but the sheriff 's office said in its brief that lawyers could have ' virtually unrestricted access ' to durst with 24 hours ' notice to the prison
dick deguerin , durst 's lead attorney in new orleans , did not immediately respond to a request for comment
as durst was placed in psychiatric care on tuesday , police raided his home in houston , removing two boxes of possible evidence

' i do n't know what they 're looking for
i do n't know what they could be looking for 15 years after berman was killed 1,500 miles away ... i think it 's a publicity stunt
' i 'm not surprised by it , but i would really be surprised if they found anything of any evidentiary value , ' he said
' they can search now till kingdom come
they 're not going to find anything because there is n't anything
