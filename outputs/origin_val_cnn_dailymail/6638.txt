next stop the masters for mcilroy and let 's hope his final competitive hole before the season 's first major in just over a fortnight 's time proves a portent of things to come
taking dead aim with his second shot on the dangerous 18th hole at bay hill on sunday , the world no 1 judged it beautifully
the eight iron approach finished just 6ft from the hole and he rapped home the birdie putt for a 70 for a tied 11th finish in his first appearance at the arnold palmer invitational , where americans matt every completed a successful title defence
given mcilroy climbed to within a stroke of the lead on friday with a run of five birdies in a row during his second round 66 , it hardly represented the summit of his ambitions for the weekend
mcilroy finished strongly but had to settle for 11th place at the arnold palmer invitational matt every ( left ) celebrates winning the arnold palmer invitational and is given the trophy by the man himself american champion every made a successful defence of the trophy at bay hill on sunday but the tournament was really all about prep work ahead of his attempt to become the first europe to complete the career grand slam and in those terms , he pronounced himself content
' i feel like i got what i wanted out of the week and saw some progress on the things i am working on between now and augusta , ' he said
' now i 'll go away and work on them some more and hopefully be ready for the masters
' that work will be completed at the bear 's club near his home in florida , where the greens will be a lot closer to augusta speed than those at bay hill last week , where he never really looked comfortable
as for the masters , mcilroy said : ' i 'm excited with it now so close , and the chance to win a third major in a row and become just the sixth player to complete the career grand slam
it is a nice position to be in and i am going to embrace it
' mcilroy began seven shots off the lead and threatened briefly to assemble the sort of final round charge that saw him make up just such a deficit to win the bmw pga championship at wentworth last year
stenson threw away a golden opportunity to win palmer 's tournament ian poulter also had a disappointing weekend as he finished outside the top 20 he birdied the two par fives , the fourth and sixth , and looked certain to birdie the 8th but the putt somehow failed to drop
mcilroy bent over in exasperation and at the next his race was run in terms of winning when he ran up an untidy bogey
it looked as if the round would fizzle out but he assembled something of a grandstand finish with two birdies in his last three holes
alongside mcilroy , europe 's other leading hope for a first masters triumph in 16 years must be the swede stenson but he will be smarting right now after throwing away a golden opportunity to win palmer 's tournament
after two fourth place finishes in a row in florida , he began the final round with a two stroke lead
after losing it on the front nine owing largely to some forceful attacking play from americans morgan hoffmann and matt every , he had regained it with four holes to play
the only thing that has ever held him back , however , has been his putting and his weakness showed up again with successive three putts at the 15th and 16th holes
how costly that proved as matt every played a marvellous iron shot to the 18th to set up what proved the clinching birdie
stenson could not match it to give the unsung floridian a one shot win
as for ian poulter , the uk 's other player in contention at halfway , he will be disappointed with his weekend 's work after a final round 72 left him outside the top 20 .
