beijing 's forbidden palace is following in the footsteps of rome 's colosseum and london 's national gallery and banning the selfie stick
bosses at the forbidden palace in the city have begun a crackdown on the popular phone accessories over fears that one wrong move could cause lasting damage to the invaluable artifacts in the ancient palace houses
the people 's daily reports that eagle - eyed staff are keeping watch over photo - enthusiasts in the palace 's narrow or crowded areas , as well as all the indoor exhibitions , to avoid any potentially costly accidents
ban : the forbidden palace has said selfie sticks are no longer allowed inside the exhibition rooms or narrow passageways over concerns an unfortunate accident may occur ' selfie sticks will cause safety concerns , whether for tourists or the exhibits , ' shen lixia , deputy director of the museum 's tourist reception department , told china daily
' it may touch the glass exhibition case and cause damage to the cultural relics
' she added that as well as being banned in exhibition areas , the sticks would be banned in outdoor areas of the museum - so visitors would be wise not to bother taking them at all
however , the sticks will still be allowed outside the palace in the forbidden palace - so tourists can still get the all - important shot of the famous 15th century building in the background
there was speculation that the move could be the first step to a total ban , as has been implemented at other cultural attractions around the world
it is thought the louvre in paris will bring in a ban in the next few weeks , while several football stadiums have banned them over fears the extendable devices could be used as a weapon
but it seems should the forbidden palace instill a total ban in mobile - mad chinese - there are said to be 19,300 versions of the selfie stick available on the country 's answer to ebay , taobao - they would have a fair amount of support
popular : chinese tourists use ' selfie sticks ' to take pictures as they stand on jingshan park , overlooking the forbidden palace , in february
there are more than 19,000 versions of the sticks for sale on taobao ' museum photos are good for spreading the cultural messages , but we should pay attention to our ways , ' cao wei , a celebrated sina weibo blogger , told people 's daily
' i support the museums ' actions on the selfie stick ban
