a australian man holidaying in vanuatu reportedly survived on a diet of flying fox and small native birds after bunking down with locals in the aftermath of cyclone pam
three days before the category five cyclone hit 45 â year - old brooks travelled south to tanna island in the hopes he could climb the active yasur volcano
the thrill seeker got more than he bargained for as the powerful cyclone hit in the early hours of the morning killing 16 people across the nation and demolishing almost everything in its path
he sat huddled with the villagers for four or five hours while the cyclone tore through , destroying the grass huts that made up the village
he told the advertiser the wind was incredibly loud , almost like a â freight train or jet plane
â mr brooks waited for aid with around 60 villagers at the foot of yasur volcano after cyclone pam hit after the winds stopped mr brooks soon realised he was stranded and spent the next five days cut off from civilisation at the foot of the volcano
it was at this stage the villagers discovered that all the gardens and cooking houses were destroyed by the sheer force of the winds
he said they managed to find some rice vegetables and chicken which sustained them for a day or two before he was gobsmacked by what he was served next
after running out of food villagers offered mr brooks flying fox which he said was nice , but tough mr brooks was in the southern region of vanuatu when cyclone pam hit he was presented with a cooked flying fox but knowing food was limited mr brooks said he was in no position to turn his nose up to warm meat he said the resourceful villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting birds and bats
â any time anything flew past , whether it was a finch or a flying fox , there âd be this hail of sticks thrown at it , â he told reporters
â they were getting finches and baby pigeons and eating them
and one morning they got a flying fox , which is quite large , and they cooked it up with rice and gave me a serve and they ate the rest
villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting small birds and bats he did nât complain about his interesting diet and said it was â quite tasty â but tough , likening the flavours to that of chicken
although he was happy not to be starving he said he had concerns about the villagers health and safety after the cyclone left them with nothing
â there are lots of young babies in the area and they were saying , â our babies are going to die and the old people are going to die â , because it âs so remote and they âre at the end of the road so they âre going to be the last to get aid , probably , â he said
he reported that villagers were having to hike 4 kilometers up mountains to get fresh water
mr brooks said villagers were concerned about the large population of young children on the island mr brooks is worried the villagers will have trouble bouncing back from the disaster , adding that he hopes aid reaches the â far - flung villages â like the one that sheltered him
although no one he was with sustained injuries , people in nearby villages were nât so lucky with a mother and son perishing after they were struck with debris
mr brooks said he intended to return to vanuatu in the Â­ future to thank the villagers who sheltered and fed him
