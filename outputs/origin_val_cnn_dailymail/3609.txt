mourinho remains ' pretty confident ' his chelsea side will be crowned premier league champions , but diego costa is an injury concern for their title run - in
the blues restored their six - point lead over city with a 3 - 2 win over spirited hull on sunday and retain a game in hand against rock - bottom leicester
that makes them heavy favourites to lift the trophy and mourinho was happy to accept the role of front - runners after loic remy grabbed a 77th minute winner at the kc stadium
mourinho is confident that his chelsea side will be able to secure the premier league title this season loic remy came on as a substitute and scored the winning goal to secure three points for the blues ' i 'm not pretty sure , i 'm pretty confident
i believe in my players , i believe that we can do it but i know it 's difficult , ' he said
' i keep thinking the same , the title race should be over
in normal conditions , chelsea should have eight , 10 , 12 points more than we have ; title race over
' but football is unpredictable and the reality is we have a six - point lead , one game in hand , which is our best situation for the whole season
' diego costa 's short - term involvement is an open question , though
the spain striker claimed his 20th goal of the season with a wonderful curling effort to put chelsea 2 - 0 up inside nine minutes , but hobbled off with a hamstring injury
one negative for chelsea was the hamstring injury suffered by diego costa , which ended his involvement diego costa 's replacement , loic remy , scored the winning goal and mourinho thinks he has sufficient replacements his exit allowed for loic remy 's match - winning arrival , but whether he emerges from the imminent international break in match condition is uncertain
' when a striker is playing , the team needs a goal to win the game and with 15 minutes to go the striker , a guy with a lot of experience of hamstring injuries , says " it is over for me " , then it is over for him , ' said mourinho
' he has this problem
he tried to play the champions league final for atletico ( madrid , last season ) and was injured again and again and again
' we know his hamstring is not a strong one
he works hard through the week to compensate the weakness he has there but the injury can come
loic remy ( centre ) celebrates scoring chelsea 's third goal against hull at the kc stadium mourinho watches on from the bench as his chelsea side go six points clear of nearest rivals city ' if he is injured then we have loic remy , we have drogba
we never cry about injured players
' diego costa can at least expect to miss spain 's forthcoming games against ukraine and holland , but despite the added rehabilitation time , mourinho would rather be pressing on with the domestic calendar
' for diego costa ( the break ) is good , because imagine we play three matches in one week , that 's three matches he does n't play
' but in this moment we have nine matches to play and i would like to play every week , so it 's not good for us
' eden hazard scored the first goal of the game inside two minutes to get chelsea on track courtois made an error to gift hull their second , but later made amends with a string of saves chelsea goalkeeper courtois gifted abel hernandez an equaliser just a minute after elmohamady made it 2 - 1 , side - footing a back pass straight to the city striker
but tigers boss bruce believes the belgian 's brilliance later in the piece was crucial to the outcome
courtois produced a sensational triple save from elmohamady , jake livermore and gaston ramirez in the 64th minute to keep the scores level
' the big turning point in the game was where courtois pulls off three saves which change the course of the game , ' said bruce , who was nevertheless delighted with his side 's endeavour
' that 's as good as we 've played for a long , long time , against the best team in england
' we 're obviously disappointed to lose the game because i do n't think we deserved that
' we gave chelsea a hell of a run for their money and on another day it could have gone our way
' i 'm sure we 've got enough and i 'm convinced if we play like that , we 're good enough to stay in this division
