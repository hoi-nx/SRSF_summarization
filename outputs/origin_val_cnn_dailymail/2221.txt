nadal lost his quarter - final clash with raonic in indian wells but believes his performance showed he is getting back to his best
the defeat meant nadal missed the chance of joining novak djokovic , federer and andy murray in the semi-finals for the first time since the 2012 australian open
but , after raonic saved three match points to spring the shock , the spaniard admitted : â i âm leaving indian wells with the feeling that i had a big chance to do more and with the feeling that i was ready to compete again well
nadal believes he 's closing in on being back to his best after a promising indian wells wells display â i think a match like this obviously is much better if you win but , even losing , i âm 90 per cent sure that will help me
â the three - time indian wells winner added : â it âs true that i did nât compete at that level of intensity mentally in tennis for a long time
â i was able to be very focused , playing with positive energy for three hours , so that âs great news for me , because that âs the way i competed during all of my career
â raonic upset the spaniard and saved three match points in the process of winning the clash canadian raonic looked like he might be heading out after losing the first set inside 36 minutes , but he rallied to save three match points in an epic second - set tie - break , forcing a deciding set
the sixth seed , who fired 19 aces and also saved six break points , finally ended nadal âs perfect record against canadian by earning a break in the third and clinching a 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 7 - 5 victory
after his first win over nadal , raonic said : â at the moments when i was playing those match points , it did nât really feel like match points
nadal has had an injury hit 18 months but now looks to come back stronger and hopes to win more titles â it was just like another point that i was trying to get through , sort of going through the paces at that moment of what i need to do , not really signifying it as a match point
â it âs really great what i was able to do today and i âm very happy with it but i do nât let myself get caught up because this is nât where it ends
there is a lot more to achieve
â it does not get any easier for raonic , with federer his semi-final opponent
the swiss master reached the last four with a routine 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 victory over berdych
the impressive canadian progresses to the semi-finals as his reputation continues to grow he had 21 winners , equalling the number of unforced errors by berdych , won 13 of 14 points at the net , never faced a break point on his serve and broke berdych four times in the match , including three times in the second set
a clearly delighted federer said : â it âs not just another win but another win against a top 10 player â against berdych , who has played me tough in recent years
i was really able to utilise the court much more , play more angles , play with variation , spin and slice
i did that very well
â because i was serving well and moving well , so maybe there is not going to be that many chances for him on the return
