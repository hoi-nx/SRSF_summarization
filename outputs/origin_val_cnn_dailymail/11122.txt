ashley had her energy adjusted by healer to the stars paul lennard ashley writes a weekly column on femail online about the joys and stress of motherhood for the career girl who may have come a bit late to the party , but is happy to be here just the same
this week she reveals how it feels to be ' healed ' by hands from la la land ... as an avid celebrity watcher i can tell you the buzz around energy healing in hollywood these days is deafening
apparently they are the new shrinks , psychics and therapists all in one
we know that gwyneth paltrow is a fan but also celebrities like naomi watts , jessica biel and halle berry are reportedly getting energy â adjustments â during important photo shoots
recently w magazine hailed energy healers as the â new shrinks â amongst the a-list , and more and more celebrities have been experimenting with energy work to help with everything from pain , insomnia , weight loss , heartbreak , grief , anxiety , and depression
as crazy as it sounded , ultimately it was a trend i was happy to try
after all , who ca nât use a little bit of an â energy adjustment â now and again ? i went to see paul lennard , who is the healer of choice for footballers , royalty and yes , dogs
( apparently the a-list in hollywood get their dog âs energy adjusted too ; and i âm betting serious money that jennifer aniston is one of them )
meeting paul lennard , i immediately felt at ease ; at the same time there âs an intensity behind those eyes
i saw him in london at the shambhala urban escape in the metropolitan by como , but paul lennard is a jet setter ; he is currently in spain at la escondida hosting a retreat but frequently works out of celeb favourite chiva-som in thailand , ( he âs their most popular visiting therapist ) and everywhere from amsterdam to la
the treatment itself is a mix of craniosacral therapy , psychic insights and chi nei tsang - an ancient taoist abdominal massage that releases blocked energy
as i lay fully clothed on a massage table , paul lennard scanned my body without touching it , and occasionally pressed a point which was excruciating
at other times , he appeared to pull invisible ' strings ' from my body - stuck energy , apparently
he says that he âs guided in his work by what he can only describe as ' intuition ' or a ' sixth sense ' to clear old traumas that are showing up as current health problems in the mind and body
the therapy is said to address the physical , emotional , mental and spiritual
according to paul lennard , these aspects are so intricately intertwined and connected that a physical problem may have its roots in an emotional difficulty
once he has addressed the energy ' leak ' or ' blockage ' , the body , he says , heals itself
gwyneth paltrow is a fan of energy ' adjustments ' and in hollywood energy healers are the ' new shrinks ' as he worked , i felt so relaxed it was ridiculous
i felt weightless , like i âd just had an intense , hours long massage â without being touched
at one point , he asked me if i âd had any kind of a physical or emotional trauma around the age of 7 years old , one that caused me to be separated from my mom overnight
without hesitation , i dismissed it and answered no. then i remember i âd had surgery , a complicated tonsillectomy at age 7 and was in the hospital overnight
he also recognised other things about my character and spirituality without my saying very much at all
naturally curious , i asked him how he does it and why
although there âs no formal training for something like this , he told me that he began his career as a physical trainer and working with clients he began â seeing things â â pictures and images that turned out to be connected to a trauma in the person âs life
reiki is an ancient method of moving healing energy through your body through the hands of the practitioner he clarified that he is not a psychic and he has no power to predict the future â rather he can sometimes look into the past , particularly if a past trauma has manifested into a physical blockage of energy
he says that he is â tuning in â to the client 's emotional history , clearing trauma that is stored at a cellular level
he claims that he can often ' see ' where the body is unconsciously ' holding ' the memory of an event or feeling which has a physical manifestation , most often in a negative way
as outlandish as it may sound , my overall feeling upon leaving was that just maybe these crazy celebrities are on to something
as i left i felt positive , relaxed and re-energised
energy healing may not be for everyone but i found it to be something far more restorative than i had imagined it could be
