it was the match martin o'neill needed to win to convince the many doubters that this qualifying campaign is not destined to end in failure
for regardless of substitute shane long âs stoppage - time equaliser amid a frenzied finish , it was a performance and result which again raises more questions than answers
martin o'neill will protest that the second - half display was better â it could not have been worse than their sorry first - half showing â but this was supposed to be the making of ireland at the aviva stadium , a venue which is yet to produce any iconic nights for the boys in green

thanks to shane long âs late intervention , however , republic of ireland âs hopes of automatic qualification have not gone up in smoke , for now at least
but scrutiny of martin o'neill and keane âs expensive tenure will intensify
they trail table toppers poland by three points with world champions germany and scotland two ahead
it is , you feel , now a shoot - out between republic of ireland and the scots â who meet here in june â for the third - placed play - off berth
â scotland now is very , very important
i think we will have to beat them
if the second - half showing is anything to go by then i think we âre capable of doing that , â said martin o'neill
â this might just prove an important point
we are still in the competition

shane long âs last - gasp effort at least spared the manager that trauma , but his celebration of a â terrific â second half which perhaps deserved more was misplaced
â we started off tentatively
we were a little bit nervous
we conceded a poor goal and that put us on the back foot , â he reflected
â but our second - half performance was terrific
we deserved at least a draw and we could easily have won it
â we got the momentum going and the crowd stayed with us
so overall i âm pleased
â whatever we may lack , courage and spirit are not among them
it âs no fluke we âve scored late goals in three games
â veteran republic of ireland striker robbie keane ( left ) takes on poland defender kamil glik poland fans light flares in the stands during their side 's clash with the republic of ireland at the aviva stadium in dublin martin o'neill had named an attacking line - up â at least in terms of personnel â but a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 system did little to inspire an early offensive zeal
his decision to play winger brady at left back was already looking like an error of judgment before the mistake which led to poland âs breakthrough on 26 minutes
surrendering possession on the fringe of his area , brady could only watch in horror as maciej rybus and slawomir peszko combined with the latter smashing beyond shay given
martin o'neill âs response to an uninspiring half was to switch to 4 - 4 - 2 with jonathan walters â wasted on the right - hand side of midfield â moved forward to partner captain robbie keane

but it was the introduction of substitute mcclean which sparked the revival
he burst down the left within moments of his arrival and landed a cross on the head of keane whose cushioned nod bounced back off the post
mcclean was again the provider for seamus coleman but the right back lashed woefully wide from 14 yards as the hosts poured forward in search of parity
and they had to wait until the second minute of injury - time for shane long to pounce with a close - range poke when the ball dropped at his feet from brady âs corner
the goal may have stolen a point , but martin o'neill and his team still have a point to prove .
