boy george o'dowd wants to build a glazed extension at his grade-ii listed property in hampstead , london boy george o'dowd 's plans to build a lavish glazed extension onto his grade-ii listed london mansion have been turned down
the 53 - year - old applied to build the extension at his multi-million pound home in hampstead in a bid to brighten up the property
according to his planning application , the culture club frontman also wanted to chop down three trees to allow more light into the victorian building
but camden council rejected the proposals last september , saying the designs were an ' over-dominant and incongruous addition '
it added that they would be ' detrimental to the character , appearance and special architectural and historic interests of the hosted listed building '
the singer , who put the papers in under his real name george o'dowd , is now appealing against the decision
the building works , filed under the singer 's real name george o'dowd , would see new floor - to - ceiling windows installed to increase light
among the planned works were external and internal alterations to the ground floor front windows , a new side window , a new rear garden door and re-landscaping of garden
the garden landscaping would include the removal of three mature trees and the demolition of an existing summer house
but the designs were opposed by the hampstead conservation area advisory committee ( ccac )
a letter sent to the council by the group said the scheme was an over-development and would affect neighbours
they wrote : ' we object to the extension and the hard landscaping because of the garden take - up and potential light pollution
' as part of the plans , syte architects , based in soho , said : ' the house does not benefit from a great deal of natural light into its interior
its frontage is orientated to the north east
' the rear has a southwesterly orientation but a combination of factors mean that the interior often suffers from poor levels and quality of natural lighting
' camden council rejected the proposals for the victorian mansion ( pictured ) last september , saying the designs were an ' over-dominant and incongruous addition ' it added : ' the proposed extension has been designed to create living spaces with a greater sense of connection to the garden and better levels of natural light
these spaces will have a different atmosphere and character to the internal spaces in the existing house
' a planning inspector will consider written representations from both sides and is expected to make a site visit to his home before reaching a decision .
