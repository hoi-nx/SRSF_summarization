rodrigo palacio wheels away in celebration after scoring an early away goal for inter in germany the argentine is mobbed by his team - mates as inter took the lead on the counter , against the run of play brazilian defender naldo powers a header at goal , and the pace he put on the ball beat carrizo kevin de bruyne added two goals in the second half to put the germany club in control of the tie wolfsburg : benaglio , vieirinha ( perisic 87 mins ) , naldo , knoche , rodriguez , caligiuri , guilavogui , gustavo , schurrle ( trasch 46 ) , de bruyne , dost ( bendtner 69 )

booked : danil d'ambrosio , ranocchia , mauro icardi , vidic goal : rodrigo palacio referee : szymon marciniak ( poland ) and in the second half de bruyne , formerly of chelsea , stole the show , finding the net from a neat cut - back and then an excellent free kick , although both goals owed much to the poor goalkeeping of carrizo
the belgian 's first goal came after vierinha had seized on a poor clearance from the inter keeper , surged into the box , and crossed perfectly for de bruyne to slide home
then , with 15 minutes to go , the former chelsea forward 's free kick snuck past carrizo , despite it being aimed at the side of the goal he was meant to be covering
de bruyne could easily have completed a hat - trick , but he shot wide when through on goal in the closing stages , with only carrizo to beat
wolfsburg showed that they could continue their good form without goals from europe 's hottest striker at the moment , dost
the dutchman was well below his best before he was replaced midway through the second half by bendtner , but de bruyne took up the slack
inter , meanwhile , under former manchester city boss roberto mancini , were poor for large periods of the game , offering little going forward , and unable to keep up the defensive solidity they had shown in the first half once they began to tire in the second 45
de bryune decided to conduct his own chanting with the wolfsburg supporters after their win the team clap the fans behind one goal after de bryune 's amusing antics dost may be the most in form striker in europe , but he offered little before being replaced by bendtner dost ( centre ) who has started 2015 brilliantly , was never really able to pose a threat on thursday night carrizo turns the ball over the bar after making an excellent save , but he was beaten from the resulting corner naldo looks on as carrizo can only push his stunning header into the roof of the inter net the brazilian defender celebrates with his team - mates after levelling the tie , and wolfsburg never looked back inter boss roberto mancini , formerly of manchester city , looks on as his side struggled in germany rodrigo palacio battles with vierinha as inter failed to hold on to their early advantage , and left well beaten de bruyne , who dictated the play in the second half , turns away from danil d'ambrosio
