she must have really been looking forward to that birthday party
here we have a really healthy , young girl who was going to a birthday party
' she died of a traumatic head injury and that 's why she would have felt nothing whatsoever
she would have died at that moment , the instant it happened and there 's nothing anybody could have done to save her
