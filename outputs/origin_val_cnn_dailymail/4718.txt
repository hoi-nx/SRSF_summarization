last night the pensioner âs family condemned the priest
mrs bewley , 60 , a college lecturer from bodelwyddan in north wales , said : â mum was really quiet throughout the service , and then i got the hymn and prayer book and all the bits of paper
mum folded the paper in half and held it up close to her eyes
â he looked up and said , â will you stop rustling paper and holding paper up â i âm doing a sermon
â thankfully , i do nât think mum realised
â i was absolutely livid
at the end of the service i told him he had publicly humiliated my mother
â he said he was in the middle of his sermon and he was in flow and it was disturbing him
mrs frances haler 's daughter tony bewley ( right ) says she was left feeling ' absolutely livid ' at the priest 's behaviour towards her mother at st winefride 's roman catholic church ( left ) in st asaph in denbighshire , wales mrs frances haler , who has chronic leukaemia and dementia , is pictured left , receiving an award and right , on her wedding day 60 years ago â i have got more christianity in me than he has in his big toe
i âve been left very upset
â i just ca nât see what justification he had to humiliate her in the way he did
it âs so sad , given dwindling congregation numbers , that he could be like this
â it âs made me question my faith
there âs no way he can justify such an un-christian attitude
â mrs bewley said her mother usually enjoyed the services because it helped with her dementia by allowing her to recall long - term memories
but trouble started before this particular service even began , when father lochran directed mrs frances haler to sit at the side of the church by the organ â despite her being blind in one eye and partially sighted in another
when mrs bewley told him she would not be able to see the mass , he allegedly responded : â this is where she sits , this is my church
â the incident happened earlier this month when mrs frances haler was attending the saturday evening mass in a 29 - strong congregation just 200 yards from the nursing home where she lives
scots - born father lochran , who has been at the church for 14 years , said : â for many years i was chaplain to pilgrims at lourdes
i would never speak to someone with dementia like that â and i did nât on this occasion
â a diocese spokesman said : â bishop bishop has no comment to make until the issues have been thoroughly investigated
â the incident , which is said to have occurred during a sunday sermon at st winefride 's roman catholic church ( pictured ) in st asaph in denbighshire , north wales , is being investigated by the bishop of wrexham
