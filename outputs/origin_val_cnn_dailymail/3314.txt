knox is pictured above in seattle last month a juror who helped to convict amanda has revealed she has ' grave doubts ' over the american 's involvement in the murder of rudy guede
job centre worker ballerini , who served on a panel of citizen judges that reinstated knox 's murder conviction last year , has slammed the prosecution 's case citing ' questionable proof , flimsy evidence and bizarre testimony '
the motive put forward by prosecutors that knox killed miss kercher after she complained about the american leaving the bathroom dirty seemed like ' nonsense ' , she said
miss ballerini , 48 , suggested that the pair did not get a fair trial because there was ' an atmosphere of guilt ' in the deliberation room before it even began
miss kercher , 21 , from coulsdon , south london , was found half - naked with her throat slit in 2007 in the perugia cottage she shared with knox , 19
knox and former boyfriend sollecito served four years for the brutal killing but were freed on appeal in 2011
knox immediately returned to the american and has rebuilt her life , finding love with old school friend colin sutherland and working on her local newspaper in seattle
but last year an appeal court reinstated the original convictions ordering the pair to serve 28 and 25 years respectively
a third suspect rudy guede was convicted in a fast track trial and is serving 16 years for the murder
italy 's highest court will hear knox and sollecito 's final appeal next week
if convicted italy can request knox 's extradition
but while the supreme court could rubber stamp the conviction later this month , miss ballerini 's claims could derail the case
the court can send the case back back to an earlier appeal stage if the decision taken by the lower court was found to be illogical or inconsistent
the juror told oggi magazine : ' i certainly had many doubts about the guilt of the two young people
i was not convinced of their innocence but i thought and i said to the others as well : " the evidence that we have is not sufficient to inflict all these years in prison "

she said : ' i said immediately that i did not agree and they took note
' above , knox sits alone before being interviewed in january 2014 she added : ' there was not enough , in my opinion , to justify such a heavy sentence : questionable proof , bizarre testimony and flimsy evidence
' she dismissed the alleged motive as ' nonsense ' and said : ' you do not massacre a girl because she complained about a bit of a stink in the bathroom
' and she was equally doubtful about sollecito 's motivation
' what could possibly have been the motive that sollecito had to participate in the killing of that poor girl
' when she heard the verdict and sentence she immediately protested
miss ballerini said : ' i said immediately that i did not agree and they took note
other members of the jury were also against an increase in the sentence , she said , but they were told there was no alternative
' the jurors constructed a timeline with mobile phone records and statements from the witnesses that showed how the pair could have been at the murder scene at the time of death , but she questioned whether it was sufficient proof to condemn them
she was equally unconvinced by attempts to portray the pair as bad characters
prosecutors had painted amanda as troublesome because she once received a fine from police for being disorderly
' this seemed to me , excuse me , more nonsense , ' she told the weekly magazine

the couple are pictured above kissing after miss kercher 's body was discovered sollecito was described in the initial trial as ' depraved ' , because he read violent manga comics , but miss ballerini said reading comics or watching cartoons did not amount to being a killer
' if someone is a murderer you have to prove it , ' she said
crucially the only person definitively convicted of the murder had not implicated the pair
he has given three different accounts of the murder and never said that knox and sollecito were with him , she pointed out
continuing to pick apart the case she said it was strange that knox and sollecito had barely left a trace of dna in the room where rudy guede 's body was found whereas rudy guede left ' a good number ' of marks
' they claimed that knox had removed her traces by cleaning
pah ! today when i think about it again i have even more doubts , ' she said
but she insisted that the two professional judges on the panel had not tried to sway the jury
she claimed that she herself had not had an opinion because she had not read about the case in the news but had developed her convictions studying the files on the previous trials and keeping a diary where she recorded what happened at every hearing .
