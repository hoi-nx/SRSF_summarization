the skills that come with lumberjack sports are traditionally left to big , burly men wielding axes and monstrous saws
but this is changing with women donning their ' lumberjill ' boots and proving their place in the male dominated sports
erin lavoie from washington has two world records and a multitude of wins under her belt but she insists her win at sydney 's royal easter show is one of the biggest
' the easter show is one of the biggest competitions so it was a huge deal for me , ' erin lavoie told daily mail australia
the 32 - year - old also competed in the wood chop category which is usually her forte , but she says that she did not have a prime block of wood and this makes it much more difficult to carve up the log
erin lavoie also competes in the wood chopping category ' my fastest chop is 24 seconds and i have two world records in the underhand chop which are around 30 seconds , ' she said
whilst the quality of the piece of wood quality is the luck of the draw , the technique and equipment are not with top of the line axes costing up to $ 600
' the axes and saws are not cheap , but they have to be top notch if you want to win , ' erin lavoie said
' the maintenance of them is expensive too and you need to know where to go
' women 's prevalence in the sport is still scarce and many females must compete against males in order to be involved at all
' i still compete against men in many competitions , ' erin lavoie said
' it 's obviously really tough as they can deliver so much power , but this means it 's so much more rewarding when you win
' women 's involvement largely started with the jack and jill sawing division that sees a man and a woman working as a team to slice through the log
' mostly women get into it because their husbands need a partner for jack and jill so they train up their wives , ' erin lavoie said
' but i do it because i love it and it 's my thing
' erin lavoie grew up with brothers and loved to do male things so when she noticed the lumberjack team training down the hall at her school , she signed up
after a short amount of time she was travelling and competing in various chopping and sawing competitions - and winning
erin lavoie also competes against men and admits she loves the feeling of pride when she beats them her fastest woodchop is 24 seconds and she holds two world records in the underhand chop of 30 seconds although she owns a crossfit gym in washington , her training regime mostly consists of chopping and sawing logs in her backyard
' i have a friend who is a logger , so that 's super handy ! ' she said
the royal easter show also contains a junior development program for aspiring lumberjacks to get involved
according to the abc , 16 - year - old lucy and her 13 - year - old sister kate are the only two females competing in this program
the sisters from new south wales have gained quite a following and always get a large applause no matter how they place
' it does n't matter who comes first , we always get the biggest cheer because no girls do this sport , ' lucy said
it their mother , wendy , three years battling with the human rights commission for the sisters to be allowed to compete
' a lot of people do n't consider it a sport
but i like it because it is so different , it 's a challenge and it takes stamina and technique , ' lucy said .
