' in 2014 apple revealed in that it had made $ 18.06 billion in revenue from itunes , including its software and services , making up 10 per cent of apple 's total net sales
if this year 's revenues match 2014 's , the firm could be losing more than $ 2 million an hour - equivalent to $ 34,000 every minute
london - based social media analyst tim grimes tweeted : ' based on 2014 itunes revenue : apple are losing $ 34,246 per minute , $ 2,054,794 per hour the # itunes store is down
' seeing as the outage encompasses other services , it could follow that apple 's losses are much higher than this
tim cook has previously said that the app store posted $ 4.6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 , which means that firm could also be losing around $ 2 million an hour , or almost $ 35,000 a minute
frustration : in both itunes and the app store , users simply see a spinning circle indicating that a song or app is in the process of being downloaded , but nothing happens , as shown in the screenshots above one person tweeted : ' if itunes does n't start working within the next two hours i will literally cry ... ' while another said ' itunes store has been down for like 2 hours
' a user called misterdand said : ' itunes , app store is down worldwide , which is screwing up my morning ! has someone hacked them ? # apple # itunes ' and a user called lightcap wrote : ' apple 's app store is down ( for purchasing , not browsing ) , but the world 's most useless site remains useless as ever ...

making a humorous reference to apple 's new macbook , which was unveiled with just one port earlier this week , twitter user schwarztech said : ' maybe someone accidentally unplugged the single usb - c cable that the app / ibook storer runs off of ? ' the outage appears to have been ongoing for several hours this morning , according to the next web , which said that ibooks and in - app purchases ca n't be accessed
testflight - a service used by developers to test apps - is also down , as well as apple support , meaning it is hard for customers to get help in accessing the services
earlier today the problems seem to be geographically inconsistent
for example , it 's been reported that it 's possible to download apps from the indian app store , but music tracks are inaccessible
but now apple has said the outage is affecting all its users across the world , but has yet to respond to mailonline 's request for comment
the app store was last down on monday , but the move was intentional as apple prepared to launch its apple watch in san francisco .
