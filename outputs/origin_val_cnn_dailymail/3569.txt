lewis hamilton is heading into the new formula one season as the favourite to seal his third world championship , but the briton is only the fourth-most marketable driver in the sport
according to a survey released by repucom on the eve of the curtain raiser in australia , lewis hamilton fails to make the top three , which is headed by alonso
alonso has been ruled out of the season opener in melbourne after he sustained concussion during a testing crash in barcelona last month
alonso , who will miss the season opener in australia , is the sport 's most marketable driver defending champion lewis hamilton , pictured at the brits with singer ellie goulding is fourth on the list alonso heads the top 10 with his former team - mate felipe massa and four - time world champion sebastian vettel completing the podium places but the mclaren driver âs popularity in his native spaniards sees him top the ' most marketable ' list ahead of the williams driver of felipe massa , with four - time world champion sebastian vettel snatching the final podium spot
â consumer brands will gravitate naturally to where the leading drivers are and with the dominance of alonso âs profile off the track , a strong first season at mclaren could well see him pull even further from the pack , â said nigel geach , senior vice president of motorsport
â however , this season , the one to watch is lewis hamilton
with a host of personal endorsements to his name already and being a part of a team everyone was chasing last year , lewis hamilton has an opportunity to grow his reputation internationally as potentially one of formula one âs finest
he has a high profile domestically brands will be watching the performance of this driver in 2015 very closely
â felipe massa , pictured playing aussie rules on wednesday , is third on the list of most - marketable drivers four - time world champion sebastian vettel completes the podium places in the repucom survey lewis hamilton , who is in the final stages of contract discussions with mercedes over a deal to seal his foreseeable future with the team , is the highest climber in the survey which is based on the perceptions of people from the racers â native countries
ninety - three per cent of britons know of hamilton , according to the survey
this compares to 98 per cent of spaniards for alonso , and a whopping 99 per cent of brazilians who are aware of the former ferrari driver
jenson button is fifth on the list , with nico rosberg , daniel ricciardo , romain grosjean , 17 - year - old max verstappen and sergio perez completing the top 10 .
