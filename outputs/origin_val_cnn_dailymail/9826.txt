but , in a second statement , the kennel club said it would not be ' fair ' to strip the dog of its best in show title , solely due to the behavior of its owner
a kennel club spokesman added that , although there was ' clear guidance ' that dogs should not be handled in this way , it would be reviewing its procedures in light of the incident
jagger , who is co-owned by belgium aleksandra lauwers and leicester - based breeder dee milligan-bott , died in his owner 's arms on friday , after returning home to belgium scandal : the owner of this chamption myter , eye to eye , also believes the dog was deliberately poisoned after she was found vomiting and shaking in pain shortly before it was due to be judged on friday the scottish terrier was initially bred as a working dog by farmers to eradicate vermin and hunt small animals underground
it has a very long and strong tail which owners traditionally used to pull it out of holes
it is not said to hurt to pick them up in this way
they were introduced into america in the early 1890s and it was not until the years between world war i and world war ii that they became popular
they have been owned by a variety of celebrities , including the 32nd president of the united states , fdr , whose scottie " fala " is included with fdr in a statue in washington , dc , as well as the 43rd president george w. bush
they said : ' we completely understand the concerns about how knopa , the best in show dog , was handled on the judging table
' a decision will be made by committee about what action may be taken within the current rules and guidance
in this specific case an investigation is underway and a decision will be made by committee about the actions that have been taken by the exhibitor at crufts and the next steps
' the judge âs primary focus is on the dogs themselves and we do not believe it would be fair to strip the dog of its best in show title because the dog was awarded this prize based on its own merits in the show ring
' it added : ' prior to this incident the guidance related to handling has been followed by those showing their dogs but in light of this situation we will be reviewing our rules and guidance and how they may need to be amended going forward
