a new parody video takes aim at the wage inequality between genders by introducing a fictional amazon prime service that caters to the average woman , who earns just 78 cents for every dollar a man in the same job makes
comedian and filmmaker paul gale created the satirical ad for ' amazon prime for women ' , which is marketed as the online retailer 's attempt to make itself more appealing to its female members , who make less money than their male counterparts
' we realized that some customers can afford more than others , so we are introducing amazon prime for women , a new service that offers 78per cent of each item for 78per cent of the price , ' actress lauren ireland says in the youtube clip
' cartoon pictures show that women can now buy three quarters of a box of cereal , books , umbrellas and sweaters â all at a special female rate
' it 's the prime service you love at a price you can afford when you are taking home three quarters of what a man would for being equally as productive , ' she says
miss ireland notes that there is also a specific service for black women , who earn 64per cent to every man 's dollar , and hispanic women who make only 54per cent
and while the video appears to poke fun at the current wage gap , the facts behind the funny side of the clip are brutally correct
women only : the fictional service , which was created by comedian paul gale , jokes that females deserve 78per cent satisfaction looks like a lady : this cartoon shows a woman utilizing 78per cent of the umbrella she purchased on amazon prime for women women 's world : this book from amazon prime for women may be missing a chunk of text , but it costs 13per cent less than the full copy according to the american association of university women , the typical white woman working full - time in the us made 78per cent of men 's earnings in 2013 , while black women made 64per cent and hispanic women took home a mere 54per cent
' regardless of the exact [ wage gap ] numbers , there 's a systemic inequality embedded in our society , whether it 's regarding gender , race , or sexual orientation , ' mr paul gale told the huffington post
he added : ' to have a platform to point at it in my own way and say ' hey , this ! we should talk about this ! ' is something i 'm grateful to be able to do
' mr paul gale debuted the video on youtube just days before last sunday 's international women 's day , which saw the clinton foundation 's release of we 're not there yet , a psa featuring amy poehler , cameron diaz , sienna miller , padma lakshmi and jenny slate 's voices as they discussed issues surrounding gender equality
the video is a part of the not there yet campaign , which removed women from ads on international women 's day , to call attention to the fact we still have a long way to go before both sexes are truly equal politically , socially and economically
racial divide : the ' ad ' offered a specific service for black women , who earn 64per cent of every man 's dollar not fair : it also highlighted that hispanic women only make 54per cent of what men earn
