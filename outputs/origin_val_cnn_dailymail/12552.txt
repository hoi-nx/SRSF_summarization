a delta airplane had a close call thursday , skidding off a snowy runway and stopping within feet of icy waters
any accident raises questions , and the ntsb is sending people to new york 's laguardia airport to investigate
although the cause of the crash is not yet clear , officials will no doubt be looking at the conditions on the runway
was it cleared and ready ? did the pilot have all relevant information ? cnn aviation analyst schiavo breaks down the responsibilities around runways
" there are a couple of things that airports have to do , " she said
" the airport has to go out and measure whether the airport runways have friction , meaning when those tires touch down that they will have some contact with the runway
" that information is then relayed to the air traffic control tower , according to schiavo
" as to whether the runways are slippery , that is breaking action , and the airport gets that from the reports of previous pilots , " she said
port authority and new jersey executive director patrick foye told reporters that the runway in question had been plowed shortly before the incident
pilots on previous planes reported " good braking action , " he said
just minutes after the delta plane landed , all of laguardia arport shut down to air traffic
one runway reopened at 2 p.m. et. the other remained closed
miles o'brien , another cnn aviation analyst , highlights how difficult it is to understand all the elements in play
" the wind was changing
it was moving from rain to freezing rain , ultimately into snow
so you had a very dynamic weather picture , and let 's not forget , it 's kind of a subjective thing , " he said
" one pilot might say , ' oh that was no problem , ' but he might have learned how to fly in northern canada
