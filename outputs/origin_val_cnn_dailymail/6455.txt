clarke afforded himself a few smiles on the touchline and who could blame him ? this has been a strange old season for reading , who are one win away from an fa cup semi-final against arsenal but have spent too long being too close to a championship relegation battle
at least this win will go some way to easing that load
they made it hard for themselves , but they had an in - form player in jamie mackie who was able to get the job done
he put reading in front in the first half and then scored a brilliant winner just moments after chris oâgrady had levelled with a penalty â one of the only legitimate chances brighton had all night , even if clarke was angry about the decision
reading frontman jamie mackie fires the reading ahead against brighton in tuesday 's championship fixture jamie mackie ( centre ) is congratulated by nathaniel chalobah and garath mccleary after netting reading 's opener reading ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : federici ; gunter , michael hector , cooper , chalobah ; akpan ; mcleary , williams ( niall keown 92 ) , robson-kanu ( pogrebnyak 76 ) ; blackman , jamie mackie ( norwood 79 ) subs not used : cox , yakubu , andersen , taylor scorer : jamie mackie , 24 , 56 booked : mcleary , pogrebnyak brighton ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : david stockdale ; halford , greer , dunk , bennett ; rohan ince ( best 75 ) , kayal , forster-caskey ; emmanuel ledesma ( bruno 86 ) , chris o'grady , lualua subs not used : ankergren , calderon , hughes , holla , teixeira

there was almost no contact
it seems to be the standard of refereeing in this division
â the win puts reading 13 points off the bottom three and clarke added : â it gives us a lift in the league because that is what was needed
it was a big win
it makes the gap bigger between us and the bottom three and we needed that
â brighton , meanwhile , have now gone five games on the road without a win and this one came against a side that had gone 344 minutes without scoring at home before jamie mackie netted midway through the first half
brighton goalkeeper david stockdale must take an element of blame
his pass out to rohan ince was easily cut out and after advancing unchallenged jamie mackie pulled the trigger from the edge of the area
by then , cooper had already seen an effort hacked off the brighton goal - line by jake forster-caskey and hal robson-kanu made a spectacular hash of a chance , launching the ball into the stands when he went clean through
jamie mackie âs strike eased the tension and almost immediately reading could have been two up , only for michael hector to balloon over the bar from six yards
niall keown , son of arsenal legend martin ( right ) , made his senior debut for reading against brighton brighton striker chris o'grady scores from the penalty spot to level the scores at the madejski stadium chris o'grady celebrates his equaliser for the seagulls but brighton went onto concede just three minutes later and brighton ? not a chance of note in the entire first half for a side that had lost only once in six coming in
cooper pushed emmanuel ledesma , who went to ground and won a 53rd - minute penalty , which chris oâgrady converted for brighton
clarke fumed about the decision but it did not look overly contentious
any animosity need not have lingered as jamie mackie nailed his fourth in four league games from 25 yards just three minutes later
reading winger hal robson-kanu is crowded out by brighton duo rohan ince and emmanuel ledesma goalscorer o'grady holds off the challenge of reading during tuesday 's encounter chris hughton waved on brighton but his side found no way of turning decent possession into reasonable chances
reading added a line of reinforcement by bringing on niall keown â son of martin keown - for his debut in stoppage time
brighton found no way of testing him
chris hughton said : â we are not there ( safe from relegation ) yet , not by a long way
in the morning i will be grateful of that nine points
â we have to get the formula right away from home
