holiday death : andrew smyth , 32 , from surrey , is feared to have been a â honeytrap â victim in turkish a uk holidaymaker was killed and his bank account plundered after being lured by a woman he met on holiday in turkish in a ' honeytrap ' , his parents insisted today
the body of andrew smyth , 32 , was found dumped in undergrowth four miles away from a nightclub where he had been , and his bank account cleared out through a cash machine
but a coroner in surrey recorded an open verdict - saying that he understood how the family concluded foul play , but could take the case no further after a four - year investigation
however , mr andrew smyth âs family believe his drink was spiked at the nightclub , before he was followed , robbed and murdered
his fully - clothed body was found face down in woodland
he had traces of heroin in his body - possibly from the spiked drink , toxicology tests showed
an inquest at surrey coroner 's court in woking was told that the athletic electrician had flown to antalya a week earlier for a fortnight âs break at his father and stepmother âs holiday home
his friend flew home after a week but mr andrew smyth stayed , going out drinking on a friday night with a woman he had met at the resort
however , at 3am the following morning , cctv footage showed him leaving the club - shortly before a series of withdrawals were made from a cash machine , emptying his bank account
hours later his body was spotted in a forest with no cash in his pockets other than small change
a post-mortem examination found a heroin metabolite , 6 - 6-mam , in mr andrew smyth âs body - indicating that the class a drug had been consumed before his death , in september 2010
dr fegan-earl , who carried out an autopsy at the royal surrey hospital in guildford once mr andrew smyth âs body had been repatriated , could find no evidence of a fight or any injuries
the original post-mortem examination was not carried out for five days
' what we expected ' : mr andrew smyth pictured with his mother , celia armstrong , who said she was ' disappointed ' after a coroner returned an open verdict at an inquest into his death he said the presence of 6-mam showed that heroin specifically had been present , rather than any other opiates , and he had found water on the lungs - which was consistent with heroin toxicity
toxicology tests showed he was below the drink - driving limit , with just 55mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood , 35mg off the 80mg uk maximum
however the pathologist added that although the signs pointed towards opiate toxicity , given the state of decomposition , he felt unable to establish a cause of death
dr fegan-earl added : â an unusual fact is the location of andrew smyth âs body , which seems to be at odds with what he was doing , enjoying himself in a club
â mr andrew smyth grew up in surrey and trained to be an electrician , before relocating to swindon in wiltshire , where he took on a new job and dated a number of women

she conceded they had had a volatile friendship , and that they had argued over â silly â things because mr andrew smyth was often in a bad mood - which led to a row in the holiday resort one night
during the first week of the holiday , they decided miss miles would leave early and , after changing flights , she left turkish on the friday

his family have travelled to turkish on dozens of occasions to try to uncover the truth about what happened to mr andrew smyth and to bring anyone responsible for his death to justice

recording an open verdict , coroner travers said mr andrew smyth had travelled to turkish for a holiday after a rough patch in his life , which included a financial crisis
he said : â by the summer of 2010 things were picking up for him and it was in these circumstances he decided to go on holiday to turkish

â after a breakdown in the friendship , miss miles left mr andrew smyth at the resort on september 10
mr travers continued : â she left and did not see or communicate with him again
the evidence of what happened next is somewhat sparse
the cause of death was unascertained
â i fully understand that andrew smyth âs parents believe that there has been foul play
it is not for me to speculate what may have happened to andrew smyth
â it is simply not possible to know what happened to andrew smyth in the hours before his death
i regret that i am unable to assist the family in any further ways
i record an open conclusion
â speaking after the inquest , mr andrew smyth âs mother celia armstrong said : â it âs not the verdict we wanted , but it âs what we expected
â her ex-husband christopher smyth , of mytchett , surrey , remained convinced people in turkish were withholding information
he said : â it âs undoubtedly a cover up
we had to work quite hard to get anything from the turkish authorities
' i understand the coroner âs point of view , but without a doubt my son was assaulted
i firmly believe my son was murdered
he was beaten to death
he had everything to look forward to in life
i wo nât ever give up ( seeking the truth )
