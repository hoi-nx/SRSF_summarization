â i will keep playing as well as i can at west ham united and enjoying it every week
you never know what will happen in the future

â you just switch off really , â noble said
â it âs so peaceful
you âre concentrating on your rods so you tend to forget about everything else
â i used to do a lot of fishing with my dad , usually in beckton boating lake
that was a little bit different from this ( at honeypot lakes in essex ) - there are no shopping trolleys here ! then i moved out and forgot how good it was
i âm pretty sure my mum sold all my gear
' this summer i was on holiday in florida , on an island called boca grande , and went fishing every day
that got me hooked again
we would do it all night from about 10 oâclock to five in the morning
it was one of the best experiences of my life
