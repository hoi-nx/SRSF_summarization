jonjo o'neill has no doubts who he will be shouting for if two particular horses are galloping clear to the final fence in friday âs gold cup
one , irish - trained carlingford lough , owned by jp , ridden by soon - to - retire 19 - time champion jockey mccoy , will be carrying a hill of punters â money and a mountain of sentimental support
the other , holywell , a winner at the last two festivals and who showed his old sparkle when winning his warm - up race at kelso last month under mccoy , is jonjo o'neill âs main hope for a big win this week

but jonjo o'neill is clear where his support will lie
â i will be shouting for holywell
the rent may go up but we will talk about that later , â he says , as he looks out over the famous strip of cheltenham turf that has defined his career
the arduous climb to the finishing post was the scene of the two - time champion jockey âs 1980 champion hurdle win on sea pigeon and , even more memorably , the heart - stopping surge to the line on 1986 gold cup - winning mare dawn run
do nât be fooled by the sparkling smile and twinkling eyes
jonjo o'neill might come over like a cross between father christmas and your favourite uncle but he has not risen to the top of the racing ladder by being soft - hearted
â i knew if jp had a runner ap would ride it
he pays the retainer , â he says
â richie will ride holywell and they get on really well
they have clicked and richie has twice won on him at cheltenham
he has won at two festivals so hopefully he can make it three in a row
â holywell is one of jonjo o'neill 's main hope for a big win in the cheltenham gold cup mccoy ( right ) and o'neil ( left ) pictured with john mcmanus after winning the grand national while jonjo o'neill is determined to deny mccoy the big final festival send - off the jockey is hoping for , that does nât mean he is not desperate to provide him with a winner despite the blow of one of their big hopes , last year âs world hurdle winner more of that , missing the meeting
they have become more than just employer and employee and no one is better placed to assess mccoy than jonjo o'neill , a man who rode against a generation of former weighing room giants including ron barry , dessie hughes , john francome , peter scudamore and tommy carberry
â there is a piece of everybody in him , â says the man who has trained 25 festival winners
â some fellas are a great judge of pace but would nât be able to produce a horse at a fence
he is the complete all - rounder
â he knows the pace , the tracks and the ground
he has ridden north , south , east and west and knows what every other horse in the race and their jockeys will be doing
he knows who to follow and who not to follow
â basically , he is a freak and he loves winning , which is great
â festival observers have learned to set their watch by jonjo o'neill , who has only twice driven away from the last day without a winner since the turn of the century
the signs are again positive with 22 winners since the start of february an indicator that his string is back in form
jonjo o'neill is determined to deny mccoy the big final festival send - off the jockey is hoping for jonjo o'neill , who has trained 25 cheltenham festival winners , described mccoy as a freak that loves winning that is in stark contrast to dark days when the whole of november , a blank december and january yielded only 11 victories
â it was very bleak , â said jonjo o'neill
the barren patch scuppered hopes of launching an outside challenge for the trainers â title that had been made possible by a bright start to the season
that remains the jonjo o'neill ambition but one hampered , he feels , by the wrong perception he is jp âs private trainer
he says : â one day , hopefully , i will be champion trainer
we are an open house and there is nobody who enjoys us having winners for other people more than jp
â i knew we did nât have the firepower [ this year ] but were expecting to have a better season with the better horses
hopefully , they will finish off the season better
â no one will be surprised if he does
course specialist johns spirit in the chase and taquin du seuil , winner of the jlt novices â chase last season and possibly heading down the handicap route , both have claims and a festival gamble on an jonjo o'neill handicapper is almost obligatory
but it is holywell , winner of the 2013 pertemps hurdle and what is now the ultima business solutions handicap chase last year , who leads the jonjo o'neill charge
the trainer describes the eight - year - old , who is transformed by blinkers , as a â little con man â
if he dashes the mccoy âs gold cup run , party pooper might be more appropriate .
