patients at a hospital a&e department are being forced to parade details of their conditions on laminated signs
they are assessed by staff when they arrive , then given a red card if their illness is serious or a green one for less urgent issues , with a two or three - word summary of their ailment
these are designed to speed up staff assessments as patients wait for treatment , but the trial scheme has been described as â insensitive â and like â a police line - up â
reid , 49 , has criticised a hospital after she was forced to wear a sign detailing her condition while waiting for treatment it means those with alcohol , mental health and gynaecological problems , and others who might prefer to keep their conditions private , could be at risk of losing patient confidentiality
reid , 49 , said she was appalled when she went to broomfield hospital in chelmsford , essex , and was given a green card detailing her ankle injury after she was assessed by a nurse
â i did nât mind much for me as i had hurt my ankle , â she added
â but i thought it was disgusting that patients with alcohol problems or mental health issues had to carry cards that showed everyone what was wrong with them
â the mother of five from chelmsford has complained to hospital bosses about the scheme
she said for those â carrying signs saying they had alcohol problems , it just smacked of them being marked out â it was like a police line - up â
mrs reid added : â the poor man in front of me was looking after his teenage daughter , who had alcohol poisoning , and everyone could see what was wrong with her
â i could see why every single person in the queue was there â and we had to wait in a line that went past lots of people sitting down waiting , so they could all see what was wrong with us too
it âs really poor for patient confidentiality
â hospital bosses at broomfield hospital in chelmsford , essex , said it was designed to speed up staff assessments she suggested it would be possible to obscure the details written on the cards , leaving the colour visible for staff , but said patients coming into a&e might be too distressed or distracted to think of doing this
â the people who come in are panicking or in pain , â she added
â they could see anyone they know as it âs a local hospital , and they have to carry these cards showing what âs wrong with them
â another woman who visited the hospital said : â i had a laminated card and actually laughed at the insensitivity
i had a very negative experience , having just moved here from another county , and as a nurse myself was quite disheartened with the overall care i received at a sensitive time to myself and my family
â the trust responsible for the hospital has defended the scheme , saying it will lead to quicker assessment times
the trial scheme has been described as â insensitive â and like â a police line - up â ( picture posed by models ) dr donald mcgeachy , medical director of the mid-essex clinical commissioning group , said : â we âd ask people to bear in mind that the new reception arrangements at broomfield hospital are part of a pilot scheme that is being developed and constantly refined
â we want to provide patients arriving at a&e with a rapid assessment so they can be seen by the right clinical service at the right time
at the moment , people arriving at broomfield hospital will be assessed by a nurse and either referred on for emergency medical help or redirected to see their own gp
â the new area that has been set up within the hospital entrance mirrors the main reception and pays the same regard to patient confidentiality
â the information patients are being asked to provide on arrival is the same as when they book into the a&e reception , with the difference that they are rapidly assessed and directed to the right service for them
â we are not aware of any complaints about the pilot scheme
