meet coronation street 's latest fresh - faced cast members who are all fighting for the same role
erin , eilah and elsie , are triplets who all play 13 - year - old faye 's baby girl miley , taking it in turns in front of the camera
they were chosen after the soap put out a call to casting agents and put up posters in hospital maternity units in the region asking for identical twin girls to play the newborn
pictured here with father martyn and mother laura the five - month - old triplets were selected after parents martyn and laura , from padiham , near burnley , put them forward after hearing that triplets are often in high demand in television
martyn said : ' my cousin , who is a theatre actor , suggested that we should get in touch with an agent
he said " there is a high demand for twins , let alone triplets "
' we sent some photos over and within two hours we heard back to say they had a client who was interested
on the monday we were at coronation street
' martyn , 29 , a sales manager , and laura , 26 , a beautician , are delighted at how well the girls , born on october 27 , have taken to being on the soap
and the family has received a warm welcome from all the cast and crew - particularly from ellie , who plays teen mum faye in the controversial storyline , and her mum anna , played by debbie rush
martyn says that despite only being a few months old his baby daughters are already developing quite a talent when it comes to being on screen
the triplets are swapped each scene while playing the daughter of faye in the controversial story line that saw the coronation street character give birth at just 13 - years - old ' everybody is shocked at how good they are , ' he said
' one of the triplets cries on cue , so when they need a crying baby we take elsie down for filming
when they need a calm baby we take erin
' everybody wants to look at the girls and they make a fuss of them , especially debbie and ellie
ellie has been fantastic with the girls
' the triplets , who have a six - year - old brother maddox , were born ten weeks early at liverpool women 's hospital
erin arrived first at 5pm weighing 2lb 2oz , followed by eilah at 5.01pm weighing in at 3lb 1oz and elsie , a minute later weighing 2lb
martyn added that he hopes that their early start on show might have given them the acting bug
' hopefully they will stay on the show if they are enjoying it
' i have grown up watching coronation street and so has laura
they have made us at home and comfortable and everybody is one big family
' the triplets will make their first appearance on good friday when a shocked faye goes into premature labour .
