when louis van gaal has time between figuring out the angel di maria conundrum and plotting man united âs champions league return , hasselbaink would love a coffee
hasselbaink is keen to pick the brains of his former coach , in his words one of the world âs greatest , to help league two burton albion âs promotion push
the former dutch international is doing pretty well so far by himself in his first managerial job in england , leading burton to top spot since surprisingly taking over in november
hasselbaink has impressed since taking over at burton albion ; they are top of league two hasselbaink scores for chelsea , against tottenham , during his playing days in april 2004 sportsmail 's graphic shows hasselbaink 's long and illustrious career across a number of countries but getting advice from the man united manager with whom he shares a bond can only help
â i was always one of his favourites , â smiles hasselbaink , who won most of his 23 holland caps under van gaal
â he wanted to sign me for barcelona from chelsea in 2003
i will never forget this
the fee was already arranged , then they played valencia , he lost at home , he got the sack , and the deal did nât go through
â does hasselbaink recognise the prickly van gaal we have seen during low ebbs this season ? his face lights up
â he is mild ! i âm telling you , â he says
â i have not spoken to him yet
i need to find the time to go over to manchester and have a cup of coffee or tea with him when he is not that busy
â he is somebody who tells you exactly what he wants , how he wants and when he wants
but he is a very loving man and a top coach , one of the best in the world
louis van gaal and hasselbaink get on well , and the burton boss would like some advice from his countryman hasselbaink and van gaal ( centre ) know each other from when the now man united boss was in charge of holland hasselbaink is doing well on his own , but admits he would like to sit down for a chat with the man united boss â of course he has come in for criticism because he is manager of one of the biggest clubs in the world , but let âs not forget , man united is changing
i am 100 per cent he will succeed and they will play attractive football
â hasselbaink would hope players under his guidance one day say similar things about him
at 43 , his managerial career is embryonic
he was a novice when he took the reins , despite a year at royal antwerp in belgium
his first fortnight at burton brought challenges even the most experienced manager might have found daunting
in his debut training session goalkeeper dean lyness broke his leg
â he is a guy who everybody really likes so that was a big blow , â says hasselbaink
â but he is back training and getting stronger
â then , just days after his first match in charge , at wycombe , there was an emotionally crushing event â the funeral of lydia , a 17 - year - old who played for burton âs women âs team
she had collapsed and died at home on november 4
hasselbaink thinks van gaal is one of the best coaches in the world , and insists he was one of his favourites hasselbaink had an esteemed playing career , pictured celebrating a goal for chelsea in 2001 hasselbaink admits that as a player he was more loud - and sweary - than he is as a manager â that was devastating , â says hasselbaink , his eyes dewy
â i have an 18 - year - old and for somebody to lose their child at that age is not right
â he bangs the table
â that was very hard
the only thing i could do was go to the funeral and represent the club the right way
i still have lydia âs black armband in my office hung up
you get reminded of the real things in life
â to hear hasselbaink talk with such sensitivity only underlines why chairman robinson selected him ahead of 60 other applicants when predecessor gary rowett left for birmingham
robinson has a knack here , also giving neil warnock and nigel clough their breaks in management
hasselbaink âs motivation to plunge into the lower divisions was not obvious
this is a man who scored so many premier league goals for leeds united , chelsea , middlesbrough and charlton ( 127 ) he still sits 11th on the all - time list , despite retiring seven years ago
the burton boss sat down with sportsmail 's laurie whitwell at the club 's stadium after a training session hasselbaink 's yearly earnings are believed to be around Â£ 40,000 - minimal compared to his playing days money is not the driving factor
when it is suggested he earns in a year what he once earned per week at chelsea he grins
the figure is believed to be about Â£ 40,000 a year
if he simply wanted to stay in football he could have ticked along with punditry jobs
as recently as last october he was on match of the day
â as much as i âve enjoyed the punditry , it âs very easy sitting there and judging people , â he says
â you âre not under pressure
do you know what has happened in that week âs training ? you do nât
â so i always wanted to be with the players , seeing them smiling , sweating and , at times , moaning
the second best thing in football â after playing
â still , why burton ? hasselbaink answers emphatically
â it was a great opportunity
a very stable club with ambition , a great chairman who works with his managers , a good squad , excellent training facilities , and you can teach players
the burton boss could easily pick up more than he currently earns , but he wants to cut his teeth at lower level scott parker ( left ) and eidur gudjohnsen ( right ) watch on as hasselbaink celebrates a goal at white hart lane â i did nât look at league two , league one , championship or whatever
i was always looking at the job
can i have a hasselbaink feeling there ? what âs the identity of the club ? does it fit with me ? do i fit with them ? â we are sitting in an executive suite at burton âs pirelli stadium , a neat ground with 7,000 capacity , opened a decade ago
training at nearby st george âs park â the fa centre of excellence costing Â£ 105million â has just finished
it does seem to fit
hasselbaink finds inspiration in swansea âs incredible rise through the ranks ; bottom of the football league to established premier league force in 10 years
â swansea have the perfect model
they have an identity of the club and then they find a manager who fits
a lot of other clubs get a manager because he is doing well
he then wants to change lots of players
â swansea have kept their way of playing
every manager who has come has tweaked it a bit , but not lost the identity of the club
hasselbaink has impressed since taking over at burton in november , and looks to be closing in on promotion the burton boss wants to follow the model of swansea , who rose from the lower leagues to the very top â we are still far , far away from swansea
but they give smaller clubs hope because of how structured and stable they are
if you plan well you have an opportunity to go far , if you stick with that belief
â hasselbaink âs belief in a passing style has seen burton win 14 , draw five and lose three of his matches to date
they can go five points clear at the top if they beat stevenage at home on monday night
â what has surprised me is that the players are better than people say they are , â he says
â i find that there are some really technical players in league two
â he tries to remain cool on the touchline
â i want to stay as focused on my team as possible , because that âs where i can affect the game
i âm trying not to swear at the fourth official
â so far i âve been more than good ! no four - letter words
as a player i was different and always at it
i try to be as respectable as possible
â steve mclaren is another manager hasselbaink speaks to in order to get advice on coaching mclaren signed hasselbaink for middlesbrough during the burton manager 's playing days in the mid 2000 's mcclaren lives fairly close and â at times we go for lunch or a quick supper â , says hasselbaink
mcclaren signed him for middlesbrough and took him to nottingham forest as a coach , his last role in england
mcclaren had one response when hasselbaink asked him about the burton offer : â take it
â hasselbaink says : â he âs a very good manager
i pick up a lot but i do nât copy
you have to make things your own
he is somebody i can call if i need to ask advice
â ronald koeman is another hasselbaink has phoned
where he does not wish for assistance , as he sees it , is through the colour of his skin
hasselbaink , studying for his uefa pro licence , is one of only five black managers in the football league , but rejects the proposal of a rooney rule that would ensure at least one candidate for each vacancy is from a minority ethnic background
he says : â if i apply for a job i want to get an interview because they think i am the right person
not because one of the six has to be black
i want to know they want me because they think i can take the club further
otherwise i do nât need it
â it would appear burton , with sights on breaking into the third tier for the first time in their history , need hasselbaink .
