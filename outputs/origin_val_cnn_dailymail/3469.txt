' we have to put it right
sometimes in life , you make a big mistake , and there is no comeback , no way you get the chance to put it right again

' we know that ( in the first leg ) we were impatient and threw ourselves forward too much , that we lost our patience and composure
' we wanted too much to make a difference in the first game and forgot our basics , that means to defend well and attack well
we just focussed on attacking well , but because a goal did n't go in we opened ourselves up
