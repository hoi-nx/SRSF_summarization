tributes are pouring in for former liberal party prime minister fraser , the giant of australia politics who died aged 84 on friday morning
his office issued a statement confirming the news ' with deep sadness ' , saying he had suffered only a ' brief illness '
' we appreciate that this will be a shock to all who knew and loved him , but ask that the family be left in peace at this difficult time , ' it said
mr fraser was prime minister from november 1975 until march 1983
he controversially came to power as caretaker prime minister following the dismissal of labor leader whitlam by governor - general sir kerr
mr fraser 's party had blocked the supply of money for the government in the senate , forcing the constitutional crisis
whitlam would dub fraser ' kerr 's cur ' , although , perhaps in a sign of mr fraser 's compassion , the two would have a rapprochement later in life
under his leadership , the coalition then won the largest landslide of any political party at the 1975 federal election
prime minister tony abbott today hailed mr fraser 's service , acknowledging him and mr whitlam as ' fierce australia patriots '
' fraser held true to the belief that his actions were in the best interests of australia ... he was rightly proud of his government
he was elected to federal parliament when he was just 25 in a statement , fraser 's office said : ' it is with deep sadness that we inform you that after a brief illness john malcolm fraser died peacefully in the early hours of the morning of 20 march 2015 ' you can call me ( caretaker ) prime minister : fraser strides down the steps of old parliament house , on the day whitlam was dismissed divisive : the method in which fraser rose to power did not endear him to much of the population during the politically turbulent period of the 1970s fraser 's government won the largest majority of any party at any federal election in 1975 in office , mr fraser championed a multicultural australia , delivered self - government to the northern territory and established sbs and the australian federal police
he was determined in confronting the ' evil ' of apartheid in south africa and began to develop economic reforms that would change the country
following his defeat by labor 's bob hawke in 1983 , mr fraser became known as an outspoken advocate of asylum seekers
he became critical of the liberal party - later resigning his membership - and his opinions , often broadcast on twitter in his later years , tended to run against the grain of the modern party
treasurer joe hockey told reporters : ' he supplied stability and re-assurance at a time where australia had experienced much upheaval
' i think history will be kinder to fraser than many of his critics have over the years
' it is with deep sadness that we inform you that after a brief illness john malcolm fraser died peacefully in the early hours of the morning of 20 march 2015
' we appreciate that this will be a shock to all who knew and loved him , but ask that the family be left in peace at this difficult time '
mr fraser 's party had blocked the supply of money for the government in the senate , forcing the 1975 constitutional crisis ' the night fraser lost his trousers ' : the former prime minister 's most embarrassing moment came about in 1986 , when he was found confused and dressed only in a towel at memphis hotel frequented by prostitutes and drug dealers fraser 's former treasurer and eventual successor , john howard , praised his ' dominance ' of the liberal party former leaders : australia 's seven surviving prime ministers past and present posed for a photograph at whitlam 's memorial service last year
