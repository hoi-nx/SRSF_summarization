government cuts after the next election will be even deeper than previously announced â but will come to an end earlier than planned , treasury figures revealed today
george osborne said he needed to slash a further Â£ 30billion from government spending by 2017/18 , with Â£ 12billion of savings coming from the welfare budget
the government 's spending watchdog said the planned cuts would be deeper than ' anything seen over the past five years '
but once the books have been balanced the government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade in 2019/20
george osborne 's planned cuts will be deeper than ' anything seen over the past five years '
but once the books have been balanced the government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade government spending as a percentage of gdp will no longer fall to the lowest level since the 1930s , after mr george osborne dropped plans to run a Â£ 23billion surplus in 2019/20 the office for budget responsibility said the plans amounted to a ' rollercoaster ' of public spending
mr george osborne 's proposal to end austerity a year earlier than expected appeared to be designed to blunt labour 's claim that state spending will shrink to a level not seen since the 1930s
but delivering his budget today , the chancellor said new plans would mean state spending as a share of national income the same size as britain had in 2000 - when labour was in office - but before , mr george osborne said , ' spending got out of control '
the chancellor used his speech to trumpet official forecasts showing better economic growth
borrowing will also be Â£ 5billion less than expected over the next three years , he said
mr george osborne said official predictions also saw the national debt starting to fall earlier than had previously been thought
national debt as a proportion of gdp will start to fall next year , not 2016/17 as previously thought
under george osborne 's plans , government spending will fall as a proportion of gdp to a level last seen in 2000 under tony blair the government is still spending Â£ 90 billion more than it raises in taxes â and this will only be wiped out by 2018/19
for 2015/16 , the deficit will be cut to Â£ 75.3billion in 2015/16 and then Â£ 39.4billion the following year
in 2017/18 it will fall to Â£ 12.8billion before moving into a surplus of Â£ 5.2billion the year after
but in 2019/20 , the planned surplus will only rise to Â£ 7billion instead of the previously planned Â£ 23.1billion
meanwhile , debt as a proportion of gdp is expected to fall in the next fiscal year to 80.2 per cent
he said : ' this is a budget that takes britain one more big step on the road from austerity to prosperity
' because the national debt share is falling a year earlier than forecast at the autumn statement , the squeeze on public spending ends a year earlier too
' in the final year of this decade , 2019 - 20 , public spending will grow in line with the growth of the economy
we can do that while still running a healthy surplus to bear down on our debt
