well , it was weird while it lasted
on wednesday , lawmakers in ireland rushed to close a loophole that temporarily made it legal to possess ecstasy , crystal methamphetamine , ketamine , magic mushrooms and a host of other recreational drugs
the loophole was inadvertently opened the day before , when an appeals court invalidated one section of the misuse of drugs act 1977
the court ruled that ireland governments had been unconstitutionally adding substances to section 2 of the law for decades
" we prepared for this possibility
legislation was prepared and approved in advance by cabinet , " minister for health varadkar said in a written statement
" the emergency legislation ... will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment
" the emergency law moved through the ireland legislature and was signed by the president on wednesday , meaning that the drugs would become illegal to possess again at midnight , a department of health spokeswoman told cnn
varadkar said the temporarily legalized substances -- which include a wide array of synthetic or " head shop " drugs -- " all have very significant health risks that outweigh any perceived recreational benefits , " according to the irish times
the original schedule of substances listed in the 1977 law -- including cannabis , cocaine and heroin -- were untouched by the appeals court ruling and remained illegal
varadkar also told the irish times that the court ruling could affect " dozens " of cases , although the journal of ireland said the court 's decision will affect only cases now in the judicial process .
