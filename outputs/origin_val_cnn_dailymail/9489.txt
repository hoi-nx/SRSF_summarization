the heckler who was kicked out of bill cosby 's show at the lyric in baltimore on friday has revealed why he stood up to the legendary comedian

crook discussed why he did what he did : ' i stood up to bill cosby tonight because i believe the 38 women who have come forward so far to accuse him of raping them
' i ca n't speak for those women , but i am determined to stand up with them and tell mr bill cosby that he can not simply avoid answering for those crimes
' before the show , over 30 protesters greeted guests as they went into the venue
crook was not part of that protest effort
he added : ' i wanted [ bill cosby ] to have to face , even if only for a moment , that reality before security escorted me out and allowed him to retreat to the comfort and embrace of audience willing to ignore those women
