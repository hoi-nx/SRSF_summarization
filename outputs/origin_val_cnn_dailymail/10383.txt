virgin are investigating standards on - board their planes following an irate passenger 's video in which he documented the lack of cleanliness on his flight from sydney to melbourne
the man known only as stuart mc called the video : â virgin â a disgrace ' and filmed a dirty seat , chewing gum , dirt and paper littered around flight va 868 from syd to mel
despite the obvious filth surrounding the man 's seat , a spokesperson for virgin told daily mail australia that the airline is committed to providing flyers with a clean environment and will be looking further into the circumstances surrounding the man 's flight
what looks like a bolt is lying down the side of a seat along side some chewing gum ' virgin prides itself on delivering a superior customer experience which includes maintaining a high standard of cleanliness on board our aircraft , ' the spokesperson said
' this example is clearly not up to that standard and we are investigating as a matter of priority
' however it was definitely a warts and all video with filthy aisles and seats the first thing you see
the disgruntled man made his opinions clear during the video , which he uploaded to youtube , claiming he would prefer if the carrier spend more time on their standards than promoting cheap fares
' and they want us to believe tiger is the discount carrier ...
this is the seat i was allocated this afternoon on va 868 syd to mel
obviously short cutting cleaning is the way to making a profit for virgin , ' stuart mc commented on the youtube segment
virgin say they are investigating the incident on - board one of their planes from sydney to melbourne dust and grime also can bee seen lying down the side of the seat as the camera pans along you then see what looks like chewing gum , dust , grime and bits of paper down the side of the seat
it 's clear that the seats and down the side of them had not been cleaned for quite a while
even the arm rests were dirty
it was a gross rather than great experience
not that it was the only airline to be a loser in the cleanliness stakes

dust , detritus and hairs can be clearly seen in an other shot the arm rest of the seat has obviously not been washed for a while videoing the evidence , the former bbc anchorman posted the evidence on twitter , dubbing the service ' filth class '
narrating the short 30 - second video , the presenter explains : ' so this is ba first class and it is abs filthy
you see the marks on here , most of these you can just actually scrape off
' you see the stains down here
it 's when you open your seat that the real horror begins there is also dust and dirt down the side of the arm rest ' this is first class
' the former bbc anchorman and reporter flew off to st lucia with a companion on saturday in first class seats that retail on ba 's website for nearly Â£ 9,000 each in peak - season january
