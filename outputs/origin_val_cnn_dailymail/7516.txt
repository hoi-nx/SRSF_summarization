it âs nearly time for brook to make an emotional walk to the ring and fight jo jo dan on march 28
he has the world at his feet again and i âm looking at fights against the likes of juan manuel marquez , brandon rios and keith thurman in the summer and then the winner of manny pacquiao and floyd mayweather
but it was so nearly game over for brook
i remember being sat next to his bed in the hospital in tenerife and i did nât know if he would fight again
i think it âs hard for you or i to imagine to what he has been through since that horrific knife attack
but this guy is special
jo jo dan is going to face a fighter in sheffield who has only thought about fighting for the past six months
it has been hard on brook â he won a world title and what was supposed to be his moment has been spent recovering from that attack
it âs been a nightmare
brook with his world title in september as he began his recovery from being stabbed in the leg the challenge â and it is a big challenge â will be handling himself in the right manner on the night
everyone wants to see how he comes back physically from what happened
but how will he cope with the emotions ? he will be in his own city , defending his title after all that frustration and pain
there is a lot that can go wrong in those circumstances
but brook is different to normal people
the night he won his world title against shawn porter in california , the stakes were so high
he was fighting in shawn porter âs backyard after having so many title shots postponed because of injury
a normal person could easily have been swallowed up by that pressure â the rest of us were properly nervous
i was there in his dressing room looking at him for a sign of how he was feeling
my dad walked over to brook just before he put his gloves , grabbed his arm and said to him : â this is your time , do nât let this moment pass
' i went outside the dressing room and my dad was smiling
he said to me : â that boy is barely breathing
he is about to fight for the world title in america and his pulse is so low
â the sheffield fighter lands a punch on shawn porter on his way to becoming world champion in august 2014 i am telling you , this guy has ice in his veins
he has been stabbed in the leg and could have died
now , a few months on he is fighting to retain his world title
people will doubt him but i wo nât
that is why i will make the biggest fights possible for him if he comes through this next challenge against jo jo dan
i have already made contact with juan manuel marquez âs people and also brandon rios âs representatives
juan manuel marquez is a legend and that would be a huge fight and brandon rios has been a world champion
keith thurman is also keen and a quality fighter
any one of those guys in sheffield in june would be a very big fight
after that , i would love to see brook fight manny pacquiao or floyd mayweather
after those two fight on may 2 , the winner and brook will be the only world champions in the welterweight division
it would be a great unification match
of course , the fight the whole country wants to see is brook versus amir khan
amir khan âs team told us the fight would happen one day but why not on june 13 at wembley ? we ca nât wait forever for them
all brook can do is take care of his own business later this month
it âs a challenge but he always comes through
brook is putting together his final training preparations before fighting jo jo dan later this month another fight everyone is desperate to see is carl frampton versus scott quigg
talks are underway between me and barry mcguigan âs cyclone promotions , who look after carl frampton
scott quigg is not worried about where the fight is staged or what television channel it is shown on â we just want to make this fight
of course the finances have to be right and we have submitted a proposal that will pay both fighters huge money
they will talk with their broadcaster and see what âs on offer and then hopefully we will sit down as soon as possible
after that , we can push negotiations on
i âm not sure if we will ever find an agreed split - i would be happy for a 60 - 40 purse split in favour of the winner
if you really fancy it i ca nât see a problem with that
we can talk about world titles and legacy and exposure but ultimately this is a super fight â and in a super fight it is only right that these two great fighters get the best deal possible financially
if we can all reach an agreement , then i would love to make this fight in june
we âd be happy to fight in belfast if the numbers were right , but likewise manchester would be brilliant and so would the o2 arena in london
there is a long way to go but who would nât want to see this fight ? scott quigg ( right ) joins carl frampton in the ring after he beat chris avalos in belfast last month i was disappointed to lose the purse bids for james - dirrell after some long negotiations with dirrell âs team
we backed our man to a tune of $ 2.1m but they put in a huge bid of $ 3.1m
i âm confident james gets the victory regardless of the location and make history in the process
i am hearing rumours that the fight will be on april 24 in chicago but we back james to get the win
tony bellew is back in the uk after his foray into hollywood
do nât ask me how he came to be involved in the creed film , but what a great opportunity for him
we will be talking in the coming days about his options , but rest assured after beating nathan cleverly last time out , he will be in a world title fight next time
we are looking at all four of the cruiserweight world champions
marco huck , the wbo champion , is keen and appeals to us as well
but we would fight any of denis lebedev ( wba champion ) , grigory drozd ( wbc ) or yoan pablo hernandez ( ibf )
all are quality fighters and i have had good feedback on all options so watch this space
we are heading for a brilliant battle of hull lightweights this summer
golden boy luke campbell was brilliant again in beating levis morales in hull at the weekend and tommy coyle survived a huge scare against martin gethin on the same card
he was knocked down but got up and perforated martin gethin âs ear drum to win
they are both huge draws in the city and now i am going to make the fight between them for this summer
they are a great mix. tommy coyle âs family is known all over hull â they have a fruit and veg stall in the middle of the city and tommy is full of beans
luke campbell is already an mbe , the boy with an olympic gold medal
tommy coyle celebrates his win over martin gethin at the hull arena on march 7 above all else , they are tremendous fighters
it will really divide the city
i am looking at the kc stadium and craven park , probably for a date in mid-july
many people would have luke campbell as favourite but how can anyone underestimate tommy coyle ? this will be a huge night
i would like to say here how relieved i was to hear that charlie payton is ok after being taken to hospital following his defeat against bobby jenkinson in hull at the weekend
he looked in a bad way but has been given the all - clear , thankfully
it reminds you how tough this sport is and , for me , it reinforces that above all else these guys ought to get the paydays they deserve
people say that fighters should ignore the money and just get fights made â it is easy to say when you are not the one putting your health on the line for your living
fight for titles and fight for glory , of course , but let âs remember what these athletes put themselves through in the process .
