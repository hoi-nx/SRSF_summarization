playing liverpool in the fa cup quarter - finals holds no fears for henry - providing he does not have to take the train to anfield
the canadian 's whirlwind beginning to life at blackburn looks set to continue with a starting spot on sunday
injury problems in defence prompted blackburn boss bowyer to take henry on a month 's loan from west ham on wednesday , the same day they played sheffield wednesday in the championship
three hours after meeting his team - mates for the first time , henry walked out onto the pitch at hillsborough and was instrumental in the victory that just about keeps blackburn 's play - off hopes alive
henry made a good start to his blackburn career after joining on loan from west ham henry said : ' i got a call from the manager in the morning and i was told i was going on loan and i was hopefully playing that night
' i had to collect my stuff from upton park , sign some paperwork and then be on a train
i got on the wrong train , asked the ticket man if it was going to sheffield to find out i had to get off and get on another train
' after that finally i recognised some people in blackburn kit at the train station and from there i was in safe hands
i met the team , did pre-game stuff and then just played
' i was just really happy to play
it 's been a while
i knew me thinking too much would n't be good , i just wanted to get on the pitch as soon as possible and establish myself in the team
' henry began his career at home - town club toronto and joined west ham in january after being recommended to west ham boss allardyce by former toronto manager ryan
ryan played for allardyce at blackburn , where he was captain and a hugely popular figure
canadian international henry joined west ham in january from mls side toronto ' it was funny coming to blackburn and walking through the facility and then seeing him amongst the boards , ' said henry
' ryan has been a mentor since he came to toronto
he really has a lot of faith in me and has really guided me along my journey
i knew he was a big figure here and he was a solid defender everywhere he went
' junior hoilett also played here , who 's a close friend of mine , so i knew it would be a good move for me
' the 21 - year - old has never been to anfield before but did face liverpool on their pre-season tour to america in 2012
he knows securing the win needed to get to wembley will be a huge task but has been impressed by the togetherness of the squad
henry played against liverpool in america in a pre-season game - but has never been to anfield henry said : ' i 'm still getting familiar with a lot of the guys but on the pitch it was great because there was constant chatter and communication and i just thought they believed in me from the get - go
' when we get the test on sunday , i think we 'll definitely be ready
there 's a lot of quality players in here so i think if we can go there and do our job , as long as we stay together as a team , it 's definitely possible to get a result
' i 'm not going to shy away from the opportunity
these are the games where you can really see how far you are from the top level
' bowyer is definitely without three defenders in injured trio jason lowe , shane duffy and alex baptiste , while grant hanley is a major doubt
but the blackburn boss has total faith in his new man , saying : ' full credit to him and his character
' he 's been brought in to play games for us and we have to thank west ham for allowing him to come to us
everybody at west ham spoke very highly of him and his performance on wednesday backed that up
' we would n't have any problems playing him on sunday against liverpool
