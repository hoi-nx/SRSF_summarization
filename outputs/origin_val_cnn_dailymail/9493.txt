australia photographer brook mitchell , 36 , who lives in bali , embarked on a trip to iran and captured these incredible pictures of the celebrations and the macabre museum
ghoulish : a mural of the statue of liberty on the wall of the former u.s. embassy in tehran , where 52 hostages were held for 444 days bizarre : wax figures supposedly represent former u.s. embassy staff inside the so called ' glassy room ' in tehran liberty : a statue at the entrance to the former u.s. embassy in tehran , which the iranian government dubbed the ' u.s. den of espionage ' a display depicting the storming of the former u.s. embassy in 1979
thousands of protesters pressed around the compound , responding to a call by the country 's new leader , ayatollah khomeini , to attack u.s. and israel interests the rooms where secret state missions were planned have been covered in graffiti
but apart from the most minor of cosmetic changes , the building that caused a global diplomatic crisis is frozen in time - and looks almost identical to its portrayal in the academy awards - winning ben affleck movie argo
in 1979 , thousands of protesters pressed around the compound , responding to a call by the country 's new leader , ayatollah khomeini , to attack u.s. and israel interests
of the 90 people in the compound , six u.s. managed to escape the building and flee to other embassies
other non- u.s. citizens captured when the embassy was seized were released , but 66 were captured , including three at the foreign ministry , and held hostage for 444 days

they demanded that the shah be expelled from the u.s. , where he had been taken for cancer treatment after he was overthrown
freeing the hostages became a priority for the administration of u.s. president carter - but nothing could be done apart from enforcing ineffective economic sanctions
mr carter pledged to preserve the lives of the hostages and conducted intense diplomacy to secure their release
but his failure ultimately contributed to his losing the presidency to ronald reagan in 1980

on the day of president ronald reagan 's inauguration , january 20 1981 , the hostages were set free starring role : ben affleck starred as a cia agent in the film argo , about the crisis which won the oscar for best picture at the academy awards the embassy garnered worldwide attention in november 1979 when revolutionary students stormed in and took dozens of u.s. staff hostage - the story which inspired the film argo , starring ben affleck two weeks into the crisis , ayatollah khomeini ordered the release of 13 female and black hostages , mostly clerical staff and members of the marine guard who guard u.s. embassies around the world
another hostage , vice consul richard queen , was released in july 1980 after falling ill with multiple sclerosis
but the remaining 52 were deprived of their freedom for 444 days
in february 1980 , iran issued a new set of demands for the hostages ' freedom
it called for the shah to be handed over to face trial in tehran , as well as other diplomatic gestures , such as a u.s. apology for its actions
the hostages were finally set free on january 20 1981

every year , iran commemorates the anniversary with its ten days of dawn celebrations a crowd gathers as this strongman theatrically struggles to break free of chains in minab , iran yet mr brook mitchell , who embarked on an enlightening trip , said : ' after visiting some of the most remote and supposedly conservative parts of the country , areas that very few outsiders see , i can not equate the term ' axis of evil ' with my experiences , at least when it comes to the people i met
' travelling through iran as an outsider was an unforgettable , immersive experience
' open , curious hospitality was the norm
despite being proud of their country and history , the people were largely ashamed of their government
' there 's rebellion going on all the time ; it 's just for the most part it 's happening behind closed doors
' my favourite image is probably one of the lady in the striking red mask staring down the camera
after having some breakfast together she was happy for me to take her picture , and she had a really lovely way about her
' it was the second morning of the trip and i was kind of reassured that it was all going to work out after that
' travelling through iran as an outsider was an unforgettable , immersive experience , ' brook mitchell explained the iranian flag flies in the town centre of the city of yazd
officials estimated around 20,000 people attended the celebrations he added that in many areas there was a sense of desperation at the current state of the economy , with many young adults unsure of their future
' i was frequently asked about the current migration laws back in australia , and what i thought of the government
this was usually followed up with an invitation to share some tea , ' he said
' even at mass anti-western rallies i was welcomed with smiles and curiosity , which was a surreal experience in itself
' the photographer travelled along the ethnically diverse persian coast region , which is rarely visited by outsiders , and spent time on qeshm and hormuz islands , the former the site of recent military exercises from where missiles were fired from the coast to destroy a mock u.s. carrier
brook mitchell says a highlight for him was a visit to the panjshambe bazaar , a weekly market in the desert town of minab , which draws some of the most remote and ethnically diverse groups in iran to sell their wares

rays of light illuminate the intricate tile work of the building ' in the persian many bandari - literally meaning ' people of the port ' in persian , women wear distinctive masks made of metal which are covered with fabric , the colour and style depending on the woman 's ethnic group and town , ' mr brook mitchell added
' this is a stark contrast to the black tent like outfits seen in the rest of the country
' there was little in the way of tourist infrastructure for outsiders for much of the trip , which made daily organisation pretty challenging
' during the trip brook mitchell visited the persian gulf coast and islands : bandar abbas , hormuz , qeshm and minab and travelled to the desert cities of yazd and shiraz , tehran , including the ancient zoroastrian centre of chak chak , ruins at persepolis and the city of isfahan
the intricately decorated sheikh lotfollah mosque in isfahan ( left ) and a vendor at the panjshambe bazaar in minab ( right ) in a city of nearly one million , only around 20,000 showed up for the rally , and dispersed after just a few hours , the photographer said ' down with israel ' : the sight of children holding placards such as these was a confronting element to the protest , the photographer said men and boys training in a traditional gym for the iranian martial art of zurkhaneh
the practice dates back more than 800 years working on a traditional lenge at low tide , bandar abbas
