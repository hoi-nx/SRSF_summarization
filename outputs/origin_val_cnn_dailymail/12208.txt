jerusalem either netanyahu just staged the most dramatic political comeback in israeli history and beyond , or something was very wrong with the polls before and during the election
polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire , with netanyahu in a virtual tie with his main challenger , isaac herzog of the zionist union party
only four days before the election , polls showed isaac herzog taking a four - seat lead into the final weekend before the election
exit polls on the night of the election showed netanyahu had closed the gap
the polls suggested he was in a dead heat , with a very even split between right - wing and left - wing parties
not more polls or surveys , but actual counts from the ballot boxes
netanyahu was n't in a fight for his political life after all
he was the clear winner , running away with the election and facing a fairly clear path to create a coalition government
although the results are unofficial , it seems almost certain that netanyahu will remain the israeli prime minister
degani , a pollster , professor at tel aviv university and president of the geocartography knowledge group , saw very different results from his own polls
he never anticipated a zionist union victory
instead , he says , he always saw likud holding a lead
the mistake that others made , according to degani , was in the methodology
" the internet does not represent the state of israeli and the people of israeli , " he said , referring to modern statistical methods
" it represents panels , and the panels are biased strongly to the center -- tel aviv , better - educated , more participants in this kind of conversation
and people who are in the periphery and so on and have the stronger tendency to vote likud , i think , are poorly represented
" " i have tested sometimes at the same night , doing by telephone as i do always -- and very specifically geographically , and very well - weighted and very well , having cell phones and other phones and so on -- and at the same time i did on the internet
and i got results which are very , very different
" but tzemach , the polling expert for cnn affiliate channel 2 israel , suggests netanyahu was in a tight race the entire way and managed to close the gap " like a magician , " using the election polls as his final trick
" the polls showed that they are going to lose
it gave very important information both to the public and to the politicians
netanyahu used it , " said tzemach
" many voted what we call strategic voting
they did not vote to the party that is their first preference , but they voted for the likud
" likud voters did not participate in exit polls , according to tzemach , and that skewed the results , leading many to believe that isaac herzog had tied netanyahu
" we had ballots in an area where there are a lot of immigrants from the former soviet union , " explained tzemach
" in these ballots , more than 30 % did not participate in our polls , and they are likud supporters
" another factor that may have worked in netanyahu 's favor was his likud party cannibalizing votes from other right - wing parties
in the days before the election , netanyahu moved to the political right , making a big push for right - wing voters to choose his party over other ideologically similar parties , such as naftali bennett 's jewish home and avigdor lieberman 's yisrael beiteinu party
during the weekend before the election , netanyahu took part in a right - wing rally in tel aviv 's central rabin square
he continued his shift to the right in a series of interviews with local media leading up to the election
his most controversial statement came the day before the elections when he reversed his publicly stated position on a two - state solution
" anyone who is going to establish a palestinians state , anyone who is going to evacuate territories today , is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical islam against israeli , " he said in a television interview
" this is the true reality that was created here in the last few years
" in 2009 , in a speech known as the bar ilan speech , netanyahu committed to negotiations for a two - state solution , saying , " let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions
israeli is committed to international agreements , and expects all sides to fulfill their obligations
i say to the palestinians : we want to live with you in peace , quiet , and good neighborly relations
" tzemach estimates that likud took four seats from jewish home and two more seats from yachad , a party that did not receive enough votes to warrant inclusion in the knesset , israeli 's parliament
exit polls in israeli have been wrong before
in the most recent elections in 2013 , exit polls showed lapid 's centrist yesh atid party winning between 12 and 13 seats in the knesset
but when the final results were tallied , lapid won 19 seats , becoming a major player in the government
this time , the unexpected surprise worked in netanyahu 's favor , turning the campaign race into an election night rout
likud had never polled better than approximately 25 seats , but it grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the knesset , according to unofficial numbers from the israeli election committee based on 99 % of the vote
netanyahu has worked this sort of magic once before
in the 1996 elections , early results showed the labor party 's shimon peres as the winner , but as more results came in , netanyahu eked out a victory by fewer than 1 % of the votes
degani said this election reveals the truth behind israeli politics
" this last election it showed very clearly that we do not have right and left
we have only right and extreme right , which is not nice sometimes
and in the right , you have the likud mostly , and in the likud , you have mostly netanyahu
