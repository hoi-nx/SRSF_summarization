rousey forced the challenger to tap out
' we were expecting that she might come out and do something flying at me right away , ' rousey said
' that 's not usually how you land an armbar at that angle , but it works
it was a lot like judo transitions , where you scramble the second you hit the ground
' i made that up on the fly , to be honest
but it was kind of funny : we were going toward the ground , and i kind of reverted back to judo mode and was thinking , ' do n't touch your back
' ' that 's where the acrobatic thing came from , was thinking about not touching your back in judo
' it was hard to work out who was more stunned , cat zingano or the sell - out 17,000 - crowd at the staples center
' she 's really good ... but that would n't happen again , ' the beaten challenger said
' it was a knee and then a throw and then a scramble , and then she was wrapped around my arm
i was ready to do a million different things
i planned on getting in a fist fight tonight
