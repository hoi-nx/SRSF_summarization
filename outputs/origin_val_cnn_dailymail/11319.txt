the site says the solid hardwood nutkin cot , a modified version of which is still being sold , is suitable for children aged 0 to 12 years as it ' transforms easily from cot into stunning sleigh bed
' it says the cot is ' extremely versatile ' and can be set to three different heights
in 2013 , baumhaus released a product recall for the original design of the cot , explaining that parts of the bed , particularly the gaps at the top , had been identified as a potential trap - hazard
a notice published online by consumer watchdog which ? said there is a ' risk of children trapping their head and neck in the gaps at the top
' it added : ' a child 's legs or arms could become trapped between the end slat of the drop - down side of some products sold
' the company , which produces a number of ranges of furniture , has since modified the design and it is available from a number of retailers for around Â£ 500
