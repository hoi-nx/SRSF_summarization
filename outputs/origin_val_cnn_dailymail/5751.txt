they 're not the usual dishes one thinks of when considering the tastes and palate of young children
but in one restaurant in cornwall , moules mariniere , wood fired pizzas , ratatouille , and crispy salt and pepper squid sit alongside more prosaic offerings such as burgers , and fish and chips
the dishes served at amã©lies in porthleven were designed and approved by the restaurant owner 's six - year - old daughter , after whom the restaurant is named
amã©lie with her mother sam in the kitchen of the eponymous restaurant in cornwall the new menu was given the thumbs up by the child testers aged between two and eight - years - old the eaterie 's new kids ' menu was devised entirely by amã©lie , who was aged just six months when the restaurant in breageside in porthleven , was opened by her mum sam
she loves nothing more than popping into the kitchen with head chef paul james and often puts on her chef 's whites and cooks at home
ms sheffield-dunstan said : ' amã©lie and i often cook together at home and dishes like our mish mash chicken with oodles of noodles were inspired by amã©lie 's home - cooked favourites

the restaurant serves mini pots of moules mariniere ( right ) starting them young : chef paul james watches over his kitchen protege amã©lie as she prepares food each time amã©lies launches a new menu the staff are invited to try the dishes so that they know what each tastes like and can ask any questions of the chef
the new menu was launched with a tasting by the people who matter â the children
amã©lie said : ' it was really fun having my friends here to share the food
i liked dinging the bell to get service to the kitchen ! ' the dishes were a big hit with the kids , aged between two and eight who tucked into everything from pizzas and ratatouille to squid and locally landed fish
grilled fish and chips is one of the more prosaic items on the restaurant 's children 's menu ruby mitchell , aged 6 , said , ' amã©lies is brilliant
it 's the best burger i 've ever had and the pasta is yummy
children 's menu 's are really great because they have chocolate and ice lollies after â i had a red flavoured one which was super delicious ! ' liam atkinson , 6 , added : ' amã©lies is the best restaurant because i can meet all my friends here and we love the food
' ms sheffield-dunstan said : ' we 're all about family at amã©lies and we wanted to focus on the food we provide for kids being as special as what we plate up for the adults
' that means attention to detail , great presentation and taste and , of course , providing dishes the kids want to eat
