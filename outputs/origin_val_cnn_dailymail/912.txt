russian president putin is ready to unleash a supersonic bomber towards uk which can outrun the raf âs fastest fighter jets
the introduction of the blackjack follows sorties by other russian aircraft near cornwall last month which disrupted commercial flights and sparked major security fears
on that occasion , raf pilots flying typhoon jets easily caught up with two propeller - driven bear bombers and directed their crews away from uk airspace
but the blackjack ( tu-160m ) is three times faster than the bear and can fly four times further than the fighters that make up uk âs quick reaction alert ( quick reaction alert ) squadrons , according to experts
the bomber , also known as the white swan because of its shape and huge wingspan , has just re-entered service in the russian air force following a design overhaul
experts say it is now more than a match for any uk aircraft , including the typhoon , which is used to protect uk airspace
like the blackjack , the typhoon can reach mach 2 â about 1,500mph
russian president putin ( pictured ) has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the west , according to experts but while the russian aircraft has a range of 7,600 miles without refuelling , the typhoon âs limit is 1,800 miles , meaning the blackjack could maintain its maximum speed for much longer than its uk counterpart without air - to - air refuelling
dr sutyagin , senior russian research fellow at the rusi ( rusi ) in london , said : â the tu-160m now has greater thrust and fuel efficiency and it can carry a larger payload of conventional missiles
â the test flights were successful and the aircraft is now very potent
there is simply no uk aircraft of its calibre or purpose
it is the largest bomber in the world
â the first two revamped blackjacks passed a series of test flights last december and have now been passed for service
they are being prepared for possible action at air bases in russian that are within easy striking distance of uk
one , monchegorsk air base near murmansk , northern russian , is just 1,000 miles from the british isles
ten more blackjacks will be modernised before 2020
dr sutyagin added that the blackjacks â revamp was part of a plan by president putin to boost both russian âs arsenal of military hardware and its troop numbers
it comes at a time of heightened tension between russian and the west , and while uk âs armed forces are shrinking due to spending cuts
â president putin has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the west , â said dr sutyagin
â he has also improved his long - range nuclear missiles such as the bulava , which is now very hard to detect on launch
it is lighter and more compact , too , so more warheads can be fitted into a submarine
' he has also committed to the t-50 low - visibility jet
this stealth jet could lead to potentially massive changes in the distribution of military power around the world
' he is doubling the number of his special forces troops , as well
â an raf typhoon aircraft from number xi squadron shadows a russian bear-h aircraft ( file picture ) between now and 2020 , the size of the spetsnaz ( special forces ) regiments will increase from 15,000 to 32,000
trained to the same level as uk âs sas ( sas ) , they were used in chechnya and , most recently , in eastern ukraine where they are understood to have organised a guerilla campaign by russian separatists
experts also believe putin could send the spetsnaz to the baltic states of latvia and lithuania , both nato members , to organise resistance among ethnic russian
dr sutyagin added : â military activity in crimea and eastern ukraine has borne all the hallmarks of the special russian units â it would be a mistake to believe the same tactics might not be applied elsewhere
â the mod ( mod ) has been following the blackjack and russian stealth - jet programmes
but while the typhoon can not match the blackjack âs range , raf sources insist it is a superior aircraft overall given its set of air - to - air weapons and its agility
an mod spokesman said : â the primary role of the raf is to defend the uk
we are aware of recent russian military activity
' raf typhoon fighters will continue to routinely intercept , identify and escort russian aircraft that travel through international airspace within the uk âs area of interest
