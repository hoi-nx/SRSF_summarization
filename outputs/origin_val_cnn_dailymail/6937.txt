a uk woman has spoken of her shock at discovering her mother is an influential jihadist who helps suicide bombers and is known as mama shabab
amal farah was stunned when police knocked on her door to tell her that faduma jama had become a pivotal member of al shabab , the somalia jihadists behind the westgate mall massacre in nairobi
mother - of - two ms amal farah had cut off all contact from her strict muslim family five years earlier and fearful for her life , had changed her number , her name and hidden her whereabouts
' known as mama shabab , faduma jama allegedly ran a safe house for suicide bombers and western fighters recruited into the militant islam organisation
the police officers told ms amal farah , 34 , to google her mother 's name if she wanted to know why she was in trouble
she said : ' it was not until i got to work that i could google her name
there were all these pictures of people injured by suicide bombs
' as i read about what she 'd done i felt so alone
i could n't just turn to my colleagues and say , " guess what ? my mum 's a wanted terrorist
" ' i could n't believe my own mother was involved
i cried non-stop for days after that
' loving : amal , pictured left with her mother , was born in the somalia capital mogadishu but now lives in uk
pictured right , faduma jama , now known as mama shabab , meets a soldier in syria in 1984 in the three years since that earth - shattering day in july 2012 , ms amal farah said : ' i 've grieved for her
it 's brought closure to any romantic idea about one day things being better with my mum
' i 've accepted i 'll never see her again
how could she ever explain that she 'd joined al shabab ? ' it 's too terrible
i fear that one day i will see her on tv or i 'll get a knock on the door to say she 's been killed
but despite all the terrible things she 's done , she is still my mother
' for her own protection , we are not disclosing the details of ms amal farah 's current location or that of her family
but using contacts she has from somalia , where she was born , she discovered her mother married one of al shabab 's leaders
she added : ' i do n't know about my mother 's involvement with western recruits like samantha lewthwaite but i know it 's alleged
i think mama shabab is a horrible name
' oddly , though , ms amal farah can see how her mother might have earned the chillingly affectionate title
she explained : ' she could be very kind and charming
i can see how natural it would be for her to be that motherly figure
' she is utterly devoted to what she believes in and being a wife of a jihadist is a way she can help as a woman
' tv appearance : mother - of - two amal farah was recently interviewed about her ordeal on itv 's lorraine but the image of her mother as mama shabab is a long way from the woman of ms amal farah 's earliest memories
she said : ' when i was little my mum loved fashion
she had these fantastic hairstyles
her brother lived in geneva and she would visit him and bring back all these amazing clothes
' mum was an independent , educated woman
she even divorced my dad because she wanted to travel
' ms amal farah 's father was a colonel in the somalia army under military dictator siad barre
when she was two he went into exile in ethiopia to campaign for democracy and a year later he was killed by a landmine
by then ms amal farah 's mother had become more religious and her childhood more restrictive - being forced to wear the hijab at the age of six
when she was ten her family fled somalia after being granted refugee status in canada
but any hope of a western upbringing was quashed after she was enrolled in a strict islam school
she said : ' suddenly i was was n't allowed to play with my male cousins
we were n't allowed to listen to music
' anything that was deemed frivolous , anything that took you away from the importance of allah , was forbidden
' when she was 15 her mother split from her latest husband and took her and her five younger siblings to live in leicester
it was only when she began studying for a degree in molecular biology that a new world opened up
' it was a revelation , ' she said
' i met atheists , christians , jews , hindus - they challenged me about my views , and i about theirs
it was an incredible sensation to be able to discuss ideas without fear
' she felt in her heart that to be true to herself she could no longer call herself a muslim
recalling the day she broached the subject with her family , ms amal farah said : ' my mum 's first words were , " you 're going to hell ! " then my uncle flew over from saudi arabia and for three days i was locked in the house and forced to listen to him
' when she failed to change her mind , her mother cut off all contact with her
she even left uk and took the family to dubai
she explained : ' she was petrified that the rest of my siblings would leave islam like i had
i was a sheep lost to the wolves and she had to protect the rest of the flock
' ms amal farah ( pictured right , with her father in somalia ) cut off all contact with her family several years ago ms amal farah got an evening job in a call centre and with the support of friends built a new life for herself
she stopped wearing a headscarf and started listening to music
the last time amal saw her mother was at leicester train station in 2005 , shortly before she left
she said : ' it was my dream to get out and finally i had escaped
' it was a haze
i did n't know it would be the last time i would see her
we hugged but she made it clear i was putting her through a lot of pain
she was genuinely worried for my soul
' at that time her younger sister asia was also leading a double life
' she 'd had a secret part - time job as a waitress and had a wardrobe of shorts and miniskirts
mum found them and i knew asia was in trouble ' , ms amal farah adds
' i panicked and emailed her , saying no matter what , she must not to go to somalia
i knew she 'd never leave if she did
' i was told to butt out if i knew what was good for me
a few weeks later my mother called me to say asia was getting married in two days ' time
' the last time ms amal farah spoke to her mother was in 2007
she said : ' she was preaching to me to over the phone
she kept saying " are you praying ? " she could n't accept that i had left islam
' i asked where she was and she said , " i ca n't tell you , i 'm being pursued by your infidel uncle
" she meant a friend of my father 's who was then president of somalia
i realise she must have been in the thick of al shabab even then
' by then ms amal farah had met her husband , a jewish lawyer , at university but she had a sense of dread
she explained : ' i knew they would do what they could to prevent us being together
' i knew i would never be safe , that i was a thorn in my family 's side
so i changed my number and made sure they did n't know where i was living
' the white widow : ms amal farah says she is uncertain of her mother 's involvement with samantha lewthwaite , a uk woman who is one of the world 's most wanted female terror suspects at their wedding in 2010 none of her family were present
ms amal farah said : ' it was tinged with sadness
i would have loved to have seen my mother there but there was no way she would ever have approved , especially of someone jewish
' since finding out about her mother amal has become a member of the council of ex-muslims of uk , speaking against radical islam , and of one law for all , a campaign group
her life now is one that she never thought she would have as a child
she says : ' all my dreams have come true
i have a wonderful family , an incredible husband and i just feel so fortunate
it 's the life i never thought i 'd have
' but i miss my siblings , especially my sister
i hope wherever they are that they are happy
i love my mum but i will never be able to make sense of the terrible things she has done
' it hurts knowing i wo n't see her again but she has made her choice
