alan stubbs has lambasted collum over the referee âs role in the goal that sealed a 2 - 0 win for rangers at easter road
the hibs boss was astonished that collum did nât award a free - kick after lee wallace appeared to foul hanlon as the centre - half sought to clear
kenny miller seized the loose ball and , with the home defence still appealing for an infringement , cracked home an 80th - minute shot that added to lee wallace âs opener
hibs manager alan stubbs speaks to the fourth official ; he was unhappy with the referee 's performance referee collum was on the end of some stick from hibs boss stubbs after their game against rangers alan stubbs attempted to pick his words carefully afterwards but could nât disguise his anger towards collum , who has been at the centre of numerous controversies this season
â can i say no comment in case i get into any trouble ? â alan stubbs opened
â i âve been in management a short time
i was a player a long time
over the years , that decision would be given 100 per cent of the time
â i think that âs probably the best way to describe it without me getting into trouble
â not 90 per cent , not 99 per cent , 100 per cent
but a guy who has an influence over a game decided differently
alan stubbs was sure that a foul on hanlon ( right ) would have been given ' 100 per cent ' of the time alan stubbs ( centre ) watches on from the dugout as his hibs side fell to a 2 - 0 defeat by rangers â when he sees it back again ... well , there âs no point
he âs there to get the big calls right and he got a big call very , very wrong
â there was no point speaking to him afterwards
everyone in the stadium could see it was a foul
â i do nât want to sit here and try to justify a decision
only one guy can do that , but he âs protected and not allowed to talk
it spoiled the game , although obviously not from rangers â point of view
â hanlon was booked for his protests towards collum as rangers celebrated kenny miller â s first goal since december
â most of the stadium felt it was a foul , â said the defender
â i thought it was but the referee thought differently
kenny miller ( centre ) celebrates after his goal gave rangers an unassailable 2 - 0 lead over hibs kenny miller is mobbed by the ecstatic rangers supporters who had made the trip to easter road on saturday â i read the pass , got in front of lee wallace and went to clear with my right foot
i just felt like i was taken out
â it âs disappointing a decision like that has maybe ruined our chances of getting anything from the game
â i was nât given an explanation , he ( collum ) just decided to book me for dissent even though i did nât say much
â i just said it was a foul , along with everyone else who surrounded him
â i did nât even think i was in his face but i think he just has to pick a player and book him
