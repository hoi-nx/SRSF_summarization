mother - of - one vicci , 32 , piled on the pounds by gorging on takeaways and chocolate while pregnant with her first son

unrecognisable : vicci fish lost ten stone
the mother - of - one piled on the weight whilst pregnant with her first child and subsequently became paranoid that her partner , chris , would leave her for another woman back together : vicci 's boyfriend chris left her because of her jealousy but the couple rekindled their relationship after she lost ten stone and regained her confidence miss vicci , from nantgarw , near cardiff , vowed to change after the break up and vowed to lose weight , swapping fatty foods for fruit and vegetables
the police control room team leader , who used to eat mcdonald 's for breakfast , followed by a cheese sandwich , a chocolate bar and crisps for lunch , and a chinese takeaway with curry and chips for dinner , also took up running â and saw her lose 10 stone
as miss vicci 's weight fell , her confidence soared , and a year later she won back her man
she said : ' i was paranoid about chris cheating because i was insecure about my own body
splitting with chris was heartbreaking but it 's what i needed to change
i 'm so glad i lost the weight to win back my man
' miss vicci first started struggling with her weight after giving birth to her son noah , now three
before and after : vicci felt so uncomfortable in herself that she would accuse her partner chris of wanted to be with other women , now she feels great about the way she looks unhappy : at her biggest vicci weighed a whooping 24st 8lbs thanks to her diet of macdonalds and take - aways soon she tipped the scales at a whopping 24st 8lbs and hid her enormous frame under size 26 clothes
she said : ' i would sit around eating throughout the day - i just did n't think about eating healthily
i would always have a biscuit in my hands or a packet of crisps
' if i walked past mcdonald 's i would always pop in for a burger
everything was difficult - i had to stop at least twice when going up the stair
' as her weight increased miss vicci 's confidence hit rock bottom , and green - eyed , she soon became convinced her boyfriend of ten years mr chris would leave her for another , thinner woman
she said : ' i could n't shake the feeling that chris was looking for someone else as i slobbed out with a takeaway
' chris is gym - mad and loves going out , but i hated it
i was a complete couch potato
it was easier for me to stay in , i felt too insecure about my body to go out and i had nothing to wear
' he would always ask me to come out with , but i always said no. eventually he stopped asking me and started to go out by himself
' i let my imagination run away with me - my insecurities placed a constant strain on our relationship
' breakfast : bacon and egg mcmuffin lunch : cheese and onion sandwich , crisps , a chocolate bar and a fizzy drink dinner : a chinese takeaway with special chow mein , special fried rice , sweet and sour chicken balls , crispy shredded beef , chicken curry , and chips and biscuits and crisps as snacks throughout the day breakfast : slimming world sausage , bacon , fried tomato , eggs and mushrooms lunch : lasagne made with lean mince and yoghurt dinner : a steak and salad with a jacket potato snacks : throughout the day vicci will snack on fresh fruit eventually mr chris , a tree surgeon , decided he could not cope with miss vicci 's paranoia anymore and in october 2013 he moved out
she said : ' he moved back in with his parents and i only saw him at weekends when he came to pick up our son
' when he moved out i was heartbroken - my paranoia had finally pushed him away
it was the wake - up call i needed and i decided to make a change
' miss vicci started watching what she ate and going on extended runs
soon she had lost four stone
after her initial weight loss she joined her local slimming world
she swapped greasy takeaways for lean meat and fresh vegetables
she joined the gym and started going four times a week
within a year miss vicci had dropped to a healthier 14st 7lbs
no social life : as vicci 's weight began to rise she wanted to go out less and less and she no longer felt confident enough to be around her friends compliments : after she began to lose the weight vicci was met with lots of compliments from her friends on her new figure and glamorous new wardrobe she said : ' i began to accept invitations to go out with friends
my new figure and glamorous wardrobe attracted lots of compliments - but there was only one person i wanted to notice , and that was chris
' in october 2014 miss vicci and mr chris went out for dinner and rekindled their relationship
they moved back in with other shortly afterwards
miss vicci says that today the couple are stronger than ever
she said : ' he told me i looked amazing , and we fell back in love
losing weight was fantastic , i feel fitter healthier and happier
' most importantly i feel confident and that has allowed myself and chris to build a stable relationship
' baby weight : it was when vicci was pregnant with her son , noah , who is now three that she first started to put on a lot of weight active : vicci is now more active which has helped her to shift the ten stone and win back her boyfriend , chris mr chris said : ' life with vicci had become hard work because she was overweight and never wanted to go out anywhere
she did n't have any confidence and was really paranoid about who i was with
' i could n't do anything without her being paranoid about what i was up to
i ended up moving out into my old bedroom at my mum 's
i missed the family unit and coming home to my son at the end of the day
' when vicci started losing more and more weight she changed
not only did she look incredible but she had more of a life
' she was going out and had a lot more confidence
i really missed her , so we got back together
these days , she looks so good that it 's me who gets paranoid
' i 'm really proud of her
it 's great being back with her , even though if i want sausages i have to eat slimming world ones
but it is great to be able to go down the pub with my mates without her worrying
