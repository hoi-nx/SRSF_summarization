patrick bamford scored three goals at the ipro stadium during a successful loan last season that helped derby reach wembley
he claimed another here of an entirely different complexion
the 21 - year - old striker , borrowed from chelsea , delivered the cutting edge to send middlesbrough five points clear of their promotion rivals
having taken stick all game from derby fans who once cheered him , he revelled in celebrating his defining contribution

tomlin nicked possession and threaded a pass to send bamford clear
he stretched to reach it before grant and looked like he may go over when the derby goalkeeper spread himself
instead he kept his feet and his head , slotting a neat finish from a tight angle
his 16th goal of the season
quite a way to end st patrick âs day
george friend celebrates with patrick bamford as the away side secure all three points against derby this result will hurt mcclaren as much as it satisfies aitor karanka
aiming for automatic promotion , derby are faltering
the roar from the visiting section at the final whistle told a story
so did the solemnness with which derby fans vacated their seats
they look set for the play - offs again at this rate
the visitors so nearly took the lead in spectacular style five minutes before the interval
grant raced out of his area to intercept a long punt forward but only succeeded in sending his weak clearance to the boot of vossen
derby 's free fall hughes of derby and clayton compete for the ball during the championship match from 40 yards out the belgian controlled in an instant and lofted the ball high towards the goal
the capacity home crowd seemed to hold its breath as the shot hung in the air , only letting go when the ball dropped to bounce back off the post and into grant âs arms
it was not a first half to savour for either of these teams with premier league aspirations
beginning the match two points apart in fourth and third , derby and middlesbrough both played as if anxious to avoid defeat rather than seize victory
quality was low , the ball often sent to the skies
johnny russell of derby and gibson of middlesbrough both do their best to win the ball derby ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : grant 6 ; christie 6 ( thomas 75 â 5 ) , richard keogh 6.5 , albentosa 5.5 , forsyth 6 ; hughes 6.5 , hanson 6 ( hendrick 70 â 5 ) , bryson 6.5 ; tom ince 6.5 , johnny russell 6 , jamie ward 6 ( jesse lingard 70 â 5 ) booked : christie , hughes , bryson subs not used : roos , dawkins , shotton , warnock manager : mcclaren 6 middlesbrough ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : konstanopolous 6 ; kalas 6 , woodgate 6.5 , gibson 6.5 , friend 5.5 ; clayton 6.5 , grant leadbitter 6 ; adomah 6.5 ( nsue 90 â ) , vossen 6.5 ( forshaw 81 â ) , tomlin 6.5 ( reach 86 â ) , bamford 7 booked : vossen , clayton subs not used : ripley , kike , whitehead , omeruo manager : aitor karanka 7 referee : andy dâurso 6 man of the match : patrick bamford the double absence of martin and bent clipped derby of their attacking focus in the previous three games leading to defeat and two draws
johnny russell made a fist of playing the striker âs role again but as a natural winger he does not possess the hold up ability of martin or predatory instinct on bent
middlesbrough âs form entering this match was quite literally hit and miss : win followed loss in their past six games
they have struggled away from the riverside before this
derby held greater possession but did not create a much
their best opening of the first half came in the 15th minute when tom ince whipped a cross to the back post to jamie ward , who was unable to apply the killer touch from two yards
middlesbrough went straight down the other end with bamford slipping in albert adomah to strike for goal
grant beat away that effort and then did well to save patrick bamford âs follow - up too
five minutes after the break simmering tensions sparked into a mass melee when hanson left grant leadbitter on the floor with a tackle
when referee andy dâurso blew for a stoppage , vossen squared up to hanson , prompting a dozen or so to get involved
vossen and cyrus christie were booked for their parts
patrick bamford had a chance to score before he did , miscuing badly from adomah âs cross
but the mark of a good striker is showing confidence the next time
clayton beats his man to the ball as middlesbrough secure all three points away against derby after his goal mcclaren made three changes seeking to salvage something
jesse lingard came on and had derby âs best chance , but dragged wide when the ball fell his way in the box
in injury time patrick bamford could have doubled his tally , finding himself with a clear run at goal as derby poured forwards
but as he closed in on grant , richard keogh arrived to block his shot wide
no matter , he was still the match winner .
