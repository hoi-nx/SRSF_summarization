in a move that could heighten the hurdles faced by states attempting to execute prisoners , a leading association for united states pharmacists has officially discouraged its members from providing drugs for use in lethal injections
the policy adopted by apa delegates at their annual meeting monday makes an ethical stand against providing such drugs , saying they run contrary to the role of pharmacists as health care providers
the association lacks legal authority to bar its more than 62,000 members from selling execution drugs , but its policies set pharmacists ' ethical standards

' now there is unanimity among all health professions in the united states who represent anybody who might be asked to be involved in this process , ' said association member fassett , who voted in favor of the policy
compounding pharmacies , which make drugs specifically for individual clients , only recently became involved in the execution - drug business

other states are turning to alternative methods
tennessee has approved the use of the electric chair if lethal - injection drugs are n't available , while utah has reinstated the firing squad as a backup method if it ca n't obtain the drugs
oklahoma is considering legislation that would make it the first state to allow the use of nitrogen gas as a potential execution method
fassett , a professor emeritus of pharmacy law and ethics at washington state university , said the united front by health professionals might force people to finally face the death penalty 's harsh realities
lethal injections have created a sterile setting for executions , he said
' it 's like we 're not really executing
we 're sort of like taking spot to the vet
we 're just putting him to sleep , and that 's not true , ' he said .
