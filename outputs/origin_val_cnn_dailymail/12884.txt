sanaa , yemeni a yemeni jet commanded by the capital 's houthis conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing yemeni 's deposed president in the country 's south thursday , injuring no one but marking an escalation in deadly fighting that 's erupted between forces for and against the ousted leader
the jet flew from sanaa , which houthis rebels overtook in january , to the palace in the port city of aden , where the jet conducted the strikes thursday afternoon , a senior air force official said on condition of anonymity
deposed president abdu rabu mansour hadi was at the aden palace compound when the first missile struck the grounds , but he then fled safely , a abdu rabu mansour hadi aide said , also on condition of anonymity
a second missile struck near the compound , but , like the first , injured no one , two officials in aden said
another houthis - commanded air force jet fired a missile in downtown aden about a half - hour later , again injuring no one , aden gov. hobtour said
it was n't immediately clear what the missile struck , or what the intended target was
the airstrikes came on the same day opposing yemeni military forces -- those commanded by houthis , and those led by officers loyal to abdu rabu mansour hadi -- battled in aden , leaving at least 13 people dead and 21 others injured , hobtour said
the houthis , a minority rebel group that holds sway in the nation 's north but has less influence elsewhere , took control over military forces stationed near sanaa , including the air force , as it overtook the government there in january
abdu rabu mansour hadi initially was put under house arrest in sanaa , but he escaped last month , fleeing to aden and declaring himself to still be president
some military forces still are loyal to abdu rabu mansour hadi , including troops from his native province in the south
on thursday , clashes erupted in aden when a special forces commander loyal to the houthis , abdul hafez al saqqaf , ordered hundreds of his troops to create checkpoints at all roads leading to aden 's airport
watch : who are the houthis ? the clashes were reported to be taking place on four different fronts in the airport and a surrounding military base
passengers were stranded at the airport , with flights canceled throughout the day
al saqqaf 's forces gave up much of their ground in aden after pro-hadi forces struck them with heavy artillery and tanks , a pro-hadi military commander said on condition of anonymity
some of the wounded in thursday 's fighting were in critical condition , officials said , suggesting the death toll could rise
the houthis entered sanaa in september , demanding a greater share of political power
they took control over a period of months , seizing the presidential palace in january
the unrest has plunged yemeni deeper into chaos
abdu rabu mansour hadi had issued a presidential decree replacing al saqqaf two weeks ago , but the decree was not implemented
