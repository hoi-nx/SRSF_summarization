here , sportsmail answers five key questions on the liverpool star âs future
the liverpool forward was in action for his country on friday night in a european qualifier sterling is prepared to turn down a mammoth Â£ 180,000 - a - week deal at liverpool 1 ) what is sterling âs issue with the deal on the table ? brendan rodgers dug himself a hole by claiming sterling is the one of the best young players in europe
someone of that stature is worth , at least , Â£ 100,000 - per - week
your moral views on whether a player so young should be paid so much is irrelevant
you pay your best players the going rate
sterling , arguably , is liverpool 's best player meaning he should be , at least , on a par with daniel sturridge 's Â£ 150,000 per week
likewise , there are issues with sterling 's role in the team at the moment
he 's been shifted around the pitch by brendan rodgers - even utilised as a right wing back on occasions
he sees his best position as being through the middle
sterling 's current Â£ 35,000 - per - week deal has two years to run at the end of this season the 20 - year - old scored for england in their 4 - 0 win over lithuania at wembley on friday night sterling impressed as part of england 's front three but he has been used at wing back by liverpool 2 ) what would it take to get him to sign a new deal ? certainly an improvement on the Â£ 90,000 - per - week deal they 've offered but even that may not be enough for him to sign
qualifying for the champions league will also help matters
a player of sterling 's rising stock wants to be plying his trade on the biggest club stage of all
playing in the europa league next season is nowhere near as glamorous
assurances over his role in the side may help , too
3 ) are liverpool losing patience with their star man ? the fans are starting to get a little restless
the longer this drags on , the more agitated supporters become
fans believe there will be a resolution but that optimism is n't shared by those in the corridors of power at anfield
they know there 's a real danger of sterling point blank refusing to sign any sort of contract
liverpool chiefs need to keep negotiations amicable
it 's a delicate juggling act for them
there will be no shortage of suitors for sterling should he leave liverpool - in the premier league and europe sterling takes on lithuania 's georgas freidgeimas during the euro 2016 qualifier at wembley 4 ) what is the likelihood of sterling leaving anfield in the summer ? it remains in liverpool 's hands
the fact of the matter is sterling will still have two years left on his current Â£ 35,000 - per - week contract this summer
they could sit tight and maintain he is n't for sale
but whether liverpool want to risk their prized - asset entering the final year of his contract remains to be seen
also , will brendan rodgers want a player who has made it clear he does n't want to stay ? if there is no agreement over a contract , sterling is likely to leave this summer
5 ) if he was to go , what are his options ? clubs across the continent will be clambering for his signature should liverpool decide to sell
bayern munich and real madrid are both monitoring the situation carefully
likewise , manchester city will be hugely interested in the forward
arsenal are also keeping tabs on sterling 's situation but the greater finances of their rivals mean they are likely to be outsiders
sterling has performed well for liverpool but he is yet to sign a new deal to keep him at anfield brendan rodgers must convince sterling to sign a deal that could be one of the biggest in club 's history
