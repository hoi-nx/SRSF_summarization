their debut youtube video of them miming to queen 's hit song ' bohemian rhapsody ' attracted 18 million hits , caught the attention of brian may , and was credited by billboard magazine with causing a staggering 261 per cent surge in the streaming of the iconic song
and now sydney - based trio sketchshe are back with a second hilarious car jam titled ' mime through time ' featuring over 14 classic songs from the 40s through to now ... and this time they appear naked
the stunning models turned comedy act , comprised of shackleford , 28 , lana , 25 , madison lloyd , 27 , became an overnight sensation when they released ' bohemian carsody ' last month
' we had no idea it would have such an incredible response
the fact that we 've had people writing to us from around the world ... i do n't think there 's been a country or continent that has n't reached out and written to us to say they loved it
' shackleford , 28 , says the reason she thinks they 've struck a chord with such a global fan base is that their song choice was so relatable , people love the song , it transcends the age and at some point in time everyone has had a ' rock out ' to it
another reason behind the sydney trio 's success is the natural sex appeal they inject into the humorous skit
as models who met through the same agency , shackleford admits while they are aware of their attractiveness they 've chosen to incorporate it into the act in a way that defies the typical ' pretty girl ' stereotype and still empowers women
' unlike what might be synonymous with an attractive girl , we want to be crazy , let our hair down , and break the rules a bit
but we still like to wear make - up and dress up - we just want be able to make fun of what we do while empowering women to be comfortable in their own skin
' beatle mania : a dramatic rendition of ' help ' by the beatles britney baby : ' baby one more time ' with references to spears 's dark days elvis in the house : elvis 's ' hound dog ' debuts in traditional full body suits in their latest hit ' mime through time ' , you can definitely expect even more sex appeal with the final scene including a rip - off of miley cyrus 's ' wrecking ball ' in which the girls go completely topless in their now famous suzuki
shackleford admits the scene ( which was filmed in the car of her dad 's back drive way ) was a definite risk and two alternative ends were filmed in case it came across as too risquÃ©
' when i first told mum she said " oooh , i do n't know " but then when they saw it they cracked up and think it 's a great joke ... my mum was more shocked by the fact i looked so much like my brother in the slim shady scene ... which i 'm not sure is a good thing
' the girls only use the bare essentials to produce the clip
' the first time we had a bra in the car so we taped the iphone to it and propped it up that way , but this time we upgraded to a block of wood , but it 's still very dodgy , ' says shackleford
getting thrifty : fur coats and bling showcased in the mime of macklemore 's ' thrift shop ' painting the town : face paint featured as key costume in gotye 's ' somebody that i used to know ' going ghetto : gangster moves and flipped up hoods for dr.dre and snoop dogg 's ' the next episode ' as for the car setting itself , while the girls plan to continue jamming it out in the suzuki , they admit there are restrictions
' the very first take we did of the elvis song , there 's a bit where we do a canon with our face down and i completely head - butted the steering wheel
lana just cracked up laughing and did n't ask if i 'm okay , guess that sums up our friendship completely , ' says shackleford
when asked what the girls hope the audience will take away from their latest clip , shackleford says as long as they laugh out loud at some point she 'll be happy
but a good reminisce is also great too
next up for the girls after the release of new clip ' mime in time ' that 's out today is a trip to la for two weeks to line up a series of interviews in which they hope lands them a partner with a hope to start their own comedy show
we also hear new modes of transport will be included in part two of the sketchshe skits and there may even be a blooper reel on it 's way ... stay tuned
