two kittens have been saved ( right ) after they were covered in yellow paint ( left ) and abandoned in a cardboard box at the side of the road in china she said : ' when i opened it up i saw the two kittens inside covered in sticky yellow paint
' it had almost dried and their legs were stuck together , they were stuck together , and even their eyes had been closed by the paint
' they were really in a pitiful state so i picked the box up and took them home where i tried to clean off some of the paint
' but the 27 - year - old was unable to remove the paint and took the animals to a vet who had to cut off their fur
the sticky paint had dried and stuck the kittens ' legs together , as well as matting their fur and covering their eyes a vet painstakingly cut the paint - covered fur off both the kittens , which took several hours
they were then wrapped in tiny blankets a spokesman for the peta ( peta ) said : ' slapping paint on animals is terribly cruel and could cause allergic reactions , blood poisoning and other life - threatening complications , including suffocation
' unfortunately , this type of abuse is legal in china , where there are no penalties for abusing animals
' peta asia regularly communicates with municipal governments in china in an effort to implement better animal welfare legislation , including dispelling myths about rabies and assisting with other animal control issues
' miss yue you meng added : ' the kittens are better now and can walk around and do not seem to have suffered any permanent damage to their eyes or ears
' but they still look really poorly because they had so much fur cut - off
yue you meng , from guangzhou , took the kittens back to her home in a cardboard box and they are now recovering the 27 - year - old said : ' they are better now and can walk around and do not seem to have suffered any permanent damage to their eyes or ears
but they still look really poorly because they had so much fur cut - off ' ' they are very resilient and despite the bad start in life they are already starting to play around with each other like ordinary kittens
' it is unclear whether the kittens were accidentally covered in paint and abandoned or deliberately targeted before being dumped
police are not investigating .
