' i 'm really pleased with the way they managed the final
' the win was fiji 's third in four years in the hong kong sevens , and a record - extending 13th in the tournament it prizes above all others
fiji 's third win from six tournaments in the sevens world series also lifted it above new zealand into second place , two points behind leader south africa , and in position to win a first series in nine years
new zealand , also defending the series title , was one point behind
