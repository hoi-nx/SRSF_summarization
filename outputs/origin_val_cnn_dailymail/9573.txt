for all those fascinated by the colourful world beneath the sea , but who ca n't afford to visit the far reaches of the globe , london 's natural history museum is here to help
beginning march 27 , and running through september 13 , underwater enthusiasts will be able to get up close and personal with some spectacular seascapes - without ever having to don a wetsuit
the exhibit , coral reefs : secret cities of the sea , will feature a live coral reef , a 360 - degree immersive virtual dive experience and specimens of over 200 types of coral , fish and fossils , some of which have never been seen before
but they offer many more benefits than simply being beautiful
the reefs also home to ample fishing , tourism and even storm protection opportunities , and are estimated to be worth more than Â£ 200 billion each year
dr ken johnson , coral reef researcher at the natural history museum , said : ' coral reefs are not simply beautiful environments
they provide food , income and storm protection for many millions of people around the world
' the exhibition will feature a live coral reef and hundreds of specimens of animals and fossils best of all ? guests will be able to experience a 360 - degree immersive virtual dive in the museum 's gallery ' the museum has an exceptional collection of corals from ancient and modern reefs that we have been studying , to understand how these animals , and the diverse habitats they create , have responded to changes in the ocean , ' he continued
' climate change , pollution and overfishing have had a major effect
' a quarter of coral reefs around the world are sadly damaged beyond repair and many more are still under serious threat
' in partnership with catlin seaview survey , stunning footage has been captured from around the world filmed with specially - designed cameras , the images have been stitched together for a panoramic experience the ' google street view ' footage from the sea was filmed everywhere from australia to indonesia thankfully , new technology , like that used by catlin seaview survey , a project that monitors coral reef health , provides scientists and sea lovers alike with more insight than ever
think ' google street view ' but for the sea , the virtual dive footage will take over the natural history museum 's gallery space for its must - see debut , exploring different reefs around the world
from australia 's famed great barrier reef to the breathtaking tubbataha reef in the philippines and komodo island national park in indonesia , the videos were captured by catlin divers on specially - designed cameras that record images every three to six seconds
stitched together , the images create a stunning panoramic view
sound and light effects will also be used to further replicate the feeling of being underwater for visitors
sound and light effects will also be used to really help guests feel fully immersed in the undersea views the museum hopes that the breathtaking exhibit will leave guests feeling ' surprised , amazed and emotional ' felicity paynter , the curator of the exhibition , told the sunday telegraph that she hoped guests would leave feeling ' surprised , amazed and emotional
' ' i had to think about what visitors might already know , what they do n't know and what questions we might be able to answer for them
' on the one hand , there are lots of very cool , weird and wonderful creatures that live on coral reefs , but there are also some really difficult and abstract concepts
