chelsea are 110 years old : and they look every day of it , battling towards a third premier league title under jose mourinho

yet it is hard , hard going , for a team that once seemed so assured

matic deserved to be penalised for his foul on mane despite chelsea 's protests
the home side could have also been awarded a penalty during the first half when ivanovic was fouled inside the area
jose mourinho will be weighing up his options ahead of the interval
both fabregas and oscar have failed to make any real impact on today 's game so far
ramires , who failed to impress in midweek , and cuadrado are both viable options from the bench

the premier league 's meanest defence will have to find a way of keeping diego costa quiet

brazilian playmaker willian has looked extremely lively during the early exchanges
he has popped up on the right and through the middles to cause southampton 's defence problems
the likes of willian , oscar and hazard have shown some neat early touches
willian just ran through the middle before laying the ball onto azpilicueta however his shot went over the bar
