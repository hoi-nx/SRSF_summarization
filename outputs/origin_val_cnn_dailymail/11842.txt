an old crowd favorite at timberwolves ' basketball games known famously as ' jiggly boy ' made a special comeback to celebrate garnett 's return to the team
and he brought his moves
when the target center stadium 's jumbotron first caught sweeney in the audience , he only gave the camera a couple of quick waves
it was a far cry from the beloved jiggly boy of the 2003 - 04 season , when sweeney was known to strip off his jersey and rip off his tank top and get down , with ' wolves ' scribbled on his stomach and ' kg ' for garnett written on his arm
what about jiggly ? ' the crowd went wild the minute sweeney appeared on screen during the february 25 game against the washington wizards , with many instantly recognizing him despite the years that had passed
and the camera soon panned back to the 49 - year - old dad , the announcer asking ' wait a second , can we go back there ? ' one of sweeney 's sons tries to grab his dad 's arm and pull him up to dance , and the camera held on him - an invitation and a tempt
but sweeney shook his head no and encouraged his sons to dance instead
the crowd went wild the minute sweeney appeared on screen during the february 25 game against the washington wizards , instantly recognizing him despite the years that had passed as usher 's yeah comes on sweeney breaks out into dance , his sons flanking behind like backup dancers after a couple of dips , sweeney takes of his shirt to reveal kg written on his stomach , and ' welcome home ' written on his chest the camera panned away again but the announcer was n't ready to give up
' let 's give it one more try , ' he told the audience , who would n't get enough
as usher 's yeah cames on , sweeney finally relented
his sons pulled him out to the stadium 's stairwell , where he still seemed hesitant
but then all of a sudden , sweeney broke out into his famous moves , his sons flanking him from behind like backup dancers
after a couple of dips , sweeney took off his shirt to reveal kg written on his stomach , and ' welcome home ' written on his chest
then he gave the audience what they really want to see : body rolls
and garnett did n't miss the show , giving sweeney a salute
when sweeney responded with an enthusiastic thumbs up , the basketball player tapped his heart to show his appreciation and gratitude
garnett did n't miss the show
he first gives sweeney a salute
when sweeney responds with an enthusiastic thumbs up , the basketball player taps his heart to show his appreciation and gratitude ' i think if you saw a fat guy with everything off , dancing with your name on his chest , i think you would pay attention to that , or at least for five seconds , ' garnett said ' i think if you saw a fat guy with everything off , dancing with your name on his chest , i think you would pay attention to that , or at least for five seconds , ' garnett later told the star tribune
it was the timberwolves ' game operations that asked sweeney for a comeback
sweeney told the star tribune he got a text days before the welcome home game that said : ' kg is coming back
what about jiggly ? ' but although sweeney , an improv comedian , may not be stage shy , after 10 years he said he now also has to consider his two sons , aged nine and 11
' we had a good philosophical discussion on the car ride home , ' he said
' about when it 's appropriate to take your shirt off
