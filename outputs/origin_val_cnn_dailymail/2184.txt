robert montagu , son of the 10th earl of sandwich , suffered years of abuse by his father
speaking at a literary festival in oxford , he said ' noteworthy families ' often feel entitled to abuse people in a report for the times , he said : ' people from noteworthy families do feel a sense of entitlement
' it is true that people from an entitled background have more opportunities , maybe circumstances have made it more likely that they will abuse
' we used to have this ethos that you just kept quiet about things in your life
at school you were taught the stiff upper lip
thank goodness we got rid of that lip
' mr robert montagu was abused by his father ( pictured ) from the age of seven to 11 , including a single instance of rape mr robert montagu has talked in the past about how a loving relationship with his father turned to abuse when he was aged seven
it began after his mother , rosemary peto , goddaughter of queen maud of norway , left the family home , and he believes his father used it as a way to cope with the loss
he wrote about being groomed by his father , as hugs and tickles gave way to kisses , which in turn gave way to serial and serious abuse
in a previous interview , he said : â it was what we did every day
it was accepted that i would always go to his room at half past seven in the morning until quarter to nine
â i felt i was fulfilling a function of my mother who was missing
it was my duty , to some extent , to be in the position i was in and that is the reason i did not resist
' that feeling was hinted at by my father , by sometimes making comments comparing me to my mother
' he never said it in outright terms â we never discussed what he was doing in any terms whatsoever â but it was implicit that i was helping him emotionally
' at the time of the book 's publication , in september last year , he said it would likely sour relations between himself and his elder brother john , the 11th earl , who is also a peer in the house of lords
speaking now , he says his family are ' cross and unhappy ' with his book , and that he is given dark looks at family events , and hug which are then turned into pushes
however , he has repeatedly stated that he felt the story needed to be told , after he revealed the abuse to his mother and family doctor as a young boy , only for it to be swept under the rug
mr robert montagu has previously told how , every morning , he would be called to his father 's room at the family home at mapperton , in dorset ( pictured ) , and would stay there from 7.30 until 8.45am he said that following his confession he expected his father to be taken to jail , but nothing was done , and mr robert montagu was even returned to his care , though the abuse stopped
mr robert montagu says there were other victims , beside himself , and that he has personally spoken to ten of them - though believes there could be another ten he has yet to identify
asked why there was such a reluctance for her father 's story to be told , his daughter fiamma said : ' in our case it has been because of the establishment
everybody has a vested interest in getting him to shut up .
