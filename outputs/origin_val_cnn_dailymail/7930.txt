i can remember so clearly visiting the hospital to see kell brook the day after that horrific knife attack in tenerife
as soon as i walked in i looked into his eyes and i knew exactly what he was thinking - is it all over ? the wound was horrific , some 38 staples virtually holding his thigh together
i could nât believe it , only weeks before we had been celebrating the biggest moment of his career when he dethroned welterweight sensation shawn porter in his back yard to capture the ibf welterweight title
suddenly we are sitting there waiting to find out if he would ever be able to enter a ring again
the doctor âs analysis was nât great - she said with the right rehab there was a decent chance he could fight again but he would not be able to perform in the same way in and out of the ring
she could nât have been more wrong
kell brook performs at a media workout ahead of the first defence of his world title against jo jo dan brook at home shortly after he was stabbed ( left ) and showing his scar ( right ) on the week of his fight over the last few months kell brook has shown the heart of a lion
no one really gets to see the struggle he went through - dressing the wound , struggling to walk at first , the endless hours of rehab and massage and this is all before the camp got underway
what we have now , just days away from the first defence of his ibf welterweight title is an elite level fighter , someone who i believe can go on and unify the 147lb division and someone who is in devastating form , ready to make a statement to the world in front of his home fans
saturday in sheffield is going to be an emotional night
no one has taken jo jo dan for granted - he has earned the right to challenge kell brook as the no 1 and mandatory challenger - a position kell brook was in not so long ago
he is confident and full of hope to become world champion but he has a wounded lion in front of him who is ready to bite
it will be an awkward fight
jo jo dan is a southpaw who comes on strong late in fights
another challenge for kell brook will be handling the emotions of the situation in front of 10,000 people
but i believe in kell brook
i think he has to impose himself early and i suspect he âll produce a devastating performance with a stoppage somewhere in the middle rounds
jo jo dan has earned his shot at brook after becoming the mandatory challenger for his ibf world title there are some huge plans ahead for kell brook but for now it âs all about saturday
live on sky sports and live on showtime in the us - finally he gets his chance to get his big homecoming
it âs going to be some night

people ask me about aj and how he is recovering after the stress fracture in his back
i watched him sparring in a three - hour session last week and he is looking devastating
i left that day feeling more convinced than ever that this guy is going to be the world heavyweight champion
he will fight first on april 4 in newcastle and i will make an announcement on his opponent in the coming days
i will meet barry mcguigan and carl frampton âs team in london today as we work towards making the fight everyone wants to see between carl frampton and scott quigg
two world champions from britain in the same division â they simply have to fight
i have submitted my proposal to them and am waiting to hear what they have from their side
i feel we need to make progress now
the hope is for a summer fight , possibly on june 20
but all dates , venues and purse splits ca nât be decided until we know where we are going with the broadcaster
i think we need to reach some kind of agreement soon , probably the next two or three weeks , if we are to get this fight on in the summer
it really is the fight people want to see
carl frampton ( left ) and scott quigg look set to unify their super-bantamweight world titles this summer i should know in the next 24 hours what date james degale will fight andre dirrell for the ibf super-middleweight world title vacated by carl froch
contrary to rumours stateside , it will most likely be in mid to late may on the us east coast .
