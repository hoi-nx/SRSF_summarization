keith allison of smithville , ohio , has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was fired by green local school district ' because he opposed dairy farming , on his personal facebook page , on his own time ' along with the photos , allison - who is a vegan â had also posted a message voicing his support for animals rights
' as someone who grew up feeling parental love and support , and now as a parent who gives love and support , i reject the claim that separating babies from loving mothers to raise them isolated in boxes can ever be considered humane , ' he wrote on the post
allison was told by his superintendent that the family that owns this farm had called and complained about it and said they were upset and frightened by the post
' the fact that their family 's farm was in the picture , i guess , is where their complaint was coming from and from what i was told , they were fearful , afraid that someone might come and break their calf crates or free their cows and their children were not safe to be out in their yards , ' he told fox 8
' during the meeting with my superintendent , i was informed we live in a large agricultural area , which is true , and that a lot of our money for the schools comes through residents of the community and that i needed to be very careful of what i put on ( facebook ) because i might offend the community and the economic interests of the community , ' said allison
according to a lawsuit , school administrators told him he his contract would n't be renewed because of photos he had posted online showing baby calves in small crates ( stock photo ) ' i was also told that i could have any personal beliefs i want to have , but if i want to be a strong vegan advocate , i might want to look into doing something other than teaching
' the lawsuit says the board of education of green local school district has a policy that teachers can not speak about issues if members of the community disagree with their views
allison and the american civil liberties union , which filed the lawsuit on his behalf , say the policy is unconstitutional and are suing the district to remove it
they are also asking for back pay and damages and to reinstate him into his old position , even though he was hired at a middle school in the district in january .
