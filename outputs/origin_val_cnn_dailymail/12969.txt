for the second time in his career , madison , wisconsin , police officer matt kenny is being investigated for using lethal force
but the cases and their circumstances are different , very different
friday 's death of robinson , an unarmed biracial 19 - year - old , has made madison the latest epicenter of protests of black males killed by white officers
eight years ago , it was a different story
matt kenny shot and killed a man who pointed a pellet gun at him
he was exonerated of any wrongdoing and received a commendation
the dead man was white
it started as a 911 call
the caller reported a man with a gun on his front porch
what the dispatcher did n't know was the man that ronald brandon was talking about was himself
three officers rushed to the scene , including matt kenny
they knew they were facing a potentially life - threatening situation
they were unaware that ronald brandon 's ex-wife , susan , was also calling 911
" my ex-husband is sitting outside and i think he just called 911 , " she said
" he 's got a pellet gun ... he 's drunk
" as she talked to the dispatcher , the squad cars arrived outside
" i think he called you because he wants to end his drunkenness , " ronald brandon said
" i hear the sirens coming
it 's not a real gun
i think he wants to be taken away
" the officers never learned that the weapon ronald brandon pointed at them was a pellet gun
the call with that information came 40 seconds before they arrived
investigators ruled the shooting a " suicide by cop
" for his handling of the incident , matt kenny was awarded the medal of valor , the department 's highest honor
last week 's shooting has n't earned commendations
it 's polarized a community
because robinson did not have a weapon , his death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police : michael brown in ferguson , missouri
eric garner in staten island , new york
over the weekend , protesters filled streets in madison
on monday , demonstrators packed the wisconsin state capitol
they chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message : " black lives matter
" the incident started friday night when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars , madison police chief koval said
when matt kenny went to the apartment where the report came from , he heard some commotion and forced his way in , koval said
" once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer , " koval said
after that , according to the chief , " the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject
" matt kenny has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation
" it 's a stressful period for him and his family , but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation , " said palmer , executive director of the wisconsin professional police association
under wisconsin law , officer - involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency , in this case the division of criminal investigation
once the division completes its investigation , the report will go to the local district attorney , koval said
palmer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation , but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer
" the real fear for any officer when he 's being attacked , generally speaking , is that their weapon will be taken away , " palmer said , " and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly
" concern is a word often used by the police chief as the investigation continues
matt kenny , 45 , is a 12 - year veteran of the madison police department
koval calls him " a very conscientious dedicated public servant , " but acknowledges that a second shooting in eight - year 's time is , well , concerning
" any loss of life is very tragic , " the chief said
" twice is concerning for anyone
we are concerned for him and the community
" and the community is looking for its concerns to be addressed
