archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool in oregon that suggests humans occupied the western u.s. earlier than thought
the agate tool was uncovered under a thick layer of volcanic ash dating back to the eruption of mount st helens 15,800 years ago
scientists believe the primitive knife , discovered 12ft ( 3.6 metres ) below ground , was used for cutting animal hides , butchering meat , and carving wood by pre-clovis people
archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool in oregon that suggests humans occupied the western u.s. earlier than thought
the agate tool was uncovered under a thick layer of volcanic ash dating back to the eruption of mount st helens 15,800 years ago the find , at rimrock draw rockshelter , was announced today by the u.s. bureau of land management , which controls the land on which the site was found
archaeologist thomas said that if the age of the area holds up to scrutiny , it would be the oldest pre-clovis find west of the rockies
it would also be older than another predating the so - called clovis culture , once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from asia into north america
the earliest clovis artifacts , known for distinctive and elegant stone points , are dated to about 13,000 years ago
professor o'grady from oregon university called the find ' tantalising
' the find , at rimrock draw rockshelter , was announced today by the u.s. bureau of land management , which controls the land on which the site was found
archaeologist thomas said that if the age of the area holds up to scrutiny , it would be the oldest west of the rockies but he added that they want to continue digging this summer to see whether the volcanic ash covers the entire area
grayson , professor of archaeology at the university of washington , said the scientific community would be skeptical
two pre-clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists
one is paisley cave , located about 60 miles southwest of the rimrock site
the other is monte verde in chile
both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest clovis sites
if the date of rimrock holds up , it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier , at the end of the pleistocene era , when mastodons , mammoths , camels , horses and bison roamed the area
much of discoveries at these sites indicate the people were involved in hunting , gathering and fishing , for which they used bone tools
some sites suggest that pre-clovis people sometimes lived in hut clusters
many were situated along the coastline , suggesting a marine lifestyle
many archaeologists favour the theory that they came over the bering strait crossing from northeastern asia
' no one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer , that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up , and until it is published in a convincing way , ' he said
' until then , extreme skepticism is all they are going to get
' two pre-clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists , grayson said
one is paisley cave , located about 60 miles southwest of the rimrock site
the other is monte verde in chile
both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest clovis sites
if the date of rimrock holds up , it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier , at the end of the pleistocene era , when mastodons , mammoths , camels , horses and bison roamed the area
the find has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication , but it has been reported in newsletters and at conferences
thomas found the site several years ago , while taking a break from carrying supplies to a session of the university of oregon archaeological field school nearby that o'grady was overseeing
he said he noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow , with some very tall sage brush growing in front of it , indicating very deep sediment deposits
rimrock draw rockshelter is located near oregon in harney county in southeast oregon
if the date of rimrock holds up , it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier , at the end of the pleistocene era , when mastodons , mammoths , camels , horses and bison roamed the area the soil was black in front of the rock , indicating someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time
an ancient streambed ran by , which would have given people more reason to stay there
and on the surface , he found a stone point of the stemmed type , found at sites both older and younger than clovis
similar points have been found at paisley cave volunteers looking around the surface found some 30 stemmed points , and the field school started excavations in 2011 , o'grady said
uncovered above and below the volcanic ash layer were fragments of teeth believed to be from ancient camels
tests by archaeological investigations northwest of portland on blood residue on the agate scraper were consistent with the bovid family of animals , thomas said
the most likely bovine animal living in oregon at that time would have been an ancestor of the buffalo .
