no - one will linger long over this
at some point on thursday morning it will be gone , expunged from the memory , all thoughts turning to a significant european championship qualifier with gibraltar on sunday
for both nations this was what it was
an improving northern ireland have their own qualifier against finland and , like the scottish , had an eye on the bigger prize
the 85th - minute corner from debutant ritchie which placed the ball onto the head of goalscoring substitute christophe berra salvaged the night from irrelevance
christophe berra gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for scotland christophe berra celebrates his late goal , which was one of the few memorable moments in a game lacking intensity or quality the ipswich centre back celebrates with his team - mates after securing the win five minutes from time steven fletcher gets a shot away , one of few clear cut chances created by either team , but was unable to put his team ahead the sunderland striker is denied again by mcgovern as he goes through one on one to try and break the deadlock scotland : craig gordon ( mcgregor 45 mins ) , steven whittaker ( russell 78 ) , greer , martin ( christophe berra 45 ) , forsyth , james mcarthur ( james morrison 63 ) , darren fletcher , ritchie , maloney ( naismith 45 ) , steven fletcher ( jordan rhodes 63 ) , anya
subs not used : brown , may , robertson , hutton , bannan , reynolds , , forrest , marshall
goal : christophe berra 85 northern ireland : mcgovern , danny lafferty , jonny evans ( mccullough 81 ) , baird 9hodson58 ) , dallas , reeves ( ryan mclaughlin 70 ) , mcnair , hughes , norwood ( steven davis 69 ) , magennis ( mckay 75 ) , grigg ( paddy mccourt 58 )
subs : mannus , conor mclaughlin , kyle lafferty , brunt , ward , cathcart
referee : martin atkinson ( english ) a captain âs performance from darren fletcher was also worthy of note
throw in some decent runs and crosses from derby left back forsyth in his first start and strachan will take value from this
with ikechi anya , the enigmatic watford winger who tried his utmost to enliven a comatose friendly , there was evidence of a promising new line of attack
yet the truth is this
it was no night for snap judgments
strachan fiddled with his resources , never really fielding anything resembling his strongest first 11
at times this was a stark reminder of why the home international championships are now a distant , mothballed relic
â i thought it was important to win this game , â said the scotland boss
â just to make us feel good about ourselves
the performance was good at times
we got used to the pitch as well - which is a bit slick
northern ireland have improved immensely over the last year , beating hungary and greece
â they never threatened a repeat
their boss oâneill , an old face on the scottish scene , said : â for us i thought there were more positive than negatives
but we did nât get enough good balls in the box
we left a lot of our first - choice players out , seven or eight of our players that will probably start on sunday [ against finland ]
â christophe berra âs breakthrough came in his first appearance for his country since november 2013
it came late , as people crept towards the exits , resigning themselves to a mediocre scoreless draw
the ipswich defender âs header from the penalty spot crept through a ruck of bodies and into the net via the inside of the post
northern ireland 's stuart dallas carries the ball away from maloney as both sides warmed up for competitive football scotland captain darren fletcher issues instructions from his position in front of the back four ikechi anya ( right ) , who was one of scotland 's livelier players , takes on manchester united defender mcnair on the wing it was a reward scotland just about deserved
they had given it a go in the opening half , but looked to have run out of ideas after a raft of substitutions
thank goodness for anya , a cult figure amongst the tartan army , who brings an energy and industry to his work
even on nights like this
nights when , bluntly , others ca nât quite find their game
reared a mile or so from hampden park his endeavour and tempo kept things interesting when an unspecified crowd estimated at less than 30,000 allowed their minds to drift towards the latest plot on coronation street
anya was at the heart of the first major chance in just four minutes , scurrying down the left flank and playing a one - two with forsyth
a sharp cut - back was turned towards goal at the second attempt , northern ireland keeper mcgovern â also hamilton âs keeper â producing a terrific save to push the ball over the bar
the early touch gave the keeper confidence
he would need it as anya embarked on a one - man war of attrition
the little winger , whose goal in germany last september has already become an iconic moment , was hellbent on adding to his tally
he smashed a low right - foot shot from 20 yards in nine minutes
scuttled forward and hit one wide with his right in 20
then wasted a great chance after james mcarthur nicked the ball off the toe of chris baird and teed him up two minutes later , thumping past the post again
dallas goes up for a header against steven whittaker as the two sides attempted to stamp their authority on the friendly fixture bournemouth star ritchie , who made his debut in wednesday night 's game , controls the ball in midfield it took half an hour for another scotland player to have a crack on goal , steven fletcher âs low shot from 18 yards taken comfortably by mcgovern
five years have passed since steven fletcher , sunderland âs Â£ 14million man , last scored for his country
the only strike in 19 appearances for a player people screamed for during the infamous craig levein spat
no - one remembers the goal â in a 2 - 1 world cup qualifying win over iceland in april 2009
instead they remember barry ferguson âs v - sign to photographers or goalkeeper mcgregor âs smirk in the aftermath of the infamous boozegate episode
a steven fletcher goal celebration in a scotland shirt is now a solitary event
he had another chance to change that before half - time , making the run to take a maloney pass and trying to dink a shot over mcgovern
to his credit the irish keeper â an old hand around these parts â would not be beaten
steven fletcher lasted an hour before accepting that this , once more , would not be his night for a goal
manchester united 's jonny evans ( left ) , the northern ireland captain , holds off steven whittaker as the ball goes past mcgovern gets up well to punch away , under pressure from scotland striker steven fletcher , as mcnair watches on the substitutions are a necessary nuisance in these games
keen to try as many players out as possible before sunday , strachan made plenty
naismith and , critically , christophe berra joined mcgregor as half - time replacements , the hull city no1 replacing celtic âs craig gordon
on the hour mark , james morrison and jordan rhodes â steven fletcher âs replacement - were also handed a half hour to turn things around
for northern ireland , the arrival of the mercurial paddy mccourt - scorer of extraordinary goals for celtic - and former rangers skipper steven davis also raised interest levels
for ritchie , it was a tentative , but promising debut
he ran around a lot and showed sharpness , and almost made the decisive impact in 69 minutes â taking a neat lay off from naismith and thrashing a long - range shot a couple of yards wide
with the best assist record in english football , he also takes a decent corner
a swirling inswinging ball picked out naismith for a firm header which hit the target , but failed to seriously trouble the confident figure of mcgovern
ritchie had better luck with his delivery from a corner five minutes from time when christophe berra claimed his third goal for scotland
and just when northern ireland boss oâneill thought his young , inexperienced side had come through the game unscathed
against a gibraltar team who have shipped 21 goals in four qualifiers , oâneill expects scotland to do likewise
â there is a lot more depth in the scotland squad at this moment in time , â he said
â they moved the ball well and looked strong and powerful
anya , in the first 15 or 20 minutes , caused us problems
i do nât anticipate gibraltar will give you too many problems
â in that regard he probably spoke for a nation
anya and mcnair battle for the ball in a game that had plenty of endeavour without much quality from either side the teams observed a minute 's applause for the late dave mackay before the game at hampden park
