repeated use of some types of antibiotic may raise the risk of developing type 2 diabetes , warn researchers
findings from a new us study underline the need to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions , it is claimed
more than 3 million britons are diagnosed with diabetes and nine out of ten have type 2 which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar
researchers looked at the number of antibiotic prescriptions given to 200,000 diabetics a year before they were diagnosed , and found those given at least two courses had a higher chance of getting the condition type 2 is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese , leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet
researchers from the departments of gastroenterology and medical oncology at the university of pennsylvania carried out the investigation
they looked at the number of antibiotic prescriptions given to more than 200,000 diabetics in the britons at least one year before they were diagnosed with the disease , and compared this to the number given to 800,000 non-diabetic patients of the same age and sex
they found that patients prescribed at least two courses of penicillins , cephalosporines , quinolones and macrolides were at higher risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
the risk increased with the number of antibiotic courses prescribed , says a report in the european journal of endocrinology ( must credit )
more than 3million britons have diabetes and nine out of ten have type 2 which occurs when the body loses the ability to process blood sugar patients prescribed 2 - 5 courses of penicillins â used for a variety of infections - increased their risk of diabetes by 8 per cent
the risk increased by 23 per cent for those having more than five courses of penicillins
patients having 2 - 5 courses of quinolones , used in respiratory and urinary tract infections , had an increased diabetes risk of 15 per cent , which rose 37 per cent for those having more than five courses
the risk was calculated after adjusting for other risk factors such as obesity , smoking history , heart disease and history of infections
study leader dr boursi said â gut bacteria have been suggested to influence the mechanisms behind obesity , insulin resistance and diabetes in both animal and human models
â previous studies have shown that antibiotics can alter the digestive ecosystem
â senior author dr yu - xiao yang added : â while our study does not show cause and effect , we think changing levels and diversity of gut bacteria could explain the link between antibiotics and diabetes risk
â there was no increase in risk associated with use of antivirals or anti-fungal medications and the study found little evidence of a link between antibiotic use and the risk of type 1 diabetes
dr boursi said â over-prescription of antibiotics is already a problem around the world as bacteria become increasingly resistant to their effects
â our findings are important , not only for understanding how diabetes may develop , but as a warning to reduce unnecessary antibiotic treatments that might do more harm than good
â prof jodi lindsay , professor of microbial pathogenesis , st george âs , university of london , said â patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing infections , and therefore they are more likely to be prescribed antibiotics to treat those infections
â in the year prior to diabetes diagnosis , patients may show some signs of disease and may also have a higher risk of infection , and therefore receive more antibiotics
â this is a very large and helpful study linking diabetes with antibiotic consumption in the britons public , but at this stage we do nât know which is the chicken and which is the egg
â the idea that antibiotics might contribute to diabetes development might be important and more research needs to be done
