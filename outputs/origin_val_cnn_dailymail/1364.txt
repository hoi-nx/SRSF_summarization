there is a vulnerable beauty in the fragile yet perfectly formed machinery within our bodies
now , one london - based photographer has captured these structures in a series of captivating - and at times gruesome - images of the animal kingdom
from a fetal monkey to a cat 's uterus during pregnancy , the photographs document historical dissections featured at the london
london - based photographer , frank , has captured stunning images of the anatomy of various creatures
pictured is a fetal monkey ' when you remove the entanglement of surrounding tissue and fat , you are left with something so pure and delicately artistic that is completely different from anything else i have ever seen , ' photographer frank told dailymail.com
each of the specimens is stored in a formalin pot , preserving its intricate structure in incredible detail
' on one hand , especially from the royal veterinary college 's point of view , these images are designed to understand anatomy and with the help of digital imaging they will be now available to a vast audience of students and practitioners , ' said mr frank
' from my perspective , i wanted to create something that is so detached from academia and anchored in art that it will puzzle the viewer

to create the images , the photographer used carefully constructed lighting on the pots to achieve a sense of the fragility of the membrane or tissue within
all pots were photographed with a hasselblad 120mm and 40mp phase one digital back on black background , and lit with three or four bowens strobes
in one day , mr frank would normally photograph between 15 - 20 pots , with on average one day in post-production for each
the collections features images of a cow 's heart , a goat 's testis and a dog foetus , among others
his image of a pregnant uterus of a horse recently won the wellcome image awards 2015
it shows the uterus of a new forest pony , around five months into the pregnancy , with the developing foetus still attached
picture editor of bbc focus magazine , james cutmore , who was a member of the judging panel said : ' the image of the horse 's uterus with the foetus evokes many different emotions at once
it 's fascinating , sad , macabre , almost brutal
' yet the subject is also delicate , detailed and beautiful
the image shows us a large and magnificent creature reduced to this sad , fragile and half - formed creation , which i find very humbling
' one of mr frank 's favourite images is of the injected testis of a goat
' this image grabs my attention because you ca n't tell what it is
it is when science becomes pure art , ' he said ' i do n't see an injected testis ; i can see a satellite image of a river

pictured is a cow âs uterus ' the pot itself obviously posed some limitations and some problems , ' said mr frank
' scratches , diffractions and reflections on one side , dirt suspensions , colour cast through old formaldehyde or air bubbles on the other side
' a large part of the work had to be done in postproduction
