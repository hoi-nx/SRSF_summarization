history has repeated itself at indian wells with the surprise withdrawal of williams from the semifinal due to a knee injury
williams ' withdrawal comes 14 years after her sister venus pulled out minutes before the semifinal in 2001 -- also with a knee injury -- a move which led to a tournament boycott , amid claims of racism , that only ended this year
williams had been due to play romanian halep on friday night , but instead posted news of her withdrawal on instagram
" four months ago i began a journey to play indian wells and it was amazing
i never dreamed i could do it
but i would not have been able to do this without my fans
though it ended early due to injury this year , i have to say i can not wait to try again next year
i love you so much ! " williams posted
back in 2001 , crowds booed a young williams as she took on belgian clijsters in the final of the competition now known as the indian wells
despite being on home soil , spectators backed clijsters in scenes former tennis champion and broadcaster shriver said were difficult to watch
" you would expect the crowd to be so supportive of the u.s. player , so it clearly was the exact opposite
because she was african-american , because she was so young , because she was african-american , predominantly white audience
it was tough , it was tough to listen to , " shriver told cnn 's open court
shriver watched as spectators booed williams 's father richard and sister venus , as they walked down the steps to take their seats for the match
" that 's when we realized this crowd is still really upset by what happened in the semifinals , " shriver said
minutes before the highly - anticipated semifinal between the two sisters , venus pulled out due to a knee injury
her withdrawal seemed to add credence to rumors , which the family denies , that the result of the match had been pre-determined by their father , who kept a tight control on his daughters ' careers
despite the booing , williams beat clijsters to take the title
but the issue did not end there
days later , richard williams gave a press conference and said the booing amounted to racial abuse , bill dwyre , who covered the match for l.a. times told open court
" richard williams had said that the n - word had been used and that the booing was racially motivated
... that was the beginning of williams never coming back
" after 14 years of refusing to play at indian wells , williams , who with her sister has dominated the world rankings for more than a decade , said that she was " following her heart " by deciding to rejoin the tournament
" in order to forgive you have to be able to really let go of everything , " she told reporters at a pre-match news conference
williams said she discussed it with her father in a " really emotional " conversation and he agreed
" he said it would be a big mistake if i did n't go back and i thought that was really admirable , " williams said
before the match , she told reporters that , by returning , she felt like she 'd already won
" i do n't think i need to hold the trophy at the end of it
i feel like i 'm already holding the trophy
i 've never felt that way before , " she said
" just being here is a huge win not only for me but for so many people and it 's a wonderful feeling
" williams ' early exit gives halep a free pass to the final .
