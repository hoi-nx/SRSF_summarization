think back to your high school 's senior prank
maybe you and your pals slipped a pig into the building or greased all the door handles or turned all the chairs upside - down
so it 's no surprise that wichita high school principal padgett was reluctant to play along last week when a student showed up and told him to stand in the hallway holding a bucket
" she did n't say anything about why
she just said ' hold the bucket , ' " the north high school principal told cnn affiliate kwch
" i 'm not going to hold the bucket unless i have a little inkling of why it could be
" good thing he changed his mind
once he did , student after student streamed by , dropping notes of praise and thanks into the bucket
" thank you for making high school the best years of my life , " one said
" you 've made my first year experience in america one that i will always fondly remember , " read another
one student recalled how padgett " helped me get through my eating disorder and helped me get into therapy
" the notes were the idea of senior emily jones
she decided she wanted to do something nice for the principal and cooked up the plan with her mother
" padgett 's an awesome principal , " she said
for padgett , who has been principal at north since 2006 , the experience was priceless
" became a little emotional on some of them , " he said , " i kind of read them and thought , ' man , this is better than a paycheck
this is why i do the things that i do
