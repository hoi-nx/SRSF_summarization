maloney has branded scotland âs crunch end - of - season clash with ireland as â colossal â â and vowed that strachan âs men are capable of leaving dublin with three more crucial points on the road to euro 2016
the goalscoring hero when the two nations met last november at celtic park , maloney believes the pressure will be off the scale when the celtic nations collide for the return at the aviva stadium on june 13
the scots currently lie in third place in group d , one point behind leaders poland , level with world champions germany and two points ahead of the irish
scotland currently lie in third place in group d after saturday 's 6 - 1 victory over gibraltar it has been a hugely encouraging opening five games to the qualifying campaign as scotland aim to reach the nation âs first major finals since the 1998 world cup in france
and maloney insists strachan âs side can grab the win that would all but end ireland âs hopes of reaching france next year if they reprise their form against the irish four months ago
however , he admitted scotland âs 3 - 1 home defeat to england four days later serves as a reminder not to let standards slip
â the ireland game in june is going to be absolutely colossal , â said maloney , who now plays with chicago fire in america âs major league soccer
scotland have enjoyed a hugely encouraging opening five games to the qualifying campaign â the pressure on both sides will just build and build as we get closer
but i think we can go there and win the game
â however , we have to know that we can also lose it if we are not as good as we have been in recent games
â look at our game against ireland in november and the poland away game when we drew 2 - 2
we played well and got results
â but then look at the england match , when we were a little bit off it
the better side defeated us
â so we have to be very aware of why we have got ourselves into this position and what we need to continue doing
â maloney insists scotland âs ability to handle the intense pressure ahead of that first ireland match in glasgow and to emerge with a fine win was a key moment in the development of the team under strachan
maloney was the goalscoring hero when the two nations met last november at celtic park and he warned it will be the turn of the irish in june to see if they can handle the heat of what is now a must - win match for martin oâneill âs side
â the pressure when we played ireland at celtic park was huge , â said maloney , whose two goals in scotland âs 6 - 1 win over gibraltar on sunday leaves him as the highest scorer in strachan âs squad with a total of six
â it was a pressure for a match ( against ireland ) that i had nât felt for a long time
so for the team to cope with that was a pretty big step
â i think we âve made some pretty big steps in the last 18 months
but that was probably as big a one we âve made as a group of players for a while
â the pressure will now be magnified for the irish being at home and it âs a brilliant game to be involved in
â i have learned , though , that they are only brilliant if you win them
they sound great on paper , but they are not that enjoyable when you do nât win
