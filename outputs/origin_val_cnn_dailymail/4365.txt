the uk 's only female giant panda tian tian has been artificially inseminated for a third time after two previous failed attempts
the procedure took place earlier today , before an attempt is made at natural mating with partner yang guang later , edinburgh zoo said
on the two previous occasions keepers have inseminated tian tian she has failed to produce a panda cub
iain valentine from the royal zoological society of scotland , which runs edinburgh zoo , said : ' natural mating will also be attempted today before the short breeding window comes to a close this afternoon
' both pandas remain extremely interested in one another , but as tian tian 's transition to peak was so rapid it was a priority to move straight to artificial insemination first
' throughout yesterday tian tian remained very quiet and sleepy , but by 5pm there was a behavioural shift and the results of hormone tests that came back at 7pm , carried out by the university of edinburgh , confirmed ovulation had occurred
' as each individual panda is different and their pattern can vary from year to year , this is why we start hormone monitoring via urine samples so early and continually observe our female via cctv as the window approaches
' tian tian is doing very well and everything went according to plan
' giant pandas reproduction is a notoriously tricky process , with females only ovulating once a year.the gestation period is typically five months and one or two cubs are usually born tian tian stretches after eating her panda cake in her enclosure : both pandas are said to be extremely interested in one another the panda enclosure will remain closed until sunday
tian tian ( sweetie ) and yang guang ( sunshine ) are the first giant pandas to live in the uk for 17 years
the animals arrived on loan from china in december 2011 and will remain at edinburgh zoo for a decade
there were hopes that a panda cub would be born last year when tian tian became pregnant following insemination
yang guang feeds on bamboo as he bulks up for the breeding season : each individual panda is different and their pattern can vary from year to year which is why producing a cub can be so difficult yang guang stands up as he looks into the enclosure of tian tian
throughout yesterday tian tian remained very quiet and sleepy , but by 5pm she had a behavioural shift which meant ovulation was likely vets who closely monitored her believe she may have reabsorbed the foetus
