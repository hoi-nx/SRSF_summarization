they may have been good enough for legendary actor gary cooper and singing superstar barbra streisand , but it seems their christian names are now no longer cool
it may be unimaginable that you wo nât be able to call friends â gazza â and â barbra streisand â in the future , but according to latest research these once popular names are no longer being used for the next generation
according to ourbabynamer.com the name gary reached peak popularity in 1952 in the us , coming in at number nine on the baby names popularity list where there were 38,000 registered garys
however , in 2013 , only 400 babies were thought good enough to be called gary
legendary actor gary cooper was the flag - bearer for his christian name in the 1950s in another name shocker , nameberry.com revealed that barbra streisand , spelled in the same unique way as global superstar barbra streisand , was also out
barbra streisand made her unusually - spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s , when it peaked at number 511 , only to drop off in the top 1000 in 1971
to make matters worse the conventional spelling of barbara , a top 10 name for three decades , only just gets in the top 1000
so no matter how you spell it the name seems a goner
barbra streisand made her unusually - spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s other names compiled by baby naming website nameberry.com that look on the way out are llewellyn as a boy 's name and claudine for a girl
the popularity of the 2013 coen brothers film inside llewyn davis obviously has not rubbed off on cinema - goers
a common name in welsh , with the distinctive welsh double - l beginning , llewellyn appeared on the us list for six decades
bye bye baby : the girl 's name claudine is another one that has gone out of fashion but despite its rich welsh history , literary cred and quirky nicknames , llewelyn does n't cut it any more
while claudine , the feminisation of the ancient roman name claudius , ranked in the top 1000 for first half of the 20th century , then rose to new heights in 1970 thanks to the popularity of singer claudine longet , only to fall off the charts in 1975
claudine along with most other once - popular - ine and - een - ending girls ' names are now generally out of favour
the once popular welsh boy 's name llewellyn is also out when it comes to babies ' names
