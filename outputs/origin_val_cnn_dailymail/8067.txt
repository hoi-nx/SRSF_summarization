it was a case of â the young man and the sea â after a massive swordfish was caught by a 16 - year - old boy in tasmania that weighed over three times his bodyweight and which took him six hours to get into the boat
the amazing feat was pulled off by teenage fisherman kyle - who weighs just 70kg - when he caught the record - breaking 263.5kg broad - bill swordfish about 35km off tasmania âs east coast
what made the effort even more incredible was that the teenager caught the 263.5kg fish using just 24kg fishing line
it was for this reason it took him so long to reel the huge fish in as he was afraid the line would snap
i was pretty exhausted by then but once the fish was in the boat i just felt massive relief , ' kyle told daily mail australia ' then there was a huge amount of excitement
lots of screaming and celebrating after that , and a team hug
it âs something i âm very proud of
' it 's believed to be the biggest swordfish ever hooked in australian waters by amateurs
it beat the current australian heaviest record catch for using only a 24kg line by 156 kilos , and beat the australian all - tackle record by 88kg
it took kyle ( left ) six hours to get the giant 263.5kg broad - bill swordfish into the boat kyle kept the fish and divided it up amongst his mates who helped him to eat it
normally he uses the ' tag and release ' method when he catches fish , but made an exception this time as it was so big and he was going to eat it with his friends
apart from fishing kyle âs in his first year doing a school - based apprenticeship as an automotive mechanic
' i âve been fishing all my life
it took a lot of concentration â a lot of mental and physical work
i just had to stay focused and not give up
after all that you have to hope you can land it , ' kyle says
â the worst moment was when it got closer to the boat
it âs when things can go start to go wrong and people start to panic
there âs always a lot more pressure as the fish gets closer to the boat
' kyle battled with the huge fish despite feeling mentally and physically exhausted kyle was onboard his friend leo miler âs 7m boat leo miler while competing in the coles bay classic fishing competition last saturday when he made his memorable catch
leo miler explained that kyle had to stay patient and not rush into making any mistakes
' i mean the last three hours of the fight the fish was only 50 metres from the boat swimming around
kyle just had to be careful because the line was so much lighter than the weight of the fish , ' leo miler told daily mail australia
the 16 - year - old was able to catch the massive swordfish using only 24kg fishing line ' it jumped about 23 times to try and get rid of the hook , but we still were nât sure how big it was
it was only when we got it onto the boat that we realised the size of it
' kyle was really physically and mentally finished by the end
he really had to concentrate the whole time and not stop for a moment
' he did tremendously well for a boy of his age to land this kind of a fish
he âs obviously a naturally talented fisherman
