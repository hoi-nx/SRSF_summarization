a 72 - year - old woman created her own ' no parking ' zone outside her home after becoming frustrated with the number of cars being left in front of her driveway
the grandmother , who does not want to be named , said she took action after being repeatedly blocked in by parents on their way to pick up and drop off their children at a nearby school
she paid to have a white line painted on the road in front of her home on culmington road , birmingham , and ' no parking ' written on the pavement
action : the 72 - year - old woman , who does not want to be named , paid to have a white line painted on the road in front of her home on culmington road , birmingham , and ' no parking ' written on the pavement the woman also placed traffic cones on either side of her driveway
parents of pupils at albert bradbeer primary school , which is less than half a mile away , have branded her decision ' ludicrous '
the grandmother - of - five called the police during a dispute last week with a couple who she claims parked in front of her home twice on the same day
she said : ' the couple deliberately came and parked and blocked me in
they have children at the school - two little children - and i went to see who was parking there and blocking me in
' in the afternoon he came back again
i said " you again ? i 'm calling the police "
' she claimed the man started racially abusing her and mimicking the way she talked
she added : ' i had to get the police involved
they told me to put something visible up so people would know there 's no parking
' ' i have lived here 20 years and this is the first time i have had any trouble
' sometimes you overlook things
i do n't mind people parking on the public bit but not parking on my driveway that i paid to make
' parents at the school have branded the woman 's decision ' extreme '
one mother , katey large , who walks her children to school along the road every day , said : ' there have been days when the lady who lives there sits outside in a chair underneath the window and tells people they ca n't park there and she 's gone to extremes now by painting that on the road
' people with drop kerbs do n't want people parking on them but to go to the extreme of painting it yourself is ludicrous
' as if birmingham does n't have enough litter on the streets , we 're are teaching people it 's ok to paint lines on the footpath
' taking a stand : the grandmother - of - five also placed traffic cones on either side of her driveway ' ludicrous ' : parents of nearby albert bradbeer primary school have branded her measures ' extreme ' but she added : ' you quite often see parents in the morning walking up the road and sniggering , but if it was outside their house they would n't be laughing about it
' a spokesman for birmingham city council said : ' she does n't have the right to paint on the road because road markings are subject to traffic laws
' if it 's on her property that 's different but if it 's on the public highway , it 's not allowed
