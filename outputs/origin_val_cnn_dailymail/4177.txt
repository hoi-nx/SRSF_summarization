scott has checked into a luxury rehab center in costa rica
the reality star was pictured jetting off via helicopter to start his stay at the rythmia on monday
in a statement released via the center , he explained : ' i realise my issues are bigger than me and i 'm ready to truly remedy this struggle i continue to battle
' it later emerged that scott first visited the center back in february , but kept that spell in treatment confidential
off to rehab : scott , second right , poses in front of a helicopter escorting him to the rythmia ; he is seen with rlac coo dr jeff mcnairy , jeremy geffen , and rythmia ceo gerard powell luxury stay : the boutique rehab center is located in tropical guanacaste , costa rica , on a private estate only minutes from the beach scott 's latest rehab stay came as it was revealed that he was found shoeless and drunk stumbling around his hotel lobby on sunday morning after a paid appearance at an atlantic city club
the previous evening he had been openly downing shots of tequila before taking the microphone to rant onstage
a hotel source told tmz that the reality star had to be escorted back to his room by a supervisor
the club promoter had already made headlines by cancelling three club appearances while in the uk earlier this month , only letting fans know at the last minute via twitter
scott did not mention his recent troubles in his statement , instead explaining why he chose the center
' while i have been unconvinced in the past of treatment and therapy methods , rythmia 's rehab approach puts my worries at ease , ' he said
' the fact that there is a money back guarantee that has never been called upon gives me even more confidence
i am looking forward to starting my therapy and iboga treatment there
' scott will be treated with the controversial drug ibogaine , which is made from the psychedelic african rainforest shrub iboga
ibogaine reputedly causes hallucinations similar to lsd - it is banned in the u.s. perhaps not the perfect job : despite difficulties controlling his drinking , scott continues to promote clubs ; he is seen on saturday at harrah 's resort in atlantic city - where he was later found wandering shoeless around his hotel lobby and the center even offers ' shaman - supervised flights ' while patients are taking the drug
while not undergoing treatment , scott will certainly not be deprived
the boutique rehab center is located in tropical guanacaste , costa rica , on a private estate only minutes from the beach
according to a press release it ' affords guests a secluded and serene environment with the utmost privacy
' as well as undergoing ' intensive ' rehab the 31 - year - old can also make use of the fitness center , five - star restaurant and full - service spa with mud bath
and indeed scott knows exactly what he is committing to - having secretly visited the center in february
' scott was here last month , ' charles johnston , director of addiction treatment at rythmia told the magazine in touch
and he added : ' it âs just getting him to the place where he âs ready to give up that lifestyle and hopefully that will happen soon

it came after he was hospitalised for alcohol poisoning
the father - of - three 's struggles to control his drinking have been a recurrent theme on the kourtney reality shows , with viewers watching as kourtney tries to support her long - term partner

scott 's mother bonnie disick , 63 , passed away in october 2013 following a lengthy illness
his father , jeffrey , died a few months later in january
' i literally just want to jump out of my skin it 's that bad , ' he said of his anxiety on kaktth , admitting he was taking medication
