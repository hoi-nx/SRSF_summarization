an amazing image showing a collection of stars and nebulae has been released by the eso
in the colourful picture star clusters , emission nebulae and active star - forming regions are seen at a distance of about 4,000 light - years
the image is the most detailed view of this part of the sky , the southern constellation of the altar ( the altar ) , ever taken
scroll down for a video zooming in to the region this image , taken by omegacam on the vlt survey telescope at paranal observatory , shows a section of the ara ob1 stellar association
in the centre of the image is the young open cluster ngc 6193 , and to the right is the emission nebula ngc 6188 , illuminated by the ionising radiation emitted by the brightest nearby stars the image was created using the vlt ( vlt ) at the eso âs ( eso âs ) paranal observatory in chile
at the centre of the image is an open star cluster called ngc 6193 , which contains about 30 bright stars
a nebula , which comes from the latin word for â cloud â , is a region of gas and dust in space
some are the remains of dead stars that have expelled their gas , whereas others are regions where new stars are being formed
they come in a variety of shapes and sizes
there are four main types : planetary nebulae , reflection nebulae , absorption nebulae and emission nebulae
the two brightest are extremely hot and giant stars , which provide illumination for a nearby emission nebula called the rim nebula , or ngc 6188
this includes the extremely bright star hd 150136 , at the centre , which is likely to actually be a pair of stars that are extremely close to each other
the reddish glow comes from giant clouds of hydrogen , which are lit up by the intense ultraviolet light from the cluster of hot young stars in the middle of the picture
they are spread over a region known as the ara ob1 association , which continues outside the limits of this picture - and is a region of similar hot and bright stars that formed at the same time
the blue colouration is scattered light from these stars , while the brown darker features are huge clouds of cosmic dust , which absorb the light
the rim nebula is towards the right - centre of the image , and is the prominent wall of dark and bright clouds that provides a border to an active star - forming region called rcw 108
the nebula is about 300 light - years long and contains young stars that formed as recently as a few million years ago - a blink of an eye in cosmic terms
at the centre of the image is an open star cluster called ngc 6193 , while on the right is the rim nebula

the total exposure time was more than 56 hours
â a great deal of computer work was needed to combine the many individual pictures and make this detailed colour view from them , â a spokesperson for the eso told mailonline
â this is a great image for studying what goes on in star formation regions , and how the young stars interact with their surroundings - and also trigger the next generation of star birth
