the international prototype kilogram shed 0.0001g last century , leading scientists to come up with a more accurate measure of mass it âs a problem that has been weighing on scientists â minds for years â how to redefine and accurately measure the kilogram
currently the unit of measurement is based on a metal cylinder - which should weigh precisely 1,000 grams - that is kept under lock and key in paris
but the cylinder is gradually losing mass , leading german researchers to look for a new formula to create the most accurate definition of a kilo
the international prototype kilogram shed 100 micrograms ( 0.0001g ) last century , which although is around the weight of dust particle , means the official kilogram is becoming slowly less accurate
scientists at the german nation metrology institute ( ptb ) in braunschweig have come up with an ingenious way to create a more exact measure of mass , which involves counting the number of atoms needed to make up a kilogram , instead of relying on a piece of metal
but in order to win the international race to redefine the kilogram , they must perfect the method by developing the world âs roundest sphere
horst bettin , head of the ptb 's kilogram project , said : ' our goal is to have ptb master the realisation of the future kilogram completely anonymously
â after years of research , they have created a method of making incredibly pure circular crystals made from tiny vortices of silicon gas
from incredibly pure silicon , they are able to grow a flawless single - crystal whose inner structure is completely regular and without fractures
the company said : ' both being free of impurities and having a regular structure are preconditions for the success of the experiment
' ' from the round - bodied , cylindrical single - crystals , ptb produces crystal spheres that are rounder than anything else in the world
â scientists at the german nation metrology institute ( ptb ) in braunschweig have come up with an ingenious way to create a more exact measure of mass , but they first need to perfect their technique by counting the atoms in the world 's rounded spheres ( pictured ) the aim is â to produce the connection between the mass of the sphere and the mass of an atom , ' by counting the atoms
physicist peter becker told the local : â we work out the number of atoms in the sphere , weigh the sphere and therefore work out how much an atom weighs
â this mathematical method has enabled the mathematicians to discover the avogadro constant
the company said : ' already at this point , ptb scientists miscount only twice every one hundred million atoms
kilograms of different materials are based on the measurement of the international prototype kilogram ( international prototype kilogram )
â the kilogram is the unit of mass ; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram , â according to bipm ( bipm )
the cylinder , which is meant to weigh exactly a kilogram , has a diameter of 3.9cm
the cylinder , which is meant to weigh exactly a kilogram , has a diameter of 3.9cm
it âs made from an alloy that is 90 per cent platinum and 10 per cent iridium
an illustration of the cyclinder is shown it âs made from an alloy that is 90 per cent platinum and 10 per cent iridium
it âs been looked after in paris by the bipm since 1889 and replacements have been made to maintain its accuracy
the unit of mass is disseminated throughout the world via â official copies â
â with these copies and via further transfer standards , we teach weighing instruments how heavy a kilogram is , â ptb scientists explained
but the official international prototype kilogram has shed 100 micrograms ( 0.0001g ) in the last century , prompting experts to find a more exact way of defining the kilogram
â at worst , the international prototype of the kilogram could be destroyed or stolen all of a sudden [ if an alternative is nât created ]
then the definition would be lost for all time , â the ptb said
â the goal is to miscount only by one atom for every one hundred million atoms
â the method could be used to work out how many atoms are needed to make up a kilogram , but leaves the challenge of counting how many atoms make up an object
in the case of the sphere , it is possible because the 3d shape is composed of a regular crystal lattice
the researchers who created the sphere know the dimensions of the sphere and the individual layers of lattices , so they are able to calculate the number of atoms by dividing the larger dimension by the smaller one
they believe they will have the answer in 2018 .
