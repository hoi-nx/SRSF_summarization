a young boy was in need of a fix that only his local pub could provide
filmed at home in london , the 20 - month - old boy named max stands in front of his mother with tears streaming down his cheeks
he urges her and his father to take him to the local pub - where he usually receives sweets and hot chocolate - instead of the doctor 's surgery
the youngster stands in front of his mother crying , clearly disappointed about having to see the doctor after allowing him to catch his breath , his mother asks him to tell his father â who is presumably the recipient of the recording â why he is crying
choosing to ignore her question , the youngster carries on snivelling , so his mother asks him : â where do you want to go ? â the boy replies with the rather blunt and humorous answer , â pub â , to which his mother retorts : â no , but we have to go to the doctors
â refusing to back down , max continues to suggest the pair go the pub until his mother offers a compromise
when his mother asks max where it is he wants to go he hilariously replies by saying ' pub ' she says : â ok , you know what ? when daddy gets home we will ask him
we will ask him if you can go to the pub later
â please with her response , although not entirely convinced , the youngster immediately reminds his mother to ask
according to max âs father , oliver bath , he normally takes his son out of the house and down to the local pub to give max 's mum some peace and quiet
he said : â i always get a beer and max always gets his hot chocolate
â true to the principles of pavlov âs dog max now associates sweets and hot chocolate with the pub. â my guess as he gets older he 'll feel the same but his choice of chocolate will move to his choice of cask ale
