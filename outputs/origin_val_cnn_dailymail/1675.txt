italian football 's new anti-racism campaign will use the friendly against england in turin on tuesday as the focus of its efforts to change attitudes in a country that has an uncomfortable history of race relations in the game
the italian campaign is being headed by fiona may , the england - born former olympic long - jumper who chose to represent italy after marrying an italian , and she admits she has a tough challenge
may was appointed by the italian fa 's controversial president tavecchio , the 71 - year - old who was banned from all football activities for six months in november after referring to ' eating bananas ' when discussing foreign players
mario balotelli was subjected to racial insults while training with the italian national team in coverciano fiona may ( centre , pictured in turin ) has been tasked with improving race relations within italian football since then , former italy coach sacchi caused a storm in february by saying there were ' too many black players , even in the youth teams ' in italy , while racist abuse of players by extremist fans is relatively commonplace compared to the british - liverpool 's mario balotelli was even subjected to racial insults while training for italy at the italian fa 's ( italy ) training centre in coverciano before the world cup last year
may admits she had to think long and hard before taking on the ' daunting ' task of heading the italian fa 's anti-racism committee in september last year , but has taken heart from the response to the recent launch of a 20 - month campaign
she said : ' i did n't accept it straight away - it was a pretty daunting task , but i do like a challenge and felt it was important to show a bit of courage
' there was nothing existing , we have to start from scratch and the main thrust is to target youngsters , the next generation
' may 's campaign is called ' racists ? ugly race ( ... and we do n't want them in our stadiums ) '
it is holding 20 events in 20 months in 20 different cities across italy , and the second of these takes place in turin on monday ahead of the england game
the first involved more than 2,000 young people in florence , may 's adopted home city
ex-italy boss sacchi , pictured in 1996 , said there 's ' too many black players , even in the youth teams ' the italian media has had a reputation for ignoring racist incidents in its football , but may believes that has changed , shown by the coverage given to the tavecchio and sacchi remarks , as well as the actions of kevin-prince boateng who led his ac milan team - mates off the pitch after being abused in a friendly
even so , sacchi 's comments in particular were hard for may to take
' i was shocked and disappointed - he 's a big name in italy and it did n't exactly help our cause , ' she added
the events around the italy vs england match will mainly target registered players aged between 10 and 18 , and will include educational programmes in regional schools , a talk show targeted at teenagers plus a social media campaign
juventus and torino have both promised one first - team player to take part in the events as well as local politicians in turin
may , who was raised in derby and is still a keen rams fan , admits all those efforts will seem a waste of time if england players are on the receiving end of racist abuse from italian fans on tuesday
she said : ' i ca n't say it 's not going to happen , but i really hope not - and we know fifa and uefa are now watching these matches very , very closely
' may , 45 , who has become a well - known actress after retiring from competition , also hopes italy will learn from british that part of the key to eradicating racist abuse is through legislation - italian anti-racism laws are nowhere near as tough as they are in the british
' the legislation has to change , has to be stronger , ' may said
' but at least we are doing something now and slowly but surely i believe it 's changing
