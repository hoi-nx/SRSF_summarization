a bright red miniature statue of marx given to a britain city to commemorate his 195th birthday has been relegated to a back garden because a conservative - run council does n't want it on display
the four - foot tall , plastic sculpture of the communist revolutionary , was presented to gloucester council by dignitaries from his birthplace of trier , germany - which is twinned with the city
trier made 500 of the statues which were placed across the city , and one was donated to gloucester in order to symbolise marx 's journey across europe , because the cities are twinned
charles yates , a member of gloslinks , which maintains the link between gloucester and twinned trier , has instead given the statue a home in his back garden
he said : ' it needed a home and my wife and i were quite happy to have it here
he is stood in the garden quite happily
' it is the sort of statue that guests will always make a comment about
it deserves to be put somewhere in the city
it deserves a home somewhere in gloucester
' this whole thing started because the germany people asked us what we had done with it
' it is all very well everyone making decisions about the statue but they have n't actually seen it yet

' the statue of the revolutionary trier - born socialist , who wrote the communist manifesto , was donated to gloucester last may
transported to britain on the eurostar , the journey was meant to mimic the way marx drifted across europe
born in trier in 1818 , marx moved to berlin to study law before travelling to paris , where he became a revolutionary communist
expelled from france , marx spent two years in brussels before moving to london , where he was to spend the remainder of his life
despite marx 's significance and political standing , the conservative leader of the council does not believe it should be placed anywhere important
leader of gloucester city council paul james said : ' we value our twinning links so i 'm pleased we 've been able to find somewhere to put trier 's kind gift
' i do n't think it would be appropriate to put it anywhere more prominent unless , perhaps , to warn people of the dangers of voting for ed miliband
' the comment and political stance of the council has sparked fury with local councillors who says it should not be used as a political weapon , whether you agree with his politics or not
labour councillor chris chatterton said : ' i appreciated it 's election time and silly season but you should n't say that
' whether you agree or disagree with marx and engels is up to you
their theories changed the world
to make that kind of comment is misplaced
' the statue should n't be bandied about as a political part
' i think you take it on its merits
just as a point of courtesy when any of us are given a gift you treat it with respect
' through time we have been given some very weird gifts and you may not want to put them on display but you treat it with courtesy
' how many times have we gotten something at christmas that we do n't want but you do n't just throw it away
you treat it with respect
' born in trier in 1818 , marx moved to berlin to study law before travelling to paris , where he became a revolutionary communist and befriended his life long collaborator , engels
the pair co-authored the pamphlet ' the communist manifesto ' which was published in 1848
it theorised that all human history had been based on class struggles
expelled from france , marx spent two years in brussels before moving to london , where he was to spend the remainder of his life
he lived , for a number of years , in poverty supported by the wealthier engels , before he produced his most important body of work , ' das kapital '
the first volume of this ' bible of the working class ' was published in his lifetime , while the remaining volumes were edited by engels after his friend 's death
he died on 14 march 1883 and was buried at highgate cemetery in london
