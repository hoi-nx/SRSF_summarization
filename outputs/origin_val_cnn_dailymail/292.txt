manager symons , who was a coach at fulham in 2010 in that memorable night , was aware of the anniversary
â that âs football , â was all he could summon about their fall , adding : â we had 27 shots altogether , i âm incredibly frustrated
â i thought we were excellent first half , created numerous chances and did n't take them
i âve been in and around football for a long time , often there âs sucker punch if you do n't take chances
â we need three wins to stay up , it âs down to us to go get them
we probably had enough chances to win three games here
â twice the home side âs defence fell apart either side of half - time to allow sam byram and sol bamba to head leeds ahead
fulham went down to 10 men and still managed to outplay their opponents , until substitute mirco antenucci made it three late on
it was inexplicable that fulham were not in front before leeds took the lead , five minutes before the break
ross mccormack and matt smith , facing their former club , raced through early on but could not convert
bryan ruiz almost caught out leeds goalkeeper marco silvestri with a 35 - yard lob , but he tipped over , then hit the crossbar from a corner
but out of nowhere , leeds scored when gaetano berardi crossed for sam byram to head in completely unmarked and by seven minutes into the second half the home team completely capitulated
on 48 minutes leeds went two ahead , an alex mowatt corner bouncing all the way through fulham âs box to allow defender sol bamba to head in at the back post
then left - back stafylidis was sent off for two yellow cards within 45 seconds of each other to end any hope of a comeback
sol bamba doubles the travelling side 's lead as he heads past marcus bettinelli in the fulham goal leeds 's sol bamba celebrates scoring his side 's second goal of the game with teammate billy sharp symons said : â it was ridiculous getting the second so soon after the first
he dived in right in front of the leeds fans for the second
it seemed the ref was moving on , but someone was in his ear then he changed his mind and went for the second yellow
it was rash and petulant
â fulham continued to dominate , despite having a man less , until the 88th minute when mirco antenucci scored with a first - time shot
leeds manager neil redfearn said : â our lot got a bollocking at half time , i thought we were off the pace
we worked it out and toughed it out
it could âve been four or five by the end
