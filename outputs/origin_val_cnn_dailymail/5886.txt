clemens will not have to pay mcnamee a dime after a settlement was reached in the defamation lawsuit that was brought against the former mlb pitcher by his ex-trainer in 2008

the deal will not require the seven - time cy young awards winner to contribute any money or release any claims against mcnamee , attorneys for both men said on wednesday
clemens , who pitched until he was 45 , has denied the charges and told espn mcnamee 's case was an example of ' somebody out there that is really crawling up your back to make a buck

he said : ' at this point it 's water over the dam
' it 's high time
this is old news these days

' i got to go home and have a good meal
