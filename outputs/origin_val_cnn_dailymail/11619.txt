if you 've ever craved the smell of fast food all day long , burger king has come up with the ultimate solution with the launch of a new burger - scented cologne
the cologne will supposedly imitate the signature aroma of the whopper burger , which consists of 100 per cent flame - grilled beef , freshly sliced onions , lettuce and mayonnaise
the scent , which has been named flame-grilled , is set to be launched by burger king japan on 1 april 2015
there will also supposedly be a one day promotion , whereby every customer will receive a free whopper burger with their purchased perfume bottle
it 's apt that the release of the perfume would fall on 1 april ( april fools ' day ) , and many have speculated that the ' launch ' is in fact a global practical joke
while many people are doubtful of the launch 's authenticity , the fast food chain insists that the upcoming release is not a hoax
in fact , this is n't the first time that it 's launched a fragrance
in 2008 , burger king unveiled a men 's spray , dubbed flame-grilled , which was promoted as ' the scent of seduction with a hint of flame - broilled meat '
flame was only available online and in certain stores in new york , and was discontinued shortly after its launch
april fool 's ? while many people think that the cologne is a hoax , the advert insists the authenticity of the cologne and sees it retailing for 5000 yen , which is around Â£ 27
