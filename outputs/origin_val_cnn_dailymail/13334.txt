dollar is hoping a few folks will see fit to bless him
the minister , known for being a prosperity preacher at his atlanta - area dollar , is seeking " 200,000 people committed to sow $ 300 or more ( to ) help achieve our goal to purchase the g650 airplane
" the figures were presented friday in a nearly six - minute video on the creflo dollar ministries website and total more than $ 60 million needed to buy the g650 , which goes for a reported $ 65 million
the page featuring the video and information on the fundraiser has been taken down , but those wishing to donate are still able to do so on the church 's gift page
the project is n't limited to member donations , as the site states that " we are asking members , partners and supporters of this ministry to assist us in acquiring a g650
" the request goes on to detail that the luxury jet will transport pastors creflo and taffi dollar and member of the dollar ' church around the globe to help them spread the gospel
prosperity gospel is a theology that promises wealth and health to those who tithe 10 % of their income to the church
the video includes parishioners , a pilot , a project manager and even the president of liberia , ellen johnson sirleaf , advocating on behalf of the pastor
on the video , the pastor chronicles incidents involving his current jet , which has been in service for more than three decades : the right engine went out en route to australia , but the plane was able to safely land at its destination thanks to the experience of the pilot and crew
during another trip , mechanical failure caused the jet to skid off a runway in london while taffi dollar and their three daughters were aboard
dollar attributed his family 's safe arrival to " a grace working on that airplane , that brought my girls back home to me , you understand what i am saying ? " he said from the pulpit to thunderous applause
dollar said that after those incidents , he " knew that it was time to begin to believe god for a new airplane
" the g650 would comfortably allow the ministry make its way around the world
it seats up to 14 passengers with berthing for six , according to gulfstream.com
the jet comes with two rolls-royce engines , high - speed internet and two multichannel satellites and allows for a four - and - a - half - hour commute from new york to los angeles
" the g650 is the biggest , fastest , most luxurious , longest range and most technologically advanced jet -- by far , " according to the site
in soliciting the donations , dollar 's site states , " we need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the lord jesus christ
your love gift of any amount will be greatly appreciated
" attempts to contact dollar 's ministry for comment were unsuccessful .
