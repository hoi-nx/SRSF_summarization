swarbrick sent off west brom 's mcauley for a challenge actually committed by craig dawson referees ' chief mike riley has called for video technology to be trialled in the wake of that blunder west brom defender craig dawson ( right ) makes the original challenge on wiflried bony just outside the area the ivorian striker heads to the ground under craig dawson 's clumsy challenge but managed to get back up wilfried bony continues but mcauley comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area wilfried bony goes to ground again under mcauley 's challenge , leading to the dismissal of the west brom player bt sport showed the incident from referee swarbrick 's perspective , with no 25 craig dawson the closest to him swarbrick 's blunder is the third case of mistaken identity in a calendar year following roger east 's dismissal of sunderland 's wes brown for bringing down manchester united striker radamel falcao last month and a red card for arsenal 's kieran gibbs , who was sent off by andre marriner when it was alex oxlade-chamberlain who had handled a shot from chelsea 's eden hazard last march
mike riley , general manager of the pgmol ( pgmol ) , acknowledged that now was the time to test replays
' i think football as a whole has to look at how we can enhance refereeing performances through the use of technology , ' he said
' we 've been open - minded to things like the goal - decision system which has made a great difference and a great benefit to referees in the premier league
' we need to see what other technology can be used to get refereeing decisions more accurate
' mike riley , speaking to bbc radio 5 live , added that he had spoken to swarbrick since his gaffe but would not confirm whether he would be selected for the next round of premier league matches
city went on to win the match 3 - 0 as they try to keep their premier league title hopes alive until the final day following mcauley 's dismissal manchester city ensured a miserable week , which included defeats to burnley and a champions league exit in barcelona , ended on a high at a sunny etihad stadium
in a one - sided encounter that often resembled a training ground match of attack versus defence wilfried bony 's first goal for the home side , a neat finish from close range , set them on their way on 27 minutes
a horrendous defensive mix - up allowed fernando to tap in manchester city 's 1,000th premier league goal before the break and david silva deflected substitute stevan jovetic 's low drive home to complete a dark afternoon for the black country visitors
the win , which featured 43 shots , eased some of the pressure on manchester city boss manuel pellegrini amid reports he will be sacked in the summer if his side end the season trophyless
ex-chelsea midfielder lampard , who started the match in place of the injured yaya toure , defended the chilean
' he has been a pleasure to work with and he 's a very good man , ' he said
' he 's a very experienced manager , a very good manager , and i do n't think there is any finger - pointing at any individual for the recent form
' lampard has proved himself to be a readily capable deputy in midfield for the injured yaya toure lampard , who will join sister club new york city fc at the end of the season , admitted tough questions may well be asked in the summer
' judgements will be made at the end of the season and that is fair enough , ' he added
manuel pellegrini himself dismissed claims that chelsea would not surrender their six point lead at the summit
after joking : ' please , no questions about the sack , ' he said ' i do n't think they are a winning machine all the time
' i am sure form now until the end of the season every team will drop points
' you never know what will happen when you have to play for another 24 points
' manchester city boss manuel pellegrini is under pressure to deliver some silverware at the etihad stadium
