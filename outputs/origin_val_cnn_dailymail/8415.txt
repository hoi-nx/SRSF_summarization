this is the first picture of a six - year - old boy whose hand was savagely hacked off by hired assassins who collect albino body parts for witchdoctors to turn into charms and potions for their rich clients
baraka cosmas was attacked on saturday evening by a group of men , who stormed into the home he shared with his parents in western tanzania
the young boy was held down while the gang chopped off his right hand , before beating him and his mother prisca shaaban so badly both have been hospitalised
eighteen - month - old yohana was snatched from his home less than a month ago , while four - year - old pendo was taken at the end of december
yohana 's mutilated body was found a few days later , while pendo has never been seen again
all three cases are linked to a trade in albino body parts , fuelled by the high prices they fetch and a belief in the ' magical ' properties of the skin and limbs , said to bring wealth and luck
the men who viciously attacked baraka cosmas at the weekend are likely to have been little more than petty criminals at worst , carrying out the bidding of a witchdoctor
the witchdoctor will have paid a significant amount for the limb - but who paid the witchdoctor is likely to remain unclear
beale , managing director of standing voice , a charity working to protect tanzania 's albinos , says until these people are rooted out , government efforts to curb the attacks and killings are likely to have little impact
' this most recent tragic attack serves to remind us that current responses from the government , police force and justice system are not sufficient and do not target the heart of this crisis , ' he told mailonline
hidden : many children are now kept in special schools , away from their families and behind protective walls children are being snatched from their beds as gangs of men roam southern malawi hunting as demand for albino body parts fuels a surge in attacks and murders leaving people in fear of their lives , the u.n. has said
the country , which borders tanzania in the west , has seen a horrific rise in the numbers attacked or killed since january
already , there have been six attacks in 2015 - compared to just four over the previous two years
victims have ranged from a year old , to 68 , with children being snatched from their beds as they sleep
and just as in tanzania , it seems the high value of the limbs is driving the trade
an uncle , among three men facing charges in malawi for the kidnapping of an 11 - year - old malawi girl in january , revealed he had been offered $ 6,500 for her body
it equates to 2,778,425 kwacha - a fortune in a country where the minimum wage is 551 a day
the recent surge in attacks has pushed the u.n. to speak out on the issue
' these attacks are often stunningly vicious , with children in particular being targeted , ' said zeid ra'ad al hussein , the u.n. 's high commissioner for human rights
' many people with albinism are living in abject fear
' the u.n. called on regional governments to ensure the criminals behind the attacks are prosecuted
' they are maybe not doing enough to stop it , ' the u.n. 's human rights spokesman rupert colville said
' this is an incredibly vulnerable population in these countries
' and when you hear these kind of details of gangs of men roaming around , literally hunting down people with albinism simply to make money by cutting off their limbs and killing them , you must question whether enough is being done
' ' sadly what we see from the government are measures which react to this crisis in a surface level fashion
' we call for a criminal investigation beyond the hired assailant or witchdoctor , and the gathering of thorough evidence on those involved at higher levels of this absurd trade
' so far , while few kdinappers and witchdoctors have ever been successfully tried for their role in the incidents , not one buyer has ever been prosecuted for their part in the albino trade
however , the government has announced a ban on witchdoctors - and last week , it was announced 32 had been arrested in the geita , the same area where yohana was killed last month
' the witch doctors were arrested in possession of different items , including potions and oil from an unknown source , ' police cheif joseph konyo told reporters - but did n't say whether they had been charged
but mr beale warned targeting all witchdoctors may mean attention is diverted from the real killers
he said : ' we do hope that the government declaration to ban all witchdoctors in the country does not distort the judicial task at hand by indicting individuals practising traditional rituals who may be entirely innocent , yet by default are to be considered killers
' even more dangerous is the idea that this could create a smokescreen of impunity for those who actually fuel the trade by approaching witchdoctors with their demands
' but the tanzania government does seem to addressing the problem - described by president jakaya kikwete as a ' shame ' on the nation
at the same time as the arrests were announced , a court sentenced four men to death for their part in the 2008 murder of 22 - year - old zawadi mangidu
she had died after her legs and right hand were hacked off with an axe and machete after being attacked while eating dinner in her village - also in geita , north - west tanzania
among the condemned was the young woman 's husband , charles nassoro
convictions : four men were sentenced to death last week for their part in the murder of 22 - year - old zawadi mangidu , which came as the tanzania government began a crackdown on the shocking trade feul : but sentencing the men to death will not stop wealthy buyers approaching witchdoctors to make the potions - and offering huge amounts of money to collect the limbs of tanzania 's albinos and nassaro is far from the only family member to be implicated in the attacks and murders of tanzania 's albinos
in each of the three most recent cases , a close family member has been arrested
both baraka cosmas and yohana 's fathers were among the accused , while pendo 's uncle has been implicated
these four cases perhaps point to how strong the lure of the money offered is - and , by default , to the wealth of those purchasing the potions and charms
it is further support for mr beale 's calls for those at the top of the ladder to be targeted
' what is required are intelligent strategies which target the source of these crimes , ' he said
' the sad reality is that , in one of the poorest countries in the world , for years to come there will always be poor individuals who will commit these atrocities for money
' as much as we commend the government on its efforts , until the law enforcing authorities look beyond the obvious we are putting plasters on a wound here
