' sentencing hunter to be detained indefinitely in a secure hospital , judge gerald gordon said : ' after careful consideration i have come to the conclusion that your responsibility for what you did at the time by reason of your mental illness was so substantially reduced and caused by your mental health that that is the right course
' i should stress that i have taken into account both the ferocity of the attack and that the person you attacked was a total stranger
' this was indeed a serious , unprovoked attack upon a complete stranger resulting in his loss of life
it occurred without your having any violent history whatsoever and as a result of your mental illness
' i am satisfied that in the circumstances that if you are ever released , unless it is with the most careful control and monitoring , that there is a real risk of serious harm were there to be any future relapse
