a former bodybuilder given just weeks to live after being diagnosed with cancer today blamed his 10,000 - calorie a day diet and energy drink addiction for triggering the disease
dean wharmby was told he had just weeks to live in november after a large tumour was found on his liver
but he is still battling the disease five - and - a - half months later , thanks , he believes , to cutting out sugar and relying on natural remedies
it is a huge turn - around for the 39 - year - old , who told mailonline he turned to a diet of burgers , pizzas and bacon sandwiches - washed down with seven to eight cans of energy drink - to create the ' perfect ' bodybuilder 's physique

' it was because i was trying to be as big as possible , ' mr dean wharmby told mailonline
' i ca n't say it was the diet for sure , but things like the energy drinks could be contributing factors
red meats - all things we have found out have so many impurities in them now
' i think it was a combination of it all
' mr dean wharmby had been a bodybuilder for 20 years before he became ill. in the beginning , he admits to taking steroids for about a year to create his physique because ' everybody did it '
but he soon turned his back on them , as he began to build his personal training business
it was then his diet took a turn for the worse
' i could train seven clients in a day , back - to - back , ' he said
' then i would have to have the energy to train myself
' he added : ' i was constantly on the go
' dean wharmby was on a high - calorie diet for four to five years , as he tried to get make his body as big as possible
here , he reveals what he ate during an average day
breakfast : an entire pack of bacon , made into eight sandwiches and a protein shake 2,500 calories snack : a steak muffin ( sandwich ) 225 calories snack : two sweet potatoes and a full chicken 1,190 calories snack : a protein shake 262 calories snack : two protein bars 580 calories snack : large mcdonalds meal with a diet coke 855 calories snack : supermarket bought pizza - normally pepperoni 888 calories dinner : chips or rice with three chicken breasts or a steak 783 calories snack : 400g of beef on its own 1,000 calories supper : 15 boiled eggs 1,170 calories snack : protein shake 262 calories total : 9,715 calories a day but that is not all : overnight , dean wharmby used to wake up every two hours to eat either a full pack of jaffa cakes , a jar of peanut butter , or more protein bars - pushing him over the 10,000 calorie - a - day mark mr dean wharmby said his hectic lifestyle meant he turned to fast food to get the calories he needed some days , he would see seven clients back - to - back - and would fit eating every two hours around them mr dean wharmby found the energy from seven to eight cans of energy drink while eating every two hours
and while some of it was typical bodybuilder fare - protein shakes , eggs and chicken - other bits were less conventional
mr dean wharmby would grab a mcdonalds for a snack , and a pizza on the way home - which he would eat while his girlfriend of five years cooked dinner
at his biggest , he was 20 stone
but then the personal trainer from rochdale , greater manchester , became unwell five - and - a - half years ago , and doctors discovered a growth
mr dean wharmby and partner rigby ( pictured ) started to research natural medicine after his diagnosis he was offered chemotherapy and a liver transplant , but he decided to turn both down in favour of natural remedies
' i refused it from day one , ' he said
' the main reason why i chose to do natural instead of artificial was because i wanted to live
i did n't want to die
' but that meant he needed to completely rethink his diet , which was full of things like acids - which he believes help cancers thrive
and for a year , it was successful : mr dean wharmby 's tumour disappeared
' but i got complacent , ' he admitted
' the old lifestyle crept in again
' in 2013 , he collapsed outside the gym where he was working as a trainer , and rushed to hospital
for the majority of the next year , he returned to his healthy regime
but then things started to go wrong : he broke up with his girlfriend briefly , and found himself homeless - making it hard to concentrate on getting better
by november , he was in hospital ' hooked up to every machine you could think of '
doctors said he had just three weeks to live
the tumour had got too big to operate , and there was little the doctors felt they could do
' i was offered chemotherapy , but doctors basically said there was no point , ' mr dean wharmby said
mr dean wharmby , at his heaviest , weighed 20 stone - something he admits was also not good for his body mr dean wharmby and miss rigby , who have been together for five years , hope to inspire others with his new diet it is not known exactly what causes liver cancer , but research has suggested diet could be a factor
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease - which is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes - has been linked to cases of liver cancer
the disease occurs when small deposits of fat build up in the tissue
but while it is a common condition , in some cases , with people who have high levels of fat the liver can become inflamed
this can scar the liver over time - causing cirrhosis , which is linked to many cases of liver cancer
energy drinks , meanwhile , have been linked to cases of bowel cancer by scientists in scotland , according to the scotsman
it was also reported earlier this year that some energy drinks have as many as 20 teaspoons of sugar in them
sources : nhs choices so he and girlfriend rigby - his ' rock ' - began his healthy regime once more
they also began fundraising to help pay for the treatment costs and have attracted more than 2,000 likes on facebook by regularly posting videos of his progress
he has also visited a doctor in london - and is hoping to shrink his tumour by using natural medicine
mr dean wharmby is also hoping to inspire others through social media to live more healthily
ms rigby , 27 , said : ' there are lots of examples out there of people beating cancer naturally , even when they 've been told there 's nothing conventional medicine can do for them
' the support dean wharmby has received has really lifted him
people have been so positive and it has really made a difference to his attitude
' now he 's determined to inspire others to live more healthily
' mr dean wharmby added : ' it has been very difficult but i 'm 100 per cent determined to beat this
' and five - and - a - half months later , i 'm doing something right
