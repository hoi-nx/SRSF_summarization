reconnect : the european union hopes to a deal to restore relations with cuba and its president raul castro ( pictured ) by the end of 2015 after cutting ties with the country back in 1996 negotiations : european union 's foreign policy chief mogherini ( left ) held talks with cuba 's president raul castro and high - ranking officials ( pictured ) ' slow progress ' : ms mogherini said the european union wants to finalise the framework for an agreement between the two bodies by the end of 2015 mogherini said the pace of progress was ' slow ' but it was gaining ' political momentum ' after meeting with cuba president raul castro and other high - ranking officials in havana
she said : ' we decided today to speed up the rhythm of our negotiations , hopefully to manage to finalise the framework of our dialogue and agreement by the end of this year
the negotiations they began last april were seen as part of an improvement in relations since the 28 - nation bloc lifted diplomatic sanctions on cuba in 2008
but only three meetings took place in the next 11 months , prompting the europe to quicken the pace which cuba officials agreed to
cuba foreign minister bruno rodriguez will now visit mogherini in brussels on april 22 and like the european union chief 's trip to havana , the meeting will fall outside of formal negotiations
between now and then they will also see each other at the summit of the americas set for april 10 - 11 in panama , to which both cuba and the european union are invited for the first time
fixed : cuba has recently improved relation with its old enemy the us and raul castro ( right ) famously shook hands with us president barack obama ( left ) at nelson mandela 's memorial service cuba has also begun to engage in talks with the us after the former enemies announced they would restore diplomatic relations in december
relations between the countries are still strained but they have improved drastically since fidel castro stepped down as leader of cuba and barack obama became president of the us
after assuming office , barack obama said he was open to scrapping the trade embargo if cuba underwent political change and in 2009 , he eased some economic sanctions on the country and eased travel restrictions too
cuba 's president raul castro reciprocated barack obama 's policies and in july 2012 he said his government was willing to hold talks with the us to ' discuss anything '
they two leaders famously shook hands at former south african president nelson mandela 's state memorial service
the us and cuba quickly arranged high - level meetings in havana and washington , while european union - cuba talks were postponed twice
though not as severe as the open conflict between the us and cuba , europe 's relations with the caribbean island have also been strained through the years .
