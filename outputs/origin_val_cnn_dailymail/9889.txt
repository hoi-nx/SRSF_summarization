a visionary project has been approved which will see australia âs largest solar farm constructed in queensland in a staggering $ 1 billion project
the impressive development promises to be 100 times bigger than the country âs current largest solar farm and potentially , the largest of its kind in the world
the plant will be located on a 5,000 hectare acre site at bulli creek on queensland âs darling downs and promises to produce enough clean power for 550,000 homes
the south - west queensland project is expected to begin construction in 2016
it is hoped that within eight years the solar farm will be generating two gigawatts of power ; a massive figure which is more power than any coal station in queensland is currently capable of producing

the solar farm development , set to be built in queensland , will be 100 times bigger after seven years as a barrister , angus gemmell established solar choice , a solar project broker and consumer comparison service , which was the driving force behind the proposal â this will be a wonderful example of what australia can make from our natural resources , space and sunshine , â angus gemmell , managing director of solar choice , told daily mail australia
' australia is wonderfully geared to some visionary projects to harness those benefits of cheaper , bountiful , reliable sources of power , â mr angus gemmell told the guaridan
mr angus gemmell was formerly one of australia âs top defamation lawyers and won some of the country 's most high - profile cases
in 2006 he won a case which saw nrl player mcgaw awarded $ 385,000 , which is the largest ever damages figure handed down by a judge , after a today tonight program accused mcgaw of domestic violence
angus gemmell also represented political figures , including defence intelligence chief frank lewincamp
after seven years in his profession angus gemmell established solar choice , a solar project broker and consumer comparison service , which was the driving force behind the proposal
with angus gemmell at the helm , solar choice campaigned for 18 â exhaustive â months until approval was finally granted three weeks ago

the bulli creek solar farm will be built toward full 2gw capacity in â manageable steps â over a number of years
with angus gemmell at the helm , solar choice campaigned for 18 â exhaustive â months until approval was finally granted three weeks ago â we have optionality reserved to build over time , up to eight years
this means we are able to break it down into manageable steps , â mr angus gemmell told daily mail australia
solar choice have located one of a very few locations which meet all requirements
â it âs wonderfully positioned , close to major transmission nodes in the national electricity grid
it âs on large - scale , cleared flat country
all aspects make it for an aspiring study , â mr angus gemmell told daily mail australia
the area is also â soaked in sunshine â due to â good sun hours â and has no neighbours
there are no ecological restraints
crucially , the bulli creek site is close to a 330 kilovolt substation near millmerran , operated by powerlink
this ensures the solar power will be able to reach australia across the nation
the next step will be for solar choice to work with powerlink for six to nine months to determine how to connect the solar farm to the grid
the project has already garnered the interest of a number of crucial investors
â investors are well - advanced in the project
a number of north american and european - based parties are certainly very excited by the solar farm
the interested parties already have experience with similar , very large - scale solar projects
â no one has finally signed up but they have completed due diligence on the project

however , investors require legislative certainty from the government regarding the renewable energy target before they come on board however , investors require legislative certainty from the federal government regarding the renewable energy target before they come on board
the abbott government wants to redefine a renewable energy target ( ret ) set by a previous centre - left government in 2009
the government promised that 20 percent of projected energy use would be renewable by 2020
however , the current government wants to aim for 20 percent of actual energy use , which is far less
to reach the target , the government subsidises companies which invest in renewable energy as well as households and small businesses which opt to use such energy
changing the current mandate could potentially deter investors
but the cost of renewable energy is higher than the subsidies , so companies pass on costs to customers
the government and opposition are now negotiating new terms of the ret in a review that is expected to last a year
â we have placed this project on the radar at all levels of politics , â angus gemmell told daily mail australia
â we are helping to show them that there are alternatives
there is conjecture at a federal level that there is not enough of a pipe line in australia
â however this project would be considerable way to help achieve the target ( 20 per cent of projected energy use )
â it is proof that there is enough of a pipeline in australia to reach the target , not to fall short of it
â the solar farm is forecast to take australia 25 per cent closer to achieving the current target , 41,000 gwh
