a police officer called to a domestic fight over a love triangle compared the row to the jeremy kyle show and complained , ' i do n't get paid for this s * * * ' , a report claimed today
the comment was said to have been made when orrett turned up at the home of his ex-lover dawn barr - five days before barr stabbed him to death
two officers , pc simon butler and acting sgt poole , have now been formally disciplined for failing to deal with the incident properly amidst claims that they did not take the argument seriously
row : dawn barr , left , killed ex-boyfriend orrett , right , five days after an argument attended by police police did not report the fact that mr orrett , 32 , had sustained a stab wound during the altercation as they apparently believed barr 's assertion that he had inflicted it on himself , according to a report from the ipcc
five days later , barr , 42 , stabbed mr orrett in the neck with a vegetable knife , causing him to bleed to death
she was later convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nine years in jail
the couple had been together for 12 years before they split up and had four young children together , three of whom suffered from cystic fibrosis
mr orrett struggled to accept the end of their relationship , and would often turn up at barr 's home in a bid to win her back , even though she was now seeing another man , joyce
in november 2012 , police were called to barr 's house in cheadle , greater manchester after she called them accusing him of threatening to stab her new boyfriend
scene : forensic officers at barr 's house in cheadle , greater manchester after the fatal stabbing horror : greater manchester police initially downplayed the incident in november 2012 five days before mr orrett was killed according to barr , one of the officers on the scene said : ' this is like f * * * ing jeremy kyle , i do n't get paid for this s * * *
' all the police involved denied comparing the situation to the controversial talk show , but the ipcc report concluded it was likely that someone had used the phrase
when they later filed a log of the incident , the officers stated that no offences had been committed despite the fact that mr orrett showed them a stab wound in his abdomen
in the domestic violence report which the police filled out , they did not mention a weapon and downplayed the severity of the incident
following the ipcc 's report , pc butler and acting sgt poole , from greater manchester police , were given written warnings for misconduct
five days after the argument which was attended by police , mr orrett once again turned up at barr 's home because their daughter sent him a message saying she missed him
he clashed with his ex and tried to hide her mobile phone so she could n't contact mr joyce , leading to a fight in which he was stabbed in the neck
father : mr orrett pictured with two of his four children with barr , three of whom had cystic fibrosis barr called 999 and police arrived to find mr orrett bleeding to death on the floor
his former partner was cleared of murdering him but found guilty of murder in may 2013
it later emerged that she had written messages to mr joyce in which she said , ' i 'll stab the c * * * myself ' and ' get him gone - i 'm gon na kill this c * * *
' ipcc commissioner james dipple-johnstone said today : ' what we have seen in this investigation and others we have done into the way greater manchester police deal with victims of domestic abuse is that there is sometimes a disconnect between the policies and practice of the force and what is actually happening on the front line
' there is a need to tackle a culture on the front line , which appears to minimise and dismiss the impact of domestic violence , to make sure that we do not see further examples where victims are let down with catastrophic outcomes
' there were opportunities for officers to take more robust action in this case and those opportunities were missed
' we are concerned that this is one of a number of greater manchester police cases we are investigating , and hope that the force and its officers are learning from our and hmic 's recommendations so that the service it provides improves
