' no , it is not even a relevant discussion because we were both on slow - down laps at that point in time
and that was very , very clear
' informed hamilton had set a personal best in the first sector , rosberg said : ' yeah , but if you bail out of a lap it turns into a slow - down lap , does n't it ? ' it was then suggested to rosberg that hamilton only slowed as he came upon the german , to which he said : ' that is not true

i will have to think about something later on
