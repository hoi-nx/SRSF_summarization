after it became clear there was no way for wildlife rangers to break the slippery bank , it was left to a digger from chinese company china road and bridge corporation , working on a nearby railway , to cultivate a gap in the bank allowing the mammal to walk to freedom
exhausted from the ordeal , the elephant , which was too tired to move from the ditch , was eventually encouraged to make its dash out onto the open plains after being nudged by the digger
jeremy said : ' this elephant had gone into a human dominated farming area that borders a national park at night to find water in a man - made well
' the area has been experiencing a very dry period and water is hard to find
' he must have slipped in while drinking and could n't get out because of the steep clay sides
' wildlife conservationists watched helplessly for hours as the animal struggled in the well , but thankfully the chinese construction company came to the rescue by providing the machine

' once it emerged , it seemed very tired but otherwise seemingly unharmed
' following the rescue , rangers were called upon to escort the elephant from the farmland back into chyulu hills national park , home to the highest mountain range in eastern kenya
using land cruisers in tandem with a helicopter , the rangers tried to push the elephant in the direction of the 100 kilometre long national park , preventing it from moving back towards other farms and settlements
jeremy said : ' there was then a difficult process where rangers had to prevent the elephant from moving back towards other farms , there were still lots of people that had been watching the rescue and they had to flee as the elephant ran in different directions
' but it was a wonderful moment watching him escape from the well
it was because of humans that he ended up in trouble , but humans were able to help him survive
' i just hope that he moved back into the safe natural area , and takes bit more care next time he goes for a drink
