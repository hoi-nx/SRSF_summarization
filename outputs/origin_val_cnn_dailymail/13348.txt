wrapped up in a long brightly - colored scarf , which does little to contain her free - flowing curly hair , nneka sits back quietly as she tries to bring to mind her very first memory of music
" i was a kid , " the nigerian singer finally says , her thoughts traveling back to warri , the niger delta city where she grew up
" while i was doing my domestic work in the house , sweeping , waking up at 5am in the morning , there was this bird [ singing ] -- and i never forgot the melody , " she continues , breaking a warm smile
" funny wise , like 25 years later i was in lagos and i heard the same melody -- it was amazing ! " nneka 's first musical recollection might be firmly rooted in her birthplace , but the award - winning singer 's career was destined to begin thousands of miles away from home -- the daughter of a nigerian father and a german mother , nneka moved to hamburg at the age of 19 to study anthropology
whilst attending university , she also started exploring her musical talents , and soon found herself performing in various clubs opening up for top reggae and hip - hop names
in 2005 , she released " victim of truth , " a much - lauded debut that fused soulful beats , tasty hip - hop - and reflective ballads with politically - charged lyrics and black consciousness
since then , she went on to enjoy further chart success , tour extensively and collaborate with global stars like lenny kravitz and damian marley
and now , the soulful singer is back with a brand new , self - released album -- " my fairy tales " is a formidable collection of rich afrobeat grooves , reggae - tinged beats and uplifting rhythms that reaffirm her place as one of the continent 's most exciting -- and relevant -- artists
cnn 's african voices caught up with nneka in london to talk about music , memories and the current situation in nigerian -- as well as present her with the questions you sent via the # asknneka and # cnnafrica hashtags
cnn : in the past , you 've dealt with issues ranging from the environment and politics , to religion and love -- what are the themes that you 're emphasizing at this moment ? nneka : what is happening in africans at present concerns me a lot
boko haram has always been an issue obviously for the past five , six years -- funny wise , there 's a track in the album called " pray for you " which i recorded when not too many people knew what was going with boko haram in the west
i 'm talking about the problems and possible solutions , and what are the reasons for the problems that we have
we as nigerian , we 're not united , that has always been the issue ... that 's our problem , tribalism , and what belongs to whom
i also talk about children and the future , bringing children into this world ... everyone 's living in a cage and then you bring your child into that kind of society , where your child is forced to live in fear
people are afraid to express themselves politically , and even in their home -- i remember the way we grew up , i did n't look my father in the eye until i was 22 ; you call your father " sir , sir , sir " -- apparently it 's a form of respect , ok , but respect should not be mistaken with fear
i was afraid and that 's the thing , that 's the colonial mentality : we mistake fear for respect
he [ goodluck jonathan ] says he wants to tackle boko haram , obviously every nigerian is asking why now , he could had done it a long time ago ... but i 'm not good at the whole blaming game , i do n't want to blame anybody but i pray that he comes up with a good idea for us if he is an honest and genuine guy
but i know that fela [ kuti ] would definitely not be cool with him , seun [ kuti ] is not cool with him , and many other musicians who are very outspoken are not cool with him
cnn : what is the power of music and how can it influence things to bring positive change ? nneka : music is very powerful , music is big ; music is even more powerful than politics at present
beyonce would definitely draw more crowd than [ nigerian president ] goodluck jonathan if she was going to hold a speech -- if beyonce is going to talk about boko haram , many people are going to listen , and if she had something to tell nigerian about love or whatever , many people are going to listen
cnn : how do you see the political and security situation now in nigerian ? nneka : all i can say is that we do need proper leadership
yes , that 's just easier said than done , but we also need ourselves to take more things into our own hands -- so if we want change , we have to show that we want change , peacefully -- i love malcolm x but i 'd rather go for martin luther [ king ] -- peacefully
and be part of it , not just blame our leaders and making sure that you , yourself , contribute to the change that you want to see
your questions nneka : my personal life always inspires me , in the first place , and then i try to expand it to the world
i try not to go too personal so that people can have their own interpretation of the song and also relate to it in their own special way
nneka : i like the prophet by kahlil gibran , i like things fall apart by chinua achebe , i like the bible
right now i 'm reading the humans by matt haig
read ! just read , educate yourself ! nneka : the way forward is going to be easier said than done , but tribalism is not they key
what we need is unity and to appreciate each other as nigerian , as africans , regardless of tribe and regardless of religion -- imposing your religion on other people is only going to create war and turmoil , there has to be another way
nneka : being on tour for like five months ; i mean you get used to the life , but [ it 's hard ] when you 're coming back home and then realizing that people move on when you 're not around
nneka : it is successfully already , that 's why everybody is in it
that 's all i can say to that , it 's flourishing and they know it 's flourishing and that 's why they 're all there -- the chinese , the americans , the europeans and the rest of them .
