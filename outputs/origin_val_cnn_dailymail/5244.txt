happy : abbi jillians has been given a pink hand through the pioneering 3d printer technology the first thing four - year - old abbi jillians wanted to do when scientists gave her a new hand was brush her barbie doll âs hair
the youngster â who was born with a just a thumb on her left hand â has been given the pink hand through the pioneering 3d printer technology
she has now been using her new hand to pick up objects around her house , ride her bike , and even pinch her dad on the bottom
full - time mum julie jillians , of tavistock , devon , started a campaign to find local access to a 3d printer three months ago and said the new hand had revolutionised her daughter âs life
the 47 - year - old said : â when we got home , the first thing she did was pick up her dolly so she could brush her hair with two hands
â that is one thing she always wanted to do
she had always loved her dolls and wanted to dress them - but i ended up always having to do it for her
â it is amazing and wonderful to see her do it herself
she is just like any other girl - barbie is her favourite
â this is just so special for abbi jillians
the smile on my daughter âs face is from ear to ear with a bow round the back
â i am now finding things all over the house
she âs even managed to pinch her daddy âs bum
the determination on her face is the sweetest thing , and the fact she âs willing to receive the hand and willing to work at learning to use it
â the hand works by opening and closing when abbi jillians bends her wrist up or down
it has a velcro which straps around her palm and the gauntlet sits on her arm
abbi jillians had an operation at 18 months old , taking parts of her toes to give her a bigger palm , and replacing the toes with hip bone
but her mother said she and husband jim , 34 , would not consider any more operations after seeing the success of her hand
she said : â it is fantastic and we just ca nât stop her using it
she wants to wear it all the time and can not believe what she has now got
new lease : julie jillians says the pink hand has changed abbi jillians 's life and the four - year - old has been testing out the new kit by picking things up and putting them down all over the house abbi jillians 's hand costs around Â£ 50 in materials to print a hand , so new limbs can be created as she grows â she is still building up her strength and getting used to it - and she can not hold anything too heavy
â but she is going around picking everything up , from cups to fruit , and playing with all the toys she was never able to before
â she loves dress - up as well and is finding that a lot easier now she has two hands
abbi jillians 's hand is among designs available on a global database of 3d printer prosthetics and comes in 30 colours
it was printed in around 20 pieces which were put together with elastic bands before a professional helped to fit it
the hand is attached to abbi jillians âs arm with velcro straps
she can control it by twisting her wrist to tighten the bands
the 3d printer was provided by it firm midwich , and the enabling the future website printed it out and helped fit it
a midwich spokesman said nhs prosthetics were usually for aesthetic purposes only and did not move or grip
he added that it costs around Â£ 50 in materials to print a hand , so new limbs can be created as a child grows
â she was never able to ride a bike before as her hands would slip off the handlebars
but she is now riding it around the house
â the technology is fantastic
the more she gets to use it , the stronger her wrist and arm will become
there is no way i would consider another operation for her now - this is just way too functional
â because her muscles are nât as developed in that arm , we keep having to take it off her so she does nât overdo it
but in time the muscles will get stronger and she âll be able to use it more and more
â it âs not going to be a permanent fixture on her arm but it âs there as and when she needs two hands
â abbi jillians , who is in reception class at school , said of her new hand : â i love wearing it so much
i want to wear it forever and ever
â mrs abbi jillians launched the appeal for organisations with a 3d printer to help abbi jillians , and the fablab at plymouth college of art , with the help of it firm midwitch , came forward
the family has since raised nearly Â£ 4,000 to get a nearby school kitted out with a 3d printer to help other children in a similar position to abbi jillians .
