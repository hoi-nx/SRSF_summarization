there seems to be an ever - growing list of people , places and things that will turn you gay
maybe we should think of these as the brigade of evil , homosexual nouns
there were the teletubbies and spongebob squarepants a decade ago
now , as these views thankfully get more fringe , the theories are becoming increasingly bizarre and awesome
among the homo nouns , there 's the common core , according to a florida lawmaker ( education policy is super gay , obviously ) ; taylor swift , who an op - ed writer for the christian post , larry tomczak , claims is being used by ellen degeneres to " attract young girls " to her show ( uh-huh ) ; the disney princess movie " frozen , " according to radio hosts in colorado ( that dress ! ) ; and now , according to a potential 2016 gop presidential contender , carson , there 's prison
stay away from crime , kids
carson , who , let me reiterate , is a potential presidential candidate from a major america party , and a neurosurgeon to boot , told cnn 's chris cuomo in an interview that aired wednesday that " a lot of people ... go into prison straight -- and when they come out , they 're gay
" asked if being gay was a choice , carson replied in a word : " absolutely
" this level of ignorance is so last century , so near - irrelevant , that i 'm hesitant even to respond
but no one who holds these beliefs belongs in a race for the 2016 white house
ordinarily , i 'm the kind of gay person who likes to give people room to evolve
i know not everyone " gets it " automatically
that 's ok , as long as you are n't hateful about it , are willing to listen and do n't try to restrict the rights of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people
i 'm from oklahoma , a deeply conservative state , and i 've seen friends , family and co-workers evolve
people who thought being gay was a sin -- or that it was a choice , or fixable -- now support same - sex marriage
but presidential candidates do n't get that leeway
( in fact , he later apologized , regretting his words but saying the science on the issue of sexual orientation is n't clear
) these views belong in another decade , not modern america
this apparently still needs to be said : being gay is not a choice
do n't believe me ? well , ask a gay person
as i mentioned , i 'm one of those ( despite never having seen " frozen " in its entirety ) , and i can tell you that , for me , it was n't a choice
it 's not something i would want to undo , but it also is n't like i woke up one day and was like , huh , you know what would really mix it up this winter ? dating dudes instead of ladies
science backs me on this
i 'm not going to roll through all the details , but mark joseph stern from slate sums it up pretty well : " in study after study , biologists have found that homosexuality , at least in men , is clearly , undoubtedly , inarguably an inborn trait
" and even if it were a choice , who cares ? a person 's religion is a choice
yet the america offers certain protections based on religion
carson , meanwhile , opposes same - sex marriage
that 's a stance that , again , thankfully , is getting exceedingly rare in national politics
it 's also an issue that , along with transgender rights and employment discrimination against lgbt people , should be a focal point in the 2016 campaign cycle
i hope that america is evolved enough not to elect a candidate who opposes lgbt rights
i do think we live in that country these days
it 's a country that mostly laughs at someone saying prison would " turn " someone gay
but the point remains that saying so both belittles a serious issue of violence -- that of men raping other men in prison , which has nothing to do with turning anyone gay and everything to do with criminal activity
and it 's a serious lapse in logic
being around a bunch of dudes -- or ladies -- in prison does n't change a person 's innate sexual attractions
it 's so obvious i should n't have to say it
and the america people damn sure should n't have to listen to it
especially coming from a 2016 presidential contender , it 's almost laughably irrelevant
