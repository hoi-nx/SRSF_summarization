clive betts , chairman of the communities and local government committee , said ofsted 's ' credibility is on the line ' ofsted 's credibility suffered a major blow yesterday when scathing mps said the inspectorate was partly to blame for the rotherham child sex abuse scandal
the education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs
yesterday a parliamentary committee probing ofsted âs work there called for urgent inspections of every council in the country with responsibility for child protection â to ensure large - scale abuse is nât being ignored elsewhere
clive betts , chairman of the communities and local government committee , said ofsted âs â credibility is on the line â
the labour mp added : â the perpetrators bear ultimate responsibility for the sexual exploitation of children in rotherham but the ineffectiveness of ofsted âs inspections contributed to a failure to expose the extent of the problem
â the fierce attack came on the day a second group of mps found flaws in ofsted âs handling of the trojan horse affair , in which birmingham schools were accused of fostering religious extremism
the commons education committee said little evidence of radicalisation had been found and â confidence in ofsted has been undermined , and efforts should be made by the inspectorate to restore it â
meanwhile , the rotherham report pointed to ofsted inspectors repeatedly labelling child protection in the town as â adequate â â yet they were tied to their paperwork and had no idea what was really going on
instead , the inspectors simply accepted what they were told by local officials , and did nât ask searching questions
â ofsted does not appear to have probed beyond what it was told , and it failed to penetrate the professional jealousy and incompetence that distorted the operation of children âs social care in rotherham , â stated the report
it also described ofsted âs habit of calling the efforts of councils like rotherham adequate as â ambiguous â
while ofsted thought â adequate â meant that improvement was needed , outsiders , including councillors , thought it meant â satisfactory â
â rotherham appears to have gone a step further and interpreted it as indicating a strong performance
â the mps added that ofsted was operating in a way that meant its different inspectors and departments did not discuss their findings with each other â and inspections of councils like rotherham were â too short and narrowly focused â
they relied on paperwork â rather than actuality â and on what they were told by councils , who did not pass on concerns raised by whistleblowers and others
the education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town ( pictured ) where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs â we conclude that the experience of whistleblowers at rotherham was the antithesis of what a good whistleblowers policy should be , â the mps said
they called for louise casey â who was sent in by the government to examine rotherham âs failures after the scandal broke â to carry out a second inquiry to check that the town is working more effectively
a similar inquiry should be held into south yorkshire police , they said
and they were â uneasy â about the way in which ofsted polices itself as it â may not be sufficiently accountable for its performance â
last night an ofsted spokesman said : â we welcome the report and the committee âs recognition that the changes we have made since 2012 strengthen our ability to uncover where children are at risk
we know we did nât get it right historically in rotherham and have apologised for those mistakes
