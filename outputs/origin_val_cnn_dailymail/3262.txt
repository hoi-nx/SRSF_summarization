netflix has officially launched in aussies but it has been revealed the online streaming service 's local offering carries 7,000 fewer titles than its u.s. version
tech blogger tsang extracted all the movies and tv shows on offer in each country and put them in a spreadsheet , finding 1,116 titles in aussies compared with 8,499 in the u.s. a netflix spokesman said the libraries vary from country to country , adding that they change every day
' our aim in aussies is not to replicate the u.s. library , ' he told daily mail australia
' the spokesman added that content distribution deals prevented netflix from carrying certain titles in aussies
' that 's purely down to distribution rights , many programs get snapped up by other services
' our goal is to work towards a global model , when that happens we will be negotiating rights on a global scale
' mr tsang also found that netflix has 693 titles available only to aussies viewers
on monday netflix officially outlined its pricing scheme , and confirmed house of cards and new black would be among its key tv shows on offer
the service launches on tuesday charging $ 8.99 per month for a single screen ( standard definition ) , $ 11.99 for two screens ( high definition ) and $ 14.99 for ultra definition on four screens
this makes netflix 's lowest offering the cheapest tv streaming option on the market
new black will be available online on netflix , but will also screen on foxtel netflix original series unbreakable kimmy schmidt starring titus burgess and ellie kemper ( l - r ) but competitor stan â a joint partnership between fairfax and the channel nine â charges $ 10 per month for hd streaming on three screens
like netflix , this is inclusive of tv shows and movies
stan 's exclusive series include breaking bad spin - off better call saul , season six of community and transparent along with a number of channel nine shows
presto - a foxtel - seven west media partnership - charges $ 9.99 per month for tv shows or movies only , or $ 14.99 for both
all packages are standard definition
presto carries channel seven content and a number of older hbo and showtime series including the sopranos , sex and the city and dexter but most of those networks ' series still in production - including hbo 's game of thrones - are not included
all three svod ( subscription video on demand ) services are offering a free month trial

but it does not carry all seasons as they premiere free trial period : two weeks the launch of netflix ushers in what is arguably the biggest change to the aussies tv landscape in decades
but the online streaming services will still have to convince aussies - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content
this could prove difficult , with a new canstar blue survey finding that the majority of aussies are still not willing to pay for tv content
around one in five are willing to pay up to $ 20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see
but this could change in future , with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young aussies are already utilising online streaming services like stan , presto , quickflix and netflix
