the hollywood gym inside which pacquiao plots his victory over mayweather is being patrolled by seven armed guards
the wild card boxing club , run by the filipino âs esteemed trainer roach , is usually open for fans hoping to catch a glimpse of a master at work
but now , with a $ 300million ( Â£ 200m ) mega-fight at stake , nothing is being left to chance
the veteran trainer is in macau preparing for zou shimming âs first world title fight on saturday before returning to los angeles where pacquiao , now 36 , will spar 90 to 95 rounds instead of the usual 150
they will both make the short trip downtown on wednesday where they will be met by mayweather for the only face - to - face meeting before fight week in las vegas
and roach wasted little time in taking a swipe at mayweather âs father and trainer floyd snr
pacquiao uploaded an instagram post on thursday undergoing some shadow boxing pacquiao 's welterweight unification bout against mayweather is expected to total $ 300million â going against floyd snr is a little disappointing , â roach said
â he just is nât very good , especially during the fight itself
one of our advantages is having him in the other corner
â roach also underlined his complete confidence in pacquiao ending mayweather âs unbeaten record
â mayweather is so disrespectful , â he said
â pacquiao is the perfect role model for this fight and mayweather is not
i told pacquiao we âve got to beat him for the whole world
there âs no way we ca nât win this fight
mayweather began training in his las vegas gym exactly two months before fighting pacquiao â mayweather âs legs do nât move like they once did
he âs very clever but the fight is so big he may feel like he has to take a risk and exchange with us
â if he does that , that âs the best thing in the world for pacquiao in my mind
â pacquiao will be performing a public service for boxing when he beats mayweather
â pacquiao has been training in roach âs absence and posted several videos on instagram of his shadow boxing sessions
and despite showing off his blistering hand speed , he wrote : â i feel slow but i âm not worried because i still have a lot of time
