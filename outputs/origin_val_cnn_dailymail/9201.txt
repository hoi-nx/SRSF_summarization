manuel pellegrini has told milner to meet city halfway as their contract negotiations continue to drag on
the england midfielder , who joined the club from aston villa for Â£ 26million in 2010 , is stalling over a new deal with the premier league champions and his future at the etihad appears to be increasingly uncertain
milner , 29 , is reluctant to commit to what could be the last big contract of his career while he still has concerns over his first - team opportunities at city
he will be a free agent in the summer and has been linked with arsenal and liverpool , as well as a number of clubs in italy and spain
milner is a versatile and popular member of city 's squad but talks of a new deal have hit the rocks manuel pellegrini had been hopeful that milner âs situation would be resolved by now but seemed less optimistic when asked about it on friday
the city boss indicated that the ball is in milner âs court and the club are unlikely to improve their offer
â i do nât have any news about milner , â he said
â to decide to sign a contract you need both parties to agree it
we will see what happens from now until the end of the season
manuel pellegrini has asked milner to meet the club in the middle after the factions have reached an impasse â maybe city have already offered all that the club can offer
maybe it âs not about more money , maybe there are different things to sign a new contract
â you must ask milner what is happening with him
i hope he will find an arrangement , but you can not talk about city only
