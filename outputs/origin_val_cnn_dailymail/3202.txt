a ceo who reportedly died of a heart attack in venezuela two years ago has been arrested on fraud charges after being captured by the fbi at his remote north carolina hideout
jose lantigua , 62 , and his 57 - year - old wife , daphne simpson , have been jailed on seven florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested on saturday wearing a brown toupee and a dyed beard
each count carries a possible 30 - year sentence
just a few years ago , jose lantigua 's family appeared to be living the american dream
the cuban immigrant claimed he had a heroic military career and earned numerous degrees before running a successful furniture business
he owned a florida beachfront condo and a new home atop a verdant north carolina mountain
but in 2012 , as his circle k company slid deeper into debt , those who knew jose lantigua said he 'd made some odd decisions : he ordered tons of new furniture on the company dime for his family 's many homes
three months later , his family said he died of a heart attack in venezuela , his body cremated there instead of returned home

jose lantigua , a jacksonville businessman reported dead two years ago in venezuela , was arrested in north carolina on saturday on alleged fraud charges after his life insurance companies filed a lawsuit alleging he was alive and they should n't be making payments he replaced the bookkeeper he 'd used for years with a relative
he built a panic room with steel doors inside his north carolina hideaway
and , prosecutors say , he and his wife began planning his fake death to scam almost $ 8 million from insurance companies
no matter how the criminal case turns out , his arrest gives a resolute end to a long - running court battle between jose lantigua 's family and insurance companies that refused to pay off on his life policies because , for many reasons proven right , they did n't think he was dead
' i 've never seen anything quite like ( this case ) , ' said licandro , a jacksonville prosecutor working the case
' there was always a suspicion , but they were able to evade authorities as long as he did , and she did n't have any missteps either - until recently
' jose lantigua , who had emigrated to the u.s. as a youth , purchased circle k in 2008 after claiming to have served more than 20 years as a senior officer in the army , where he claimed to have earned the silver star , the nation 's third - highest military honor for bravery

friends had left messages of condolence to her following her father 's reported passing in 2013 months after her father 's alleged passing , christina lantigua posted this picture of them together and friends posted their condolences below
neither the businessman 's daughter or son , joseph , have been charged with a crime the army has not responded to requests for confirmation
he also graduated from florida international university in 1989 with a degree in computer science , the school said , and claimed degrees in management , mathematics and physics and aerospace engineering from pepperdine , northwestern and the uf , respectively
uf said he attended the school but did not earn a degree and northwestern had no record of him
pepperdine did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation
by the time jose lantigua bought circle k , it had grown from a few items sold from the corner of an old feed store to two large jacksonville showrooms offering everything from contemporary to country - style pieces made from logs
problems surfaced in 2012 , when jose lantigua told friends and colleagues he 'd fallen ill and needed to go to venezuela to get an experimental treatment not available in the u.s.
daphne simpson stood by his side with an expression of worry , people who know the couple said
records showed they sold their jacksonville - area condo for $ 600,000
about this time , circle k was also developing financial problems
no one suspected anything suspicious at first , said leis , who was circle k 's bookkeeper
but as the company 's debt grew into hundreds of thousands of dollars , she said jose lantigua kept buying furniture for his family with company funds
still , she trusted the man , whose kindness she said she leaned on previously when she had problems
then lantigua replaced her as bookkeeper with his sister - in - law
' i was n't given a reason except i was needed more on the floor and his sister - in - law could n't sell furniture , ' she said
before long , jose lantigua headed to venezuela to deal with his alleged illness
jose lantigua ran the once successful circle k furniture company ( pictured ) but the business began to slide into debt in 2010 lantigua , 62 , and his 57 - year - old wife , daphne simpson , are jailed on seven florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on saturday in north carolina it was there , in april 2013 , that his family said he died of a heart attack , his body cremated there instead of returned home
circle k 's stores closed a month later and the company soon filed for bankruptcy
jose lantigua 's family began filing life insurance claims for the nearly $ 8 million in policies he 'd obtained
at his june 2013 memorial service at high point community church in suburban jacksonville , lantigua 's daughter , christina , sang ' amazing grace ' and the pastor read words of hope as his widow looked on
meanwhile , american general had suspicions about the $ 2 million claim lantigua 's son , joseph , had filed , particularly the venezuela death and cremation certificates accompanying it
first , the physician who signed lantigua 's death certificate never received or examined the body
the investigators also said there had been no autopsy
finally , the crematorium that had supposedly been used was 250 miles from where jose lantigua supposedly died
' the insured 's body was purportedly not prepared in any way prior to the cremation and likely would have rapidly decomposed during the lengthy travel in high temperatures , ' american general said in court documents
the crematorium representative who signed the certificate was paid to generate false documents , the company said
last november , american general denied the claim and lawsuits were filed
lantigua has not responded to several phone messages seeking comment
no contact information for christina lantigua could be found
neither has been charged with a crime
american general 's findings piqued the interest of local and federal prosecutors , who opened an investigation that included surveillance
at the time of his supposed death , lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep , narrow road on hogback mountain in north carolina , a remote vacation destination near asheville
' it 's possible that he 's been hiding out there these past couple of years , ' said licandro , the jacksonville prosecutor
residents of the nearby village of sapphire said the area is perfect for hiding out : only a couple hundred people live there and they keep to themselves
but jose lantigua apparently thought trouble was coming
he built a bunker in his basement complete with 20 - inch thick steel doors , said a contractor who worked on the house
' it made me wonder why would you need a panic ( room ) here ? there 's not that many people around here you got to worry about , ' said boutte , 28
boutte said lantigua was a nice , straightforward man
on saturday , state department security agents arrested lantigua near the hogback mountain home
the passport he had used to get back into the u.s. had proved his downfall
the man whose name lantigua was trying to steal was black â the photo lantigua submitted showed he is white
the social security number he used was from a woman born in 1917
suspicious , state department agents used facial recognition software to discover his true identity
finding him was n't hard â while the other information on his passport application was allegedly forged , he listed his supposed widow as his emergency contact and gave the correct north carolina address
for those who knew him , the news that he was still alive was startling
' i 'm just shocked
he did n't seem that type at all
he seemed to me an upstanding , christian family man
he was nice to everybody and wanted help people , ' leis said
