a country song with a theme as old as time has some listeners up in arms - and some radio stations now refusing to put it on the airwaves
little big town has a hit with their new tune girl crush , selling an impressive 25,000 copies a week , a song about a girl who wants to get back her man
that girl though is not afraid to admit she is a little bit jealous of her former man 's new lady however , and some are now claiming the song ' promotes the gay agenda
i got a girl crush
' and for this , a simple tale of jealousy , some stations are saying they are getting just as much outrage from listeners as when the dixie chicks criticized president bush back in 2003
' is it frustrating to you that here is your song - that is one of the top 10 sellers for weeks and weeks and weeks - and people on the radio are still afraid to play it because they think it âs a lesbian song ? ' radio host bobby bones asked the group during a recent interview according to the washington post
' just the fact that we âre still discussing that , number one , there âs so many problems with that whole issue , ' answered fairchild
bones , who hosts the most popular country radio morning show in the country then said ; ' it should nât even matter if it âs a lesbian song , is the first thing
' this is not the case for listeners however , with one individual in texas writing in to say to a station after they played the song ; ' you are just promoting the gay agenda on your station and i am changing the channel and never listening to you ever again ! ! ' alana lynn , who hosts a morning show in boise , idaho , says she got a similar response from some listeners
kacey musgraves ( left ) went through the same thing when her single follow your arrow included a line about girls kissing girls , but katy perry topped the pop charts with i kissed a girl ( right ) newcomer kacey musgraves dealt with the same problem from country radio when her song follow your arrow , listed by some in the industry as one of the best songs of 2013 , was shunned as it included the lyrics ; ' kiss lots of boys / or kiss lots of girls / if that 's something you 're into
' despite selling over 500,000 copies , the song never charted higher than 43 of the billboard chart for country music radio airplay
this has never been a problem on the pop charts meanwhile , with katy perry finding herself atop the billboard hot 100 with her debut single i kissed a girl
now , the group has actually filmed a spot that explains the song , with fairchild saying ; ' it âs about a girl saying , you know , " why do you love her and not me ? " ' the group did at least have their last song go to the top spot on the country charts and receive plenty of airplay-day drinking .
