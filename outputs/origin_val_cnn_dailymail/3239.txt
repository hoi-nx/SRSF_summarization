jenson button can understand the reasoning why fernando alonso will not be making his second debut with mclaren this weekend
on the advice of doctors , fernando alonso is absent from the season - opening australia grand prix after sustaining concussion following a heavy crash on the final day of the second pre-season test last month
fears were expressed to fernando alonso of ' second - impact syndrome ' whereby a serious brain injury , or even death , could occur should the 33 - year - old be involved in a second incident so soon after the first
jenson button walks through the paddock at the albert park circuit ahead of the australia grand prix after several weeks testing ( above ) , the f1 season gets underway in melbourne on sunday despite that there has been scepticism of the decision , particularly as fernando alonso spent three days in a local hospital and passed a variety of tests
jenson button knows what it is like to suffer concussion as he was involved in a severe accident in practice for the 2003 monaco grand prix , yet just a fortnight later was back behind the wheel of his car in canada
on reflection , jenson button knows he should arguably have never driven in that subsequent race , so can understand the precautions taken with fernando alonso , even if they appear extreme
' as far as i know he ( fernando alonso ) had three days ( in hospital ) undergoing every scan and check under the sun , ' said jenson button
' i 'm sure whatever they 've chosen to do is the correct decision
the british f1 driver understands why mclaren team - mate fernando alonso will miss the race fernando alonso suffered concussion after a high speed crash at the circuit de catalunya on february 22 ' concussions vary
some are very light , and then you have different grades of concussion , brain damage
' for me , i raced two weeks after an accident in monaco in 2003 , with checks of standing on a box , closing one eye and whatever else i had to do
' to be honest , i scraped through , so they let me race , but that was nearly 13 years ago
now the checks are very stringent
' with the incidents we 've had , in particular with jules ( bianchi in japan last year ) , the medical people are going to be more strict , and so they should be
' a helicopter takes fernando alonso to hospital after the former world champion crashed during pre-season testing the spaniard waves to supporters after leaving hospital , having passed numerous tests despite fernando alonso 's incident at barcelona 's circuit de catalunya , jenson button insists he has no issues with the car
initially , speculation centred on mechanical failure or an electrical issue given the new mclaren is now powered by mclaren honda
the woking - based marque , however , categorically ruled out any such faults and instead stated a freak gust of wind played its part in the double world champion veering off track and into a wall
heading into sunday 's race at melbourne 's albert park , despite the lack of running throughout testing given numerous other glitches , jenson button maintains the car is one of the best he has driven
jenson button was involved in a serious accident at the 2003 monaco grand prix before returning two weeks later ' competitiveness is impossible to say , but in terms of feel and how the car is and what you want it to do , it does everything right and a lot better than last year , ' assessed jenson button
' this car is very different in that it does what you hope it will do , which is very important for myself , and also for fernando alonso as far as i can see
' the basic philosophy of the car and idea of the aerodynamics and how it works is definitely right
i have n't driven a mclaren like this before , not in the way it works
' i 'm not saying it 's the quickest mclaren i have ever driven , because it 's not , but in the way it works , the basic car is very good
' mclaren reserve driver kevin magnussen will race in fernando alonso 's absence at the australia grand prix whilst jenson button is confident of finishing sunday 's race , he appreciates mclaren honda are a long way off from challenging their main rivals
' you are going to have doubts , and it would be stupid not to have doubts when you look at winter testing because we have n't completed a simulated race distance yet , ' said jenson button
' yes , i do know it 's going to be a tough start , but it 's also very different
' the last two years have not been the easiest seasons for us , but i think the difference with this year is the understanding there could be something very special on the horizon with mclaren honda
jenson button looks on as the nsx concept vehicle at a honda f1 grand prix press conference ' the whole team is unbelievably excited about what could happen in the future
' but we also understand there 's a lot of work needed before we even start thinking too much about winning races , even podiums and fighting for the world championship
' it 's a great base for the future , but it is going to take time
it 's not going to be an overnight thing
