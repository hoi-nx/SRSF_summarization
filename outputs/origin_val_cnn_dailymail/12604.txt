in 2011 , journalists flocked to kinshasa , the capital of the democratic republic of the congo , to cover the presidential election and the violence leading up to the vote
photographer leonard pongo had different plans
" i could have focused on the election , but i chose to follow people around , " leonard pongo said
" i wanted to experience what life in the country was like ... to understand another side of those events -- not those usually reported , but one that was much more personal
" it was leonard pongo 's burning personal quest that brings us " the uncanny , " a black - and - white series that helps us experience the democratic republic of the congo in flesh and blood
these rich portraitures and compositions of leonard pongo 's family members give us a vivid emotion of what it is like to be human as your country spirals into chaos
it is also a photographic detour from the cliche images of the democratic republic of the congo -- a subtler but deeply psychological representation of how war affects daily lives
war is something only experienced marginally by leonard pongo , who was born and raised in belgium to a belgium mother and a democratic republic of the congo father
stories of the democratic republic of the congo were narratives whispered into his european upbringing
" i had never been , " to democratic republic of the congo , he said
" it was a latent desire i had for a very long time to go there
i do n't feel particularly drawn to belgium ... but going ( to democratic republic of the congo ) made me feel even more lost
" connecting with his family in the democratic republic of the congo , the photographer attended baptisms and weddings , exorcisms and political rallies
everywhere he looked , he felt a challenge to his core beliefs as he went down his dna chain
" i felt very challenged in my identity , sometimes as a ' white , ' others as a ' black ' person , " leonard pongo said
" this led to many conflicts , internal and external ; many arguments ; and it also directed the way i photographed
" while feeling the warm welcome of his family , leonard pongo still felt a certain reticence when they looked at the camera
their trust was not always unshakable , and that state of awareness become synonymous with the democratic republic of the congo

he uses a photo of a family reunion -- the first in the gallery above -- as an example
" i find that photo a little disturbing , because all the gazes are going into different directions , " leonard pongo said
" there are clearly some mixed emotions here
and that is the democratic republic of the congo
it is a very complex country , and it is not always easy to read which signs are being communicated
there is a state of tension and confusion
" working with the approach of an artisan , leonard pongo plays with light to create a certain magic in the aura of the people he portrays
it is a useful tool in a place with so many contrasts
" i like to remain loyal to the principles of film development and darkrooms , " said leonard pongo , who shot " the uncanny " on a digital camera
" the light is a combination of using flashes and taking advantage of the amazing presence of the sun. the humid atmosphere , fog and dust renders some interesting possibilities ... like a natural filter
" leonard pongo went back in 2013 and said his journey through the country is not over yet
" i think i reached my objective , to embed into the daily life in the democratic republic of the congo , which clearly transformed me , " he said
" i was allowed into the life of people who were former strangers ... and got a deeper understanding of what daily life in the democratic republic of the congo could feel like
" i was also deeply impressed to discover how much life there is in this country , how much more there is to discover , how complex it is to understand , and how much work that will require
" leonard pongo is a photographer from belgium
