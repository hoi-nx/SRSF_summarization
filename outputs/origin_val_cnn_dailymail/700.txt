a high school student who suffers from autism and down syndrome was given a varsity letter by his mother to celebrate that he had begun playing special needs basketball at his high school , and then shockingly told he had no right to wear that letter
michael , who attends east high in wichita , kansas , wore the letter , which his mother purchased for him , on a jacket , until he was told to remove it and never wear it again at school
now though , many are coming out to show their support for michael - including the chicago bulls
when asked if that policy might change however , given the situation , he said ; ' we have considered it , and our decision was no. we decided that is not appropriate in our situation because it is not a varsity level competition
' wanting more answers , mrs. kelley turned to the district , who said there was no official rule about who could and cold not wear a varsity letter
as for how this all happened , mrs. kelley said ; ' another parent , from what i am told , was upset that my son was wearing his letter jacket
' michael however is getting a lot of support in the aftermath on this decision however , and a change.org petition to change this rule already has over 30,000 signatures
in addition , many are voicing their support for michael using the hashtag # givethemletters on twitter
also , griffin , the assistant coach of the chicago bulls , has donated an autographed jersey , basketball , and a derek rose bobble head to the kelley family which he says they can auction off and use to buy uniforms for the special needs basketball team michael plays on
' supporting michael , east high and all special needs student - athletes who share the passion and drive for the game i love
we are all blue aces ! ' wrote griffin , who attended east high sxchool
mrs. kelley ( above ) said ; ' another parent , from what i am told , was upset that my son was wearing his letter jacket
' ' teachers told the parents they would prefer he not wear the letter on his jacket , ' said east high principal ken thiessen what 's more , mark calvin , the principal and athletic director at santana high school in santana , kansas has sent one of their varsity letter for michael to wear
' before he got the letter he was one of the biggest cheerleaders in the school it was incredible , after he got the letter jacket it just sky rocketed him to another level , ' said calvin of michael
he then said of the situation ; ' we ca nât be cookie cutter
we have all kinds of kids with all kinds of different needs and we need to be able to make our rules adjust to meet those needs
' he added ; ' it âs a message to michael that you can be a part of something anywhere you want to
' as for mrs. kelley , she is not just fighting for her adopted son michael , but all the kids , saying ; ' it âs not just my son
it âs every student that was out there last night
it âs every student that âs there on fridays that plays their hardest and to the best of their capability regardless what that is
