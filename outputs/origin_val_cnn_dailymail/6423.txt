monty python member eric idle attended the royal school wolverhampton a Â£ 29,000 - a - year boarding school will scrap all its fees this september to become one of cameron 's latest free schools
the royal school wolverhampton , whose former pupils include the monty python member eric idle , will become a state school â with no fees to attend
the boarding school was one of 49 new free schools announced by the prime minister yesterday as part of a major expansion of the policy which allows schools to be set up by community groups including parents , charities or teachers
an extra 500 free schools will be opened by 2020 under a conservative government , mr cameron said
the royal school wolverhampton is the latest of several private schools to scrap fees and take state funding via the free schools programme
the most prestigious was liverpool college , while others included william hulme grammar school in manchester , queen elizabeth âs grammar school in blackburn , and chetwynde school in barrow in furness
pupils at the school who do nât board currently pay fees of Â£ 13,230 â but this will fall to nothing from september
families of children who board will see their fees drop to a boarding charge of between Â£ 10,000 and Â£ 14,000 a year
the school , in grounds of 25 acres , currently has 538 pupils , of whom 139 are boarders
as a state school it will expand to 1,200 children , with boarders dropping slightly to around 110
free schools were introduced in 2010 to allow parents and community groups to set up their own schools
they are independent from local authorities but must still undergo ofsted inspections
supporters say they help to drive up standards by creating competition with existing schools , but labour has opposed their creation in areas with a surplus of places where they are not needed
the new plan to open at least 500 of the schools by 2020 mean an extra 270,000 places
in a speech in london , mr cameron said : ' if you vote conservative , you will see the continuation of the free schools programme at the rate you 've seen in the last three years
' that means , over the next parliament , we hope to open at least 500 new free schools resulting in 270,000 new school places
' remember - we 're the only party that is committed to this
the only party that 's opening up the education system so we can get more good places for your children
the royal school wolverhampton was one of 49 new free schools announced by the prime minister yesterday ' and is n't that what every parent wants - a great education for their child ? you deserve the security of knowing your child is getting just that
and with the conservatives you should expect nothing less
' he also backed the idea of existing grammar schools
taking questions from the audience , mr cameron was asked about comments he made in 2007 that a ' pledge to build more grammar schools would be an electoral albatross '
he insisted : ' i have never said that grammar schools are an albatross , grammar schools are good schools and i like good schools
i want there to be good schools for people to send their children to
' what i 've said about grammar schools is , like other schools that are good , if they want to expand they should be able to expand
i have been very consistent about that
' education secretary education secretary said she would not allow free schools to make a profit , despite the move being supported by her predecessor gove
she said she wanted each school to ' make the right choice for them ' about whether to become a free school or academy
cameron talks with school children during a visit to the green school for girls in west london today asked if she could rule out a tory government allowing free schools to make a profit , she told bbc radio 4 's today programme : ' yes i can rule it out , i think having for profit education is something that would make me feel very uncomfortable and it is not something that is needed
' we have excellent sponsors like charities and others or parent groups wanting to run schools and they are doing an excellent job up and down the country
' mrs morgan 's insistence that there would be no profit - making schools for the whole of the next parliament suggests a shift in policy from her predecessor
mr gove , who lost his job as education secretary in july , had advocated allowing profit - making to encourage companies to set up successful free schools
in may 2012 he said : ' it 's my belief that we could move to that situation but at the moment it 's important to recognise that the free schools movement is succeeding without that element and i think we should cross that bridge when we come to it
' labour has criticised the free schools policy , claiming it can lead to money being channelled to areas where there is a surplus of school places instead of being targeted at areas where classes are overcrowded .
