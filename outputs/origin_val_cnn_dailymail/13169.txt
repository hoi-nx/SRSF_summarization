us weekly magazine has retracted a story about model and reality star kendall jenner and her father , former olympian bruce jenner
" we would like to retract the story entirely and have removed it from our website
we sincerely apologize to ms. jenner and her family , " the magazine said thursday on its website
us weekly had quoted the sister , a member of the kardashian family , as saying she supported her father , who has made entertainment headlines over rumors that he is becoming a woman
" he 's a wonderful man
and just because he 's changing shoes now , so to speak , does n't make him less wonderful
i will always love my dad , whether he 's a man or a woman , " the magazine quoted her as saying
but kendall jenner said she never said that
" how is it legal for someone to ' quote ' someone and publish it if in fact you never said what was quoted ? " she tweeted
us weekly said on its website : " the interview was allegedly conducted by an independent freelance journalist at the saturday , march 14 , taping of comedy central 's roast of justin bieber in los angeles
when ms. jenner denied , via twitter , that the interview took place , us weekly immediately reached out to the freelance reporter
" he stood by the interview , and continues to maintain that the quotes are accurate
however , after attempting to reconfirm his account , editors of us weekly have concerns about the veracity of this interview and the circumstances under which it was obtained
" bruce jenner has not commented publicly on speculation that he 's transitioning to a woman , so any comments from his relatives would essentially be confirming the rumors
cnn 's attempts to get comment from him , his agents and his mother about the rumors have gone unanswered .
