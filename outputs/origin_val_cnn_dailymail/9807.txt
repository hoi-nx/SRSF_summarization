mullins has described his historic achievement of having the first three home in the hurdle as his greatest ever training achievement
the dominant nine - time champion irish trainer has become used to swatting aside the opposition in his homeland and bruising the home defence with his increasingly potent cheltenham festival raids
but the feat of the ruby walsh - ridden 4 - 5 favourite faugheen leading home stablemates arctic fire and dual champion hurricane fly will take some surpassing even for a man who has won a grand national
the nearest any other trainer has come to matching what this modern - day racing william the conqueror achieved was irish colleague aidan oâbrien , who sent out istabraq and theatreworld to be first and second in both the 1998 and 1999 champion hurdles

mullins said : â a one - two - three is a dream
on paper it is my best training feat , certainly
to get three horses in that condition is good for anyone but then to get the luck in running is vital
â and it is even more remarkable given what else mullins managed on the first day of the cheltenham festival with three other winners â douvan ( 2 - 1 favourite ) beating stablemate shaneshill in the supreme â hurdle , un de sceaux ( 4 - 6 ) in the arkle challenge trophy and paul townend - ridden glens melody ( 6 - 1 ) in the olbg mares â hurdle
punters jumping on the mullins bandwagon cost the bookmaking industry an estimated Â£ 10million as they linked them in accumulator bets
but it could have been worse
ruby walsh - ridden annie power , 1 - 2 favourite and the horse mullins had regarded as his certainty of the day , was clear at the last in the mares â hurdle when taking a crashing fall
ruby walsh celebrates on faugheen after the seven - yeatr - old won the champion hurdle challenge trophy mullins said : â annie power got a horrible fall and she will have a sore neck and shoulder in the morning but she will be ok
it âs rare to have four runners on a day like this , let alone four winners
i keep saying to myself , â enjoy it while it lasts â
â you could nât write a script like that , but i just knew that all the horses were doing everything right
it was going scarily well and i thought coming here it was either going to be a great success or a blow - out
â the latter does not happen very often for mullins
the man who has now trained 37 cheltenham festival winners and has been top trainer at the meeting for three of the last four years might as well pop the trophy in his suitcase for the flight home
faugheen was imperious as he led home a mullins - trained one - two - three at the cheltenham festival douvan , like faugheen owned by former barclays investment banker rich ricci , had been decribed as one of the best mullins had brought to the cheltenham festival
he jumped with efficiency to set the ball rolling with a four and a half length win in the supreme
front - running un de sceaux proved fears about his headstrong nature were unfounded with a performance of total control in the arkle chase
and there was faugheen , the horse who has developed from an ugly duckling into a fully - fledged hurdling swan unbeaten in nine races
after he had made the running before sprinting clear off the home turn , mullins revealed ruby walsh had formulated the battle plan months ago , even though he had only confirmed he would ride the seven - year - old on saturday
ruby walsh glides over the fence on his way to winning the champions hurdle at cheltenham festival 2015 mullins said : â i did nât think he would win that impressively
i was wondering like punters , the media and the bookmakers , could he take on the grade one horses and beat them because we picked races for him that did not have top grade one horses in
it paid off and he learned his trade
ruby walsh rode him with huge confidence and he showed that he was the good horse ruby walsh and everybody else thought he was
â his next run is likely to be at the punchestown festival and he is 6 - 4 to win next year âs champion hurdle
but he still has somewhere to go to usurp dual champion hurricane fly in mullins â affections
â he is a very good horse and probably over hurdles the second best i âve trained
ruby walsh made his intentions clear as he took faugheen to the head of the line before the tapes went up
