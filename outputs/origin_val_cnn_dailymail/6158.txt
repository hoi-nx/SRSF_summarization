not content with second spot at fifa 's goal of the year award , republic of ireland women 's forward stephanie roche has added another wondergoal to her collection
the 25 - year - old came in just behind colombia forward james rodriguez 's world cup superstrike in the 2014 puskas award contenders - and if this effort is anything to go by she could be walking fifa 's red carpet alongside the likes of cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi again this year
last year roche took three touches before smashing in from outside the box for peamount united against wexford youths , but this time she needed just two to find the net with a brilliant dipping shot from 20 yards out for the republic of ireland against costa rica
