an indonesian minister has threatened to release a ' human tsunami ' of asylum seekers towards australia if the federal government continues to fight for a stay of execution for the bali nine duo
the warning came from the coordinating minister for political , legal and security affairs - tedjo - to remind the government who was working to keep asylum seekers away from australia shores , fairfax media reported
it comes after indonesian government officials took offence to prime minister tony abbott 's comments about australia donating $ 1 billion in aid to help recovery after the boxing day tsunami along with threatening to discourage visitors to bali
' if canberra keeps doing things that displease indonesia , jakarta will surely let the illegal immigrants go to australia , ' he said
' there are more than 10,000 [ asylum seekers ] in indonesia today
if they are let go to australia , it will be like a human tsunami
' mr tedjo - who is an outspoken politician in indonesia - added it was ' no big deal ' if trade relations with australia fell apart following the executions of andrew chan and myuran sukuraman
