a mother is demanding an apology from a trendy bar after claiming she and her friends were turned away for being ' too fat and ugly '
stacey owen was enjoying a night out with her two friends when she says her group was barred from entering neighbourhood bar , in spinningfields , manchester , because of their weight and looks
the 33 - year - old said the trio had arranged to meet a friend inside the bar but when they tried to walk in , they were held back by security staff who said it was too full
stacey owen claims she was enjoying a night out with friends and decided to head to the neighbourhood bar a shot from the interior of the bar which is alleged to have turned stacey owen and her friends away ' after a while a group of lads went in and the doormen said it was because there were too many women in and they try to balance the ratio so we thought " fine " , ' stacey owen said
however , the mother - of - one claims she and her friends became suspicious when they saw some other women walking straight into the bar
' then a group of women went in and we said " hang on what âs going on ? " and he turned to us and said " look , you âre too big and ugly to come in , i suggest you try elsewhere "
' i could nât believe what i âd just heard and asked him if he could say it again to make sure - he repeated " you âre too fat , you âre not getting in "
' i know i âm not exactly a supermodel , but i âve never known anything like it in terms of customer service , ' she said
' we were so shocked we did nât know what to do
it was so uncalled for and i âve never had anything so humiliating happen to me in my whole life
' for us the night was completely ruined and we just went home
' the travel rep , who lives in the droylsden area of manchester , said she and her friends were left feeling insulted and she said the least neighbourhood bosses could do was to apologise
stacey owen takes a selfie and said she was left feeling humiliated after the alleged incident on saturday night ' i âve been in touch to report the incident since and ask for an apology but they do nât seem interested and i âve had no response , ' she said
' i certainly wo nât be going back and wanted to draw attention to it because i do nât think they should be allowed to speak to people like that
â the alleged incident on saturday comes just a week after a hen party said they were called " chav cheap trash " and " peasants " by staff at city centre restaurant 47 king street west in manchester after posting a negative review online
lawyers for the owners insist that staff at neighbourhood are not rude or abusive to guests and ms stacey owen ' s claims are strongly denied .
