in court : shaneka monique torres , pictured in the courtroom during the first day of her trial on tuesday , is accused of opening fire on a mcdonald 's in february 2014 after they got her order wrong ' she says she pulled the trigger , but she did not pull it on purpose , ' beason said , according to mlive
intentional ? no. ' shaneka monique torres had gone to mcdonald 's the previous day for a burger but was unhappy to find it did not have bacon on it , as she had requested , police said
after speaking to the managers , they offered her a free bacon burger on her next visit , police said , and after drinking at clubs with a friend that night , she took them up on their offer
sitting in the passenger seat , she headed to the drive - thru at 2am - stopping to chat up a manager at one of the windows before giving him her number , which later helped police track her down

torres ' friend , nydia ray , who was driving the car , told the court her friend had not been upset by the lack of bacon on her burger
she said she saw the gun after handing the order back and was in the middle of saying ' what the f * * * is going on ? ' when it fired
the server , essence lake , had walked away from the window when she heard the shot and saw the hole in the glass , she said , adding the bullet would have struck her if she 'd still been by the window
' we went back and forth screaming and yelling and then we pulled off , ' ray said
the women went to ray 's home but not before a witness wrote down the plate number
police tracked the women down 30 minutes later
grand rapids police officer patrick loeb said ray told him that her friend had been upset over the order
she told him shaneka monique torres said something along the lines of ' do you know who you 're talking to ? ' before she fired - which ray has since denied
the trial will resume on wednesday
caught : shaneka monique torres was found soon after speeding away from the grand rapids mcdonald 's ( pictured ) because she 'd given her number to the restaurant 's manager as she flirted with him before the shooting
