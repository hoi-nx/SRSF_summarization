a u.s. coast guard ship was cutting ice on frozen - over st clair thursday morning when they came across a bizarre sight : a young man walking out on the ice alone in sub-freezing temperatures
when crew members brought the curious 25 - year - old man on board , he said he was trying to walk from detroit to toronto
detroit lies on the southwestern shore of st clair , and the unidentified ice - walker was found just half a mile from seaway island on the opposite shore
from there it 's a 201 - mile journey on land to reach the canada capital
detroit is on the southwestern shore of st clair , and the unidentified man was found just a half - mile from an island on the opposite shore all alone : coast guard say the man stood out since he was n't wearing the type of clothes used for snowmobiling or ice - fishing on the lake u.s. coast guard petty officer second class sjostrom first spotted the michigan man walking on the lake around 9:30am on thursday
the sight was especially odd considering how the man was dressed : in regular pedestrian clothes - not the heavy gear used for snowmobiling or ice fishing
he also was n't carrying a flotation device , and sjostrom says he could have easily broken through the ice and drowned
' that raised flags right off the bat , ' sjostrom told mlive
sjostrom and another coast guardsman then put on gear to walk on the ice towards the man who , though able to stand and walk , was clearly suffering from hypothermia
' when we got to him , you could tell the cold was getting to him , ' said sjostrom
' he was very lethargic ... he was shivering very bad
' he also would n't speak at first and had a ' 1,000 - yard stare '
when they got him back to the ship and started treating him for the cold , the man started talking and revealed his travel plans
it 's believed he had been walking for two to three days when the coast guard found him
the coast guard then brought the man back to port just after noon where he received further treatment
it was the first rescue by a great lakes ice cutter boat in four years
the boats break up ice on the lakes to clear travel for commercial shipping
' most of us joined the coast guard to protect life , ' lt. joshua zike , commanding officer of the neah bay , said in a prepared statement
' our primary mission during the winter months is breaking ice to keep commercial traffic moving , but preserving life will always come first
