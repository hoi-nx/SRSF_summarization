chelsea were knocked out by psg on wednesday night , with subjects ranging from the referee 's performance , ibrahimovic 's comments on the blues being ' babies ' , david luiz 's return and whether the premier league is still the best in the world
also , arsenal overcame their old trafford hoo - doo to beat manchester united on monday night , and the former gunners legend was at the game
but what was that ' money ' sign to arsene wenger all about ? you can read all the answers below
host commentator it âs certainly a good way to sum it up
if you think about how you âd react in that situation , he did nât know whether to laugh or be angry
he probably thought the referee had got it so wrong , and everyone could see it , that he âd get off the hook
the controlled reaction of the chelsea players was definitely a factor in the red card
many years ago , when i was playing under george graham against manchester united , he accused us of being too nice during half - time
he said we had to get around the referee as they were influencing every decision
from that day , i contested every decision , almost giving the referee a running commentary
i would often say , â who âs in charge , them or you ? â
there âs nothing worse for a referee to hear
i appreciated why people do nât like to see it , but as well as influencing the referee , it makes you fight and compete for everything
it makes you more alive and puts your receptors on red alert
it âs like a game within a game , and believe me , it works
niall came into the game quite late
as a youngster he did his a-levels and his club reading helped him through
just recently he âs turned a huge corner , particularly since steve clarke was appointed and started involving him in first - team training
ireland asked about him last year , but he had an operation , which curtailed his development
now he âs in the under 21 squad and we âre very proud
it looks ironic , given that i played for england , but a lot of my family were shocked i did nât play for ireland as i come from a big irish family
i could have played with as much passion for ireland as i did for england , and it âs niall âs right to play for ireland , too
it was a clear demonstration from manchester united that he âs not going to be a part of their future
we know he has nât played well , and he looks like he âs lost some sharpness because of his knee injury
though his last contribution for manchester united , winning a penalty against sunderland , was very important and has been largely overlooked
he has nât played since ! i think letting him go is probably the right call though
he âs not sharp enough , and does nât strike fear into the opposition
he looks to have given up trying to certain extent
i think van gaal is largely responsible for manchester united âs situation at the moment though , not the players
man management was sir alex ferguson âs forte , and some players find it harder to cope than others
mangers have to work with players â minds , bodies and hearts
and when all is not right in their mind they will react to everything
it feels like van gaal has created this environment
alex ferguson would squeeze every ounce out of his players
if he were still there , they would nât be so far away from top of league
i do nât blame either of them , ben
they were shown the door , so why not ? when roman abramovich first took over at chelsea , he offered a lot of money for henry , but arsenal refused and henry was flattered by it
i think david luiz would have been half - hoping for that same reaction from chelsea
as for danny welbeck , he âs a young man early in his career and was never really given a chance as a centre forward â his preferred role
and then there were the unnecessary comments from van gaal , claiming danny welbeck was only good enough to be a substitute at manchester united
he wanted to fulfill his dreams at manchester united and he had to listen to that
now he has the chance to fulfill his dreams with arsenal
everyone in the studio thought it was so funny
it âs like showing a montage of gary [ lineker ] 's misses ! i was trying to explain that andy cole âs run takes me off giggs âs line so i ended up caught in the middle
my most vivid memory is from after the game when i went into manchester united dressing room to show some respect , but they were in full celebration mode and did nât show a great deal of respect to us
i felt i had to say something though , it was an epic battle
but they were nât better than us that day , put it that way ... i had to have my smile surgically removed ! it was fantastic
i must admit , i was surprised at how many of the young manchester united fans in the ground wanted photos with me and autographs
i had to walk through the manchester united fans to get to the gantry , and it was a bit intimidating , but overall it was fine
maybe , because the fans were so young , that had nât seen everything that used to go on ! there was one occasion when i exclaimed out loud when arsenal wasted a chance â that got a few comments from the crowd , but it was good to feel like part of my old club again
all credit to david luiz â he has so much self - belief
people were saying jose mourinho was a genius for letting him go , but was he a genius last night , calvin ? of course , he had to let him go for that kind of money
it âs just unfortunate for him that the player came back to demonstrate he was worth every penny
though i must say , silva was magnificent with those successive headers at the other end late on
you could nât have written a better script
david luiz looks like the hero at his old ground , then silva gives a horror penalty away but snatches the winning goal
it âs a valid argument , jaymie
however , i think chelsea âs performance has quite a lot to do with winning the capital one cup
i âve never liked that trophy being awarded so early in season
it âs possible you âll lose focus , making it tough to keep going
when chelsea celebrated winning the cup i think they were also enjoying the fact that manchester city had lost to liverpool earlier in the day
they were probably thinking they had the league title wrapped up that weekend as well as the capital one cup
that looks to have taken the edge off of them
they had a tough game against west ham afterwards , and they were very lucky to get a result there
they look to have the wrong mentality
money sign ? we were talking about the grass ! the old trafford pitch is part synthetic , part grass , which was a change sanctioned by david moyes last season
we were remarking on how it compares to a normal grass pitch
i do nât think it makes it any less interesting , nico , but whether it âs the best ? i âm not even sure i thought it was best when chelsea and manchester united were in the champions league final in 2008
before christmas , it looked like chelsea and real madrid could win it
suddenly there are huge question marks
it âs all about finding consistency and form at right time
the workload does nât help , but chelsea had seven days to prepare
routine is everything for footballers , and perhaps going from a game every three days to one a week might have affected them
usually chelsea control the tempo
they tried to press , but the likes of thiago motta and marco verratti were so calm and technically gifted ... this forced the chelsea players to sit off a bit as they could nât get the ball off them
psg did nât panic with ten men , they were brave and kept the ball in tight situations
they just ignored the fact they had 10 men , it was an incredible show of strength
it was like they had been hypnotised into thinking they had 11 men ! jose mourinho was just as guilty as his team
usually he âs very decisive â sending on three subs if he needs to â and gets it spot on
but he had them time wasting after they scored the first goal
they did nât go out to win the match
ibrahimovic goes to ground , realises he could make heavy contact and tries to pull away - i agree
oscar knows exactly what he âs doing by feigning injury â it âs not nearly as bad as he makes out
i do nât think he should have been sent off , i âm not even sure it was a booking
the speed at which the chelsea players all surround the referee is important â it âs the quickest you âll ever see john terry run ! they ca nât even be certain what âs happened or if their player is injured , but it does nât stop at least five or six of them waving their arms in air
it âs a calculated , orchestrated reaction , and they âve been doing it for a while .
