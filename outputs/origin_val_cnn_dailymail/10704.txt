the envie dâart gallery , in south kensington , london , had been asked to look after the painting while the home of the customer who purchased it was undergoing renovations
but when the art lover asked for it to be delivered three years later , the gallery gave him an apparent imitation - and then tried to convince him it was his original
the standard reports that gallery manager hassler had mistakenly sold the painting while they were storing it for the customer
the newspaper quotes a source as saying that the gallery initially said it was having trouble locating the painting and asked the customer whether he had a picture of the artwork to help them trace it
he did not have an image â but weeks later he was informed it had been found in envie dâart âs paris gallery
once it had been picked up in london , the customer spotted differences and asked if the artist had carried out any extra work on the painting
after being told this had not happened , he took his purchase home , only to find that the artist âs signature was dated three years after he bought it
the standard quotes the source as saying that the customer eventually found an email picture of his original and saw that he had been given a â rather ugly copy â
the source said the gallery manager had â panicked â when the customer asked for his painting back and ordered a new commission that was â in the spirit â of the original â for a new client â
after being threatened with legal action , the gallery eventually admitted its error
