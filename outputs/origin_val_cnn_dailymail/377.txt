tebow , whose stint as a nfl quarterback briefly sparked ' tebow - mania ' , spent monday trying to make a comeback in a workout for the eagles
but after one day of training , tebow left without being signed , according to espn nfl insider schefter
the 27 - year - old who once played for the denver and new york jets performed for the eagles and coach kelly in hopes of trying out for a quarterback position , a source told ap. tebow , pictured in august 20123 , trained with the eagles on monday in an attempt to try out for a quarterback position considering all the offseason moves made by kelly , taking a look at the 2007 heisman trophy winner with the huge following should n't be a surprise
it has been speculated that tebow could run zone - read plays better than philadelphia 's four current quarterbacks
tebow elicited interest from millions of fans in large part for his public displays of religious faith on and off the field , a head - bowing genuflecting move on one knee that became known as ' tebowing ' in the wake of his success
in 2011 , tebow began the season as a backup with the denver but was given a chance to start after a 1 - 4 start
tebow sparked a string of come - from - behind victories and led denver into the playoffs and an upset of pittsburgh in the first round
but tebow 's 47 - per cent pass - completion rate was the worst in the nfl that season and when the denver signed peyton manning in 2012 , tebow became expendable
he was sent to the new york jets in a trade
tebow was seldom used even as new york jets starter sanchez struggled
he was released in 2013 having thrown only eight passes and run just 32 times in his lone season in new york
the new england patriots made tebow one of their final roster cuts in 2013 and he spent last year as a college gridiron television commentator when no nfl team wanted him
tebow , pictured here in august 2013 , left training on monday without signing with the eagles
but espn nfl insider schefter left the idea open , claiming ' we 'll see if anything changes ' tebow was being assessed by an eagles team that features sanchez , who joined philadelphia after his own departure from the new york jets , and bradford , a quarterback who missed most of last season with a torn left knee ligament
bradford was the second sophomore player to win the heisman trophy as the top college player , doing so in 2008
tebow had been the first in 2007
tebow has an 8 - 6 record as an nfl starting quarterback with a career 48 - per cent completion rate for 2,422 yards with 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions
schefter announced on twitter that the eagles decided not to sign tebow , but left the option open
' tebow has come and gone from philadelphia
team is not planning to sign him at this time
we 'll see if anything changes , ' he wrote
kelly 's remake of the eagles ' roster has included trading star running back lesean mccoy to buffalo , then signing offensive player of the year demarco murray to replace him
clearly , kelly - who took over personnel duties after last season - is unafraid to look anywhere for possible upgrades
although tebow had some success in denver , his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence has plagued him in the nfl
his strength has been running the ball or improvising
there 's also been some thought that tebow might switch to tight end or fullback , although he has balked at such a move in the past
the eagles have depth at tight end , but no fullbacks on the roster .
