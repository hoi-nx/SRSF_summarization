beijing chinese 's premier on sunday offered a sobering assessment of the world 's second largest economy amid fears of a sustained slowdown but brushed aside concern that it could face a full - blown economic crisis
" i do n't deny that the chinese economy is facing downward pressure and multiple risks , " said li at a nationally televised press conference
" the key is to find the balance between stable growth and structural adjustments under the new normal ( of slower growth )
" " we have n't adopted the policy of strong short - term stimulus in recent years -- in other words ... we still have plenty of tools in our toolbox , " he offered
earlier this month , the people 's bank of china -- the central bank -- cut interest rates to guard against deflation and the country set its lowest growth target in 25 years
li , the no. 2 leader in chinese behind president xi jinping , also promised a further streamlined government to strengthen the role of free market in the economy
" the pain of reform is still there , actually the pain is becoming more acute and in more places , " he said
" during the course of reform , vested interested will be tested -- but this is not nail clipping , this is like cutting off one 's limb with a sword and we have to do it despite the pain
" li held the highly choreographed annual press conference -- often the only occasion a senior chinese leader faces the media -- after chinese 's rubber - stamp parliament approved the government budget and concluded this year 's 10 - day session
li answered questions from pre-selected journalists that focused on the economy and touched on the government 's stance on the anti-corruption campaign , the environment and foreign policy
before he was ushered out of the ornate room , the premier responded to a question shouted from the audience about myanmar , whose warplanes reportedly dropped a bomb friday in a chinese border town and killed four civilians
" we have the responsibility and capability to firmly safeguard the stability of the chinese - myanmar border -- and will firmly protect the lives and property of our citizens , " li said to applause from chinese reporters .
