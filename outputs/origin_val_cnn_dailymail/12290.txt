many years ago , a colleague told me how frustrated her husband was by " amazon mom , " a special membership program offered by the retail giant that provides discounts , recommendations and other information to help parents during the crazy toddler years
in bold print , the company says the program is " open to anyone , whether you 're a mom , dad , grandparent , or caretaker
" but still it is called " amazon mom , " irking my colleague 's husband to no end since he was the one ordering the majority of diapers and other products for their babies
' dad ' gets a makeover in super bowl ads my friend 's husband was not alone
a petition created a few years ago calls on amazon to change the name of the program from " amazon mom " to " amazon family
" but the drive did n't get much traction
that changed after the recent death of a beloved dad blogger , miller , who created a facebook group for dad bloggers in 2012 that has grown to more than 1,000 members
in 2013 , miller called on men and women to sign the petition to get amazon to change the name of the program
" why did amazon bother changing the name of its parenting program when the program started in the united kingdom ? what made them realize they could n't get away with calling it ' amazon mom , ' and why do they get away with it here ? " miller wrote
" someone actually started a petition to change the name to ' amazon family ' in the america , and so far it has less than 100 signatures
why is that ? why are we ok with letting england be more progressive than we are here when it comes to fatherhood ? they have a queen ! they are ruled by a freakin ' queen ! we can do better than that ! " he wrote
no more dumb old dad : changing the bumbling father stereotype i had the pleasure of interviewing miller for a story last year on whether modern dads get enough credit
the 42 - year - old stay - at - home father of two , who fought perceptions of fathers as nothing more than babysitters in essays on his blog , was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014
miller , of owings mills , maryland , died saturday
now , members of the dad blogging community are rallying in his honor , trying to step up the pressure on the internet powerhouse to finally change the name of its program and get with the times
heenan , a stay - at - home father of two in northern california and founder of the blog at - home dad matters , never got to meet miller but says that when miller welcomed him into his community of dad bloggers , it changed his life
" he got me writing again , inspired me to publish , to contribute , to tell my story ... to be a better dad for my daughters
" heenan , like several other dad bloggers , took to twitter using the # amazonfamilyus hashtag to call for amazon to make the change
" the push for inclusivity in the parenting arena has been well received by many a brand in the past few years and , like miller , many of us think the change to ' amazon family ' is a no - brainer , " heenan said
judgy moms and dads face off in hit ad bishop , a father of two in calgary , alberta , and founder of the blog dad camp , points out how amazon calls its program " amazon family " in germany , japan , austria , france and canada as well as the united kingdom
" so why is it called ' amazon mom ' in america ? " bishop wrote in a blog post
" we are continuing a cause that was once championed by the creator of the facebook group , miller , " wrote bishop
" in his name , we want to finish the job
" the petition has gotten over 4,800 signatures
amazon has not commented on the movement
in the meantime , miller 's supporters wo n't stop pushing
i hope they never do
