it is the first feature film to tell the story of the ordinary british women at the turn of the last century who risked everything in the fight for equality and the right to vote
so it seems only right that the cast behind movie suffragette , which focuses on the role emmeline played in that movement , should get together to mark international women 's day
posing in a specially released photograph , actresses meryl streep and helena bonham carter , who star in the film , set to be released in september , are joined by relatives of the woman considered the leader of the suffragette

the film will bring to life the the british women 's suffrage movement of the late 19th and early 20th century , with famed suffragette emmeline ( played by meryl streep ) among the main characters
meryl streep , 64 , makes her grand appearance as emmeline , the political firebrand who paved the way for women to get the vote by supporting the war effort during the first world war , and who ultimately ran for office as a parliamentary candidate for the conservative party
the actress commented : ' every daughter should know this history , every son write it on his own heart
' both helena bonham carter and carey mulligan have been spotted filming for the movie outside holloway in london
a picture of the late emmeline using a polling booth in circa 1910
emmeline was the leader of the movement and fought tirelessly for women 's right to vote the actresses were shooting scenes at her majesty âs prison in islington , which held some of the biggest figures of the suffrage movement
carey mulligan plays one of the female foot soldiers in the women âs rights movement , and sees to visiting the suffragettes who were arrested and incarcerated during that period
helena too wears the badge of the suffrage movement , carrying small bouquets of flowers in the green , white and violet colours of the women 's social and political union
meryl streep dressed as emmeline , and helena bonham carter , right , during filming for suffragette holloway was opened in 1852 as a mixed prison , and became female - only in 1903 , but it is nât the only prison being used to capture scenes for the film as camera crews descended on ruthin gaol in wales to film extras dressed as wardens and prisoners
the site was used to replicate interior shots of hm holloway prison where 27 women were locked up after emmeline led a protest march of 300 on parliament square , now known as black friday
two years later emmeline was convicted of conspiracy to commit property damage she led another militant protest after the conciliation bills ( which would give women the vote ) were put in jeopardy
inside holloway , emmeline staged her first hunger strike to improve conditions for other suffragettes in nearby cells and spoke about the horrible conditions of the female - only prison in her autobiography : â holloway became a place of horror and torment
sickening scenes of violence took place almost every hour of the day , as the doctors went from cell to cell performing their hideous office
â emmeline was arrested numerous times but was frequently released after several days because of her ill - health from hunger strikes , but was re-incarcerated under the â cat and mouse â act of 1913
other notable suffragettes who were imprisoned at holloway were anne miller fraser , constance markeivicz , charlotte despard , mary richardson , hanna sheehy-skeffington and norah elam
the houses of parliament have also opened their doors to the movie , which is the first time the political establishment has been used as a set for a commercial film
carey mulligan and helena were joined outside the building by hundreds of extras playing protesters , and there have also been scenes filmed in the central lobby and a committee room
mps granted the production permission to use the historic building while they were away on easter recess to subsidise the cost of maintaining parliament
suffragette âs director , gavron told the bbc : â our film is inspired by the true stories of the foot soldiers of the suffragette movement , women who were willing to sacrifice everything in their fight for the right to vote
â we are honoured to be allowed to recreate a crucial moment in that long journey towards equality by filming where the suffragette actually brought their protest over 100 years ago
â the theme for international women 's day 2015 is ' make it happen '
according to the british film institute ( british film institute ) , in the seven years from 2007 to 2013 , the average percentage of british films released each year that were directed by women was 12 ; and for films written by women the percentage was little better at 14.8
gavron added : ' international women 's day celebrates the achievements of women throughout the world and i am overjoyed that my film can be part of that celebration
' the story of the ordinary british women who were willing to sacrifice everything in their fight for the right to vote is an inspiration to all of us in our ongoing fight for equality
