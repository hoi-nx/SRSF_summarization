passengers aboard a skywest flight to puerto vallarta , mexico , were stunned tuesday when an hour from reaching their sunny vacation destination , their pilot turned the plane around due to ' paperwork issues
' flight 4507 departed salt lake city just after noon tuesday , carrying 57 travelers en route to the popular resort town on the pacific ocean
but less than two hours into the three - hour flight , a pilot 's voice came over the intercom to announce that the small canadair jet will be returning back to utah
the pilot explained to passengers that he could not land in puerto vallarta
instead , he said the plane will be diverted to tucson , arizona , to be refueled before returning to salt lake city
' again , we do apologize , ' the pilot said over the intercom to the 57 disappointed passengers

â it does n't sound like maybe the whole story
â a spokeswoman for skywest stated that flight 4507 landed in salt lake city at around 6pm to correct a ' paperwork issue

â we apologize to those customers we 've inconvenienced and are working to get them on their way as quickly as possible , â the statement read
the airline representative did not specify the paperwork issue that kept the skywest plane from landing in mexico tuesday
