he is the protege of total football mastermind rinus michels , but ' little general ' advocaat has been pitched straight into battle at sunderland
in nine games there will be little time to roll out the revered brand of football which won fame and acclaim with the ajax and holland teams of the 1970s
instead , the 67 - year - old is tasked with saving a failing side from relegation
then , successful or otherwise , he will be gone
but who is the man who , at 67 , is making his premier league debut as sunderland âs oldest - ever manager ? advocaat ( left ) in action during his playing days for roda against psv advocaat on a cycle ride when assistant coach with holland in 1987 - seen here with adri van tiggelen , ronald koeman , rene van der gijp and marco van basten advocaat has held many managerial positions both in his native holland and abroad - see here at psv in 1996 advocaat is best remembered in great britain for his two league titles with rangers in the late 1990s advocaat certainly does nât want for experience
this is the 18th job of a 28 - year managerial career which has taken in nearly 900 matches and yielded 10 major trophies
he is best known on these shores for three - and - a - half years at rangers , a stay which produced two spl titles â including a record 21 - point winning margin â two scottish cups and a league cup
advocaat , though , has since been accused of reckless spending â a claim he defends â and it was at ibrox that he splashed out a club record Â£ 12million for chelsea striker flo
that name alone is enough to cause alarm among followers of sunderland
for they paid rangers Â£ 6.75m for the norwegian after a relatively successful two years north of the border
sunderland appoint advocaat as manager there will be a few familiure faces in the premier league for advocaat
he has worked with and against ronald koeman in holland manchester united manager louis van gaal is another manager that advocaat knows well former england , manchester city and leicester boss sven goran eriksson is someone else that advovaat knows from his time in the game successful , however , is not a word used to reflect on his time at the stadium of light and , after four league goals in 29 appearances , he left on a free transfer
that , of course , is not advocaat âs fault and there will be no scope for new additions during his time on wearside , should the flo connection cast doubt over his judgment
rather , it will be his ability to make a snap judgement on those already in residence which will determine his legacy with the black cats
he is certainly well remembered at the likes of psv and zenit st petersburg , where in 2008 his domestic champions beat former club rangers in the final of the uefa cup , a triumph which won him honorary citizenship of the russian city
working with premier league players will not be new to advocaat as he has come across many in his time in international football - including manchester united 's marouane fellaini while he was coach of belgium between 2009 - 10 former arsenal star andrey arshavin is another player advocaat has worked with during his time as russia manager between 2010 - 12 advocaat signed brazilian international giovane elber for german side borussia monchengladbach in 2005 during his first spell in eindhoven in the mid-nineties he lifted the dutch cup and eredivisie title , working with the likes of brazilian striker ronaldo
his second stint in 2012 saw the club finish second in the league and lose in the cup final , but a win ratio of 65 per cent equalled that of his initial tenure and still stands as the best of his career
were he to win six of nine matches with sunderland then it would perhaps eclipse everything he has achieved
but there have been rocky times , too
advocaat has nine games left in the premier league season and his aim is to ensure sunderland do n't go down despite his years of managerial experience , advocaat has never been in a relegation battle before he was hounded from his second spell as holland national - team boss after both the media and supporters were critical of his handling of the team , despite them reaching the semi-finals of euro 2004
ten years earlier he took holland to the last eight of the world cup but was on the brink of losing his job before the finals in the usa after a fallout with star player ruud gullit , who retired from international football in protest
subsequent posts at south korea and russia saw his teams fail to emerge from the group stages of world cup 2006 and euro 2012 respectively , while his latest job was an unhappy five - month period in charge of serbia , where he was sacked in november
despite his origin as a pupil of michels , advocaat has been criticised for playing defensive football with too much emphasis on structure and discipline
however , on the evidence of sunderland âs shambolic 4 - 0 defeat to aston villa on saturday , structure and discipline is probably the best place to start .
