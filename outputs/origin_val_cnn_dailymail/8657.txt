if you 've ever given blood , you 'll know that even the most skilled nurses and doctors can struggle to locate the vein first time
so hospitals in the us are trialling a device that can locate veins inside a person âs arm using harmless near - infrared light
called christie , the device detects veins and then projects the image of them in real - time on top of the arm to help the medical worker know where to put the needle
called veinviewer ( shown ) it uses infrared light to look ' under ' the skin
it can then project a high - definition image of the veins onto the surface of the skin
the device enables doctors and nurses to find a vein immediately the medical system was designed by memphis - based company christie medical holdings
it shows a picture of your veins directly on your skin âs surface , â hopefully saving you from the unnecessary pain of multiple needle stings , â said the company
the device attaches to a movable arm that can be wheeled into position , to keep it steady while observing a patient âs arm
it works by emitting near - infrared light , which is absorbed by hemoglobin in the blood and then reflected by surrounding tissue
the information is processed digitally by the unit , and projected in real - time onto the skin

a fine detail mode also increases the contrast in the image , bringing out more detailed vein formations
this can allow a clinician to find turns in a person 's veins , called bifurcations , and valves
the user can also take up to 200 static images of patient vasculature - the arrangement of blood vessels in the body
â only veinviewer can provide pre , during and post-access benefits throughout the entire vascular access procedure , â said christie âs president , george pinho
â it is also the only device of its kind that has been shown through clinical studies to increase both first - stick success and patient satisfaction by up to 100 per cent while reducing medically unnecessary [ catheter ] lines by over 30 percent

it has a cub - like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor - level bed to a bath , for example
it weighs 309lb ( 140kg ) with extending legs that stop the ' bear ' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms
robear was developed by the riken-srk collaboration centre for human-interactive robot research in nagoya , japan .
