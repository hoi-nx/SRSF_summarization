police have been accused of creating a â charter for criminals â with a scheme that allows officers to ignore low - value offences
the powers mean they can dismiss a crime if the investigation cost outweighs the value of the item stolen or damaged
victims have been told that unless the stolen object exceeds Â£ 50 in value , police do not have to bother with an investigation
police have been accused of creating a â charter for criminals â with a scheme that allows officers to ignore low - value offences ( file picture ) last night the move was roundly condemned by mps , anti-crime campaigners and criminologists who said the scheme handed offenders a â licence to steal â
they said the police power of â discretionary disposal â could forever change the criminal justice system which was founded on a principle of caution or prosecute
williams , a businessman who had his fridge stolen , was stunned to hear police would not investigate as it was worth less than Â£ 50
the 50 - year - old , of new ferry , wirral , was selling the fridge on ebay , with the buyer picking it up from his flat
the fridge was loaded into his van and he told mr williams he would secure it and then pay him
instead , he drove away
mr williams called police , giving them the vehicle registration , the man âs name and description and details of his ebay account
williams ( pictured ) was told police would not investigate the theft of his fridge because it was worth less than Â£ 50 but he received a letter a few days later from merseyside police , which read : â i am sorry to inform you that the theft that you reported will not be investigated due to the low value of the fridge ( Â£ 16.00 ) as the cost of the investigation would outweigh the cost of the item stolen
â the crime report will be closed using the police discretionary disposal method as it is not in the public interest to pursue the offender
â mr williams said : â i was absolutely astonished police have been handed the power â¦ it is a charter for criminals , a licence to commit crimes
' they could make a mint stealing items under the value of Â£ 50 and never face a courtroom
â he added : â this anoints police the judge and jury â¦ criminals who can be pursued and brought to justice will simply escape unpunished to go on to more serious and larger crimes
â discretionary disposals , created to save policing costs , were first introduced in northern ireland and have yet to be widely used on the british mainland
but critics expressed concern that the power was an option at all
david green , criminologist and founder of think - tank civitas , said : â in areas where there are problems of disorder it could end up tipping the balance in favour of the criminal element as opposed to the law - abiding
â nick de bois , tory mp of the justice select committee , said the disposals send â a signal that crime is ok and will be tolerated at a certain level â , adding : â if we let this take root then we are looking at criminal justice from the wrong end of the telescope
â others said the powers had been introduced by stealth to avoid public outcry and called for an explanation from the home office
a spokesman for families against crime said : â this is a preposterous scheme â¦ it âs time the home office stamped it out
â a home office spokesman said : â this government expects all police forces to investigate all crimes reported to them
â merseyside police stood by the use of discretionary disposal , which it introduced two years ago , but said it was wrongly applied in mr williams âs case â and would make â further enquiries â
a spokesman said the scheme allowed officers to focus on the â most serious â crimes , not those â highly unlikely to be detected â .
