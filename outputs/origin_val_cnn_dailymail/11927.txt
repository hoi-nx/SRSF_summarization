customers have taken h&m 's global facebook page in anger after being refused entry to h&m 's new store in indooroopilly , in brisbane 's western suburbs , with their trolleys one woman said it was ' rude ' she was not allowed to bring her trolley in but others with prams were welcomed
' when i questioned why , the guy told me someone could get hurt by the trolley , because it made out of steel , ' she wrote
' when i pointed out that prams are also made of metal and are just as bulky as a trolley and someone could also get hurt by them
' he just replied it the company policy for both our stores
' do you also stop people in wheelchairs entering your store cause they are made of steel ? shame shame on your stores [ sic ]
' one woman said it was rude for shoppers who had trolleys to be turned away while those with prams were allowed a man said he had a similar experience saying he took his business elsewhere because of the snub a representative of h&m replied to her facebook message and apologised for the ' negative experience ' , but echoed the response the woman got in the store
' currently our policy does indeed restrict trolleys within the store , however we are always looking to improve our experience for customers and are currently reviewing this , ' the representative said
they added : ' please email us at info.au@hm.com if you would like to discuss this matter further
' dissatisfied with the response , the woman said she would not be shopping with the retailer again
' i will never again try and enter your store , ' she wrote
' i think your store needs too show some respect to the consumer
' while another woman said she ' wo n't bother returning again ' because she was refused entry for having a trolley a h&m spokeswoman said a higher incidence of accidents happened when trolleys were inside the store a spokeswoman for the retailer told daily mail australia they had experienced a higher incidence of trolley - related injuries when they were allowed in store
' however we do appreciate the feedback we have received from our customers so we are continuing to evaluate this policy , ' she said
the spokeswoman further clarified : ' this policy is in no way related to our customers with prams or in wheelchairs who are of course welcome in all of our stores
' but there were others who expressed displeasure about h&m 's no trolley policy
one man said he had planned to spend $ 500 in the store until he was told he could not enter
' i had my special needs 4 year old in the trolley to keep her contained ... the trolley was to have room for the big purchase i was going to make
all that money went elsewhere [ sic ] , ' he said
while another woman also felt compelled to share her experience online and said she would not attempt to shop at h&m again
' i was so excited to check out your indooroopilly store today but was refused entry because i had my 2 children in a trolley
i wo n't bother returning again , ' she said .
