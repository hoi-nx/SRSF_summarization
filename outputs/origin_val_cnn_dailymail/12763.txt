new york city public schools will now observe two muslim holidays , officials announced wednesday , making the district -- the nation 's biggest -- one of the few to put islam holy days on its calendar
under the change announced by new york city mayor bill de blasio and city schools chancellor farina , there will be no class for eid al-adha , also known as the eid al-adha , starting next september 24
another muslim holiday , eid al-fitr -- a festival marking the end of the holy month of ramadan -- will become a holiday for those in summer school starting in 2016
" this is a common - sense change , " de bill de blasio said wednesday , " and one that recognizes our growing muslim community and honors its contributions to our city
" the decision affects some 1 million students in new york city
while it 's not known exactly how many of them are muslim , city council speaker melissa mark-viverito said that almost 1 million of the more than 8 million people in the city 's five boroughs practice islam and a 2009 columbia university study found that roughly 10 % of new york city public school students are muslim
the move is n't a surprise , given bill de blasio 's campaign pledge to alter the school calendar with muslim families in mind
" muslim students and their families who observe eid al-fitr and eid al-adha should n't have to choose between an instructional day and their religious obligations , " said farina
" this new addition will also enable a teachable moment in the classroom for our students to learn about religious tolerance and the societal contributions of various cultures
" linda sarsour , executive director of the arab american association of new york city and the parent of three public school students , said a plan in which students would n't have to choose between education and faith " a win for our children and for future generations in this country
" " muslims are a part of the fabric of this country , " she said
" we make our country proud , and today , new york city made us proud
" new york city joins school districts in other states , including new jersey , massachusetts and vermont , that similarly observe muslim holidays , according to a news release from farina 's office
and eid al-fitr and eid al-adha join other religious holidays already on new york city 's public school calendar
in addition to holidays like easter that always fall on a weekend , students already have christian holidays such as good friday and christmas off , as well as the jewish holidays of rosh hashanah and yom kippur
