the eu is set to lift a ban on imports of chicken from the usa which are washed with a suspect acid disinfectant
usa producers routinely wash raw chicken following slaughter with a substance called peroxyacetic acid ( paa ) to remove harmful bacteria
the practice has been banned in british and european for many years because of a determination to remove harmful bugs at source , rather than using disinfectants to clean up carcasses
there are also concerns that reliance on these washes could put consumers at risk by playing a part in the creation of superbugs
however , the european commission has signalled that it plans to lift the ban following pressure from the usa government and usa chicken producers
the eu has lifted a ban on usa chickens which are washed in an acid it is feared helps cause superbugs the proposal has alarmed consumer groups , who say it is at odds with european policy , which has been designed to remove harmful bacteria from the birds on farms , rather than relying on disinfectants
just last week , the chef and food campaigner , jamie oliver , warned that british and european risk importing inferior food from the usa under a new free trade deal called ttip
campaigners say the changes being planned to allow chicken washed with paa are exactly the sort of thing that will become more common under the ttip regime
mute schimpf , food campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said : â the eu âs approach to food safety is under attack , even before any trade deal with the usa is agreed
â despite repeated denial from the eu and national governments , the pressure is increasing to allow more imports of factory farmed meat rinsed in disinfectants
the eu must take a clear stand and ban all imports of meat produced in this way , and show the public that it is not caving in to usa trade interests
â celebrity chef jamie oliver has warned lowering standards risks allowing poor - quality usa food into the british market in the past , eu national governments have blocked moves by the european commission to approve imports of â chlorinated chicken â from the usa â chicken cleaned with a chlorine and water wash to kill bugs
this was done as a precaution and because it could mask poor hygiene standards , as well as harm the health of workers in abattoirs and lead to pollution
consumer groups argue that these same safeguards should be applied to the use of paa and imports of chicken cleaned with the disinfectant
the european consumer organisation beuc insists that health and safety should be put ahead of a desire to improve trade relations with the usa
it said : â as the eu and the usa are engaged into talks for a free trade agreement , we look to eu authorities not to let their decision driven solely by trade considerations but to put food safety and consumer protection first
â beuc said allowing the use of these chemical treatments opens the door to lower hygiene standards on farms and in slaughterhouses
this is because producers may believe they can wash away any contaminants , rather than ensuring they are not there in the first place
it said : â we are concerned that paa washes will not deliver any extra safety net
rather , we see the risk they might be seen as a convenient substitute for good slaughter hygiene
â the availability of such treatment might lead slaughterhouse staff to be less vigilant on preventing carcass contamination to happen in the first place , hence putting consumers â health at risk
â the european food safety authority has ruled that paa is not toxic to humans , although it can trigger asthma and allergies in workers at processing plants where it is used
the death of a poultry inspector made the headlines in the usa in 2013 and raised questions about the health risks associated with the use of chemical decontamination treatments of meat such as paa
beuc is also concerned that bugs might mutate and become immune to the chemicals used in the washing process , so getting through to the meat sold in supermarkets and restaurants
consumer groups have said shoppers do n't like the idea of their meat having been washed in chemicals the group said there is also sound research showing shoppers do not like the idea of their chicken being treated with an acid wash
research by the consumer group which ? in 2011 showed that 60 per cent of people were unlikely to buy chicken that had been sprayed or washed with a mild acid
the british poultry council said the british and european tradition of trying to keep harmful bugs out of the food chain , from farm to fork , was better for the public than relying on chemical disinfectants
chief executive , andrew large , said : â chemical treatments should never be used as a substitute for good hygiene practice
' european food safety authority has confirmed that peroxyacetic acid is safe to use in food production , but british poultry producers are not yet convinced its use is in the best interests of consumers compared to our farm - to - fork system
