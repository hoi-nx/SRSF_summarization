this is the massive mexican , red rump tarantula discovered wandering around a football pitch in maesteg , south wales by a concerned member of the public
bridgend council , which is now trying to track down the tarantula 's owner , was alerted after the spider - which is not generally harmful to humans - was spotted by a passer - by at local garth park ball court
local authority worker dave edwards scooped the arachnid up into a black bag before calling wildlife expert and tv personality dr rhys jones , from cardiff university , for advice
dr rhys jones , from cardiff university , best known as the star of the bbc one series rhys jones 's wildlife patrol holds the lost tarantula , showing how safe it is dr rhys jones , best known as the star of the bbc one series rhys jones 's wildlife patrol , said : ' it is unlikely that the spider would have travelled from distance , given the cold spring temperatures and the proximity of local houses
' the surrounding habitat offered little interest or cover for that species of spider , given that it mainly consists of large open fields which are patrolled by many aerial predators , including gulls and crows
' these birds would have easily spotted this tropical spider and , given half a chance , would have eaten her
' all things considered , the spider had a very lucky escape before a bird or cat killed it
' the mexican red rump , or b. vagans in latin , was made famous in jack arnold 's 1955 sci - fi movie tarantula , where an ill - advised scientific experiment leads to a giant arachnid breaking out of captivity and terrorizing the arizona desert
luckily for the population of bridgend county borough , however , the creature is not aggressive , and is currently being looked after by dr jones at cardiff university
' the red rump tarantula does not present a significant health risk to the general public
in the rare case of the spider biting , the symptoms would be similar to that of a mild bee sting
' i 'm happy to report that no one was unnecessarily frightened by the appearance of this spider on the loose
' while the spider is now secure and recovering from its ordeal , anyone with nformation relating to this incident should either contact the local authority or the police on 101
' councillor phil white , cabinet member for communities , added : ' it 's not every day that you spot an exotic pet such as this outside of its home environment , so we are appealing for the owner to get in touch as soon as possible
