it has been a sci - fi dream for decades - a car that can simply take to the air to avoid traffic
however , a slovakian firm has said it has finally cracked the problem - and it will sell in it just two years
the aeromobil can fly 430 miles on a tank of petrol - and when its wings fold down , it 'll fit into a normal parking space
when in flight mode , it can go 430 miles , reaching 124mph - but can fold up its wings to travel on the road and fit in a single parking space
aeromobil 3 is a ' flying car ' that perfectly makes use of existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes , and opens doors to real door - to - door travel , ' the firm says
when in its car configuration , it can fit into a standard parking space , and it also takes normal fuel pumped at every service station
the latest version is the third generation of the craft
' it is now finalised and has been in regular flight - testing program in real flight conditions since october 2014 , ' the firm said
at south by southwest , juraj vaculik , co-founder and ceo of aeromobil , spoke at a panel about the future of flying cars , predicting a world ahead in which these vehicles easily merge with existing transportation
he says it will be on sale in 2017 , and that the firm was also developing a self driving ( and flying ) version
tatiana veber , an aeromobil spokesman said : ' we have been developing the concept of a flying car since 1990
' our first model looked quite bizarre and it would have problems in the regular use
' that was a signal to improve the concept of the flying car in a way to become an integral part of the regular road traffic
the winds fold behind the driver of the car when it is on the road the car seats two , although the pilot will need a licence to fly it
' we got a positive feedback from several experts in avionics , which appreciated design and the technical solution of the process of transformation
' the car is constructed to be fuelled at regular gas stations using the fuel for rotax 912 uls engine
' aeromobil says its third prototype is ready to be shown to the world this october 29th at the pioneers festival in austria
when in plane mode , the craft is powered by a propeller the firm has even completed the interior of the craft , and says it is undergoing advanced flight tests in slovakia
however , design is still not perfect - the wings fold into the back seat behind the driver when in car mode
the firm has also released a video of it in action , driving through city streets then taking to the air
' aeromobil 3 is stylish , comfortable for both the driver and passenger , and exceptionally combines the performance of a sports car with qualities of an ' ultralight ' , ' it says
the vehicle can reach 200km/h when in the air , and 160km/h on the roads .
