after postponing its first execution of a woman in 70 years because of " cloudy " lethal injection drugs , georgia has indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures , the state said tuesday
gissendaner was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. et monday , but for the second time in less than a week , it was called off
the state postponed the first planned execution because of " weather and associated scheduling issues , " department spokeswoman gwendolyn hogan said
" prior to the execution , the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency
the drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits , " the georgia corrections department said in a statement
" within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution , the execution team performed the necessary checks
at that time , the drugs appeared cloudy
the corrections department immediately consulted with a pharmacist , and in an abundance of caution , inmate gissendaner 's execution has been postponed
" repeating the " abundance of caution " wording , the department issued a news release tuesday , saying , " the scheduled executions of gissendaner and terrell have been postponed while an analysis is conducted of the drugs planned for use in last night 's scheduled execution of inmate gissendaner
" gissendaner , 47 , is condemned to die for a 1997 murder plot in which she conspired with boyfriend gregory owen to murder her husband
terrell was convicted in the shooting and beating death of a 70 - year - old friend of his mother 's after the man called police to say terrell had stolen checks from him , according to the georgia attorney general 's office
gissendaner has already requested an extravagant last meal : two burger king whoppers with cheese ( with everything ) , two large orders of fries , popcorn , cornbread , a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes , bell peppers , onions , carrots , cheese , boiled eggs and newman 's own buttermilk dressing , the corrections department said
she also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry - vanilla ice cream for dessert
terrell was scheduled to die between march 10 and 17
last year , oklahoma issued a months - long moratorium on executions after murderer and rapist clayton lockett convulsed , writhed and lay alive on a gurney for 43 minutes before dying
it was the state 's first time using a new , three - drug cocktail for an execution
the constitutionality of lethal injection drugs has made headlines since 2013 , when european manufacturers -- including denmark - based lundbeck , which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned u.s. prisons from using their drugs in executions
thirty - two states were left to find new drug protocols .
