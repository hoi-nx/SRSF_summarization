more than a dozen homes were raided on tuesday in a crackdown on so - called ' maternity tourism ' operators who arrange for pregnant china women to give birth in the american , where their babies automatically become american citizens
the crackdown on three alleged maternity tourism rings may be the biggest yet by federal homeland security agents who say that , while pregnant women may travel to the american , they can not lie about the purpose of their trip when applying for a visa
birth tourism has been reported from a range of countries , but authorities say the most recent cases in california have catered to wealthy china amid a boom in tourism from mainland china
it is unclear how many women travel to the american for maternity tourism
according to the la times , during the raid pregnant women were seen opening doors to apartments , looking confused and then slamming them shut
one agent announced ' baby here ' and then called over a colleague to go inside
crying babies could be heard from several apartments , according to the la times
investigators said women were coached to lie about their travel plans when applying for tourist visas and were promised they would receive social security numbers and american passports for their babies before returning to china
in one instance , a trainer in china helped fabricate employment and income information for an undercover federal agent posing as a pregnant client to secure a tourist visa and encouraged her to fly through hawaii , where customs officers were believed to be more lenient than in los angeles , according to a copy of an affidavit in support of a search warrant
the business netted its owners hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past two years and helped china tourists deliver more than 400 american babies at orange county hospitals , the court papers said
no arrests were made or charges filed
investigators conducted the searches in orange county , los angeles and san bernardino counties , hoping to collect evidence of crimes tied to three separate maternity tourism operations , including visa and tax fraud , ice said

maternity tourists believe citizenship will help their children secure a top - notch american college education and provide a sort of insurance policy should economic conditions crumble in their home country â especially since the tourists themselves can apply for a green card once their american child turns 21
bill ong hing , professor of the university of san francisco school of law , said wealthy foreigners from across the world often travel to the american for medical care and are allowed to do so on visitor visas , provided they do n't overstay
u.s. customs and border protection warns on its website that officers at airports and on the border will consider a pregnant woman 's due date , travel plans and medical insurance to determine whether she can enter the country
in the irvine case , investigators said another undercover officer posing as a pregnant traveler was told not to apply for her visa too late as she would be denied if she were noticeably pregnant
a pregnant woman who was questioned at the airport said she was told to say she was simply a tourist , court papers said
investigators also tracked the movements of a couple who arrived in february 2014 , had their baby in april and returned in may
while the couple 's bank account recorded charges at luxury stores including louis vuitton and rolex , they paid $ 4,080 â less than 15 per cent of the billed amount â to the hospital for medical services after stating the mother was not employed , the affidavit said
federal agents started investigating the business after an anonymous tip last year
in 2013 , los angeles county cited more than a dozen maternity hotels for code violations after an uproar in a nearby suburban community about a hotel operating in a residential neighborhood
feere , legal policy analyst for the center for immigration studies , said he believes birth tourism will grow along with international travel
' there is a sense the foreigner has control over our immigration policy rather than the american people , ' said feere , who wants stricter limits on immigration
the business netted its owners hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past two years and helped china tourists deliver more than 400 american babies at orange county hospitals , according to court papers
