you wait half a lifetime to see the terminator , and then two come along at once
standing on the top step of the podium was the indestructible human - looking phenomenon of legend , and next to him stood schwarzenegger
lewis hamilton , of course , was the second terminator , the crushing victor of the australia grand prix that gave him the perfect start in his attempt to become the first british driver to successfully defend the formula one world championship
he has hung about with stars of the screen , fashion and music through a winter of a paparazzo âs dream , but here he was after 58 laps he had rendered as interesting as counting sheep , the supreme driver of the moment
lewis hamilton celebrates his australia gp win in front of second - placed nico rosberg and sebastian vettel who completed the podium world champion hamilton stormed to victory at the season - opening australia grand prix following a dominant performance lewis hamilton flew off the start - line and never looked back as he cruised to victory in the first race of the 2015 campaign nico rosberg , who finished runner - up last year , kept lewis hamilton honest , but in truth he was no match for his mercedes team - mate 1

although his mercedes team - mate nico rosberg put in some fastest laps , lewis hamilton seemed to be holding back , doing all he needed with measure and control
but for his one and only pit stop , he led throughout after effectively winning the race with a dominant pole position on saturday
nico rosberg was second , with sebastian vettel third on his ferrari debut
â lewis hamilton made no mistakes , â said nico rosberg
â i was nât able to get close to him , let alone try to overtake
â if there was any downside to lewis hamilton âs victory it was the possibility it raised of a one - sided season , or at least , if nico rosberg can find form , an internal duel
for these mercedes are so invulnerable they could take you to all four corners of the earth and back without so much as a splutter
sebastian vettel was 34 seconds behind lewis hamilton , who , on this track , put stevenage on the map with a breathtaking first few corners of daring and precision in his debut formula one race eight years ago
the tv cameras barely focused on the mercedes because routine genius can be boring to behold
pastor maldonado crashed into the wall on the first lap of the race after he was clipped by the sauber of felipe nasr sebastian vettel and raikkonen bang wheels on the run down to turn 1
it causes a concertina effect which ends in maldonado crashing out jenson button finished last , but it was a sterling effort to get his mclaren to the finish line following the british team 's miserable winter lewis hamilton was clearly delighted with his win in melbourne
he shared a joke with schwarzenegger who conducted the interviews re-live every lap of the melbourne race not only that but damaging to the sport , according to red bull team principal horner
he is one of the most intelligent and garlanded figures in the sport but he might be considered something of a hostile witness for formula one given his vested interest in the revival of his struggling team
but he deserves a hearing
â when we were winning â and we were never winning with an advantage that mercedes have â double diffusers were banned , exhausts were moved , flexible bodywork was banned , engine mapping was changed mid-season , â said horner
â anything was done to pull us back
that was not just us ; it was done to mclaren and williams in other years
lewis hamilton and nico rosberg ( right ) shake hands after the race
the briton out - classed his team - mate at the season - opening race lewis hamilton holds alfot the winners ' trophy after seeing off the challenge from nico rosberg to claim his sixth victory in the last seven races schwarzenegger conducted the podium interview , which caught lewis hamilton off guard as he said : ' hey man ! wow ... i thought you were taller '
â is it healthy to have a situation like this ? take nothing from mercedes , they have done a super job
the problem is that the gap is so big that you end up with three - tier racing and that is not healthy for formula one
â the fia can see the power output that every engine is producing
they have the facts and they could quite easily come up with a way of a form of equalisation
â yes , but is the pursuit of , and reward for , perfection not formula one âs raison dâetre ? any late risers among the insomniac petrol - heads watching the race live early in sunday âs british morning would have missed the greatest excitements of the day : the pre-race rate of withdrawal
the 30 - year - old briton crosses the line to claim his first win of the season and start the season where he left off in abu dhabi lewis hamilton sprays champagne from the rostrum as he celebrates the 34th grand prix victory of his career kevin magnussen , driving for the tardy mclaren team , did not even manage to make it on to the grid
his mclaren-honda - powered engine gave up on him soon after he left the garage , sending smoke into the warm air
within seconds of that , daniil kvyat âs red bull gearbox packed in
this was a another blow for a team already angered by engine supplier renault âs failure to improve on last year âs power unit
with manor not even having taken part in qualifying , and williams â valtteri bottas having pulled out with a bad back , only 15 cars started the grand prix
although lewis hamilton safely negotiated the opening lap , raikkonen âs ferrari caught felipe nasr âs sauber , which then clipped pastor maldonado âs mercedes
it clunked into the wall , ending the venezuelan âs participation
we were down to 14 cars
maldonado âs team - mate romain grosjean was then wheeled into the garage after suffering power failure
max verstappen , the history - making toro rosso man , was next to go
â smoke in the car , â said the 17 - year - old , anxiously
we were down to 12
raikkonen âs afternoon ended when a second shoddy pit stop left him with a barely fitted left rear wheel
now there were merely 11
lo and behold , this meant jenson button was in contention for points having started at the very back of the grid
but he could do no more than finish 11th and last in a mclaren-honda that remains in a lamentably early stage of development
but he believes , to borrow a phrase , they will be back .
