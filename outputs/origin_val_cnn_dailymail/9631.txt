the woes have increased for qpr , with the club fearing they will lose star striker austin in the summer and their accounts showing they could still face a financial fair play fine of nearly Â£ 58million
the club are in deep relegation trouble , three points adrift of safety , and have a crucial match away to crystal palace at lunchtime on saturday
they have not won in their previous 11 matches against london clubs and the game will be played against a backdrop of an uncertain future
manager ramsey insists that austin will not be allowed to leave qpr for a paltry fee manager ramsey admitted that austin , whose contract runs out at the end of next season , could leave in the summer , but is adamant they will not let him go for a paltry fee

austin has been in red - hot form in his debut season in the league with 15 goals austin celebrates scoring his second goal during the league match against west bromwich albion ramsey admitted : â when somebody sparkles there âs always people in there to poach them or to buy them and make their clubs better
â so we would be foolish not to be worried we âre going to lose him
we hope we do nât and we âre glad he âs performed in a way that other teams are trying to secure his services
â he âs one of the top strikers in the country , it âs not my decision whether he stays or goes , but any top striker always goes for top dollar
â qpr have opened talks with austin over a new , Â£ 60,000 - a - week deal , but he is keen to wait until the end of the season before making a decision
austin has been offered a new deal at loftus road but will wait until the end of the season to make a decision to make matters worse , the club âs financial accounts for the 2013 - 14 season when they were in the championship , filed at companies house on friday , show that their â real â losses last season were almost Â£ 70m
the football league âs complex financial fair play rules are designed to discourage rich owners buying success and endangering the health of their clubs
a tariff of fines is in place for clubs that massively overspend
earlier this month , qpr announced they had made a loss of Â£ 9.8m but the accounts now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of owners â mainly tony fernandes â wrote off Â£ 60m of old loans in an â exceptional item â in the accounts
qpr owners including tony fernandes wrote off Â£ 60million worth of old loans in the accounts effectively , qpr counted that write - off as extra income
but that money is noted in the accounts as being a â related - party transaction â â and the football league âs own financial fair play regulations explicitly rule out related party moves of the kind qpr have undertaken , to prevent â artificially â lowered losses
if the league decide qpr âs â real â losses are Â£ 69.8m , the financial fair play fine they potentially face will be Â£ 57.9m
qpr declined to comment and remain in talks with the football league
whatever is decided , refusal to pay a fine could result in their expulsion to non-league football .
