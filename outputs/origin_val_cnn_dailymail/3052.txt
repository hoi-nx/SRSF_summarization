a weekend report claiming that a top adviser to president obama leaked to the press that the political heavyweight and fellow democrat hillary clinton was using a personal email address during her time as secretary of state is ' baloney , ' the white house said monday
the new york post on saturday claimed that valerie jarrett , a close confidant of both the president and first lady michelle obama , divulged details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the white house
the bad press was reportedly timed to become public just as clinton was planning to announce her candidacy for president
white house spokesman josh earnest indicated to reporters on monday that the report was n't true , though
he did not comment further on the matter
according to the new york post article , authored by klein , a source close to the white house disclosed that ' obama and valerie jarrett will go to any lengths to prevent hillary clinton from becoming president
' ' they believe that hillary clinton , like her husband , is left of center , not a true - blue liberal
' sources claim that the long rumored tension between obama and the clintons hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the democrat party refused to be seen campaigning with president obama
jarrett is reported to have commented that the defections were linked to the clintons , who she believed had begun ' marginalizing the president ' and were ' trying to wrestle control of the democratic away from obama
' she reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge , working to get monica lewinsky high - profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the clintons
then , shortly after the midterm elections , she , the president and the first lady , reportedly sat down with clinton and told her in no uncertain terms that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president
this as jarrett is reported to have been speaking to martin oâmalley , the former governor of maryland , and senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts about possibly running in the 2016 election
' she âs promised martin oâmalley and warren the full support of the white house if they will challenge hillary clinton for the presidential nomination , ' a source who spoke to klein allegedly said
jarrett has reportedly been speaking to martin oâmalley ( above ) , the former governor of maryland , about running in 2016 she has also reportedly reached out to senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts about entering the primary klein , the author of blood feud : the clintons vs. the obamas , also says he spoke to a friend of the clintons , who told him that bill said ; ' my contacts and friends in newspapers and tv tell me that they âve been contacted by the white house and offered all kinds of negative stories about us
' he then added ; ' the obamas are behind the e-mail story , and they âre spreading rumors that i âve been with women , that hillary clinton promoted people at the state department who âd done favors for our foundation , that john kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes hillary clinton left behind
' and it 's not over yet , as according to klein , six additional probes into clinton 's performance are underway
bill , upon learning of this , reportedly said to a friend ; ' the obamas are out to get us any way they can
' klein seems to have known about all this for some time , having discussed it when he appeared on fox and friends last wednesday
' [ bill ] has said , according to my sources , that the white house is leaking to their friends in the mainstream media stories about the clintons
not only about hillary clinton , but about him , and about what she did while she was in the state department , ' klein claimed
' this is from sources within the white house , that the clintons know that hillary clinton is under not one , but six different investigations prompted by the white house
' he then added ; ' they 're going through these , looking for problems on her expense account , on her dealings with foreign leaders
all of this , i 'm told , is prompted by valerie jarrett and the president , who do not want to see hillary clinton become president of the united states
' jarrett , 58 , is one of president obama âs longest serving advisers
she said in a recent interview that she would stay in the white house ' until the lights go off
