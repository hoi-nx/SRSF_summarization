australia 's property market is continuously booming , with house prices soaring through the roof - but unfortunately for prospective property buyers , it 's showing no sign of slowing down
an auction of a quaint , unrenovated surry hills home on saturday reaped surprising bids , with the owner of the property managing to bag a whooping $ 1.5 million for the home , which did n't even have a bathroom and had holes in the ceiling
on the same day , a stunning beachfront home , owned by former tv comedian john ' strop ' cornell , in the stylish area of belongil in byron bay was picked up by harvey norman heir glen norman for $ 10 million
' while we have cheap money , people will just extend themselves , ' ms brigitte blackman told daily mail australia
' also there âs very low stock on the market , which i have nât seen in a long time at this time of year
' with low stock levels and lowest interest rates ever - which are projected to go down further - moneys cheap and real estates such a solid investment that people are spending big and wanting to buy , but there âs not much to buy , ' she said
the house had holes in the ceiling and did n't even have a kitchen 14 registered buyers turned out for the auction and each battling it out to but the house about 700 homes went under the hammer in sydney on saturday and domain put the clearance rate at 86.1 per cent , the second highest result on record
ms brigitte blackman sold 22 ridge st in surry hills on saturday for $ 1.5 and said everyone was extremely surprised with the outcome , considering the reserve was set at $ 1.3 million
there were between 80 - 100 people at the auction and astonishingly 14 buyers registered to bid
the dilapidated four - bedroom surry hills terrace was unrenovated with no kitchen , no bathroom and not even a toilet
the home had been in the same family âs hands for more than 60 years , but was left in a state of neglect
paint was peeling off the walls , holes littered the kitchen ceiling and and the garden was in some serious need of some tender loving care
the house did n't have a bathroom , a toilet or a kitchen but was located in prime real estate two other houses on the same street sold last year for less than this house , and they were both renovated however , what it lacked in amenities it made up for in location and buyers scrambled over themselves to be the one to scoop up the hot property
' surry hills is probably one of the hottest suburbs in sydney that people want to buy , ' ms brigitte blackman said
' it was what i call a rough diamond
it had the right orientation , it âs faced north at the rear
there are only a few streets in surry hills that do face north at the rear so that was a big plus and it was unrenovated but very solid , it was n't falling down
' it was raw , the potential was massive , it was a gem
buyers saw that and we âre prepared to pay big dollars for it , ' she said
this byron bay property was snapped up by harvey norman heir glen norman the stunning home is set right on the beach and is only accessible by a private path two properties on the same street went up for auction last year and both were renovated
one sold for $ 1.45 million and the other for $ 1.55 million
' this one did n't even have a kitchen and barely a bathroom so it was a big surprise , ' ms brigitte blackman said
' we 've got too much demand and low supply so unless the supply comes up it âs not going to meet the demand
i 've never heard buyers say to me : " there âs nothing else to see " , generally they will say : " i 've got five other âs to see today " - and they âre not saying that right now
mr norman bought the home from his former father - in - law john ' strop ' cornell glen norman sold his double bay apartment for $ 4.5 million last week so he could move to byron bay ' i think it âs a very interesting time , i 've been selling for 20 years and i ca nât recall another time like this
noones ever seen these low interest rates before because they 've never been this low in our country
' ms brigitte blackman said she did n't know what was going to happen to the property market but she believes people are more interested in buying now , due to the high rent prices
' money âs cheap so people are buying , ' she said
' if you were renting a property and you can afford to buy , why pay someone else âs rent when you can pay your own ? that âs why there âs so many people in the market in my opinion
' further north in byron bay a stunning beachside home , formerly owned by comedian john ' strop ' cornell was snapped off the market by his former son - in - law glen norman
interestingly , mr norman 's move to byron bay 's seaside replicates that of his ex-wife , who only returned to live there last year after selling her bronte home for $ 4.6 million melissa and glen norman were married in 1997 at her father 's beach hotel but separated in 2004 norman had listed his his three - bedroom apartment in double bay earlier this month and was hoping to secure $ 4 million for the north - facing home , which he bought in 2008
