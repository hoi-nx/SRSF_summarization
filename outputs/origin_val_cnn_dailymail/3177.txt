stoke city , under the management of tony pulis , became the team everyone hated and everyone hated to play against
but if there is something worse than being hated , it is being ignored and that is where we are with mark hughes â stoke city side now
while the physical nature of the team pulis built brought incendiary headlines , critical comment and damning statistics â i was the captain of his team in the championship from 2004 - 2007 â the progress made by mark hughes has been overlooked
stoke city stars mame diouf , jon walters and steven nzonzi celebrate during the potters ' 2 - 0 win over everton in the premier league on wednesday which lifted them to eighth in the table stoke city have collected 23 points from a possible 33 since boxing day
only liverpool and arsenal have picked up more , so why is nât there more attention to their achievements ? when stoke city beat everton this week to rise to eighth place in the premier league , the aftermath was nât about how well stoke city are doing but instead about the struggling roberto martinez and everton
stoke city are the team who are above garry monk âs swansea â recently championed after their defeat of manchester united â west ham , newcastle and the rest of the bottom ten
southampton have exceeded everyone âs expectations this season and receive weekly reviews as the nation âs romance story ; neutrals want them to do well , to upset the normal order of the top four
but what is it about stoke city , who are as high as they can probably ever wish to be , that generates such little media attention or positive write ups ? stoke city , as a city , finds itself situated between the bigger and more glamorous cities of manchester and birmingham , but it has a lot to offer
stoke city 's duberry tracks wigan striker nathan ellington during a championship match at the britannia stadium in november 2004 , which was the defender 's first season at the club eagles striker andy johnson tries to take evasive action as duberry jumps across to make a tackle during stoke city 's 3 - 1 home defeat by the eagles in march 2006 duberry stands all smiles at the britannia stadium during his time as a stoke city player
it was a period in the defender 's career where he admits he felt wanted by the club in his three - year spell which ended in 2007 when i moved to stoke city from leeds , the city did nât have a harvey nichols or some of the swanky restaurants i left in leeds , but it did nât matter
the club gave me a home and a place
i felt wanted - i did nât want anything else
i moved near the training ground in nearby newcastle under lyme and was very happy
i had trentham gardens , hanley shopping centre and alton towers was on my doorstep too
back when i was a stoke city player the club always seemed to have a power struggle going on upstairs
there was a lack of a clear vision as to who was in charge and the direction in which they wanted to take the club
then coates took over in 2006 and the vision became clear
a stoke city boy and self - made millionaire , mr coates has the club at heart and never hides that love
he has made some wise appointments to manage the football team
stoke city were promoted to the premier league under the management of tony pulis , with duberry playing under the now west brom boss while at the potters in the championship tony pulis arranges a training drill at stoke city 's training ground in 2012
duberry described the sessions as regimented and boring , but admits it made the team play better on match days since mark hughes has taken over , the club have only spent Â£ 10m in the transfer market , which is a tremendous job in the current climate of spending
stoke city have become quite successful in finding players to fit the mold , with mark hughes and his staff working with head of recruitment mark cartwright
they do nât overspend and yet they have created and established a premier league team
finishing 12th,11th , 14th and 13th twice since coming into the premier league , last season was their highest - ever
with a 9th place finish
but now they are one place higher and playing a more attractive passing style
during my first spell under tony pulis , we were very direct , often going back to front in less than two passes
training was regimented , often just walking through team shape and then doing set pieces
i did nât like it and found it boring but it made us better on match days and i loved the feeling of a clean sheet
stoke city attracted criticism for their direct style of play after being promoted to the premier league in 2008 , with teams forced into having to form defensive tactics against long rory delap throw ins mark hughes gives advice to stoke city 's glenn whelan during a league game against liverpool , and duberry claims the potters have improved their style of play having spent little money under the welshman the next season under johan boskamp , everything was totally different
the dutch manager had a pure footballing philosophy and every training session was 100 per cent football
i loved everything from the training , to the games and to the way he spoke football when tony pulis came back the following season , it reverted back to the old regime of pattern of play and set pieces in training
it was very frustrating it âs a different club now with a different manager and a different footballing ethos
you never see mark hughes in the technical area signaling to his players to pass from back to front , but instead he is gesturing to pass the ball and it looks as if the players are enjoying the experience
i believe they deserve more credit and exposure
but if that does nât happen , then i âm sure the loud choruses of â delilah â from the fans will drown out any negative , stereotypical opinions outside .
