ryanair is poised to become the first airline to use a so - called â ghost airport â on spanish âs eastern coast which has been ignored by other carriers
spanish media said europe âs largest budget airline will operate flights between airport and destinations in britain , germany and sweden
a ryanair spokesperson told mailonline travel that an announcement will take place tomorrow
airport has become a symbol of wasteful public spending and spanish 's debt the spokesperson said : ' ryanair does not comment upon or engage in rumour or speculation
however , i can confirm we are holding a press conference in airport tomorrow , 11th march
' airport has barely been used since it opened four years ago , and has become a symbol of reckless government spending and spanish âs debt
it was built at a cost of Â£ 130million and declared open in march 2011 , even though no airlines were signed on as tenants and it had not received government approval to operate
it received that approval late last year and since december it has been used for charter flights operated by spanish football clubs barcelona and villarreal , but it has not welcomed any commercial flights
citing unnamed sources , abc said ryanair will begin operating from the airport at the start of the easter holiday season , and local officials are hoping the deal will bring more tourists to the region
the airport was heavily criticised for a 79 - ft tall statue built next to the only runway at a cost of Â£ 200,000 the airport âs operator , canadian multinational snc-lavalin , has set a goal of 250 flights and 35,000 passengers in its first year , the newspaper said
airport has been plagued with problems and the subject of fierce criticism since the day it was inaugurated in march 2011
officials were lambasted for a 79 - ft tall statue built next to the terminal âs only runway at a cost of Â£ 200,000 , and for spending Â£ 25million on publicity even though the airport had failed to secure necessary permits required for air traffic
the airport was developed by provincial politician fabra , who was jailed for tax fraud last year its airstrip was found to be too narrow for aeroplanes to turn around , meaning it had to be torn up and widened to meet industry regulations
while it was deserted and facing an uncertain future , there were suggestions that it be transformed into a race track for cars or a shopping mall
located 60 miles north of valencia , the airport was developed by fabra , the former head of castellon âs provincial government , who was jailed for tax fraud last year
the airport 's operators are have set a target of 250 flights and 35,000 passengers in its first year the airport 's statue is said to be a representation of fabra
it is found in a region already served by busy international airports in valencia and alicante , but snc-lavalin , which signed a 20 - year , Â£ 20million deal to run the facility , predicts that it will host 450,000 passengers in 2019
snc-lavalin said castellon âs government will not make any money on the airport until it exceeds 1.2 million passengers a year , which is nât expected until 2029 .
