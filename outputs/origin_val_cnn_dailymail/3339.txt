need some inspiration deciding who to back at cheltenham ? sportsmail 's marcus townend and scudamore reveal their favourites ... scudamore - eight - time champion jockey and rider of 13 festival winners hargam no secret that this is regarded as one of ap mccoy âs best chances of the week
he was recruited from france , where he showed decent form on the flat , and although he was beaten by a good rival on his hurdling debut , has won his two races since
last time out he slammed starchitect , who ran a commendable fourth in the fred winter juvenile handicap hurdle here on tuesday
best odds : 6 - 1 ap mccoy and hargam won the jcb triumph hurdle trial at cheltenham in december holywell ( gold cup , 3.20 ) rain would admittedly diminish confidence in jonjo oâneill âs runner but he has all the credentials to run really well
he has won at the past two festivals , peaks at this time of year and has been re-fitted with the blinkers which seem to bring out the best in him
his last time out victory at kelso indicated the spark had been rekindled in this gelding by his shrewd trainer after a couple of moderate efforts
best odds : 9 - 1 current event ( foxhunters â chase , 4.0 ) owned , but not trained , by paul nicholls and prepared for this race by one of his long - time staff , rose loxton
had won his previous seven point - to - points before being taken up to musselburgh where he sauntered home in a hunter chase
paul nicholls is pictured with sir alex ferguson and owns current event best odds : 9 - 1 next sensation ( grand annual chase , 5.15 ) fourth in this race last year after trying to make all the running and only being overhauled after the last fence
he races off a similar handicap mark and , while his form this season has been a touch below par , he has had a breathing operation since his last run
best odds : 10 - 1 captain heath - marcus townend on the best each - way bets karezak ( triumph hurdle , 1.30 ) alan king âs entry has been locking horns with the best juvenile hurdlers all season and , while a sequence of four second places might seem off - putting , he does not lack heart
fast pace should play to his strengths and could hit the frame
best odds : 20 - 1 karezak ( pictured right ) is a decent each way bet in the opener on the festival 's final day tea for two ( albert bartlett novices â hurdle , 2.40 ) romped home in january âs lanzarote hurdle at kempton and subsequently beaten at ascot
but those races were at a shorter distance and the mount of lizzie kelly shapes as if he will improve for the greater stamina test
best odds : 33 - 1 the giant bolster ( gold cup , 3.20 ) has become a regular in this race having finished second , fourth and third in the last three runnings
form this season has been unspectacular but this has been the day local trainer david bridgwater has trained him for all season
hard to see him winning but easier to see him in the places under regular jockey tom scudamore
best odds : 33 - 1 hotspots work whisper : one last dream ( wolverhampton , 5.45 ) weighting game : that âs the deal ( fakenham , 2.55 )
down 22lb from last winning mark
burnt fingers : revolutionist ( lingfield , 4.25 )
