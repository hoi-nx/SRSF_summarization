supermassive black holes at the centre of large galaxies could be powering blasts from deep inside the galaxy 's core , astronomers have claimed
the huge outpourings of material are responsible for ejecting enough dust and gas to build more than a thousand stars the size of our sun every year
and these outflows could also remove huge quantities of star - making gas , dictating the size , shape and overall fate of galaxies
this artist 's impression depicts how a black hole accretes the surrounding matter through a disc the image looks uncannily like an eye in the sky - such as the eye of sauron from lord of the rings astronomers have sought the driving force behind these massive molecular outflows for years , and now a team of university of maryland scientists has found an answer
the galaxy in the study , known as iras f11119 +3257 , has an actively growing supermassive black hole at its centre
this means that , unlike the large black hole at the centre of our own milky way galaxy , this black hole is actively consuming large amounts of gas
as material enters the black hole , it creates friction , which in turn gives off electromagnetic radiation - including x-rays and visible light
black holes that fit this description are called active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and their intense radiation output also generates powerful winds that force material away from the centre of a galaxy
in february it was revealed that a supermassive black hole 12 million times larger than the sun and powering â the brightest lighthouse in the distant universe â has been discovered
the extraordinary object is at the centre of a quasar - an intensely powerful galactic radiation source - with a million billion times the sun âs energy output
the nature of quasars has remained a mystery since they were discovered in 1963
but scientists theorise that they are generated by matter heating up as it is dragged into supermassive black holes at the centre of distant galaxies
the new object , named sdss j0100 +2802 , is 12.8 billion light years from earth and was formed 900 million years after the big bang , which gave birth to the universe
astronomers can not explain how such an enormous black hole could have formed so soon after the first stars and galaxies emerged
the study found that these agn winds are powerful enough to drive the large molecular outflows that reach to the edges of the galaxy 's borders
although theorists have suspected a connection between agn winds and molecular outflows before , the current study is the first to confirm this link
' this is the first galaxy in which we can see both the wind from the active galactic nucleus and the large - scale outflow of molecular gas at the same time , ' said lead author dr francesco tombesi , an assistant research scientist in the university of maryland 's astronomy department
he also worked at nasa 's goddard space flight centre
the team analysed data collected in 2013 by suzaku , an x-ray satellite operated by the jaxa ( jaxa ) and nasa , as well as data from esa 's herschel
an alternate theory says that active star formation near the galactic centre could drive these outflows
but the brightness of iras f11119 +3257 's active nucleus - which is responsible for about 80 per cent of the galaxy 's overall radiation - suggested otherwise
star formation alone ca n't explain this intense concentration of energy , leading the researchers to conclude that the agn winds must be the primary driver
the outflows could also remove huge quantities of star - making gas , dictating the size and shape of galaxies

the study is based on data from the herschel and suzaku space observatories this is a red - filter image of iras f11119 +3257 ( inset ) from a telescope at the university of hawaii 's , showing faint features that may be tidal debris , a sign of a galaxy merger
the background is a wider view of the region from the sloan digital sky survey ' the temptation is to ignore the supermassive black hole when studying galactic dynamics and evolution , but our study shows that you ca n't because it influences galaxies on the larger scale , ' added co-author dr marcio melã©ndez
limited satellite time means that , at least for now , the team has only this one galaxy as a baseline for study
but now that they have a better idea what they are looking for , they will be able to find more candidate galaxies in the future
within the next year , jaxa and nasa will launch astro-h , a successor satellite to suzaku
the instruments aboard astro-h will make it possible to study more galaxies like iras f11119 +3257 in greater detail
' these are not like normal spiral or elliptical galaxies
they 're like train wrecks , ' said co-author dr sylvain veilleux
' two galaxies collided with each other , and it 's now a single object
this train wreck provided all the material to feed the supermassive black hole that is now driving the huge galactic - scale outflow
' the findings were published in the journal nature .
