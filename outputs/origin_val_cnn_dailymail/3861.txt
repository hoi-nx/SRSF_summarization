haroon aswat ( right ) , from dewsbury , west yorkshire , has pleaded guilty in new york to plotting to set up a terrorist training camp in the united states with hook - handed extremist hamza ( left ) hamza , 56 , previously of north london , was jailed for life in january for supporting terrorist organisations
haroon aswat , who is thought to be 40 , was arrested in 2005 in zambia and later flown to the united kingdom
he fought extradition for several years and was held at broadmoor hospital before being sent to the united states last october
in january the echr dismissed a case he brought against the british government arguing that his extradition rested on inadequate assurances from united states officials about his treatment
his lawyers claimed that it had breached article 3 ( prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment ) of the convention ( echr )
prosecutors say haroon aswat ( background ) and hamza conspired to create a terrorist training camp in bly , oregon , 15 years ago in their ruling at the time , echr judges said : ' in light of the specific assurances and additional information received from the united states government , and the careful examination of the case by the high court in the united kingdom , the court found that it could not be said that there was a real risk that mr haroon aswat would be subjected to treatment contrary to article 3 if extradited
' the court therefore considered his complaint to be manifestly ill - founded pursuant to article 35 of the convention and declared the application inadmissible
' haroon aswat 's lawyers told the court yesterday that he has been treated for mental illness
he will be sentenced on july 31 .
