dangerous man - eater on the loose in downing street ! on closer inspection it turned out to be itv presenter susanna reid interviewing the prime minister for breakfast
the reid eyelashes beat like the wings of a butterfly trapped at a window pane
she pouted until her lips must have ached worse than louis armstrong âs after a night on the toots
then she bit her pen â grrrrr ! shades of liz hurley in one of her leotarded jungle - vamp roles
my goodness political interviewing has come a distance since sir robin day and his bowtie
yesterday morning âs broadcast was , unintentionally , comedy of a high order
it confirms miss susanna reid as heir to the late kenny everett
the american - style steel fridge is covered with family photos and magnetic letters while the shelves house a mug collection and gleaming saucepans he had a character called cupid stunt , a glammed - up tv dolly who would lift her whole derriere off the chair when she crossed her thighs
cupid used to scream that it was all being done â in the best pahssible taste â
oh , susanna reid , we âll make a windmill girl out of you yet
in that scarlett and rhett publicity still of you and the pm , you owned him , baby
and later your puppy eyes would not have disgraced an andrex advert
mr david cameron , we will deduce , is on a personal publicity push
so are the other party leaders
only the quickest - fingered channel - surfers can these days avoid some fresh outrage against taste by senior politicians
tidying up : the pm at his fridge with some wine on show
there 's another bottle on the bench
the larder stores olive oils , condiments and - surprisingly - what seems to be salad a pm 's work is never done : tackling his paperwork among the children 's toothbrushes , a tube of toothpaste and a packet of weetabix the milibands , mrs and clunky mr , popped up on the bbc bulletins the other night with their kiddywinks in a saccharine parkland scene
nigel farage was giving it full bluster on yesterday âs daily politics and had posed for another of his man - with - beer portraits in that pub - bore coat
scots nationalist nicola sturgeon was on breakfast telly on monday , giving the nation a fright with its frosties
meanwhile , cleggy and the castanet clacker ( senora miriam ) posed for cheesy shots at their spring conference the other day
mr david cameron , in addition to being grrrrrrilled by sultry susanna reid , yesterday had a soft double - page in london âs evening standard and an astonishing effort in the sun. he had given personal access to that red - top for an entire day , starting with jamie oliver - style footage of him in his kitchen at dawn
what is it with politicians and their kitchens at present ? appearances : mr david cameron , in addition to being grrrrrrilled by sultry susanna reid , yesterday had a soft double - page in london âs evening standard politics has surely not been so serious for decades yet our party leaders are behaving like teenagers mr david cameron âs in downing street , by the way , has a fridge as large as imelda marcos âs shoe closet
he also let the sun attach a camera to his body so we could see what it looked like to walk into no 10 as pm
for heaven âs sake , you lot , you âre contesting a general election , not some butlin âs bognor regis beauty pageant
thanks to the sun âs intimate web - video we saw a shirtsleeved prime minister licking his hellman âs mayonnaise spoon and concocting a lunch of sardines on toast for the paper âs political editor , who , when asked , declined to say they were delicious
when the hellman âs went back in the enormous fridge we copped sight of a fair few bottles of vino
hic ! we heard our head of government go through his diary to convey what terribly busy days he has ( is this news ? ) and we saw him giving michael gove a telling - off for being late to a pre-cabinet meeting
one actually quite interesting disclosure was that the prime minister calls cabinet to order by ting - a - linging a little bell , the sort of thing found on the reception desks of small seaside hotels
puppy eyes : a flirtatious susanna reid interviews david cameron in number 10 for daybreak yesterday yes prime minister ! susanna reid pulls a mischievous smile ( left ) and chews her pen ( right ) during the interview he yacked away happily with miss susanna reid about his childcare arrangements and how had just been to see shaun the sheep the movie with his little daughter florence endless , soft - focus shots caught the pm bidding hello to office underlings and doorkeepers , quite the breezy brigadier telling the little chaps what a splendid job they were doing
the camera lingered lovingly on the camerons â cat and on photographs on the walls of no 10
this would have been for something like through the keyhole but it did not exactly elucidate the tory âs policies
how does such a soft - soap sell connect with the blue - collar vote the tories must retrieve if we are to be spared a miliband-sturgeon government ? the film ended with the pm retiring at bedtime
we did not â phew â see him leaping into his pyjamas
johnson will have to wait until 2016 for a cabinet post if the tories win the general election , david cameron signalled yesterday
the london mayor , who is the prime minister âs chief leadership rival , is bidding to return to the commons and has been tipped for various posts , including party chairman or head of a new infrastructure department
but mr david cameron suggested that any appointment would have to wait until mr johnson steps down as mayor next year
â johnson can do anything , he defies all laws of political logic and gravity , â he said
â but i think he needs to focus on being mayor , strongly
being mp and the mayor is quite a lot
â the pm also spoke of how he and osborne differed , describing himself as a more traditional tory and the chancellor as a â metropolitan , market conservative â
he added : â we have both had our ups and downs
whenever i am down he will offer the hand up and when he is down i will offer the hand
â asked who he would back to succeed him , mr david cameron declined to name an individual â but identified five potential candidates : mr johnson and mr osborne as well as theresa may , michael gove and philip hammond
he stopped the camera at the door to his family quarters , saying it could go no further
but it may have been a damn close call
perhaps such things as economic - industrial strategies and education proposals and political philosophies are no longer considered important by the image - benders and political spin doctors
perhaps this really is the way to win votes in 2015
but i have my doubts
politics has surely not been so serious for decades yet our party leaders are behaving like teenagers
the only one to have kept below the radar is the greens â woman , aussie natalie , but that is probably only because her nerve is shot after her recent mid-interview â dry â on radio
back on itv yesterday morning , miss susanna reid was unstoppable
incorrigible ! she kept touching her blushing cheeks , drew her mouth into sucky pools of winsome doubt , stroked one of her ears , tilted her black - maned head in a come - hither gesture
even the thickest royal navy flag office would have been able to translate those signals
there were times , it must be admitted , when mr david cameron gave her what we might call an old - fashioned glance , plainly wondering what on earth she had put in her tea
the thought â who is this madwoman ? â flittered across his gaze
but hey , there is a general election in the offing
prime ministerial dignity was hauled overboard
soon he was yacking away happily with miss susanna reid about his childcare arrangements and how had just been to see shaun the sheep the movie with his little daughter florence
â we try to be a reasonable dad , â he said
we ? as in â we are a grandmother â ( copyright m. thatcher 1989 ) ? susanna reid cooed
her laughter tinkled like the trevi fountain
one of her eyeballs swelled
samantha cameron , sweetheart , look out !
