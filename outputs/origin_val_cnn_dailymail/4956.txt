george osborne announced fuel duty had been frozen for the fifth year in a row fuel duty has been frozen for a fifth year in succession , allowing the chancellor to boast that motorists have had â Â£ 10 off a tank with the tories â
yesterday âs move means a 0.54p - per - litre duty rise planned for september 1 will not go ahead
and the freezing of duty over the five years of the coalition means the average driver spends Â£ 10 less per fill - up than if the controversial â fuel - price escalator â had been implemented in full
between 2011 and 2016 , a typical motorist will have saved Â£ 675 , the treasury calculated
the planned fuel duty rise by the rpi rate of inflation on september 2015 would have increased the current duty rate by 0.54p per litre â from the current 57.95p to 58.49p
for an average family car fill - up of 55 litres , this would have increased the cost by 30p
mr george osborne said he had cancelled the fuel duty rise because â i want to help families with the cost of filling up a car â
he added : â it âs a cost that bears heavily on small businesses too
it âs the longest duty freeze in over 20 years
it saves a family around Â£ 10 every time they fill up their car
that âs Â£ 10 off a tank with the tories
â motoring groups welcomed the policy and urged any future government â not to step back on the escalator â
the rac foundation said the above - inflation fuel duty â escalator â that operated between 1993 and 1999 â is the primary reason that we now pay nearly 70 per cent in tax on every litre of fuel we buy at the pumps â
aa president edmund king said : â the coalition has done its â fuel duty â by shielding drivers from some of the impact of volatile fuel prices over the past four years by freezing fuel duty , and we welcome the further freeze and cancellation of the scheduled fuel duty rise for september 2015
â with petrol and diesel prices surging and falling by more than 35p a litre since 2010 , the continued four - year fuel duty freeze allows the coalition to dodge the fuel - protest bullet
â howard cox , of the fairfueluk campaign , welcomed the freeze but said the chancellor should have gone further and cut duty
the move means a 0.54p - per - litre duty rise planned for september 1 will not go ahead , which for an average family car fill - up of 55 litres , would have increased the cost by 30p he added : â we give mr george osborne six out of ten for endeavour and will continue to campaign that duty should be frozen for the lifetime of the next parliament
â rac foundation director professor stephen glaister said : â with fuel duty revenue making up about 5 per cent of the treasury âs tax income there was never going to be a huge giveaway as the chancellor still desperately needs motorists â money
â he added : â but with the latest figures showing that almost a million of the poorest households see a quarter of what they spend go on buying and running a car the continued freeze is very welcome

the couple , who use their cars for commuting and taking six - year - old megan and one - year - old emily to school and nursery , drive a combined 1,500 miles a month
mr fox , an it manager , spends two hours a day making his 35 - mile commute in rush hour
filling up his 2.7 - litre mercedes every week costs him Â£ 280 a month
mrs fox , a maths teacher , spends another Â£ 70 a month on fuel for her golf gti
yesterday george osborne delayed an increase in fuel duty once again â meaning drivers are nearly Â£ 10 better off every time they fill up their car than they would have been had labour âs â fuel - price escalator â still been operating
this saves the family , pictured , about Â£ 50 a month
mr fox said : â the extra money we save will be a nice little boost and we can spend more on the kids
â company cars take a clobbering basil fawlty attacks his austin 1100 in show starsky & hutch and starsky & hutch 's 1975 ford gran torino the classic car to which basil fawlty administered â a damned good thrashing â is now exempt from road tax
the character played by monty python actor john cleese famously took a tree branch to a red austin 1100 estate in frustration after it broke down on him in the 1970s comedy series fawlty towers
but now it has reached an age where the government no longer requires vehicle excise duty to be paid
also newly exempt is the red 1975 ford gran torino â with its trademark stripe â as used and rolled over by american tv cops starsky & hutch , played by actor and singer david soul and paul michael glaser in the popular 1970s crime - fighting series
paul clark , senior tax manager at city accountants deloitte , said : â an exemption from vehicle excise duty for vehicles constructed 40 or more years ago was introduced in april 2014
â this exemption applies automatically on a rolling basis on 1 april each year
â so next month all cars made before 1 january 1976 will be exempt from the duty
â he added : â this includes the 1975 ford gran torino used in starsky & hutch and the austin 1100 estate famously thrashed by basil fawlty in 1975 â
the majority of drivers with company cars will be hundreds of pounds worse off after the chancellor moved to make the work perk â greener â
the tax levied on the majority of company cars will be increased by three percentage points in 2019 - 20
the rate for environmentally - friendly vehicles will also rise â but at a â slower rate â
city accountants said the changes are unfair on company car drivers locked into three or four - year deals who chose a cheaper vehicle â in good faith â â only to have it re-classified months later as a gas - guzzler , and taxed accordingly
the government âs avowed aim of the changing tax rates for the â benefit in kind â is to push company car drivers into greener vehicles â such as fully electric or hybrid cars , which carry a smaller tax burden
this has fuelled a boom in low - tax â plug - in â hybrid vehicles , which can be charged from the mains but also run on conventional fuel
the tax on these so - called â ultra-low - emissions vehicles â or ulevs â is still rising too
however , the chancellor is at pains to point out that it is rising at a â slower â rate because he is increasing the gap between the tax on the cleanest â green â cars and the conventionally - fuelled alternatives
george osborne told mps : â to encourage a new generation of low - emission vehicles we will increase their company car tax more slowly than previously planned
â ashley hollinshead of accountants deloitte stressed that because most company car drivers are signed up to three or four - year deals , they will be penalised for choices made well before the changes were introduced
â it âs effectively a retrospective tax on cars , â he said
â many employees with company cars will be locked into long term deals and will have no choice but to bear the ever - increasing cost of company car tax
â â having previously introduced an annual two - percentage - point increase in the rate of company car benefit in kind to 2018/19 , today george osborne announced a further annual hike of three percentage points from 2019/20
this announcement will see the benefit in kind rate increase by nearly 50 per cent in the period to 2019/20
â for example , the benefit in kind rate on [ a car emitting 100 grams of carbon per kilometre ] will increase from 19 per cent next tax year to 28 per cent by 2019/20
â the changes mean a driver paying the 40p tax rate with a Â£ 28,000 1.6 - litre nissan qashqai provided by their employer will be Â£ 1,008 worse off after five years , with a â benefit in kind â tax bill of Â£ 3,360
someone with a golf gti worth Â£ 28,000 will also see their tax increase by Â£ 1,008 , to a total of Â£ 3,472
an executive with a Â£ 38,000 bmw 5 series will pay Â£ 1,368 more , taking their annual bill to Â£ 4,712 , while anyone with an Â£ 81,000 three - litre range rover sport as their company car will be nearly Â£ 2,600 worse off , with an annual bill of Â£ 11,998
however , taxes on green cars mean the driver of a top - selling Â£ 28,304 mitsubishi outlander hybrid will also see their company car tax treble â rising by Â£ 1,245 to Â£ 1,811 a year
tax on a Â£ 32,000 volkswagen golf gte hybrid will rise by Â£ 1,408 to Â£ 2,028 by 2019 - 20
britain will become a world - leader in the development of driverless cars thanks to a Â£ 100million boost from the chancellor
the figure will be matched by private - sector funding for a total pot of Â£ 200million
the announcement was welcomed by jaguar land rover , which hailed a policy that will â help create the smarter and more connected cars of the future â
two driverless car pilot schemes are already under way in greenwich and bristol
much of the technology â from automatic parking to radars that scan for pedestrians or cyclists and can slam on the brakes â already exist in the latest cars on the road
however , new research is aimed at making driverless cars both safe and socially acceptable .
