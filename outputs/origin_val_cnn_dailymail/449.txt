' it âs important to challenge all the england teams , ' said dewsnip
' we have played holland twice , italy away and then poland away twice this season and , particularly for this group of players , they did ever so well in winning the euros last year
' it is important that we build on that momentum
they are a talented group and we want to give them tough challenges
tottenham hotspur 's joshua onomah ( right ) also makes the squad for the switzerland games ' traditionally the swiss youth teams are very competitive and they will be very well organised and hard to beat
' we want to pit our wits against that and see if we can perform well and win both games â carrying on that momentum to take them into their under 19 year next season
