rangi chase turned on the style in front of australia national coach tim sheens as salford continued their revival with a 24 - 18 win over wakefield to climb into super league 's top eight
the red devils have collected five points out of a possible six since tim sheens arrived to take up a short - term advisory role at the club and it was rangi chase , who was given his nrl debut by tim sheens as a teenager at wests tigers , who once more stole the show on adrian morley 's 300th super league appearance
the former castleford and england stand - off scored one try and provided the scoring pass for salford 's three others to further underline his return to the form that earned him the man of steel title in 2011
rangi chase put in a stylish performance for salford red devil in their win over wakefield on sunday the red devils , who were led out by adrian morley , were virtually at full - strength with the return of major close - season signings ben jones-bishop and dobson , and showed signs of becoming a force this year
wakefield , who gave 18 - year - old jordan crowther his second appearance , had their moments but were left to contemplate a third successive defeat after starting the season with back - to - back wins
chase scored a try and set up three for his side as salford moved into the super league 's top eight chase had the chance to help his side open the scoring when he re-gathered the ball from dobson 's high kick but his trademark " no - look " pass found a defender instead of a team - mate and wakefield went on to dominate the rest of the opening quarter
impressive full - back hall 's 40 - 20 kick set up the position for left winger chris riley to go over only to be brought back for a forward pass , while centre reece lyne had a try disallowed for a double movement before loose forward danny washbrook 's break paved the way for stand - off jacob miller to score the opening try
hall 's conversion made it 6 - 0 but the red devils struck twice in a five - minute spell to turn the tables on the visitors
chase picked off a pass by his former half - back partner tim smith to get winger greg johnson away for an 80 - metre try and then produced a short pass for second rower weller hauraki to score his first try for the club
griffin added both goals to make it 12 - 6 and was then denied a try by being held up over the line
salford looked to be firmly in command when chase dummied his way over for a solo try three minutes into the second half , griffin making it 18 - 6 , but wakefield were in no mood to roll over
hooker paul mcshane , just back on the field for the injured pita godinet , caught the salford defence napping by forcing his way over from dummy half for his side 's second try , which hall goaled
adrian morley then produced arguably the highlight of the match , a 50 - metre break , to set up the position for chase to get centre junior sa'u over for a fourth try , with griffin maintaining his 100 per cent with the boot
wakefield battled to the end and were rewarded with hall 's opportunist try but salford never looked like surrendering their lead .
