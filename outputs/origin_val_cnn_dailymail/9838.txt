a ring crafted more than 1,000 years ago confirms highlights the contact between the vikings and the islamic world
discovered inside a ninth century woman âs grave in sweden , the stone inset into the ring bears an inscription that says â for allah â or â to allah â
while it is already known that the vikings acquired glass in far flung lands , the artefact bolsters the theory that the seafaring civilisation did business with islamic traders
a ring ( pictured ) made over 1,000 years ago has confirmed contact between the vikings and the islamic world because it was unearthed in sweden but bears an ancient arabic inscription that asys ' for allah ' or ' to allah ' the ring was discovered during excavations of a viking trading centre in birka , sweden , in the late 1800s , science news reported
since then , it has been thought that stone in the ring is violet amethyst , but now experts have revealed it is coloured glass â an exotic material at the time
researchers at stockholm university used a scanning electron microscope to determine the material and to clearly reveal ancient arabic writing called kufic writing , that reads â for allah or â to allah
â it is known that scandinavian traded glass objects from egypt and mesopotamia up to 3,400 years ago , so it is entirely possible that the vikings fetched glass goods from the region instead of waiting for them to make their way north via trade networks
ancient texts also mention trades taking place between the vikings and members of the islamic civilisation , which stretched from the mediterranean to west asia , but archaeological evidence is rare
the ring was discovered during excavations of a viking trading centre in birka , sweden ( shown by the red marker ) which lies west of stockholm , in the late 1800s but has now been examined under a scanning electron microscope to determine the stone is exotic glass , rather than an amythest ancient texts mention trades taking place between the vikings and members of the islamic civilisation , which stretched from the mediterranean to west asia , but archaeological evidence is rare
an illustration of vikings unloading goods from a longboat is shown the study , published in the journal scanning , says : â the ring may â¦ constitute material evidence for direct interactions between viking age scandinavia and the islamic world
â being the only ring with an arabic inscription found at a scandinavian archaeological site , it is a unique object among swedish viking age material
â further analysis of the ring showed that it was rarely worn
the inner ring still shows signs of where the silver was filed by a craftsman , meaning that it was probably sold as new before it became a treasured possession of a viking woman
â the ring has been cast in a high - grade silver alloy ( 94.5/5.5 ag / cu ) and retains the post-casting marks from the filing done to remove flash and mould lines , â according to the study
â thus , the ring has rarely been worn , and likely passed from the silversmith to the woman buried at birka with few owners in between
â last year , a viking sword was discovered in a field in norway by aman scanning the area with a metal detector
this led experts from the museum of natural history and archaeology at the norwegian university of science and technology to excavate the site
they found a grave dating to 950ad that contained the remains of a shield buried with a viking warrior , as well as a sword bearing an inscription
the boss from a viking shield ( pictured ) was recently found to contain islamic coins in a leather purse

archaeologist ingrid ystgaard told thornews : â we have not managed to find out who owned the sword , but we know that he was a well - travelled man
â â the shield boss has a clear cut mark by an axe or a sword , â she said , before adding that it is not known if the man died in battle .
