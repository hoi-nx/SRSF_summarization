just a week before the grand jury decided not to indict wilson for the shooting death of brown , its request to make a public statement about the case was rejected by a judge
the twelve ferguson grand jurors were denied the opportunity to speak by st. louis county circuit court judge carolyn whittington , according to court documents filed on friday
the documents surfaced during the ongoing lawsuit involving a member of the grand jury , who filed a memorandum earlier this month fighting to speak publicly about the controversial case
the unnamed juror , referenced as grand juror doe , has claimed attorney robert mcculloch , who prosecuted the case , lied to the public
in a letter from judge carolyn whittington to robert mcculloch on november 17 , she explains initially she said yes to the request , but then did legal research and decided the final response was no , according to yahoo news
it is unknown what the jurors were going to say in their statement , and documents from friday do not detail when they initially made the request
in the letter she wrote : ' the supreme court has stated that the power of a grand jury to investigate and inquire is limited to finding or returning indictments
' a grand jury has no power to report short of an indictment unless it is on the condition of public buildings
' the grand jury sat for three months hearing evidence and a verdict was released on november 24 , 2014 not indicting wilson ( above ) for the shooting death of brown in a memorandum filed last month by the juror , he claims robert mcculloch presented evidence over the course of the trial that suggested brown ( above ) was the aggressor and wilson did nothing wrong judge carolyn whittington continued : ' the supreme court has spoken on the issue of the power of the grand jury
' i do not believe there is authority for the grand jury to make a statement and request that you inform the grand jury that it must be guided by the ruling of the supreme court
' in the documents filed on friday , robert mcculloch states his argument in support of reasons for the dismissal of the case involving the grand juror
he wrote that despite having been duly sworn and sworn to secrecy twice , the juror now ' claims it is intolerable that he should be held to his oath or made to abide by his charge '
under missouri law , it is a misdemeanor for a juror to disclose information regarding the case
robert mcculloch said the juror ' has no right under the first amendment to violate his oath or disregard missouri law ' , or ' sidestep the court ' , and that the case should be dismissed
the individual filed suit in january accusing robert mcculloch of lying during the november 24 press conference when he said ' all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges '
a 21 - page memorandum was filed on march 6 detailing that he is seeking an injunction to prevent criminal charges for violating grand jury secrecy laws
robert mcculloch filed court documents on friday to support his reasons for the dismissal of the case involving the grand juror this is just one of the reasons why the juror is asking to be able to speak out about the case
in missouri , only nine of the twelve jurors are need to make the decision on whether or not to indict an individual
' this case is about doe 's first amendment rights , ' said the lawyer for the unnamed juror
' the claim that a citizen with information on a matter of public concern should be permitted to challenge the government 's narrative without going to jail is a cognizable first amendment claim
' the lawyer also noted ; ' robert mcculloch speaks freely and purportedly openly about the very content about which doe wishes to speak , just from a different viewpoint
' the juror is also claiming in these papers that robert mcculloch presented evidence over the course of the trial that suggested brown was the aggressor and wilson did nothing wrong and was simply acting in self - defense
' robert mcculloch has given his view of the grand jurors ' thoughts
the twelve who know the answer are silenced by the challenged laws , ' said the juror 's attorney .
