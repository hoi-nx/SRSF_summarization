southampton have jetted off to switzerland for a break ahead of what ward-prowse believes are the 10 biggest matches in the club 's history
southampton ' late , and somewhat fortuitous , victory against crystal palace on tuesday evening got them back to winning way after their remarkable season started to go off kilter
the latest in a line of disjointed displays looked set to cost ronald koeman 's men , only for mane to strike late on to secure a 1 - 0 win which moved them back to within a point of the top - four

' i think it will be great to just have a good time , the pressure of the premier league is massive , especially where we are in the table , ' the midfielder said
' it 's good to get away , put our feet up and have a bit of a laugh with the group
it should be a good bit of fun and then we 'll move on from there ' these next 10 games are probably the biggest in the club 's history and we 're determined as a group of players to make history for the club
' we want to get us to the biggest stage in the world where we feel we belong with the best teams and best players in the world
' next up for southampton is the unenviable task of a trip to chelsea on march 15 - a match ward-prowse will hope to be starting after his telling impact against crystal palace
the england under 21 midfielder was brought on in a bid to inject some fresh impetus into southampton ' toiling attack and had the desired impact , producing the shot which led to mane clipping home
' we reflected on the win in the changing room and we believe it 's going to be a pivotal three points come the end of the season , ' ward-prowse told southampton 's official youtube channel ' we have n't been on the best of runs lately and it 's great to obviously get the three points and move forward
you could feel the whole stadium was pleased
' it was n't a pretty performance , not a vintage southampton display , but we dug deep , the fans got behind us and i think we showed great character
' southampton 's displays have been inconsistent lately but mane 's goal keeps their champions league hopes ward-prowse believes the final 10 league games of the season are the biggest in southampton 's history while ward-prowse deserved credit for the run and shot that led to mane 's goal , it would not have got that far had julian speroni dealt with the initial attempt
the long - serving crystal palace goalkeeper could only parry ward-prowse 's shot into the senegal winger 's path , but defender scott dann stood up for his team - mate after the costly mistake
' you ca n't just point the finger at jules , ' he said
' he has kept us in games at times this season and he will carry on making important saves for us
scott dann refused to criticise goalkeeper julian speroni for spilling the ball into the path of mane for the goal ' jules said he should have done better but these things happen and we should have reacted better
' he is a great goalkeeper and has done really well for us
he made a couple of good saves last night and made some good decisions coming out when they played balls through
' these things happen but we 'll stick together as a team
