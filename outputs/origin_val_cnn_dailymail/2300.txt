the first treatment specifically designed to treat migraines has been developed - a breakthrough experts say is of ' ground - breaking ' importance
the new injection gives hope to the hundreds of thousands of people who suffer chronic migraines - the most debilitating type of headaches
the jab is made from monoclonal blood protein compounds
these are are antibodies - proteins produced by the body to fight injection - specifically engineered to fight the chemical that causes migraines
the protein compounds are able to ' mop up ' another protein called calcitonin gene - related peptide ( cgrp ) , which triggers the pain , nausea and vomiting associated with a migraine
a new injection to prevent migraines has been developed for the first time , in a breakthrough experts are calling ' ground - breaking ' in trials of 172 sufferers , scientists found the jab brought ' significant reduction ' in the numbers of hours and days chronic migraine patients suffered headaches
the international headache society defines chronic migraine as more than 15 headache days per month over a three - month period - more than eight migrainous â if it has been ruled out that the headaches are caused by an overuse of medication
a migraine is severe recurring headache , usually affecting only one side of the head , characterised by sharp pain and often accompanied by nausea , vomiting , and visual disturbances
according to the who ( who ) , up to four per cent of the world 's adult population have headaches on 15 or more days every month
it has identified chronic migraine as more disabling than blindness , paraplegia angina or rheumatoid arthritis
it has also categorised migraine at the same level of disability as dementia , quadriplegia and acute psychosis
and people with migraines or severe headaches are three times as likely to become depressed than healthy individuals , the who warns
this can lead to sufferers often becoming depressed and unable to cope , says the charity the migraine trust
while internal or outside influences can bring on a migraine , the mechanism by which one is triggered is understood
a combination of reactions occur that results in a chemical called the calcitonin gene - related peptide ( cgrp ) being produced and released
cgrp causes the swelling of blood vessels that are intertwined with nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve , which is located on both sides of the head
this leads to a painful headache , sometimes with aura â meaning the person experiences visual disturbances , dizziness and vertigo â as well as nausea and vomiting
researchers found monoclonal blood proteins â antibodies specifically engineered to bind to cgrp â were able to ' mop up ' the chemical , meaning it did not trigger a migraine
peter goadsby , director of the nihr-wellcome trust king 's clinical research facility , london , and a trustee of the migraine trust , told mailonline this was a ' landmark ' breakthrough
he said : ' this announcement is of ground - breaking importance , as it represents the first potential , specific treatment for chronic migraine ever developed
the injection , which is made from proteins called monoclonal blood proteins , is able to ' mop up ' another chemical which triggers migraines when it is released in the brain ' all interested physicians will watch this development with excitement , as it offers a chance to do more for our most disabled migraine patients , as we invest in further research for an eventual cure
' the message for people with the condition is that there are real developments which will make substantial improvements to their treatment
' he said past medications used to treat migraines â beta - blockers , anti-depressants , and epilepsy medicines â are ' borrowed ' from other specialities , whereas this injection works specifically for migraines
while internal or outside influences can bring on a migraine , the mechanism by which one is triggered is understood
a combination of chemical reactions occurs that results in a chemical called the calcitonin gene - related peptide ( cgrp ) being produced and released
cgrp causes the swelling of blood vessels that are intertwined with nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve , which is located on both sides of the head
this leads to a painful headache , sometimes with aura â meaning the person experiences visual disturbances , dizziness and vertigo â as well as nausea and vomiting
researchers found monoclonal blood proteins â antibodies specifically engineered to bind to cgrp â were able to ' mop up ' the chemical , meaning a migraine was not triggered
these treatments all have side effects , whereas none have been identified for the new injection
it also prevents the onset of migraines , rather than treating them when a headache has come on
he said : ' if you have 15 days or more and you 're just chasing the headaches it 's not a good strategy
no side effects have been identified
as the injection will be expensive , he expects the injections to be offered as a last resort , after the first line treatments such as antidepressants have been tried
wendy thomas , chief executive of the migraine trust , said : ' many chronic migraine patients find existing treatments are ineffective , or cause unpleasant side effects
this breakthrough has the potential to give them back a more normal life
' due to the way and how long sufferers are affected , people with chronic migraine take considerably more time off work , school , leisure , housework and social activities than episodic migraine patients
efficiency is also hit , with work or school productivity more than halved - described as a migraine ' hangover ' by numerous sufferers
incapacity for over half a month sometimes means people can not work at all , with some claiming disability living allowance
if the treatment given in the trials passes further tests , the injections could become available within a few years
the next step will be a phase iii trial on a larger population of people , in which the injection will be tested against a placebo .
