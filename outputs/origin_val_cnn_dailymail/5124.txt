the bbc was last night accused of suppressing an interview that called for corporation boss fairhead to resign over her Â£ 10,000 - a - day second job at scandal - hit hsbc bank
it âs a new blow to mrs fairhead , chairman of the trust and a non-executive director of hsbc , who is facing growing calls to quit one of her high - profile jobs over claims of a conflict of interest
she is due to be questioned by mps tomorrow after mail on sunday revealed that she was paid Â£ 513,000 for just 50 days work at the troubled bank last year , vastly exceeding her Â£ 110,000 salary for what is supposed to be her main job overseeing the bbc
last month hsbc came under fire over allegations that its swiss banking arm helped wealthy clients dodge millions of pounds of british taxes , and that it sought to influence media coverage
silenced : retired businessman mason-mahon ( right ) who said fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the trust , will not be shown now an hsbc shareholder has claimed the bbc refused to broadcast an interview with him in which he declared that mrs fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be heading the trust
retired businessman mason-mahon says he was invited to broadcasting house in central london to discuss the turmoil at hsbc in an on - the - record interview with a bbc business reporter on february 23
his interview failed to feature in the broadcaster âs coverage of the hsbc story that evening
he believes it was shelved because of his remarks questioning mrs fairhead âs fitness to run the trust
he said : â i said during the interview i disagreed with her appointment as trust chairwoman
â i could nât understand why a non-executive director who is there to protect the shareholders ignored us when we told her on numerous occasions in the past about illegal behaviour that was going on involving hsbc
â it âs my personal belief she âs not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the trust
the hsbc item was shown , but my interview was not in it
i believe it may have been suppressed
â mr mason-mahon has attempted to obtain a copy of the interview but has been told that this would be against bbc policy
mr mason-mahon is well - known for his outbursts at the annual general meetings of big public companies
last may he brought a lawsuit against hsbc âs north american arm after it was fined Â£ 1.2 billion having been found guilty in 2012 of allowing mexican drug cartels to launder money
last week former bbc chairman sir christopher bland called on mrs fairhead either to give up her post at hsbc or to resign from the trust
tomorrow she is due to appear in her role as an hsbc board member in front of the commons public accounts committee , which has fiercely attacked tax - dodging corporations
last night the bbc declined to say why the interview with mr mason-mahon was not broadcast and whether or not mrs fairhead â who is not supposed to be involved in editorial decisions â was told about it
a spokesman pointed out that it was the bbc âs panorama programme that originally broadcast the highly damaging allegations about hsbc âs swiss banking arm and added : â like every news organisation we do nât use every interview we conduct
' it is simply wrong to suggest that we would not broadcast an interview due to it criticising someone associated with the bbc
