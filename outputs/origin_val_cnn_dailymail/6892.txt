' marfan is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body âs connective tissue , which hold the body âs cells and organs together
connective tissue also plays an important role in helping the body grow and develop properly
marfan affects about one in 5,000 people - and can affect men and women of all races and ethnic groups
three - quarters of those who have it inherit it - and there is a 50 % chance that someone with marfan syndrome will pass along the genetic mutation each time they have a child
but some are the first in their family to have it , which is called spontaneous mutation when it happens
people with marfan syndrome are born with it , but features of the disorder are not always present immediately
some features of marfan syndrome , including those affecting the heart and blood vessels , bones or joints , can get worse over time
this means it is important for early diagnosis and treatment in order to avoid the risk for potentially life - threatening complications
