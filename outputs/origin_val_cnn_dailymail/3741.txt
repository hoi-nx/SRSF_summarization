the worst thing most people will get caught carrying at security is a bottle of water , but there are some passengers who attempt to sneak some dangerous and very bizarre items onto planes
the tsa ( transport security administration ) has its own instagram feed documenting the unusual items it confiscates from airport security checkpoints - and it certainly makes for interesting viewing
from passengers travelling with their beloved eels , to hiding knives in the most unlikely of places , the tsa shares it all with its 238,000 followers
though potentially harmless , this toy must be checked by explosive detection professionals , the tsa says discovered in a carry - on bag at the eagle county regional airport in colorado , it 's hard to know what this odd - looking creature is
while it might be nothing more than a homourous novelty toy , tsa agents have no way of knowing if the grenade in its hand is actually inert until explosive detection professionals have the chance to examine the item
grenades , whether inactive or otherwise , are prohibited in any carry - on or checked luggage
another item to leave out of your hand luggage ? seal bombs , like those discovered in a passenger 's carry - on bag in seattle 's tacoma international airport
a seal bomb is a small explosive used to frighten seals from fishing areas , but , unfortunately , what this traveller did n't know is that all explosives are prohibited from both carry - on and checked baggage
seal bombs , used for fishing , are prohibited from both carry - on and checked luggage one of the oddest items that mailonline came across while browsing the instagram was definitely a medieval mace , which was discovered in a carry - on bag at chicago 's midway international airport
similarly dangerous , a pair of cat - shaped brass knuckles were seized at the buffalo niagara international airport
while they may look like a key chain at first glance , these feline - inspired weapons can cause serious harm and are banned from bringing on board
one of the strangest confiscated items ? a medieval mace , found at chicago 's midway international airport these cat - shaped brass knuckles must be checked into the hold in order to be transported in 2012 , officers seized a bag of live eels , which they found in a passenger 's checked luggage in miami officers received a massive shock when they discovered a bag full of live eels back in 2012
found in a passenger 's checked bag at the miami international airport , the traveller was attempting to transport 163 marine tropical fish and 22 invertebrates to maracaibo , venezuela
however , instead of arguing with security , the passenger , smartly , opted to surrender all items to the u.s. fish and wildlife service
seven small snakes were also discovered in miami in 2011 , after being stuffed down a traveller 's trousers in nylon stockings
the snakes were found using tsa 's advanced imaging technology , which allows officers to find threatening items that have been concealed from plain sight
the passenger was later arrested and charged
and yet another animal - based smuggling attempt was made in the form of a knife concealed within a scooby doo greeting card , despite the fact that all knives are prohibited from carry - on bags
a scooby doo greeting card was used by a crafty passenger to unsuccessfully conceal a knife also in miami in 2011 , a passenger attempted to smuggle seven snakes , in nylon stockings , in their trousers swords , though fine to check , can not be brought on board an airplane as a carry - on item this jack the ripper - like sickle was seized from a passenger 's bag because no blades are allowed on board throwing stars , which are used in martial arts , are banned in some american states but not others interestingly , one item travellers can bring through security : a freshly - baked pie , like this one from swords and a jack the ripper - like sickle to throwing stars , all bladed objects are prohibited from carry - on bags - but that has n't kept many passengers from attempting to transport them through the security checkpoint
but do n't worry , even swords can be taken to your destination in a checked suitcase
interestingly , however , you are allowed to bring baked goods through security , such as this pecan pie .
