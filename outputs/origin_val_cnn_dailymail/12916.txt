when china photographer wang wenlan first pressed the shutter on a borrowed soviet camera in 1967 , he was a teenager taking photos to kill time during chairman mao 's cultural revolution
" i made rolls of film out of a motion - picture reel i found
the photographic paper was left over from printing mao 's portraits , " wang wenlan told cnn
five decades later , wang wenlan , 61 , is one of the country 's top photojournalists
his work is a rich chronicle of china 's fast - changing society
" still images are fragments , sections and points that connect the history , " wang wenlan says
" the whole process of china 's reform over the past four decades -- whether going forward or stalling -- i 've been determined to and have managed to document it all
" one of his most famous series of photographs tracks china 's relationship with the bicycle -- once a family 's most precious asset but now fast vanishing from the streets
photography was an outlet for wang wenlan during the dark days of the cultural revolution , when china was convulsed by violent class struggle
his family were labeled " capitalist roaders " and unlike most other kids , he could n't join the red guards
despondent , 14 - year - old wang wenlan wandered around beijing with friends in similar situations , snapping pictures and portraits to distract himself
taking photos turned into more than a pastime in january 1976 , when premier zhou enlai died - beloved by many for his role in tempering the worst of mao 's excesses
wang wenlan went to tiananmen square with his camera , capturing the unprompted outpouring of grief , both then , and again in april that year
" i was in deep grief , " wang wenlan said , " and i felt i should record the collective grief
" he kept the film secret from the military , which then employed him as a photographer , transferring it to friends
the photos were published in the early 1980s
from then on , wang wenlan saw that his camera was much more than a memory keeper
" i did n't get photojournalism until then , " he said
" my biggest regret was not to capture anything meaningful during the cultural revolution period ; it would 've been a precious record
" in the decades following , wang wenlan has photographed not only major events -- from tangshan earthquake in 1976 and the overthrow of the gang of four , to the beijing olympic games in 2008 -- but also intimate moments captured in china 's changing countryside and growing cities
from april 3 , wang wenlan will have the first overseas exhibition of his work in the united states at the university of iowa
curator judy polumbaum -- a china media scholar and former colleague of wang wenlan -- said his work is a great window to examine contemporary china
" it reflects not only the many changes in china society emerging over the past several decades but also the endurance of tradition , and the often striking and sometimes amusing clashes between tradition and change , " she said
the clash between tradition and modernity is stark in the lead picture of the exhibit â an elderly farmer looks on as a groom carries his bride through the field and " the couple 's western wedding garb contrasting with this longstanding custom , " she says
wang wenlan has spent most of his career at the china daily , the country 's official english - language paper , which he joined in 1980 before its official launch
back then , it broke the mold , using large photographs rather than the stamp - sized images used in most other china newspapers at the time , he says
it was also unafraid to feature ordinary people on its pages , rather than national leaders -- something wang wenlan found he excelled at
" thanks to the china daily , i stood out
it was an irreplaceable platform
" wang wenlan finds himself nostalgic for the 1980s , when ideas emerged and collided after the cultural revolution ended
" people thought nothing was impossible , " he said
" we reflected on the past and were determined to move on
it was a special time ; the air was filled with ideals , enthusiasm and all kinds of possibilities
" today 's china is different , he said
" the country 's goal has shifted toward a transition to a market economy since the 1990s , " he said
" individuals also have since switched their focus onto consumerism and incomes from ideals
" throughout his career , wang wenlan 's focus has changed a great deal as well
he said he used to focus on the technical and artistic aspects of photography , but now , with smart phones , he says anyone can be a photographer
to wang wenlan , what matters is the perspective , he said , pointing at his head
wang wenlan says he 's felt obligated to observe and criticize through his lens over the years
" my job is n't to chant slogans
" " i take photos first
it 's great if they can be published ; if not , they 'll eventually be part of the history
" next year will mark wang wenlan 's 40th year in photojournalism
he is planning to have a photo exhibition and wants to call it " unfinished
" the name was inspired by the alternative title of franz schubert 's symphony no.8
" china is unfinished , " said wang wenlan , who is also fan and critic of classic music
" it 's always a work in progress
