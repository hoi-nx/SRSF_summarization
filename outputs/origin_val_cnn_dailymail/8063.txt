a father spent Â£ 10,000 on private detectives after police failed to track down the thug who killed his daughter âs kitten with an air rifle
neil tregarthen devoted six weeks to gathering information for a 15 - page report that named their prime suspect â but officers dismissed it as â rumour and speculation â and abandoned the case
yesterday the millionaire former business owner â who posed as an angler at one stage to spy on youths he believed were responsible â criticised the police investigation as â totally impotent â
but police refused to bring a prosecution because of â lack of evidence â for an attack that condemned farah the kitten to a slow , agonising death
mr neil tregarthen âs daughter aylish was horrified to find farah lying in a pool of blood after limping home wounded and crippled with pain last september
the 24 - year - old medical student and her father took the kitten to a vet but she suffered â a very long , painful , lingering death â from a ruptured bowel and blood poisoning , finally passing away on the operating table , mr neil tregarthen said
when police told him there was not enough evidence to pursue the case he hired the detective firm and offered a Â£ 1,000 reward to catch the killer
they distributed flyers and set up a phone line for people to give information
it quickly became clear there had been a string of air rifle attacks near where aylish lives in exeter , devon
â we narrowed it down to four youths , so we set about doing surveillance work , â mr neil tregarthen said
â we would camp out on the river pretending to be fishing
we surveyed certain areas by pretending to be members of the public
ideally we needed to witness an incident , but that never happened
we found a witness who claimed he had witnessed our main suspect shooting another cat
â the kitten , pictured right with one of the family 's other pets , died despite extensive treatment at the vets mr neil tregarthen is offering Â£ 1,000 to anyone with information which could lead to farah 's killer
the kitten was shot near her owner 's home in exeter exeter - based focus investigations , whose staff includes ex-police officers , said the person responsible had â an obvious sociopathic nature â
mr neil tregarthen , 56 , added : â we compiled all the information we had , and presented it to the police
we did 85 per cent of the work â then devon and cornwall would not even go and knock on a couple of doors
using an air rifle to shoot cats is illegal , and should be treated as such
â mr neil tregarthen , who lives in a luxury house in truro , cornwall , said of the cost of his own investigation : â i would pay double that if i thought it would stop this sort of behaviour
' i know i am in a fortunate position to be able to do so , but i think it is money well spent
it âs about society fighting back
â mr neil tregarthen enlisted the help of private investigators focus ( offices pictured above ) to help find farah 's killer the animal is likely to have been playing in the garden when killed , mr neil tregarthen said
she returned to miss tregarthen 's house wounded his daughter said : â i feel like there is no justification for not investigating something that is illegal
we sympathise with the budget cuts â they have limited time and resources , which is why we chose to investigate it
but to still have the same response is very disappointing
â devon and cornwall police neighbourhood beat manager steve parsons said : â we investigated this crime fully
as for the investigation report , i have examined this and it is packed with rumour and speculation , not evidence
â however , on the back of this , officers did make further inquiries in the area which also turned out to be fruitless
i am confident we have done everything possible in investigating this case
â mr neil tregarthen said police were ' impotent ' in their investigations into who killed the cat , pictured above in a red collar mr neil tregarthen lives in a plush Â£ 3million home in truro , cornwall ( above )
