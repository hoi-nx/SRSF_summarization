the president of sierra leoneans has an idea on how to curtail the spread of ebola : get everybody to stay inside
president koroma on saturday launched a campaign called " ebola , " in which almost all sierra leoneans are supposed to stay indoors march 27 - 29 and from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on three consecutive saturdays -- april 4 , 11 and 18
" the campaign will provide an opportunity for communities to be directly involved in the drive to zero cases , to reflect and to pray for the eradication of this disease from our country , " he said in a statement
sierra leona tried a three - day lockdown last september in what was primarily an informational campaign , with volunteers going door - to - door to talk with residents about the virus
in august , the liberia government locked down one of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital of monrovia in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus
the move resulted in riots
no commercial activity is supposed to occur during the upcoming lockdown , koroma said
because march 29 is palm sunday , church services will be allowed from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. health workers , journalists and public safety officers are exempted
koroma noted that his country has made " tremendous progress " in the fight against the deadly disease as the ministry of health reported zero new infections friday
he warned that the rate of transmissions may increase during the upcoming rainy season
" the economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of ebola in sierra leoneans , " he said
" the future of our country and the aspirations of our children are at stake
" during sierra leoneans 's lockdown last year , doctors without borders said such an effort is unlikely to stop the spread of the disease
" large - scale coercive measures like forced quarantines and lockdowns are driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers , " the charity group said in a statement
" this is leading to the concealment of cases and is pushing the sick away from health systems
" sierra leoneans has the largest number of confirmed ebola cases -- 11,751 so far , according to the who
who says liberia has the highest number of deaths -- 4,264
so far , 10,194 have died from ebola and 24,701 have been infected , according to who
ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person
the national institutes for health said thursday it will admit an united states health care worker with ebola to its maryland hospital
the person was volunteering at an ebola treatment center in sierra leoneans
the centers for disease control and prevention said last tuesday that 15 united states aid workers who had high - risk exposure to ebola in sierra leoneans have arrived back in the united states for monitoring
none is known to be infected with the disease
