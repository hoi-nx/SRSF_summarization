prior to his death , he recorded video footage of himself â dressed in army fatigues â in which he said : ' my name is scurfield
i came here on my own free will and i came here to help
' his family , who live in a detached former farmhouse in royston , near barnsley , south yorkshire , were devastated to hear of his death
they were under the impression that he had left british in november last year to provide ' medical and humanitarian support ' as an expert in battlefield medicine

scurfield was stopped from joining kurdish forces last october when he was still a serving royal marine
he had been training with the u.s. marines in california when he made email contact with a kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline
but he was stopped while trying to board a flight from los angeles to istanbul , a now well - known jumping off point for syria , in october and questioned by the american authorities
his one - way ticket rang â alarm bells â , officials said , and his luggage , phone and laptop were examined
the royal marine , who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of isis , was also questioned by police on arrival in the british and then returned to his unit , 45 commando , in arbroath , scotland
it is believed he left the royal marine just weeks later
at one point during the procession , a woman dressed in a headscarf offered mr scurfield 's devastated father support , by pulling him close to her and kissing him on the head
according to the kurdish female fighters page on facebook , those who gathered at the ceremony chanted â slogans of heroism â as mr scurfield âs body was handed back to his family
the group said the chants included : â oh immortal martyr ! we swear by your blood , your blood will never be left on the ground , we will take your revenge and we will never forget you
' with our life and with our blood we are with you , oh martyr
â another post by the facebook group said : â the body of british ypg fighter scurfield , is on the way back to british
â you will never be forgotten , you will always live in our hearts
â it is believed that it will be some time before the fighter 's body is repatriated to the british , due to paperwork , and the foreign office refused to comment on the matter
