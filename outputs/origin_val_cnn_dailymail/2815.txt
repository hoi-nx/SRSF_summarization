is it really you ? : jasper the cat stares lovingly at her best dog friend bow-z before giving him the hug of a lifetime ( for a lifetime ) where have you been ? : jasper the cat has n't seen bow-z in 10 days so she jumps up to give him a hug still hugging : jasper ca n't take her tiny paws off of bow-z 's neck because she misses him so much as soon as jasper catches a glimpse of bow-z she ca n't help but wrap her tiny arms around his neck
' meow , ' jasper exclaims several times as if to say , ' i missed you so much
how could you ever leave me ? ' when her tiny claws fail her and she falls off her furry friend 's neck , she resiliently goes up to give him another very long hug
bow-z who is less emotive than his feline companion wags his tail silently and walks into the next room
not letting him out of her sight , jasper follows bow-z as he walks away and continues to jump on him for more hugs
no hug back ? : japser continues to hug bow-z as he wags his tail silently , perhaps too overcome with emotion to let out a single woof do n't leave again ! : as bow-z walks into the next room , jasper keeps a tight grip on him as she does n't let him out of her sight
