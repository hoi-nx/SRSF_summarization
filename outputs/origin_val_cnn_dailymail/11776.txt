manchester united manager louis van gaal has asked his players not to play as many backpasses to goalkeeper david de gea as he faces mounting criticism over his side 's unadventurous performances this season
despite travelling to newcastle on wednesday in a champions league spot , manchester united fans booed their team during saturday 's 2 - 0 win against sunderland , most notably when an attacking corner was played all the way back to their spain ' keeper
though van gaal is keen for supporters to lay off his players , he does admit sharing their frustration at de gea being over-used as a springboard for attacks
louis van gaal said he agreed with the fans that sometimes it was frustrating watching manchester united van gaal felt that sometimes his team passed the ball back to david de gea unnecessarily ' i agree with the fans that we do n't have to use the goalkeeper so much , ' he said
' i have seen moments when we could play with a higher tempo without interfering with the goalkeeper
' sometimes the players may not see another solution
but i have to support them
also , a fan has to see that
' of course , to attack is more or less the english style of playing a match
but i think the supporters have also enjoyed manchester united playing in a possession game so it is always a mix of playing both
i think we can still improve in not losing the ball unnecessarily

van gaal admits the raft of players he signed in the summer including di maria are struggling to come to terms with english football and said it may take 12 months for manchester united fans to see the best of them
' the first season is always difficult
you can see it with every player we bought â shaw , blind , ander herrera , radamel falcao and also di maria

although it is a daunting schedule , van gaal is taking heart at their run at the end of last year when they rose from 13th to third after a run that included back - to - back away wins at arsenal and southampton followed by a thumping 3 - 0 win against liverpool
