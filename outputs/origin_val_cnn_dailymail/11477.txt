known as ' the king ' by supporters of the club , astle 's crowning glory came when he scored the extra time winner in the 1968 fa cup final against everton at wembley
two years later , astle scored in west brom 's 2 - 1 defeat to manchester city in the league cup final , becoming the first player to score in finals of both english cup competitions at wembley
astle won five caps for england and was part of the squad at the 1970 world cup in mexico
he passed away on january 19 , 2002 at the age of 59 , with a coroner finding that repeated minor traumas caused by heading the heavy leather footballs of his era were the cause of his death
west brom fans applaud in the ninth minute of every game - no 9 was his shirt number - in tribute to him
his family will officially launch the foundation , which will raise funds for research into cte or chronic traumatic encephalopathy
astle died of the condition in 2002 at the age of just 59
the disease is normally linked to boxing but coroners at the footballer 's inquest ruled astle 's brain had been damaged by heading heavy leather footballs in the 1960s and 1970s
the justice for astle campaign was launched after this and at every game this season , west brom fans have held a minute - long round of applause in the ninth minute as he wore the no 9 shirt for the club
the historic kit , modelled by club captain darren fletcher and striker saido berahino , features no sponsorship logos and the players will be numbered 1 - 11 as was tradition at the time
it is only the second time the premier league have given special dispensation for a replica strip to be worn - the other was for manchester united on the 50th anniversary of the munich air disaster in 2008
astle 's widow laraine and daughters dawn and claire chose the leicester fixture because they provided the opposition on astle 's debut for the west brom 50 years ago
astle played 361 matches for west brom between 1964 and 1974 , scoring 174 goals astle died at the age of 59 in 2002 , with coroners ruling the cause was heading heavy leather footballs club chairman jeremy peace said : ' we promised at the start of the season to honour both astle and his family 's efforts to raise awareness of an important issue by dedicating a home game to him - and it promises to be a special day
' we are absolutely delighted the premier league have granted permission for this kit change as an additional salute to a footballer who remains much loved
' we are mindful that it is only the second time this has happened which i think says much about astle 's standing and the gravity football places on the issues his death raised
' we must not forget to also thank our sponsors intuit quickbooks and kit suppliers adidas
when we presented them with the idea they immediately grasped the spirit of the project and graciously stepped aside
' the one minute ovations for astle and the ' if in doubt , sit it out ' campaign this season have been well supported by fans up and down the country and now the launch of the foundation gives a new impetus to the family 's efforts
' there is a need to support the research required to understand more about the issues the astle family have fought so hard to raise

' i think the astle family 's dedication to their father and husband is inspiring and the idea of an astle foundation is important
