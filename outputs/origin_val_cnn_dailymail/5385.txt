strachan is living proof there is life after man united
scotland âs manager left the world âs wealthiest football club at the age of 32 and , like the clichÃ© says , feared the only way was down
within three years , he was captain of leeds , champions of england
the odds of fletcher mirroring that achievement at west brom are long
yet strachan casts a glance at one of his star midfielders now and sees a rejuvenated figure
free of the ulcerative colitis which cast a long shadow over his old trafford career , fletcher is playing football again
his performances at the hawthorns have drawn critical acclaim
scotland manager strachan has praised fletcher for leaving man united strachan has revealed he is yet to decide if fletcher ( centre ) will lead scotland in their upcoming fixtures scotland manager strachan says he does n't know who will be his captain for the upcoming fixtures there can be no denying that having a man united player as captain was a boon to scots morale
yet strachan knew when the time was right to seek fresh pastures
fletcher , he believes , is thriving in his new environment
â you can , when you leave man united , go on and create a new career for yourself , â said the scotland boss as he prepared for the twin challenges of northern ireland and gibraltar
â some find it difficult , some get on with it and create a new career
that âs what fletcher is doing now
â tony pulis , apart from being a good coach , knows good players
getting good people around you is the secret
â i got on all right after i left man united
i had good players around me and good people
â football players just like playing football
fletcher has got a hunger and a pride
it âs not easy to leave man united
it âs one of the best clubs in the world , if not the best
â so there âs a point when you think , â is this it ? â but then you realise there âs more to life and your career can continue
there is another world out there
â man united was all fletcher had known
strachan ( far right , pictured with ron atkinson , jesper olsen and alan brazil ) left man united to join leeds celtic captain scott brown has been scotland skipper in the absence of west brom skipper fletcher born in dalkeith , he signed for sir alex ferguson in 2003 and spent 12 years at the club
celtic tried to bring him back to his native land before the opportunity to remain in the premier league proved irresistible
in contrast with his latter years at man united , when first - team appearances were bitty and sporadic , fletcher has played almost every game since signing for tony pulis in the january window
â i think he âs happier in himself , which is understandable , â said strachan
â he has played 10 or 15 games this season and is enjoying life
â he has answered a few questions by playing all those games
i saw him a couple of weeks ago at aston villa and he was terrific , even though west brom lost
â i âve been lucky during his absence that i âve got scott brown , james mcarthur , james morrison and mulgrew
in the republic of ireland game , mulgrew was as good as anyone in there
we have good players in midfield
â there is a physical and mental side to it for fletcher but he has dealt with that
he has decided what his career is and that it âs not with man united any more
he does nât want to be a sub , he wanted to do something about it
â fletcher has played seven games for west brom since joining the midlands outfit on february 2 fletcher decided to leave man united after struggling to break into louis van gaal 's first team plans capped 66 times , fletcher has been captain of the national team for most of that time
it âs far from clear he will be this time , with celtic âs scott brown claiming the armband in recent games
strachan says he has yet to decide his team to face northern ireland , let alone the identity of his captain
the intensity of training has taken the scotland boss by surprise , adding to the difficult decisions which lie in wait
â when i went out to training , i thought to myself i had four things to do and really i should be doing them over a four - day period , â he continued
â i had to try to cram four things in and i was nât sure if we could push the players to do this
â but i kid you not , after i did the four things the players would happily have gone on for another half hour
â we could nât believe the intensity of the training - it âs amazing because some of them have already played 40 games this season but not one of them was giving an inch on either side
it was terrific and if we can take that into the game then we âll be fine
â i almost had to calm them down and make a few adjustments just so that we could all get a breather
â steven naismith ( right ) was desperate to train with the scotland national team despite his recent exploits it âs impossible for outsiders to know how true this is , yet there is a simple gauge for the contentment levels of a national team
if tired , mentally jaded players were tempted to miss an international week this would be it
an uninspiring friendly with northern ireland , followed by a qualifier with gibraltar on sunday at 5pm
yet shaun maloney flew from california , where new club chicago fire lost to san jose earthquakes on sunday night
steven naismith , in ukraine with everton last week , also passed on the chance to take some time off before joining up
â they surprise me with their enthusiasm because i thought , after four months and all the games they have played for their clubs in between , that this week would be all about rest and talking , â said strachan
â i thought i would have to protect them
but their energy is fantastic - they do nât seem to want to be protected
most of them are happy with life and just want to play
â i âve no idea what it is about them but they have a natural enthusiasm and enjoy working with each other
i do nât think we should analyse it too much - just go with the flow
you can screw yourself up the wall by over analysing things
â all i need to say is that tuesday was not what i expected
â shaun maloney has just flown in from california
you say to him , â do you want a wee rest ? â but he âs not interested
â i said the same thing to steven naismith because he âs been doing a lot of playing and travelling in the europa league with everton
i actually asked him if he wanted two days off to spend at home with his family because i thought it would be beneficial
but again , he was not interested
he just wanted to come up and be part of the group
â on monday , i needed 16 players for a specific training session i had in mind
but i had 17 of them all desperate to take part
â in the end , i had to remind jordan rhodes that he âs had a knock and that he could do with sitting this one out ... â
