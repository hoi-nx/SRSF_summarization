the white house claimed today that the us should be feared by â extremists â in yemeni â even though the last remaining special forces have been evacuated from the country â because it is dangerous
' white house spokesman earnest said that isis - linked groups will have us to deal with if they carry out more attacks in the war - torn country , which is split between sunni and shia
us officials ' had to relocate from yemeni because its a dangerous country , ' earnest said monday
' but i 'll tell you , that as of today , yemeni remains a dangerous country for extremists as well
' earnest said there continues to be continues to be ' ongoing security cooperation ' between the us and the ' national security infrastructure ' of yemeni president hadi , whose power has been crippled in recent months after shia rebels initiated a coup - d'etat
the uk also pulled its special forces out of the country , following the us ' lead , leaving hadi and his loyalists to face extremist and rebel threats to the country on their own

' house homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul had said a day before on abc news program this week that the result of the complete withdraw is that ' we will have no intelligence footprint or capabilities to monitor ' what al qaeda affiliates , known in the country as aqap , isis and shia ' militants are doing in the region
' ' good intelligence stops plots against the homeland , ' he said
' without that intelligence , we can not effectively stop it , that âs what i âm most concerned about
' earnest said monday afternoon that its ' true ' that he us would be a ' more effective ' force against extremists if military personnel were still in the country - but it ' does n't mean that coordination has been eliminated
' the white house said it has proven its ability to fight threats in other countries , including syria and somalia , without troops on the ground and it will do the same in yemeni
the us , has already shown that it will take extremists ' off the battlefield in yemeni when they pose a threat to the us
' ' those efforts continue , and our capability to carry out those kinds of actions persists to this day as well
' yemeni carry a coffin during a funeral for the victims of sanna mosque attacks in sanaa , yemeni , on monday
the yemeni people held a funeral for those who were killed in suicide bombing attacks in sanaa on friday
the islamic state says it launched the bombing attacks that killed at least 154 people and wounded 350 others but the white house disputes that the terrorist group was involved yemeni and members of the houthi militia inspect the scene of a suicide attack on saturday in yemeni us officials ' had to relocate from yemeni because its a dangerous country , ' us president barack obama 's chief spokesman , earnest , said on monday
' but i 'll tell you , that as of today , yemeni remains a dangerous country for extremists as as well
' the remarks follow the us ' removal on saturday of special forces from the country the white house 's insistence that its counter terror strategy in yemeni , which the president propped up as a success story last year , and the region is still effective came after the country 's security situation took a turn for the worse over the weekend
on friday four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 people and injured hundreds more when they walked into the badr and al-hashoosh mosques in the capital city of sanaa and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country
a fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques
isis has since taken responsibility for the attack , but the white house said monday it has not seen evidence to support the group 's claims
more likely , it said , is that isis is taking credit for the assault ' merely for propaganda value , ' not because it had any direct involvement
hundreds of members of al qaeda also managed to escape from yemeni prisons on thursday and friday
in addition , shia rebels that have taken over large parts of the country , the houthis , issued a call to arms on saturday to fight yemeni loyal to embattled president hadi

aqap claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo shooting earlier this year in paris
members of the houthi militia inspect the scene inside the mosque of one of friday 's suicide bombings further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between president hadi and the houthi rebels
the houthis are a shia group that earlier this year gained power in the country after taking over the government in a struggle that some believe was funded by iran
the white house says it does not know how much support iran is providing the houthis but it does not appear to be controlling their operational movements
in january of this year , the houthi rebels seized the presidential palace , and by february they had taken control of the government
it was at that point most us were ushered out the country and the embassy was shuttered
the houthis launched a new strike against hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of aden , the country 's temporary capital
that same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of president hadi and houthi rebels battled in the same city
then on saturday , the houthis issued a call to arms to attack supporters of president hadi following a speech he gave , one of his first in weeks , in which he accused rebels of carrying out ' a coup against constitutional legitimacy
' he also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the saudi city of riyadh and announced a plan to place a national flag in the city of sa'dah , the houthis base
above all else he said he wanted unity for the country
sunday the u.n. ' special envoy for yemeni to the international organization 's security council that the country was on ' the edge of civil war
' following the suicide bombings and fighting , emotions are running extremely high , and unless a solution can be found in the coming days the country will slide into further violent conflict and fragmentation , ' the envoy , jamal benomar , said
yemeni foreign minister riyadh yaseen on monday reportedly asked the country 's neighbors to help the government fend off rebels militarily
yemeni 's president hadi delivers a speech calling for unity on saturday hundreds of yemeni chant slogans and hold placards as they protest the suicide bombings on saturday the white house reaffirmed its belief on monday that hadi is ' the rightful leader of yemeni ' and pointed to a u.n. statement issued over the weekend that echoed the policy position
the us , earnest said , hopes along with the international community that the houthis will stop their rampage ' and participate in the un-led effort to try to resolve the differences of all the parties there
' asked if the us had plans to designate the houthis as a terrorist group , earnest directed reporters to the state department
' what we have been focused on are the serious concerns that we have about the destablizing activity of the houthis , ' he said of the president 's advisers , and ' we could encourage both sides , including the houthis , to put an end to the violence and come to the negotiating table
' should they decide to participate in the peace process , earnest said the us and the u.n. would be involved ' so that we can end the bloodshed , that we can end the violence , and try to bring some stability to this nation that 's been racked by so much instability over the years
