gareth bale has told his wales colleagues he wants to stay at madrid for at least one more season
but chelsea are poised to move in
indeed , the madrid hierarchy are ready to accept gareth bale 's Â£ 75m buy - out clause back to a premier league club in order to refurbish their team and keep cristiano ronaldo
man united would love cristiano ronaldo back but , as long predicted by this column , have other priorities in team building this summer with targets such as mats hummels , paul pogba and dani alves
gareth bale wants to stay at madrid but chelsea are poised to move for the wales international man united would love to re-sign cristiano ronaldo from madrid but have other transfer priorities borussia dortmund defender mats hummels and juventus star paul pogba are targets for man united it could then be that gareth bale becomes a battle between chelsea and manchester city with the blues in pole position given ffp rules
arsenal , meanwhile , aspire to sign germany international marco reus but madrid are likely to win that battle
arsenal are keen to sign borussia dortmund 's marco reus but madrid are likely to capture the winger sam allaradyce could become the new republic of ireland manager next season
martin o'neill goes into sunday 's pivotal euro qualifier against poland under pressure
if it goes the wrong way then sam allardyce - on his way out of west ham - has been identified as a potential new man , football grapevine has been told
west ham manager sam allardyce could replace martin o'neill as republic of ireland boss next season i am hearing while west ham have cooled on the idea of signing alex song , currently on loan from barcelona , on a permanent basis , they are keen to buy carl jenkinson from arsenal when his loan term expires in the summer
arsenal , though , could play hard ball over the fee , wanting perhaps in excess of Â£ 10 million
meanwhile , alex song still harbours hopes of making it to a champions league club with manchester city and liverpool still possibilities
west ham have cooled on signing alex song but are keen to purchase carl jenkinson from arsenal i am also hearing liverpool still believe they will sign danny ings from burnley on a bosman transfer this summer
but danny ings , who has attracted interest at real sociedad , also has options with bundesliga clubs borussia monchengladbach and borussia dortmund
liverpool believe they will sign burnley 's danny ings but the striker is also wanted by borussia dortmund i was in the company of frank lampard snr ( father of ex-chelsea star frank lampard - now of manchester city but very soon to be new york city ) last week at langan 's restaurant in london âs mayfair for a pre-launch of bobby moore : the documentary
some funding remains to be required to get the show on the road ; hence the event
but it would appear the project inspired by broadcaster matt lorenzo is on its way , not least because of the support of the lampards
' big frank ' was mentored by bobby moore as a young west ham player
he still reveres the sadly deceased england world cup winning captain of 1966 , who was a football , fashion and style icon of his era
as some wonderful footage was rolled out big frank whispered in my ear : ' mooro was the guv'nor at most things , but he could nât dance
' frank lampard snr ( second left ) revealed bobby moore ( right ) was the guv'nor but he could n't dance isay there were many people , including ex-pro pundits , who somehow thought gerrard received an easy ride from the media for his red card against man united last week for a stamp on ander herrera compared to chelsea striker costa , who was also given a retrospective ban for a similar incident earlier this season
some went as far to suggest it was more evidence of a conspiracy against chelsea
the notion that there is unity of opinion in mainstream media is of course nonsense
gerrard is shown red for a stamp on ander herrera during liverpool 's 2 - 1 defeat by man united but it 's true that in general , gerrard did receive far less of a ' coating ' for his nasty act than costa
the main reason was that gerrard was quick to hold his hands up and quickly came out to publicly apologise for his act of madness
costa , even after video evidence proved his guilt , remained in denial
gerrard offered an apology and gained respect with his contrition
many people believe gerrard received an easy ride compared to chelsea attacker costa costa was handed a retrospective ban after stamping on liverpool midfielder emre can at stamford bridge btw as soon as harry kane began celebrating his debut england goal after his hurricane entry into international football , the tv cameras flashed to the vip box and caught fa chairman dyke beaming with a smug grin then turning to someone in the row behind
i 've no idea exactly what dyke said
but he was quite entitled to chortle : ' now that just goes to prove my point
' earlier in the week , dyke announced bold plans to raise the quota of home grown players in 25 - man premier league squads from eight to 12
dyke ( left ) shows his delight after young striker harry kane finds the back of the net for england he also wants to see a reduction in work permits given to non eu players of ' mediocre ' standard
the premier league have quickly come out in opposition
but dyke 's idea is sound
he argues that there could be a lot more harry kanes out there but their chances of breaking through are being blocked by , in some cases , an obsession with overseas players at some clubs
dyke argues the premier league could have more kanes by raising the quota of homegrown players indeed , harry kane - after a series of loan spells - looked to be on his way out of spurs because his route to the first team was blocked
emmanuel adebayor , who has long been coasting on the gravy train , was just one player in his way
sherwood thought differently and blooded harry kane
it took some time for mauricio pochettino , sherwood 's successor as spurs boss , to trust harry kane to start in the premier league but at least he gave him a go
sherwood , now in charge at aston villa , argues there are many academy graduates up and down the country who , if given a decent run in the team , have the quality and hunger to be top class players
it took a season or so for john terry to find his feet at chelsea back in the day
one wonders though , would jose mourinho have the patience with a 19 - year - old john terry ? john terry took a season to find his feet at chelsea and has made over 650 appearances for the blues take west ham - they have taken 33 - year - old brazilian nene , who is effectively past it , for the rest of the season on a free transfer to plug a gap rather than recall promising 20 - year - old forward elliot lee from his spell at luton
given the west ham are safe from relegation surely there could be no better time to really find out about the striker - son of newcastle legend rob lee - who made one first - team appearance three years ago
but sam allardyce does not have a good track record for bringing young players through
west ham signed 33 - year - old nene ( left ) on a free transfer rather than blooding the club 's youngsters those premier league owners who object to dyke 's plan should take a step back and consider it could make economic sense for them and not just boost the pool for the national team
after all , how much has harry kane saved spurs
the way he 's going it 's hurtling towards Â£ 50 million
ibet italy have had the upper hand against england over the years , winning eleven , losing eight and drawing six
on the face of it , a weakened england team look vulnerable and one bookmaker make italy 6/5 favourites with england 12/5
a 2 - 1 italy win at 8/1 is decent shout
harry kane , who is set to start , is 8/1 to score the first goal
one of england 's best displays against italy was the 0 - 0 draw they achieved in rome in 1997 to qualify for the world cup
paul gascoigne , paul ince and ian wright were among the england heroes that night
you can get 8/1 on a 0 - 0 draw
paul ince was one of the heroes as england draw 0 - 0 with italy in 1997 to qualify for the world cup
