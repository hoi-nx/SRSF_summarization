spurs have been given the go - ahead to build their new stadium after a local firm admitted defeat in its objections to the Â£ 400 million development
archway launched a legal challenge to a compulsory purchase order ( cpo ) rejected last month but could have appealed
the firm has now decided not to do so , it announced on friday
how spurs 's new stadium will look for night games from 2018 - 19 season onwards archway , which is located next to white hart lane on the last patch of land spurs needed for their stadium development argued that the compulsory purchase order was unlawful now that archway have dropped their case , spurs have the go - ahead for their new 56,000 - plus capacity stadium at white hart lane the company announced in a statement : ' we have always been willing to negotiate with the club on a reasonable and proper basis
' we will continue to try to achieve a proper settlement by agreement if that is possible
' spurs have relocated more than 70 local businesses from the site , which is adjacent to the white hart lane home they have occupied since 1899
by moving for what is expected to be the 2018 - 19 season , they will increase their capacity from barely 36,000 to 56,250
before then spurs expect to move elsewhere for at least one season , possibly alternating between wembley and sharing with league one ( third tier ) club milton keynes dons
the club also applied several years ago to move permanently to the olympic stadium but lost out to london rivals west ham united
