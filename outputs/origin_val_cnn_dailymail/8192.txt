it 's deja vu all over again for arsenal in the champions league
tuesday night 's brave but preventable champions league exit against monaco was the fifth time in a row wenger has been knocked out at the last - 16 stage
and once again it was the first leg that cost him
arsenal were knocked out in france on away goals , a 2 - 0 away win failing to make up for a catastrophic 3 - 1 loss at the emirates
their players know the history
' we say same thing every year , â complained defender laurent koscielny
' our first game is catastrophic
we have to put it right - play well in two games
' wenger vents his frustration on the sideline as arsenal fall a goal short in their 2 - 0 win over monaco aaron ramsey made an immediate impact off the bench and scored but could n't help the gunners advance monaco celebrate advancing to the champions league quarter finals as arsenal fall again in the last 16 aaron ramsey concurred : â we âve always gone out to bayern and barcelona at this stage but no disrespect to monaco , we thought we âd have a good opportunity to qualify
but we gave ourselves a tough test from the first leg
it âs nearly again , but it âs not enough
â after losing 4 - 3 on aggregate to barcelona in 2011 â beating them 2 - 1 in the first leg before losing 3 - 1 at the nou camp - arsenal 's first leg travails have hurt them every 12 months
andrey arshavin is ecstatic after scoring the winner for arsenal in their 2011 first leg win over barcelona lionel messi is swamped by his barcelona team - mates as his penalty wins their place in the 2011 quarters barcelona overcame the 2 - 1 loss to arsenal in the first leg to defeat the gunners and advance with a 3 - 1 victory 2012 ac milan 4 arsenal 0 ; arsenal 3 ac milan 0 ( ac milan win 4 - 3 on aggregate ) arsenal were a shambles in the san siro as kevin-prince boateng , robinho ( two ) and zlatan ibrahimovic ( from the penalty spot ) tore them apart
incredibly , wenger 's men clawed back three of the goals in the first half at the emirates through laurent koscielny , tomas rosicky and robin van persie ( penalty ) but still could n't force extra-time with robin van persie missing from close range
where did it all go wrong ? fans will remember the van persie miss ( perhaps coloured by the player 's subsequent exit ) , but it was the mental collapse in the first leg that cost arsenal
the first goal was spectacular , if avoidable , but the other three were brutally poor defending
against a decent , but not world - beating attack , the likes of johan djourou proved they did n't belong

bayern win on away goals exactly the same set of results as this week
toni kroos , thomas muller and mario mandzukic gave bayern a seemingly unassailable first leg lead , only for arsenal to come so close to an astonishing comeback in germany with goals from olivier giroud and laurent koscielny
bayern ended up winning the champions league where did it all go wrong ? it 's a little harsh to criticise a defeat against europe 's best side , but arsenal were naive in the first leg
having weathered a bayern storm , and found a way back into the tie at 2 - 1 , the gunners committed too many men forward , and conceded a sloppy third
toni kroos celebrates after firing bayern ahead with a powerful volley from the edge of the box wojciech szczesny tries to scramble the ball away , but arsenal conceded a sloppy , and crucial , third olivier giroud gave wenger 's side hope with a third minute goal in munich to spark a second leg fight after laurent koscielny added a second five minutes from time the players tried to get the ball back to restart 2014 arsenal 0 bayern 2 ; bayern 1 arsenal 1 bayern win 3 - 1 on aggregate pep guardiola 's side effectively settled the tie at the emirates with thomas muller and toni kroos on target after wojciech szczesny was sent off in the first half for a foul on arjen robben in the box
once again arsenal battled back once they had little to play for and the pressure was off and lukasz podolski scored to give wenger 's men a deserved draw in the olympic stadium as they chased a shock victory
where did it all go wrong ? mesut ozil 's missed penalty was the turning point
before that point they had bossed the game against the european champions
it took the wind out of their sails , and bayern eventually produced their magic
wojchiech szczesny brings down arjen robben , as bayern once again sealed a first - leg lead the arsenal keeper 's red card left wenger 's side to compete with one a europe 's best sides a man down for a second year in a row toni kroos ( right ) was on target at the emirates , and the tie was all but over 2015 arsenal 1 monaco 3 ; monaco 0 arsenal 2 3 - 3 on aggregate ( monaco win on away goals ) arsenal keep finding new ways to cock it up
against the weakest opposition left , arsenal conceded a killer third goal in injury - time at the emirates
it meant they had to score three in monaco , they managed two and wasted a hatful of chances
hurtfully , the languid dimitar berbatov said monaco had ' wanted it more ' than arsenal in the first leg
dimitar berbatov celebrates scoring monaco 's second , but arsenal managed to get back into the tie alex oxlade-chamberlain 's strike made it 2 - 1 , before the young midfielder made a fatal error late on video monaco deserved to go out - wenger where did it all go wrong ? for all the shambles in the first 91 minutes of the first leg , arsenal were back in the tie when alex oxlade-chamberlain scored a stoppage - time goal to make it 2 - 1
for an unimaginable reason , however , they continued to attack all - out , and with nine men ahead of the ball , gave up a shocking third
however wonderful the effort in the second leg , the task was always likely to be too great
olivier giroud and mesut ozil look dejected as the tie slips away from arsenal in the first leg yet again
