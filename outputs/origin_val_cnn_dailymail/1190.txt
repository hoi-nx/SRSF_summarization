' it is a simple argument , ' deputy davis county attorney susan hunt said
' while the defendant was on pretrial release , this defendant continued to engage in sexual misconduct with a 17 - year - old boy her willingness to continue to commit felony sexual offenses while on bail causes great concern that this defendant will continue and be a danger to the community
