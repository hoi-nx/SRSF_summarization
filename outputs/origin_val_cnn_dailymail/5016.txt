the cancer drugs fund for england has cut 19 life - extending treatments it claims are too expensive after a review in january thousands of cancer sufferers will lose out on â last chance â drugs after the nhs withdrew approval for their use
the cancer drugs fund for england has cut 19 life - extending treatments it claims are too expensive after a review in january
they include jevtana , used in prostate cancer , along with zaltrap , avastin and erbitux for bowel cancer
new patients needing these drugs will no longer be able to get them on the nhs without a consultant âs special request
but experts say this is doomed to fail and they will effectively only be available privately often costing thousands of pounds
following appeals , four drugs will be reconsidered and remain available in the meantime
dr alison birtle , consultant clinical oncologist at lancashire teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust , said the decision to axe jevtana was a travesty
she said â as a doctor who treats men with advanced prostate cancer , i am deeply saddened and my patients will be devastated
â in my every day experience , jevtana has given some men with advanced prostate cancer extra time â some of the men that i started to treat with jevtana three to four years ago are still alive today
â most importantly this time has been of good quality , allowing them to carry on doing the things they enjoy despite their cancer
â the Â£ 280million - a - year cancer drugs fund ( cdf ) which began in april 2011 has led to around 55,000 patients in england getting drugs banned on the nhs by nice , the rationing body , or awaiting approval
the government 's aim , which was a tory election pledge , was to enable nhs doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit
mark flannagan , chief executive of the charity beating bowel cancer , said â we need to hold the government and the prime minister to account for what has happened
â he needs to justify why he no longer believes doctors should be able to prescribe the drugs they think will benefit their patients
â if this is not what he believes , then he needs to reverse these cuts until a new system is in place
â he said tens of thousands of patients had petitioned david cameron , urging him to keep his promise made before the last election and to postpone the cuts until a better , fairer system was in place
he said â cancer treatment should nât be about luck
there should be no difference in the access to treatment between a patient diagnosed a couple of weeks ago and one diagnosed tomorrow
â but there will be and we believe this is just the thin end of the wedge with further cost cutting to come
â from yesterday , any patients who faces an unfortunate diagnosis of advanced cancer will no longer be able to benefit from the treatments that have been removed from the cancer drugs fund
â the argument should nât be about politics and economics , but so far this has been an exercise in managing budgets and maximising profits
â it should have been an exercise in what is important to patients and how to improve outcomes for cancer patients
â new patients needing these drugs will need a consultant âs special request to access the drugs on the nhs dr rob glynne-jones , chief medical advisor of bowel cancer uk , said zaltrap was an effective anticancer drug , which can improve the chances of long - term survival
he said â this de-listing decision will significantly restrict patient choice â thus inevitably widening the gap in survival for english patients with colorectal cancer compared with the rest of the world
â hugh gunn , spokesperson for prostate cancer patients â charity tackle , said the removal of jevtana , also known as cabazitaxel was a terrible blow
he said â i am shocked that men in england can not get the same drugs as men in other european countries , especially when we have a cancer drugs fund to supposedly pay for them
â for many men â myself included â cabazitaxel was going to be the next treatment option
in fact , the last treatment option we had left
â at the moment i âm well , but in a few months â time i might not be ; for the first time in my entire cancer journey i âm frightened
â tarja stenvall , general manager for sanofi in the uk , said the company was continuing a â dialogue â with england to explore immediate ways of maintaining access to patients for jevtana
a spokesman for england said â nhs cancer doctors on the cancer drugs fund panel have taken a careful look at how we ensure he drugs available offer the best clinical benefit , getting the most for patients from every pound
