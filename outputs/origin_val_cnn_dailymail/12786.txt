" in order to attain the impossible , one must attempt the absurd , " wrote miguel de cervantes , the william shakespeare of spain
and the quest to find his remains has sometimes seemed both , even ( dare one say it ) quixotic in a time of recession
but forensic scientists have persevered , and appear to have triumphed
almost 400 years after miguel de cervantes ' death , a team led by etxeberria announced tuesday that they were confident they had found miguel de cervantes ' coffin in the crypt of the convent of the barefoot trinitarians in the barrio de las letras ( literary quarter ) in madrid
historical records indicated miguel de cervantes had been buried there , but the convent had been substantially rebuilt since
( etxeberria , incidentally , performed the autopsy on former chilean president gen. salvador allende , confirming he had committed suicide
) at a news conference in madrid on tuesday , etxeberria said that while there was no mathematical proof or dna test available to completely verify the findings , there were " many coincidences and no discrepancies " in the examination of " osario 32 , " a common grave in the crypt that contained the remains of 16 people
" we have miguel de cervantes , represented in some form in this group of bones that are unfortunately very degraded and very fragmented , " etxeberria told national television
the search for miguel de cervantes ' coffin -- using radar -- began last year , funded by the madrid city council
it first mapped more than 30 burial cavities in the walls and nearly 5 meters beneath the floor of the church
mass spectrometry dated fragments of wood and cloth found in these cavities to the 17th century , an encouraging but far from conclusive development
one crumbling coffin found in january had the initials " m c " hammered in nail heads , along with a jumble of skeletal remains
even then exteberria urged caution , but further research has narrowed the odds
the forensic team had been hoping that some of those remains would positively identify miguel de cervantes , who suffered gunshot wounds in the chest and left hand at the battle of lepanto in 1571
but they are not in sufficiently good shape , and some of the remains found may be of miguel de cervantes ' wife , catalina
nor will dna analysis be much help , for there are no known descendants of miguel de cervantes
catalina was not miguel de cervantes ' first partner
as a teenager he ran away from home with a barmaid , josefina de perez , before enlisting with the spanish navy
it was only in the 1580s that he started to write , publishing " la galatea " in 1585 and his most famous work , " don quixote , " in 1605 -- or to give its full title , " the adventures of the ingenious nobleman don quixote of la mancha
" but " don quixote " would hardly be noticed in miguel de cervantes ' lifetime , and he was almost penniless when he died , having joined the third order of st. francis in his declining years
he knew he was dying when he wrote in the prologue of a posthumously published novel , " perhaps the time may come when i mend again this broken thread and say what words fail me here and what needed to be said
farewell , waggish jokes ; farewell , wittiness ; farewell , merry friends , for i am dying and longing soon to see you , happy in the life to come
" miguel de cervantes was buried on april 23,1616 -- in the same week william shakespeare died
there are now plans to reinter miguel de cervantes at the convent and build a new entrance to the crypt in time for the 400th anniversary of miguel de cervantes ' death next year
tyler fisher , a lecturer in hispanic studies at royal holloway college in london , says that such exhumations " ignite public attention , inspire re-readings , and invest an all - but - forgotten corner of the city with a renewed , imaginative depth
" miguel de cervantes might enjoy all the attention
many literary critics say he was not aware of his own genius
john ormsby , a scholar and translator of miguel de cervantes ' work in the 19th century , wrote of " don quixote , " " never was a great work so neglected by its author
