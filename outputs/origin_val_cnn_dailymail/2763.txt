marnock 's father , stefan marnock , 41 , described his anguish as he tried in vain to get to the boy after the tree destroyed the home at the patch , in the dandenong ranges east of melbourne , just after 9pm
' he had two storeys worth of debris and a tree on top of him
' there was no hope , i just could n't get to him
it was a complete feeling of absolutely helplessness
' the extent of the damage meant mr marnock and rescue workers could n't access marnock 's bedroom until after midnight
' i stayed there until i got him out , ' he said
' i had the firies ( fire service officers ) with me , we ended up going through the wall in our bedroom cupboard
' and the tragedy could have been even worse
mr marnock said it was a nap in the car that saved the life of marnock 's five - year - old sister nicola â who was n't tired and was on the couch watching tv instead of sleeping in the bedroom she shared with her little brother
the tree destroyed the home at the patch , in the dandenong ranges east of melbourne , just after 9pm mr marnock said he was devastated by the loss of his ' cheeky ' little boy who was his ' little dude ' earlier that day the family visited mr marnock 's father 's grave as it was the fifth anniversary of his death
when the family was back at home that evening , nicola was on the couch watching tv and mr marnock and marnock 's mother surridge , 37 , had walked to the front of the house to investigate the storm
' we had actually stood up to go and look out the front door because we heard the gust of wind , ' ms surridge said
' we opened the front door but had to close it immediately because of the wind
' nicola had stayed sitting in the armchair then all of a sudden the tree from above us just came down on top
' ms surridge said she and mr marnock were in an archway which protected them from the debris , but nicola was trapped under a collapsed wall

father stefan marnock , 41 , sister nicola , five , and marnock emergency services minister jane garrett said it was the council 's responsibility to make sure trees located near houses were safe , amid reports neighbours had complained about the size of the tree ' we were able to get across over the debris to where nicola was pinned , fortunately the angle of how things had gone down it did n't crush her upper chest or head , ' she said
' i was able to sit and speak with her and keep her talking the whole time
' mr marnock said nicola was a ' little trooper ' throughout the terrifying ordeal
' she was just amazing , ' he said
' she got stressed out at times and she was a little bit concerned as to where marnock was - she knew she could n't see their bedroom door
' it took an hour for rescue workers to free nicola
she was taken to hospital where she was treated for injuries including bruising and a torn liver , but she did not suffer any broken bones or haemorrhaging
mr marnock 's 13 - year - old son jesse , who was in a hallway when the tree came down and was not injured , ran up the street to get help from neighbours before the emergency services arrived
ms surridge said marnock 's death was going to hit his brothers and sisters hard , and she was struggling to come to terms with the tragedy ms surridge 's parents john and sue surridge were at the rear of the property , where they lived in the back part of the dual dwelling
mr surridge was trapped in a room for two hours before rescue workers got him out ' he was absolutely amazing - he was able to go up into the back section of house where grandma sue was and was able to vocally communicate with john because we had no visual , ' mr marnock said
' he helped me so much , he was my legs
' he was my star , he was just brilliant
for a 13 - year - old kid to do that is just amazing
