allnutt died in hospital after a dirty drip was left in her arm for four days
her family are now taking action against the nhs trust involved , which , they claim , only gave staff 20 minutes training in a new system of patient monitoring medics who treated a young woman who died after a dirty drip was left in her arm for four days had just 20 minutes training in a monitoring system , it has been claimed
allnutt was recovering from having the flesh - eating bug necrotising fasciitis at luton last year when the contaminated catheter was used to administer antibiotics
her devastated parents , ann and richard , are now taking action against the nhs trust involved and are claiming staff may have had just 20 minutes training on a new system of monitoring patients
ms alnutt 's family have also reported five medics from the hospital to the , the general medical council watchdog , claiming a catalogue of errors led to their daughter 's death
allnutt , 28 , has been suffering from the flesh - eating infection but was making a full recovery after two months in hospital
but she died from septicaemia when a drip administering antibiotics was left in her arm for four days , triggering blood poisoning
it later emerged that the hospital was using a new electronic alert system called national early warning score
it showed that allnutt 's condition was deteriorating but staff appear not to have acted on the alert
her family lodged freedom of information request and found staff may have only had 20 minutes training on the system
they have instructed lawyers specialising in medical negligence cases to take action against the hospital
watts of firm ashton kcj said : ' on the face of it this seems to be a very short period of training , especially as the electronic warning system deals with life and death situations
' it 's of great concern to allnutt 's parents that the staff using the electronic system may not have been adequately trained to use it
' they are devastated by the loss of their daughter and it 's important for them to know that lessons have been learnt from their tragic loss
' an inquest last year heard how a junior doctor spotted fungal spores in the tube on a friday but it was n't removed until the following tuesday
observation notes showed allnutt 's condition worsened over the weekend but medics decided to just monitor her and no action was taken until the tuesday
by that time , life - threatening sepsis had set in and she suffered several heart attacks before dying in the early hours of the following morning
allnutt , from luton , bedforshire , who was obese and had learning difficulties , had initially refused to consent to the tube being withdrawn because of a phobia of needles
ms allnutt 's family have also reported five members of staff at the hospital to the general medical council her family have questioned why no action was taken to remove the drip , known as a picc line
ms watts added : ' the family have many questions about the circumstances of allnutt 's death and why no action was taken to remove the picc line
' it 's hoped that the general medical council complaint will ensure the actions of the doctors around the time of allnutt 's death are fully investigated and that the family are given the answers that they need
' claire 's parents are determined to fight for justice for allnutt and a civil claim is being pursued against the hospital
' a hospital spokesman said : ' the luton and dunstable university hospital has given an unreserved apology to allnutt 's family following her tragic death last january
' all staff groups involved in allnutt 's case have reflected and learned from the events that occurred prior to allnutt 's death , and this has resulted in a number of changes to practice , which are being constantly monitored and evaluated
' hospital bosses say they have apologised unreservedly to ms allnutt 's family and have made changes
