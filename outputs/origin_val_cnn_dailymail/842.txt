her tv programmes have shown the nation how to create a beautiful home from treasured items that have been handed down through the generations or upcycled and recycled to find a new use
and now kirstie has opened the door to her own notting hill , west london , house to show she really does practice what she preaches
from the living room sofa that has been inherited , to the kitchen tops that were once used in a science lab , the wardrobe now used as kitchen storage and the fireplace that once caused her to burst into tears , miss kirstie 's home is full of quirky collects
she and her partner ben bought their west london house , a 1950s property , in september 2006 , a few months after her first son bay , now nine , was born and set about turning it into a home
talking about her house , which was once two flats which have been knocked together to create an open and airy family home , miss allsopp , 43 , who also has a son oscar , seven , and is step - mother to ben 's two sons , said : ' i ca n't think of anything that has n't got some sort of story behind it
' someone asked me if i designed all this , but it 's not like that
it comes together over time
you get things all the time and you are adding and taking things away
' here miss kirstie who will be hosting fair , sponsored by hobbycraft , later this year in september , shows how she has brought them all together to create a unique living space for her family
kirstie 's husband ben bought the kitchen worktops from a school science lab , above kirstie 's sofa , above , is on its way out as according to the tv star it ' has got a huge tear in it ' living room sofa ' that sofa has now got a huge tear in it
they are so old these sofas
ben got them years ago , before he met me even
they were n't always here
he does n't like buying new sofas so we just sort of move things around
but i am actually going to have to basically get either a new sofa or swap this for another type of sofa soon
' ' once you know you 're not going to just buy something new , once you 've made that decision â and i hate calling it an ethical decision because that makes it sound like you are really up your own bottom , but we have made an active decision not to go out and buy new things
that decision has been made
' the ' blue peter ' fire place ' i was pregnant with my first child and ben took me to the goldborne road and there was this fireplace that he loved
i burst into tears because i just did n't know what else to do
it was a disgraceful performance on my behalf
' i wept " please no , let 's not buy that fireplace " '
i was so ashamed at my lack of backbone
" i really do n't think we should buy this fireplace " , i kept saying
i was so ashamed of myself
' i bought the fireplace for a lot of money
i said to ben " i 've bought the fireplace , when you have a building which needs a new fireplace and everything else , you can put it in and you are bound to need it at some point
i 'm sorry i cried , it 's a beautiful fireplace
i just do n't want it in my home
" ' kirstie admits she ' wept ' when she first bought the fireplace above , as she ' did n't want it in her home ' ' then we were moving in here but it was n't ready by the time bay was born so i went down and stayed in devon for a bit and ben came up during the week to supervise the works
when i came back from devon , there was the fireplace â¦ ' ' my mum used to call it the blue peter fireplace
the one thing i dread is that he finds whatever is missing from the middle bit
it 's some god - awful piece of brass and i hope he does n't ever stumble across it
' no , but i 'm very fond of it now
it 's very baronial , i think that 's the word
for a while there was a glass sword hung up there on a nail
i 've taken it down now
and look , there 's an invitation to an event in 2014 up here
that 's how often i sort it out
' kitchen when they bought the flat downstairs , they had a reshuffle of rooms and turned a bedroom into the kitchen and made it open plan with what is now the dining room
they kept most of the kitchen furniture such as the worktops and the aga
' these worktops are from a school science lab. ben got hold of them
look , if you look closely you can still see the marks where the old bunsen burners would have been attached , ' sats kirstie
the larder and things inside there are all sorts of useful bits and bobs in the larder
kirstie says : ' it 's not looking so tidy at the moment because we 've just shoved things in here
my sister always says she wants to be here in a nuclear winter
you could live off this for a long time
' inside , there is a wicker basket with separate compartments for bottles which she bought recently in holmfirth
kirstie explains : ' this is apple juice from devon , from home
we 've got an orchard
there 's a place just up the hill that has a big apple press
you pick the apples , take them up there , they press it and sent it back to you and you keep the bottles for the next time
' i 'm a big picnic person
i bought these ( huge silver flasks from stews etc ) back from kenya
there , 46 per cent of people do n't have running water
so the supermarkets have loads of picnic stuff
' they have loads of family gatherings with lots of picnic stuff
you can put a stew in there
some people on twitter said ' nobody has winter picnics â¦ but they are absolutely brilliant
kirstie 's larder is so full , above , that her sister jokes she wants to be there in a nuclear winter kirstie , who is dyslexic , points out a sign she wrote with a spelling error : ' please keep the larder this way , thak you ' ' [ in here is ] ben 's deep fat fryer
he 's not allowed to switch it on in the house
he has to go and plug it in outside by the bbq
it stinks - the smell of deep fat frying - you can never get it out
' actually , it needs a bit of a tidy up in here
it 's not as tidy as it usually is
' she points to a small picnic basket with jubilee design : ' this is my pride and joy
do you remember the royal concert for the jubilee ? well we had a couple of tickets and everyone there got their own picnic basket
' ' the brilliant thing about this room is that is keeps everything in it
' there 's hot chocolate from switzerland
when we go we always drive and we pick it up from the co-op there
' i made this sign when the larder was nice and tidy and then i managed to write ' thak you ' on the sign
look at that , ' thak you ' [ kirstie has dyslexia ]
the wardrobe in the kitchen ' we bought that together actually and it works incredibly well
again , i think kitchen storage is incredibly important
we had to take careful measurements to make sure it would fit under that beam , ' says kirstie
wooden thing on top of the fridge next to wardrobe kirstie says : ' i bought that in bath when i was on my own
if i buy things on my own , it always gets shifted all over the house and ben never accepts that he likes it
' kirstie loves her kitchen wardrobe , above , and says that she thinks kitchen storage is very important the new fridge ' this is my new fridge
i 've had three second hand fridges
if someone buys one of ben 's buildings we just have them from there so we never throw them out
the light in the fridge kept tripping the other day and our housekeeper said " oh , be careful , the fridge was giving everybody electric shocks , " ' so i said : " no , that 's enough ! i want a new fridge ! " this is new , new , new , sparkly new
look at the ice tray , everything is there
ohh , there 's lamb in the freezer there from devon
we have our own sheep down there
it 's a great layout , i 'd recommend it to anyone
' we are really lucky
i earn a fortune , ben earns a fortune
we are not buying things second hand because we ca n't afford to
and we are not pretending to
we could n't have second hand fridges because we could n't afford them , it 's just that ben did n't want to waste a perfectly good one just because you did n't pick it
in a way , because you take time to make decision over things , it takes time to sort things out
