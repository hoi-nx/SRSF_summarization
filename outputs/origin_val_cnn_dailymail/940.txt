he has already been ruled out of the opening race in melbourne on sunday week
the concussion he suffered in barcelona means he can not be exposed to a second knock to the head , which doctors fear could kill him , regardless of the wider questions about his health
a mclaren spokesman said : â as regards fernando alonso âs medical situation , mclaren will not and indeed should not take the lead , since his medical care is being handled by the people best equipped for that task , namely his doctors

confusion has , therefore , surrounded the situation , not least after mclaren chairman ron dennis said that fernando alonso had not been concussed , a misunderstanding that was corrected by the team âs official statements
david coulthard , a former mclaren driver , said : â my experience of getting knocked out or having big shunts is that you remember the bit before , the bit after but not the bit in the middle

the mclaren mp4 - 30 of fernando alonso is recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck following the crash â the brain is a fairly complex bit of kit , so if they are not able to see any brain injury of any sort it seems a bit medically confusing for me , so there is probably more from the story to come out over time
it is unusual for drivers to miss a grand prix over such a thing
â whatever the cause , fernando alonso âs predicament is a blow for mclaren , whose form in testing suggested they are struggling very badly indeed for reliability and speed

a helicopter was used to transport fernando alonso from the circuit de barcelona-catalunya to hospital on february 22 hartstein , formula one âs former chief doctor , has speculated that the most probable reason fernando alonso might have passed out would be arrhythmia â an irregular heartbeat
if so , he would require a pacemaker
another possibility , said hartstein , would be carotid sinus hypersensitivity , whereby pressure on the main artery to the brain causes the heart rate to drop , blood pressure to fall and the sufferer to blackout
hartstein told the bbc that this was â surprisingly common â , and not totally unexpected at a fast corner in a formula one car , such as turn three at barcelona , where fernando alonso was travelling at 134mph
fernando alonso was flown away by helicopter following the crash at the barcelona but , then again , he was braking and changing down gears as the accident unfolded , so how is this consistent with his having passed out ? the questions nag
fernando alonso will need the fia âs medical team to give him clearance to race in malaysia , as well as the go - ahead from his own doctors
he has been outwardly relaxed about missing the melbourne race , saying from his father âs house in oviedo , where he is recovering : â a second impact in less than 21 days ( the stipulated period of rest ) â no. â fernando alonso may have been less sanguine if mclaren were quicker , but both team and man will be mightily relieved when , he is back , even if it is towards the back of the grid for now
