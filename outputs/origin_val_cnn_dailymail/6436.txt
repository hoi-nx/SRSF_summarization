the probe into an alleged paedophile network at the heart of the british establishment took an explosive turn last night with the revelation that powell âs name has been passed to police
the mail on sunday can reveal that the late tory mp , one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of the 20th century , has been named to scotland yard by the bishop of durham
the claims relate to â ritual satanic abuse â
and in a further development to the sex - ring investigations , police are to be given access to secret files held on mps in the house of commons archives as they hunt for evidence on suspected abusers , including former liberal mp cyril smith
the claim is being examined by operation fenbridge , one of a number of police probes into â establishment paedophile rings â â including an investigation by the independent police complaints commission into claims that officers dropped their inquiries under pressure from powerful individuals
a church of england spokesman said : â the name of powell was passed to operation fenbridge by one of our safeguarding team on the instruction of bishop bishop of monmouth
' mr dominic walker is believed to have warned the right rev butler that at the time he was told of the claims against powell , unsubstantiated allegations of satanic rituals â often involving the abuse of children â were widespread
in 1994 , an investigation by the london school of economics into 84 alleged cases of â satanic abuse â in the uk between 1987 and 1992 , including notorious cases in rochdale and the orkneys that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids , found no convincing corroborative evidence
report : bishop of monmouth , the bishop of durham , passed the name to scotland yard after hearing it from the former bishop of monmouth however , the ongoing scandal over how serial paedophile jimmy savile was able to evade detection for decades has led institutions to take a safety - first approach , so the church of england felt it had no option but to pass on the information to police
powell âs frontline political career ended abruptly in 1968 after he made his infamous â rivers of blood â speech warning about the dangers of uncontrolled immigration
tory leader edward heath sacked him from the shadow cabinet the following day , although powell remained an mp until 1974
shortly after he died in 1998 , aged 85 , it was revealed he had admitted to a friend , canon eric james , that love poetry he had written as a youth had been intended for a man â but that he did not want the fact revealed while he was alive
although powell became a hero of the right , his intellectual and oratorical skills earned him admirers on both sides of the political divide
a devout member of the church of england , he had two daughters with his wife pamela
sources close to one of scotland yard âs sex - ring investigations say officers contacted ward , the commons serjeant at arms â the commons â most senior security official â earlier this month to ask him to search the files kept on all mps
it is understood that no information was uncovered implicating mps in abuse , sparking fears at scotland yard that some of the evidence might have been shredded
now mr ward is believed to have told officers that , if they produce a warrant , they can enter the commons to investigate the files themselves on a â case by case basis â
last night , simon heffer , powell âs official biographer and former confidante , branded the allegations â absolute nonsense â and without foundation .
