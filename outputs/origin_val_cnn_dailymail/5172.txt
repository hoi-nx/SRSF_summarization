a black member of the university of oklahoma fraternity plunged into scandal after film emerged of them has hit out at his so - called ' brothers '
james , who is one of just two black men ever to join the university 's sae chapter , pledged in 2001 - but has now turned his back on the organization
the footage showed sae members , riding a bus while wearing bow ties and dress shirts , chanting ' there will never be a n * * * * * sae ' to the tune of if you 're happy and you know it
outraged leaders of sae 's national organization shut down the fraternity sunday night , and today the university of oklahoma ordered the members to leave campus
in the wake of the sickening footage , james published an uncompromising letter on his blog , in which he described how hearing the chant ' hit me in the core of my soul '
james said that while he was at sae he never felt as if racism was endemic , but says that in light of the current members ' behavior , he wishes he had never joined
james published the letter on his blog , under the title there will never be another black sae , and also spoke to local news station kfor about his renunciation of sae
he said : ' my former fraternity broke my heart today ... to say it was racist is not enough
it hit me in the very core of my soul when i saw the video
' i know those bus rides well
i was a member of this chapter 14 years ago
the second black man to be initiated in those halls
we had our own songs â¦
different songs â¦ but songs we sang on every bus trip to every date party for four years
' ... so now 14 years later , my " brothers " now sing this song
this is what gets their spirits united for a great night out with their friends and their dates ( one of which , thank god exposed this â¦ this )
' this is what binds them
but i remember what binded us
' parents came out in to help their college children move out of the fraternity house on monday coming down : university workers on monday tore down the greek letters for sae on the fraternity house - after officials cut all ties to the fraternity the true gentleman is the sae creed , which extols virtues such as self - control and humility , which members are supposed to strive to live up to
he continues : ' i thought we were different
maybe i was just being hopeful
i believed in the true gentlemen
' i believed my brothers were my brothers
i believed my son should be their brother if he so chose one day
but then i saw that video
i saw that video speaking of lynching me instead of ever letting me sign
' fury : hundreds of students rallied on the campus in norman , oklahoma , on monday morning to protest the horrific chant by the fraternity members james concludes : ' i can have no association with this organization as a black man
i know these were â kids being kids â and maybe they are nât the hateful ignorant lost little boys i think they are , but i will not stand behind anything that allowed this to happen
' they are not just kids being kids
sons of men who failed them , and they failed my son
you failed me ! member 261 - 057
' your boys sang in unison
they may not know where the song came from or who made it up or even what all the words really mean , but they sing it so often they know all the words whether they want to or not
' it came as sae members fled the university of oklahoma campus , on the orders of the university 's president
david boren today threatened legal action against those responsible , and said he wanted them to go straight away
he said : ' we will look at all possible punishment and what is available to us under the law
under the civil rights law it may be possible for us to take action against certain individuals , ' he said
' would i be happy if they left voluntarily ? yes
we do n't have room for racists and bigots here
' he added : ' i do n't want them here
i 'll pay the bus fare to get them out
they 're not coming back
