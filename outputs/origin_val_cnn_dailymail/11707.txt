the jewish studio executive , who co-founded film company miramax before setting up the weinstein company , said he had been taught about the issue by his father who had served as a sergeant during wwii he made the admission after he gave a passionate speech at the simon wiesenthal center 's national tribute dinner , where he urged listeners to stand up to anti-semites and ' kick these guys in the ass '

in his acceptance speech he urged the jewish community to get ' as organised as the mafia ' to tackle anti-semitism - although said afterwards he had never personally experienced it when asked by the new york post whether he had experienced anti-semitism he said : ' personally , no ' , adding : ' i âm very lucky that way
' my dad did , both in the army and afterwards , so i can only identify and i feel strongly through him
i âve had a charmed life that way , but i âm still outraged by what âs going on
' and we need to know and let the people who are doing those things know they ca nât get away with it

his film company produced director quentin tarantino 's wartime movie inglourious basterds , set during the wwii and the reader jewish : weinstein said his father , who served during the wwii , taught their family about the problems faced by jewish communities around the world his father max weinstein had helped the haganah , a jewish paramilitary organisation based in the middle east which later became the israeli defence force , during the war
weinstein , 63 , has produced films including the king 's speech , pulp fiction and inglourious basterds set during the wwii , and last week accepted the humanitarian award at the simon wiesenthal center
studies by the institute have shown that the number of attacks on jewish communities around the world is at its highest since 1945
the new yorker used his acceptance speech to tell the audience : ' i think it 's time that we , as jewish , get together with the muslims who are honorable and peaceful â but we [ also ] have to go and protect ourselves ' , the hollywood reporter wrote
' unfortunately , we [ jewish ] are gon na have to get as organised as the mafia
we just ca n't take it any more
we just ca n't take these things
there 's got ta be a way to fight back
' ' while we must be understanding of our arab brothers and our islamic brothers , ' he added , ' we also have to understand that these crazy b * * * * * * s [ arab and islamic extremists ] are also killing their own â they 're killing neighbours , they 're killing people from all sorts of different races
' and , unlike wwii , when we did n't act right away and we paid the price , we better start acting now
trust me , i 'm the last guy who wants to do anything about it , but i realize if we do n't , we will perish
