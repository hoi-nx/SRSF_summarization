fancy footwork : kristina on strictly come dancing my husband is holding me in his arms , gazing fondly into my eyes and leading me across the floor in a series of sinuous moves that , quite frankly , i never imagined he could make
such a moment never seemed possible because , like many women , i have been made a wallflower by a ca nât - dance , wo nât - dance partner
we never even had an opening waltz at our wedding 30 - odd years ago
david , my husband , does nât so much as bop at parties
however , with the help of strictly come dancing âs kristina , we are getting the chance to take to the floor together â and in the process improve our fitness and our general mood , and even make our marriage healthier
dressing up and taking your partner âs hand to dance Ã deux is catching on all over again , thanks to the huge success of the tv dance show
â learning dance steps allows couples to enjoy the closeness of each other and creates a sense of trust as well as intimacy , â says kristina , who has partnered celebrities from newscaster john sergeant to pop singer simon on the tv show
â some therapists suggest it as a form of marriage counselling
it allows men to lead and feel in charge again , and women to feel they are being taken care of by their partner
â plus it releases endorphins as your heart rate goes up
â and so i found myself relearning the essential 12 steps of salsa for the first time since i did the cha - cha - cha at victor sylvester âs saturday morning ballroom classes for children , decades ago
dancing was in my blood : my father danced his teens and 20s away and became an eight - times ballroom dancing champion
kristina is giving david and me a taste of the weekend workshops she âs running at champneys health spa over the next few months
but i find myself wondering how her students are going to cope with a class lasting three - quarters of an hour when we are knocked out after ten minutes of practice
â i feel like a robot , â grumbles david , who has zero ballroom experience but bucks up when kristina puts santana on the sound system
he is musical â playing guitar â but his sense of rhythm does not extend to his feet , which kristina says is surprisingly common
as for me , although i spent two years of my teens jiving in soho discos , learning specific steps 40 years on is a discipline i âm finding taxing
it âs a more demanding workout , in fact , than anything i did on a brain - improvement programme i recently attended
â you need to focus absolutely , â explains kristina , who says the extreme attention needed to learn a sequence is good for improving mood as well as fitness
â when i started partnering simon he was extremely down , but felt the dancing had a very positive effect
â like yoga , ballroom dancing takes you out of yourself ; you ca nât think of anything else while you âre practising , so it takes you away from your everyday worries
â masterclass : anthea dances with kristina as david looks on
the strictly come dancing star says learning dance steps together creates a sense of trust as well as intimacy between couples a recent study in poland suggested that dancing can elicit an improvement in mood
another soon - to - be - published study shows that learning to dance improves leg muscle architecture in older women , while dementia patients were found to feel much better after taking a latin ballroom class for a 2013 study
the aerobic effect is obviously a plus for weight loss ; kristina says john sergeant lost more than two stone while training with her for an unimaginable eight hours a day
i say â unimaginable â because after 15 minutes , my reluctant partner and i are so winded that we wonder whether we can even survive till the end of our session
i blame my shortness of breath on the need to accomplish a full underarm twirl in just three steps , every minute or so
even so , given that our other steps involve only a gentle rocking back and forth and bringing feet together , my heart rate is raised in half the time it takes when i walk at nearly 4mph on the treadmill
david becomes furious as he keeps forgetting to switch to the side - step that kicks off the next part of the salsa sequence
kristina reassures us that we are no worse than any beginners , and half an hour later we âre congratulating ourselves on remembering all 18 steps of our sequence and even keeping time with the music
i could see myself going on to tackle the foxtrot , the quickstep and tango
but first , i need a partner â the one i âve got says he prefers his salsa with avocado on a nice tortilla
at least champneys will guarantee everyone who books kristina âs course someone to dance with
strictly ballroom weekends cost from Â£ 395 and take place on march 28 - 29 and may 22 - 24
