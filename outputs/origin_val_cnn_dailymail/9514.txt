unless your name is rebecca adlington , victoria pendleton or mo farah , sport is probably nothing more than an enjoyable hobby
now a new study has revealed that your choice of sport says more about you than you could possibly have imagined
according researchers , cyclists are more likely to be emotionally stable , runners the most extrovert and swimmers the happiest , while walkers are the least materialistic
cyclists , for instance , are most likely to vote liberal democrat and tend to be laid back and calm , if keen on acquiring material possessions
meanwhile runners tend to be labour - voting extroverts who love being the centre of attention and have a penchant for upbeat dance music
those who swim tend to make the best lovers , are tidy and are also the most charitable , although according to mindlab , 61 per cent of adults are fond of charity regardless of their choice of sport
walkers , a category that includes those who enjoy rambling , orienteering and trekking , are least concerned about material possessions and like their own company
' it has long been known that exercise is not only good for your body , but also your mind , ' comments neuropsychologist , dr david lewis
extrovert : runners such as mo farah tend to be extroverts with a taste for upbeat music the research claims cyclists love shopping and vote liberal democrat ' past research has shown that exercising can act as a mood - enhancer , can be used to treat and possibly even prevent anxiety and generally has a positive effect on mental health
' the results from this study show that no matter what kind of person you are , there is the right kind of exercise for everyone
' the study , which was commissioned by the bhf to mark the launch of its 2015 series of events , also found that favourite sports vary by area
thus in birmingham and london , cycling is the sport of choice for most while running wins the race in leeds and newcastle
swimming was most popular in cardiff , dublin and manchester , while walking was most loved in bristol , glasgow , norwich and nottingham
peaceful : those who love walking tend to enjoy their own company and are least materialistic supporters : pippa middleton ( left ) and heptathlete hazel ( right ) are high profile bhf supporters the bhf is famous for its sporty fundraisers and will once again stage the london to brighton bike race this june
pippa middleton , one of the charity 's best - known supporters , is set to take part , as will olympic heptathlete hazel
' whatever your sports personality or level of fitness , i would encourage everyone to sign up to a bhf event , ' said hazel
' heart disease devastates too many lives , killing around 80,000 people every year
i lost my father to heart disease , he was just 50 years old
this is why i âm taking on a cycling challenge for bhf
' taking on a challenge can help you to get fit , enjoy the sport you love and also help to raise funds for vital research which could help save more people like my dad
