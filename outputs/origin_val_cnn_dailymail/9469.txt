england coach moores should be removed from his current position and put in charge of the ' kids ' , according to former captain vaughan
moores , handed a second stint as head coach last april , has come under intense fire since england 's defeat by bangladesh on monday condemned them to an early return from the world cup
vaughan believes moores ' talents have been wasted : ' moores was at his best working with the lions ( development team ) many years ago , ' vaughan said in the daily telegraph
moores ( centre ) oversaw a disastrous world cup campaign with england in australia and new zealand moores would be better off working with young cricketers , according to vaughan ' the job of england coach has become about man management , helping with tactics and picking the right team
at international level you do not have time to coach
' what is the best thing for english cricket going forward ? i believe it is time to remover moores from his current position and put him in a job where he can have the biggest impact on english cricket
' ' i always say the best coach works with kids and development programmes between the age of 15 and 20
' vaughan said england 's conservative approach to the one - day game had resulted in them being left behind by the likes of australia , new zealand , sri lanka and india , while even ireland , vaughan said , were playing better one - day cricket
vaughan played for england and oversaw some amazing success while he was captaining the side moores should be removed from his current position and put him in a job where he can have the biggest impact on english cricket , according to vaughan ' england started the tournament by picking a test match batting line - up for one - day cricket , ' vaughan said
' ( managing director ) paul downton said last night england needed more players appearing in twenty20 leagues around the world to gain experience
' well , alex hales has been doing that but england did not pick him
ravi bopara , michael carberry , luke wright , ben stokes and jason roy , they all played big bash cricket but were ignored
england should have looked at these guys last year
england vice-captain jos buttler looks disappointed after england were eliminated from the world cup a defeat by bangladesh left england unable to progress from their pool in the world cup ' you do not need five gears any more , you need eight
' england do not get the fact that you need four jos buttlers , not one
you need four or five who have the ability to strike it at a rate of 120 per 100 balls
' vaughan said the world cup had been a wasted opportunity for england to change tack
' i felt they had a free hand here , with no expectation of success , ' he said
' they had the chance to play expansive cricket and press ' g ' for gamble
instead they played the safest , and most timid way
