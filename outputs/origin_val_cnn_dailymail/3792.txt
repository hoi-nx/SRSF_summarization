teenagers are tired of sharing every detail of their lives online and are taking increasing steps to safeguard their privacy on social media , a report has revealed
young people are un-tagging pictures , writing false posts and even adopting parallel identities in a bid to keep their personal information safe , according to the mrs
they have even resorted to posting deliberately vague statements on their accounts - known as ' vague - booking ' - to prompt real friends to respond privately for further details
the report , by strong of the mrs delphi society , says the rise of apps like snapchat - which erases pictures after a short amount of time - show teenagers are increasingly concerned about what strangers see
his report says : ' there is an almost universally held view that teenagers simply do nât care enough about online privacy
' at face value , this appears to be true , as many young people flood public social media accounts like twitter and instagram with endless streams of selfies and personal information
mr strong cites the example of paris brown , who was forced to resign from her position as the country 's first youth police crime commissioner in 2013 after a series of ill - advised tweets she had posted years before emerged
facebook founder mark zuckerberg claimed people had become more comfortable with sharing private information online frost , chief executive of the mrs , told the sunday times that she estimates a third of twitter users have a private account , only shared with close friends , as well as a public persona
she had many used several fake identities for things like video gaming , while closely guarding accounts made using their real names
ms frost said the findings will pose problems for businesses , who will not be to take consumers for granted
mr strong adds that just because young people post things in public forums , it does not mean have no desire for privacy
' just because it 's in a public space does n't mean they want publicity , ' he said
his views are in stark contrast to those of mr mark zuckerberg , the chief executive of the world 's biggest social network
speaking at the crunchie awards in 2010 , he claimed people had grown more comfortable sharing their private information online
he said : ' people have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds , but more openly and with more people
' that social norm is just something that has evolved over time
' he explained the rise of social media reflected the changing attitudes of people
' when i got started in my dorm room at harvard , the question a lot of people asked was , ' why would i want to put any information on the internet at all ? why would i want to have a website ? ' ' then in the last 5 or 6 years , blogging has taken off in a huge way , and just all these different services that have people sharing all this information
