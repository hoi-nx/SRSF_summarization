a bride has revealed that she was secretly hiding seven pounds of sagging skin under her wedding dress - after shedding 10 stone ahead of her big day
winmill ballooned to a size 28 and 20 stone after meeting her partner , mark , eating takeaways and large meals
refusing to walk down the aisle until she 'd shed half her body weight , the 43 - year - old from the midlands , joined a slimming class with her similarly obese fiancÃ©
winmill was left with layers of sagging skin after she lost half her body weight ahead of her wedding day but after reaching a size 8 on top , mrs winmill was left with an apron of drooping flesh on her tummy , which hung down over her underwear
she was forced to buy a wedding gown in a size 12 to hide it , but despite what 's hidden under her clothes , mrs winmill says she could n't be happier
' i bought some slimming pants to wear under my wedding dress and hold in the skin i 'd been left with , but they made me look worse , ' she said
' the skin squeezed out the top so i never wore them
luckily , my dress covered my arms so i was n't conscious about the loose rolls around my armpits on the day
despite achieving her desired weight goal on her top half , the bride had to go up a size for her wedding dress to accommodate for the rolls of drooping flesh ta da ! the happy couple on their wedding day after they both shed their desired weights ' and i can honestly say that looking at those wedding photos is the first time i have ever felt really happy with how i 've looked
we 've got wedding pictures up all over our house
' the couple first started gaining weight after meeting each other on facebook in 2009
at that time mrs winmill was 18st but she soon gained weight
' we were so in love we hardly noticed we 'd piled on the pounds , ' mrs winmill said
' six months later , we moved in together , which only encouraged our bad eating habits
we 'd order takeaways and cook big meals
' soon the couple had a combined weight of 45 stone , with mr winmill , 39 , tipping the scales at 25 stone
it seriously affected their health
mr winmill was diagnosed with sleep apnoea , a condition associated with being overweight , which causes interrupted breathing during sleep
mrs winmill , a former retail assistant said : ' it was a really scary time
seeing mark struggling made me realise how out of control things were getting
winmill was 18 stone when she met mark on facebook , but quickly started gaining weight , eventually tipping the scales at 28 stone winmill was diagnosed with sleep apnoea , a condition associated with being overweight , which causes interrupted breathing during sleep - they both knew they had to change their lifestyles ' we knew we needed to lose weight but it was hard to have the motivation
mark could have been triple that size and i 'd still have loved him , so i did n't do anything about it
' on christmas day 2010 , mr winmill , an engineer , proposed
' i said yes , then i told him there was no way i was getting married until i could do it as a slim bride , ' mrs winmill explained
she set herself the goal of losing 10 stone and the pair both signed up to weight watchers
she said : ' from there we helped each other stay on track
the pair went on to shed life - changing amounts of weight through portion control , and revealed their slimmer physiques at their wedding ' we stopped having seconds and spent more time preparing meals rather than gorging on takeaways
' the couple learned about portion control and calories , and soon the pounds were melting away
fast forward 18 months and mrs winmill had reached her target of 10st 10lbs while mr winmill weighed 14st 7lbs
she said : ' as soon as i reached my goal weight mark said , ' right , we 're getting married now , you have no excuse , ' and i knew he was right
' i started planning straight away
i went shopping with my daughter , kristie , 18
the happy couple lost a combined 23 stone and exchanged vows on 1 november 2013 in front of 20 guests ' i picked out a size - 12 wedding dress and it slipped right over me
it felt incredible and i fell in love with it
' they exchanged vows at walsall register office on 1 november 2013 , in front of 20 guests
mr winmill fitted into 34in waist trousers on the big day
his wife said : ' i slipped on my dress and was pleasantly surprised
' sometimes it brings me down now and i 'd like the perfect figure
' i wonder how much more weight i could lose without the skin
it would be nice to go the whole way
' we 're both keeping the pounds off ' - mrs winmill has insisted the pair will stick to their new weight of 9st 11lbs and mr winmill 's of 13st 3lbs ' i could n't afford the thousands of pounds of surgery
i need to win the lottery to lose the skin
' i think there 's about half a stone around my stomach , tops of legs and arms
' but i would n't change anything
i was always big and i was bulging out of size - 32 leggings at one point
i never imagined i 'd be a size 8/10
' people ask me " where 's the loose skin ? " but my clothes hide it
' following their big day the couple continued to shed weight
now mrs winmill weighs 9st 11lbs and mr winmill , 13st 3lbs , after losing a whopping 12 stone
the combined 23 - stone weight loss has left the couple over the moon
mrs winmill said : ' it 's like we 're different people to when we met
not only are we healthier but we are half the people we were â literally
' i am so proud of mark and me for managing to lose all that weight
' i 'm never going back there
we 're both keeping the pounds off
