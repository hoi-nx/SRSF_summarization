it may be handy for killing vampires , but garlic can keep humans alive in more ways than one , researchers have found
they say a nutrient in garlic offers the brain protection against ageing and disease
it could even prevent age - related neurological diseases such as alzheimer 's and parkinson 's
the university of missouri researchers found a carbohydrate in the superfood is key
' garlic is one of the most widely consumed dietary supplements , ' said gu , associate professor of pathology and anatomical sciences at the mu school of medicine and lead author of the study
' most people think of it as a ' superfood , ' because garlic 's sulfur - containing compounds are known as an excellent source of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protection
a thousand year - old potion made out of onions , garlic , wine and bile from a cow 's stomach can kill hospital superbugs , scientists claim
the potent 10th century brew - used by anglo saxons to treat a stye ( an abscess on the eyelid ) destroyed 90 per cent of the bacteria on scraps of skin taken from mice with mrsa
interestingly , the ingredients had little effect unless they were all brought together into the concoction , the study by nottingham university researchers found
' scientists are still discovering different ways garlic benefits the human body , ' he said
' our research focused on a carbohydrate derivative of garlic known as fruarg and the role this nutrient plays in protective responses
' gu 's team looked at the nutrient 's ability to inhibit â and even possibly reverse â brain cell damage caused by environmental stress
environmental stress could include the aging process , smoking , pollution , traumatic brain injury or excessive alcohol consumption
' microglia are immune cells in the brain and spinal cord that are the first and main line of defense in the central nervous system , ' gu said
' unlike other mature brain cells that seldom regenerate themselves , microglial cells respond to inflammation and environmental stresses by multiplying
' by massing themselves and migrating toward an injury site , they are able to respond to inflammation and protect other brain cells from destruction
' however , increasing the number of microglial cells wo n't provide age - defying protection for the brain , gu said
in fact , it can do more harm than good
' although important to brain cell health , microglial cells also produce nitric oxide in reaction to their function as protectors , ' gu said
' if we simply increased the number of microglial cells , we also would increase the amount of nitric oxide in the brain
' excessive production of nitric oxide leads to brain cell damage and promotes neurodegenerative diseases such as cerebral ischemia , parkinson 's disease and alzheimer 's disease
however , the nutrient fruarg may provide an answer to this reactive dilemma
gu 's team looked at the nutrient 's ability to inhibit â and even possibly reverse â brain cell damage caused by environmental stress
by creating a cell model of neurological stress and monitoring microglial cell function , gu 's team was able to study fruarg 's contribution to brain health
' when stress was applied to the model , there was an expected increase in microglial cells and their byproduct , nitric oxide , ' gu said
' however , once we applied fruarg , the microglial cells adapted to the stress by reducing the amount of nitric oxide they produced
' additionally , fruarg promoted the production of antioxidants , which offered protective and healing benefits to other brain cells
' this helps us understand how garlic benefits the brain by making it more resilient to the stress and inflammation associated with neurological diseases and aging
' in the future , gu and his colleagues hope to study the effects of fruarg on other cells in the body associated with conditions such as heart disease , diabetes and cancer .
