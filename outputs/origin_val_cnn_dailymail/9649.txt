couple : chemistry student mr jason booth said he and 18 - year - old grace ( pictured above ) were â inseparable â â the metal end of the umbrella got stuck in a crevice in the wall
it made me jolt to the left hand side - i remember seeing grace dyson âs foot slip over the edge

det sgt lowden said : â he had no time
she fell in the road and hit her with his van
it all happened so quick and she went under the wheel â

the chances of this occurring are unbelievable
â mr beaumont was questioned by police but no charges were ever brought
eyewitness lesley hardy , who was driving on the other side of the narrow road at the time , said he stopped as soon as he saw the crash
in a statement read in court , the driver said he had spotted a male dressed in gothic clothes and a â black coat â in the road
he added : â i realised this was not a black coat , but a woman
my wife and i got out of the car and went over to where she was
the male was very disorientated and seriously distressed
struck : at the split second grace dyson ( above ) stumbled , her uncle told police he said he had just spotted his niece and was about to try to catch her eye to wave praised : grace dyson was a â homebird â with a â natural flair for languages â and was talented at art , her mother said â there was no movement or sound from the lady in the road
her body was sort of twisted
i spoke to the passenger who said it was his niece - i could nât believe what i had just heard
â it did nât look like she was going to survive
a while later i heard she had died
â recording a road traffic accident verdict , assistant coroner mary burke said : â no one could have anticipated that this was going to happen
no one could have changed the pattern of events
