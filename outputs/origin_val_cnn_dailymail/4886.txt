dany dubois , a counsellor and psychotherapist who deals with child related issues , said children under 10 have no moral compass
he said a child of two has no concept of right and wrong - and should not be reported to police for ' theft '
she said : ' the general opinion of psychologists is that a child below the age of 10 - 12 does not have a full moral understanding of right and wrong
' a two year - old will pick up lots of things that attracts them but they would have no concept that is stealing and there are more appropriate ways of dealing with that rather than going to the police
' but if say a child of five is doing something that may look like rape then they may be copying behaviour they have seen and could be being abused and in that case going to the authorities is the best thing to do but maybe not the police but instead a social worker
' a girl aged just two has been reported to police for shoplifting and a boy of five accused of rape , cambridgeshire police have revealed in figures a spokesman for cambridgeshire police said : ' in most cases , we do not believe custody is a place for children because there are more effective methods which actually reduce the chances of re-offending
' restorative justice , which is often used when dealing young first - time offenders , gives an officer the opportunity to resolve a situation successfully , with the approval of the victim , without arresting and criminalising the person responsible
' the process gives victims the chance to tell offenders the real impact of their crime , to get answers to questions and an apology , while offenders are given the chance to take responsibility for what they 've done and make amends but not acquire the stigma of a criminal record
' the spokesman added : ' custody staff and duty managers are urged to carefully consider whether children need to be kept in custody overnight
' a new under - 15s category has been added to force statistics to give leaders greater visibility of detainees who are most vulnerable by virtue of their age
' in addition , the cambridgeshire police and crime commissioner 's independent custody visitors , who sit on the force 's custody steering group , pay regular visits to custody units across the force to check on the welfare of detainees , including vulnerable people such as children
