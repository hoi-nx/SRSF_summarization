baines may have been an everton defender for eight years , but it seems he still is n't quite sure who is in charge of what at the club
baines , who is currently out of the side because of an injury , was a pundit for itv 's coverage of his team 's 2 - 1 win over dynamo kiev
but when asked about how his team defend from corners , following gusev 's first half header , baines seemed completely stumped over who makes the decisions - even though he has played 63 times under manager martinez
gusev heads home dynamo kiev 's first goal , with no player on the near post for everton gusev celebrates , but baines was unsure as to why there was no - one defending on the line ' i 'm not too sure , ' said baines , when asked whether it was tim howard 's decision not to have a man on the near post at corners , or if the orders came from martinez
' we get the organisation before the game from the manager and the assistant manager before the game , so i 'm not too sure who makes the final call
' what baines was confident about was that the defending was n't good enough
' there 's shades of the goal we conceded against arsenal as well , ' he added
everton bounced back from the early set - back , as goals from steven naismith and romelu lukaku saw them take a lead from the first leg
baines has been at the club for eight years , but still does n't seem sure who calls the shots at everton
