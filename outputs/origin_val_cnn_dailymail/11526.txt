these music acts are so underground ... they do n't even exist
talk show host and prankster kimmel fooled sxsw attendees for the second year in a row , by asking for their opinions on fake bands
a television crew at the austin , texas , festival spoke with people in man - on - the - street interviews
those interviewed seemed unaware it was for kimmel 's ' lie witness news , ' which catches people fibbing
all but one claimed to be familiar with the musical artists discussed , despite the fact none of them are real , apparently in an attempt to be cool
' both musical acts , however , do not exist in the clip , a female voice off - camera asks a woman in a scarf for her opinion on ' mary kate and nasty , ' in a twist on the names of ashley and mary kate
' i do love mary kate and nasty , ' the woman says
' i really , really do
' ' i just like female singers generally , so i just their kind of - punky , poppy sound , ' she says
a male attendee in a button - down offers a full explanation on his love for ' dj underwire
' ' yeah , dj underwire is great , ' the man says
' he 's really mixing it up with actually turntable - ism and bringing that back in , scratching , right ? so it 's something that is oftentimes lost on some of the newer - age djs , and i think it 's great how he 's bringing that back in
' another man at sxsw says he 's a ' dj gluten ' fan - though the interviewer says some find him ' hard to take
' ' i like it , ' the man says
' i listen - i have some of it on my phone , actually
i like some of it
' pretending : the man on the left said he was a fan of ' dj cialis ' - like the erectile dysfunction medication - and the man on the right said he was a fan of ' dj gluten ' the video shows one man with a full beard and hat describing the group ' eddie and his manpurse
' ' um , well , manpurse , is , that 's the band , and eddie is the lead singer , so , you pretty much get to see the whole manpurse
like , you get to see the whole band , ' he explains
a man in glasses lies that he 's familiar with ' dj cialis ' - named for the erectile dysfunction medication
' yeah dude , he 's got the beat , ' the man says
' jokingly referring to the drug 's potential harm , the interviewer asks ' is dj cialis a little dangerous if he lasts more than four hours at one of his sets ? ' ' dangerous ? really ? ' the man says , puzzled
he even says he 's looking forward to hearing ' kimmel and the kimmels
' ' wait , you said kimmel and the kimmels ? ' he asks
' not like kimmel , like kimmel , but just like , just like ... ' ' like lie witness news , ' the interviewer says
' okay , alright , ' he says laughing
' why not man , why not ? ' a woman lies that she knows the band ' ashley and the kale chips ' - and fibs she 's seen the group in person , but ' only once
' ' i think they 're awesome , ' she says
' they have a different sound
you know , it 's not like everything so mainstream that you hear all the time
' interviewed : one woman ( left ) claimed to be a fan of ' ashley and the kale chips , ' while another ( right ) said she was a fan of ' cheez whiz khalifa ' and three other fake artists a woman in a pink shirt lies that she knows four different music acts
asked about ' wiz khalifa 's little brother , cheese whiz khalifa , ' the woman says ' yeah , he has a good sound
um , one of my friends is really into him , and so he 's more - he 's showed me a lot more of him than i 've been exposed to
' when quizzed about ' vlad and the putins ' - a twist on the name of russian president vladimir putin - she answers ' okay , i have heard of them , i have n't listened to a lot of it
' she even says she is familiar with ' dj fictionnel
' ' i actually saw him in france , when i was in lyon , ' she exclaims
the interviewer says at one point ' do you like the band jimmy kimmel just made me lie for like 15 minutes ? ' ' yes , ' the woman in pink replies , while laughing and putting her hand to her face
a man in a hoodie gives a roundabout reply to a question calling for his opinion on fake music group ' so much marijuana
' he says ' i like marijuana
i like a lot of marijuana
so , so much marijuana is a good name for a band
' he then goes on to say that marijuana should be legalized in ' all 52 states
