toby alderweireld knows southampton need to beat burnley this weekend if they are to maintain their push for european football
a summer of despair at st mary 's has been followed by a quite remarkable season , leaving southampton sixth in the standings with just nine matches remaining
last weekend 's 1 - 1 draw at chelsea boosted their hopes of european qualification - a match in which toby alderweireld performed fantastically on his return from a hamstring injury
it was a positive display after a frustrating time of late and the belgium international knows southampton have to follow it up with a win at home to burnley on saturday
toby alderweireld is keen for southampton to keep winning to maintain the push for europe ' it was great after two months seeing from the sidelines to play again , ' toby alderweireld said
' with a bit of luck , a good defence and a great goalkeeper we got a point
' it 's important we do n't look too far in the future because it wo n't help
we can be happy with the point at chelsea , but if we lose on saturday what does it mean ? ' we want to achieve something good , something special this season , so we have to win
that 's game by game
we ca n't play a different game on saturday , it 's burnley
alderweirel challenges diego costa for the ball during southampton 's 1 - 1 draw with chelsea ' we really want to achieve something very special for southampton
we have nine games , nine finals ; we have very tough games left
' let 's get the three points with the supporters on saturday , that 's the first final
' burnley arrive at st mary 's in the relegation zone yet buoyed by last weekend 's win against champions manchester city
sean dyche 's men also got the better of southampton when they met earlier in the campaign and toby alderweireld is eyeing revenge
' it 's going to be difficult because they are in a good mood , they have had good performances in the last few weeks so they have confidence , ' he told southampton 's official youtube channel
toby alderweireld is looking for revenge when southampton face burnley after they were beaten earlier in the season ' but at home , we need to win
we can put the pressure on us because of the season we have had , we have to do that , especially at home
' we have to be patient , show good quality on the ball and look out for the counter
' in the last game we deserved to win i think
we had the better chances and they had none really
' we had the throw - in and then they scored , it was very unlucky
we could have won there so we want to get a little revenge
' they have a lot of good players
when you 're not 100 per cent , anyone can beat you , that 's what people like about the premier league
' we have to be 100 per cent
they are in a good mood so we have to be at our best
' i do n't think this group is over confident
we are focused and we know we have to show the quality on the ball
