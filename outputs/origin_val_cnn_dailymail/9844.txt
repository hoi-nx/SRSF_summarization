this is the moment a group of pall - bearers dropped a corpse to the ground - but carried on oblivious to their mishap
in the footage from a funeral procession in indonesia , the pall - bearers hurriedly walk past a group of onlookers on the side of the road
but , unbeknown to them , the corpse falls out of the coffin and lands with a thump on the tarmac
the six pall - bearers enter the scene carrying the coffin during the funeral procession in indonesia without realising , the corpse falls to the road , as the pall - bearers walk on unaware of any problem the pall - bearers march on as the corpse ( far right ) lies unattended in the middle of the road an agitated spectator beckons the pall - bearers to turn around and retrieve the corpse from the ground two people shout to the pall - bearers to come back and pick up the corpse lying on the tarmac realising their blunder , the pall - bearers rush to retrieve the corpse and put it back in to the coffin rather than stop to retrieve the corpse , the bungling pall - bearers continue to march down the street blissfully unaware of their blunder
it is only when they are alerted by a couple of animated spectators that they turn around to pick up the fallen corpse
they then hastily place it back in the container before going on with the funeral procession
