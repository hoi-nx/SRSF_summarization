referees ' chief mike riley has called for video technology to be trialled after swarbrick ( right ) wrongly sent off gareth mcauley ( left ) in the second minute of west brom 's 3 - 0 defeat by manchester city the west brom players emphatically protest the red card as gareth mcauley is dismissed by referee swarbrick gareth mcauley ( right ) appears to ask the referee if he 's got the right man after craig dawson committed the foul asked why referees do not listen to players ' on - field explanations of such circumstances , professional game match officials limited ( professional game match officials limited ) general manager mike riley said : ' the referee has got to make his decision based on what he thinks he 's seen
his instincts often lead him to trust his judgement
' it 's one of the areas that would lend itself to technology
' the game has stopped and there 's time before we restart the game to have a look at something
that would provide the concrete evidence that would get the decision right
' i think football as a whole has to look at how we can enhance refereeing performances through the use of technology
west brom defender craig dawson makes a challenge on manchester city striker wilfried bony wilfried bony continues but gareth mcauley comes across in cover and gets the ball before the man ' we 've been open - minded to things like the goal - decision system which has made a great difference and a great benefit to referees in the barclays premier league
' we need to see what other technology can be used to get refereeing decisions more accurate
' he added : ' we need to test it in live football
until we do that , we wo n't know the impact on the game
' technology can be helpful but we do n't want to destroy the fabric of the game , the fast - flowing spectacle we all love
' bt sport showed the incident from referee swarbrick 's perspective , with no 25 craig dawson the closest to him gareth mcauley walks past his furious manager tony pulis after the latest case of mistaken identity mike riley , speaking on bbc radio 5 live 's sportsweek programme , did not offer any confirmation that swarbrick will referee in the next round of barclays premier league matches , following the international break
' i 've spoken to swarbrick quite a lot last night and this morning , ' mike riley said
' referees accept at every level your performance will be scrutinised
any referee , when you come off and you 've made a mistake , you 're hurt , because you love the game
' what you want to do is make the correct decision and when you do n't there 's that feeling that you 've let yourself down and let your colleagues down
' when they make mistakes , it 's our job to make sure they understand the mistakes , learn from it and they put it right in the next game
' west brom captain fletcher had urged swarbrick not to leap into the decision to brandish a red card
west brom captain fletcher urged swarbrick to take his time with the decision before the red card fletcher told match of the day he had spoken to the referee and told him : ' just make a sensible decision , it 's the first minute of the game , take your time
take your time because this is a massive decision that impacts the rest of the game
' fletcher added : ' i was really surprised when he showed the red card
i think a lot of our players were - and then to the wrong player as well , which we were trying to say as well , but it fell on deaf ears
' west brom boss tony pulis last week urged the game to embrace technology and permit each team two appeals against decisions in each match
he wrote in west brom 's programme for the match against stoke : ' a tv call back should be brought in where for 30 seconds the game could be held up whilst they decide if the original decision was correct or not
two calls allowed during the game from both sides would be sufficient and i believe would help improve the great package that the barclays premier league provides for everybody all over the world
