in a landmark legal case , sharon , 30 , won justice for her sister michelle who killed herself aged 27 in october 2012 , a year after she was punched , kicked and sexually abused as she walked home from a night out

michelle committed suicide a year about being attacked after a night out
sharon reveals how she fought to bring her sister 's attacker to justice thackaberry was jailed for five years in a landmark case over attacking michelle hennessy but sharon , of kildare town , irish , had promised her beloved twin she would not let her attacker walk free
the pledge was important to sharon because after initially being charged with rape , thackaberry was released on bail â and michelle said she did not feel safe while he was on the streets
the family believe this was one of the reasons michelle took her own life
sharon reveals how michelle - who was a fan of skydiving and nights out - changed after the attack
she said : â she was afraid and vulnerable and instead of travelling to far - flung corners like she had done , she spent her time sat by the fire , knitting
â i hardly ever saw her put on make - up and she never went out with friends , like she used to
â she âd been so proud of her girly locks and her sense of fashion , but afterwards she did nât care
â we were furious that thackaberry had nât been locked up and whenever michelle left the house , his supporters would harass her
they sent her abusive messages online too , calling her a liar
â the taunts and threats ground her down until she did nât feel human anymore
â in october 2012 michelle committed suicide at home
her sister recalled finding out â and desperately trying to reach her twin âs body
she said : â i remember collapsing onto the stairs and screaming from the bottom of my belly
â i screamed for all the pain and emotion that my twin sister was never able to scream
i screamed for the devastation she buried inside her , until it slowly destroyed every inch of her being
â i screamed for the anger she felt at not being protected from the monster who stole her life
â michelle ( left ) and sharon , pictured at three years old , had always been close and sharon vowed to see her sister 's attacker jailed , hiring a top lawyer and pestering police to keep the case open sharon , pictured at her 30th birthday ( left ) along with a tribute to her sister at the event ( right ) michelle ( right ) and sharon pictured together on their 27th birthday sharon was heartbroken when a lawyer told her family the ongoing case against thackaberry would â never see the light of day â because of her sister âs death
â it felt like the final nail in michelle âs coffin , â she said
â i felt like that monster was going to win â again
â so she hired a top lawyer and repeatedly pestered the police for the case to be pursued â and the trial went ahead
in november 2013 thackaberry , then 20 , of kildare town , irish , appeared at dublin âs central criminal court where he admitted aggravated sexual assault
the court was told the former boxer had violently assaulted michelle as he walked her home , dragging her onto wasteland around 250m from her home

her sister sharon reveals how michelle changed after the attack and would n't leave the house michelle - pictured ( left ) skydiving in spain , and ( right ) on a night out afterwards - committed suicide a year after she was attacked by thackaberry after a night out remembering how michelle felt after being attacked , her sister said : â she told me , â i thought i was going to die â
â sharon told how thackaberry winked at her as he was jailed for five years at dublin âs central criminal court
her sister said : â i âd made my sister that promise
â the lawyer said there had nât been a case in irish history like michelle âs , where someone was convicted after the victim had died
but we would nât give up
â michelle was dead because of what that man did to her
â we had hoped he would be prosecuted for rape , but it meant so much that thackaberry had finally admitted what he âd done
â his sentence was nât long enough for what he âd done , but we were so relieved that we finally had justice for michelle
â she said she was now fighting for other victims
â they were nât even going to look at her case and did nât believe michelle deserved justice , â she said
â michelle âs case set a precedent for future court cases
hopefully there wo nât be other victims like michelle
but if there is , they wo nât just be forgotten , like michelle threatened to be
â people think it âs bad to talk about these things but , in fact , it âs one of the most important things in the world
â because it âs only by talking about them that more women who feel lost like michelle will go and get help
â in the year after her sister 's death , sharon has helped raise more than â¬ 30,000 ( Â£ 21,000 ) for suicide awareness .
