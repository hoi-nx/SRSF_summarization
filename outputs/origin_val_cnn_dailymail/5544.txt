a hilarious video shows the moment an unnamed man retches seven times during a one - minute ride in a malaysia theme park the whole astounding episode is captured by the ride 's camera
at the start of the clip the couple are seen being strapped into their seats and look decidedly nervous
at first it is the unnamed woman who is scared and she laughs as she tells the man she does not want to look
but as the attendant completes a five - second countdown the man loses his smile - and his dignity
at the start of the clip the couple are seen being strapped into their seats and look decidedly nervous as the woman laughs the man can be seen clutching his head
at one point he even starts screaming : ' i regret this ' as the pair are catapulted around 150 metres in the air he begins to clutch at the seat 's metal bars and squeezes his eyes closed
he then wildly looks around before retching and waving his arms about
at one point he even starts hitting his head and screaming : ' i regret this
' his companion does her best to distract him and shouts : ' it 's already going down
' when this does not work she tells him to close his eyes - before dissolving into laughter
the clip ends with the woman cackling as the man sits hunched in his seat
it is thought that slingshot rides can travel at speeds of 100 miles per hour
