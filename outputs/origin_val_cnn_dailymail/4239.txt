chelsea crashed out of europe , beaten on away goals by 10 - man psg and branded ' babies ' by ibrahimovic
jose mourinho 's team led twice in this turbulent encounter but twice allowed psg to level , with captain thiago silva heading the vital second , six minutes from the end of extra-time
ibrahimovic , dismissed for a tackle on oscar in the first - half , said : ' i do n't know if i have to get angry or start to laugh
for me when i saw the red card i was like " the guy does n't know what he 's doing "
' that is not the worst
the worst is when i got the red card all the chelsea players come around
it felt like i had a lot of babies around me

the chelsea manager also blamed his own players for failing to deal with their numerical advantage , wilting under expectations and conceding twice from set - pieces
' when a team can not defend two corners a team does n't deserve to win , ' said jose mourinho
' we could n't cope with the pressure
for them it was easy , two lines of four , counter-attack , waiting for the right moment
mentally for them with 10 there is nothing to lose
chelsea players look dejected after being dumped out of the champions league at home to psg ' our performance was not good enough
the opponent was stronger than us , they coped better with the pressure of the game
because they had 10 men we felt more the pressure of winning and they had nothing to lose
' we could n't cope with that , we conceded two goals in two set pieces
that is difficult to accept
for me it was a surprise
i am disappointed , but i try always to be pragmatic and honest
the first feeling was that we deserved to lose
we did n't deserve to go through
' it 's not the moment to explain
we have a barclays premier league to win
i told that to the players
we lost a competition where even if we win today there are other big teams to beat
' we have the barclays premier league to win and we are in a good situation
there 's no time to cry
move on , and look forward
' former chelsea man luiz gestures towards blues striker diego costa during wednesday 's encounter psg defender luiz celebrated excitedly after scoring against his former club at stamford bridge thiago silva 's late header loops over the outstretched arm of thibaut courtois to knock chelsea out on ibrahimovic 's red card , jose mourinho said : ' i spoke to him after the game and when he speaks with me he 's always honest
he would tell me if it was a reason for a red card , and he was very disappointed so if that 's the case , i hope they can minimise the mistake and let him play the quarter - final
if he did nothing wrong , he deserves that
' but the other situations , it was a clear penalty on diego costa and , once more , i think it 's a waste of time and money to have the officials on the side of the goal
if he can not see a penalty 10 metres when it 's completely clear , it 's a waste of time and money
' the luiz elbow i did n't see , i confess
but when uefa give him the man of the match , i have to believe there 's no elbow
perhaps they can not give us the penalty but maybe they can do what is fair and suspend luiz and take ibrahimovic into the quarter - finals
' ibrahimovic also suggested oscar feigned injury
' i pulled out ( of the tackle ) , because i saw him come in the tackle
' i do n't know if he was acting afterwards
we won the game , we went through and let 's see what happens
' chelsea manager jose mourinho says he hopes ibrahimovic is able to have his red card overturned it was ill - tempered with sky sports pundits jamie carragher and graeme souness very critical of the behaviour by jose mourinho 's players , especially their attempts to get ibrahimovic sent off
jamie carragher called it ' disgraceful ' and graeme souness called it ' pathetic '
luiz equalised for psg in the 86th minute , to take the game into extra time after gary cahill had volleyed chelsea ahead
eden hazard restored the lead with a penalty in extra-time , after handball by thiago silva , who then headed in the winner with six minutes of extra-time left
' it is amazing for everyone , amazing for paris the club , for paris the city , ' said luiz , who left stamford bridge for the french capital last year
' my cycle was finished at chelsea and psg gave me a great opportunity to continue my career
' i was very happy at chelsea , i respect everyone and it was good to score
i said i would n't celebrate but i could n't control my emotions
thank you to chelsea , and sorry i celebrated because i was so emotional
' the barclays premier league will be without a team in the last eight of the champions league for the second time in three years if arsenal and manchester city can not overturn first - leg deficits next week against monaco and barcelona respectively but psg boss laurent blanc was satisfied to make it into the quarter - finals after this fierce contest
â both sides put pressure on the opposition and chelsea did their fair share of that
it had happened even before the match with their manager exerting pressure on the referee
that âs part of the mind games
but if you take out these elements of unsporting behaviour , i think my team were better than chelsea in every area of the pitch , â he said
