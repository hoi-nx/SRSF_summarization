an alabama woman on trial for murder in her granddaughter 's death called out the child 's name time after time as the girl lay on the ground after collapsing , but did n't tell medics the girl had run for hours , according to evidence presented on tuesday
joyce , 49 , is heard repeatedly calling the name of 9 - year - old savannah hardin in the more than 11 - minute 911 recording played in an otherwise silent courtroom
the child 's stepmother , jessica mae hardin , told the 911 operator the girl had a seizure
garrard talked in the background
jurors heard a 911 during which joyce did n't tell medics that she had made the girl had run for hours and could also be heard asking for ' a smoke ' while the child was unconscious ' savannah , open your eyes , ' garrard is heard saying
savannah , ' garrad says
' how is she doing ? ' operator beggs asks
' we ca n't get her to come to , ' savannah hardin responds
garrard 's lawyers have n't denied that the girl ran before her collapse , but the defense said the woman had no intention of harming her granddaughter
the recording showed savannah hardin , who is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl 's death , never told beggs the child had been running or that she had any previous medical problems
beggs said the information could have been useful to her treatment
savannah died in a hospital three days later
a firefighter who came to the scene said garrard also never told emergency workers the child had been running
she ' was telling us she had a seizure and she was trying to get her to respond , ' said justin hairrell of the mountainboro volunteer fire department
the 911 operator said garrard is heard early in the recording asking for ' a smoke ' while the child was unconscious
the defense suggested the woman was actually asking for something to cover the child with , like a small a blanket
' did she in fact say , " give me a throw ? '' ' asked defense lawyer richard rhea
' no. " give me a smoke , '' ' said beggs
victim : garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter , savannah hardin ( pictured left and right ) , nine , to run to her death at her home in etowah county in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates also in court on tuesday , neighbor jolie jacobs testified that savannah was crying and begging to stop before she collapsed
garrard , 49 , ' was hollering at her , telling her she better move it , ' jolie jacobs told jurors
prosecutors say garrard ran 9 - year - old savannah hardin to death as punishment for a lie three years ago
jolie jacobs lived across the street from the girl 's home at the time
she said she saw savannah running and carrying wood as garrard yelled at her
' she was crying and begging to stop , ' jolie jacobs said , savannah fell in apparent exhaustion , still crying
' joyce kept telling her to move it
' jolie jacobs said that she stood on her porch on several occasions after 6:30 p.m. on february 17 , 2012 , after she saw savannah collapse and begin throwing up
garrard , she said , tried pouring water in savannah 's mouth and told her , ' you better drink up or you ca n't go to the bathroom
' ' she was throwing up while she was trying to get water , ' jolie jacobs testified
jolie jacobs then said that as light began to fade around sunset , she thought she heard what sounded like garrard striking the child
she tried to recreate the sound , which she described as ' skin on skin
' biting her lip , jolie jacobs said she decided she had to intervene after about four or five trips to her front porch , and went inside to tell her husband
by the time they both came back out , medics had arrived
the girl died in a hospital three days later , and jolie jacobs said she regrets not doing something to help
' it had gone on long enough , ' she said as she blinked away tears
' i wish i had done something a lot sooner
' defense attorney bone questioned how jolie jacobs could have seen these events after showing her a paper stating sunset was at 5:30 p.m. that day
' i know what i saw and heard , ' she replied
the defense denies that garrard meant to do anything to harm the child
on monday prosecutors had compared garrard , 49 , to a drill sergeant
she could face the death penalty or life without parole if convicted
assistant district attorney reid said during opening statements in a standing - room - only courtroom that jurors would hear from neighbors who say they heard and saw what happened to savannah the day she died
mother and daughter : savannah ( pictured with her mother in a facebook photo ) eventually collapsed and started fitting
she was rushed to a nearby hospital , where she later died from dehydration and low sodium defense attorney bone tried to raise doubt about medical evidence in the case by showing jurors a version of the indictment , which mentioned severe dehydration and seizures
however , bone said savannah died because of a fatally low sodium level
he said the evidence will show the girl had too much water in her system , not that she was dehydrated
bone told jurors that prosecutors ' have oversold their case to the world
' ' they 're trying to hoodwink you with junk science , ' he said
' make them prove their case
' according to prosecutors , neighbors said garrard yelled at the girl as she ran , forcing her to continue ' like some kind of drill sergeant
' at one point , a neighbor saw the girl vomiting on her hands and knees , begging to stop , reid said
when paramedics arrived , they found savannah on the ground , ' freezing cold to the touch , ' her clothes and shoes soaking wet , reid said
garrard never told the medics that the girl had been running ; she said only that the girl collapsed in the yard
the 9 - year - old was rushed to a birmingham hospital , where she later died from dehydration and low sodium , a condition common in marathon runners
savannah was n't supposed to eat chocolates because she was on medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had a bladder problem , but she had eaten candy on the school bus the day before she died
arrests : garrard ( pictured , left , in her police mugshot ) was charged in the fatal february 2012 incident alongside savannah 's stepmother , 27 - year - old jessica mae hardin ( right )
the former 's trial began on monday garrard was angry that savannah ate the candy â ' but she was more upset about the lie , ' reid said
surveillance video from a school bus shown to a jury showed garrard talking with the bus driver , holmes , about savannah taking candy without paying from another student who was selling it
garrard told holmes : ' she 's going to run until i tell her to stop
she 's gon na learn
' the women then talk about a bladder condition the girl had and a procedure she had related to that condition
the driver then asks , ' is she ok ? ' garrard replies : ' she might be when i get about four more bottles of water in her
' garrard said savannah was ' in double trouble ' because she took the candy without paying and because she lied about it
holmes said in court that she saw the girl picking up sticks in the yard but did not see her running
' i feel partly responsible
i should have paid for those candy bars , ' holmes said
opening statements followed a jury selection process that lasted nearly three weeks
the judge in the case has refused the defense 's request to move the trial to a venue where it less well known
