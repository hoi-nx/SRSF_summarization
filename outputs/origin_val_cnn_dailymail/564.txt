there is a small corner of north manchester which can boast two mini sporting dynasties that continue to be remarkably productive
most famously from bury are the nevilles , whose notoriety takes in the worlds chiefly of football and netball , together with phil 's england age group honours at cricket
and then there are the crosses , who can field a west ham footballer , a superleague netballer and two very accomplished cricketers , the youngest of whom is becoming a fixture in england 's women 's cricket team
kate is part of the seam attack for england 's women 's cricket team and helped them win the ashes kate is daughter of former upton park striker david , but has followed more the path of her brother bobby , who was contracted to lancashire
the first girl to gain a place at the county 's cricket academy , she has progressed to becoming part of england 's seam attack , and was part of the team that won the women 's ashes last year
' we 've got quite a few connections with the nevilles , they live not far up the road from us , ' says kate , 23
' phil and gary went to the school next to our house and my sister jenny played netball with tracey [ who is now england 's interim head coach ]
my mum still plays netball in the same league as tracey 's mum
' these days david is a scout for blackburn rovers , and while he is best remembered for his 99 goals with the west ham , he is a lifelong cricket nut
' my dad was able to play cricket at the beginning of his football career and towards the end
i am too young to have seen him play , but i did manage to play a game of cricket for the thirds at heywood with him when i was 14
' cross ( left ) is the daughter of former west ham striker david ( right ) the neville brothers phil ( left ) and gary , pictured here playing in 2005 , are also from bury tracey neville ( right ) is a retired netball player and is pictured here at the 1998 commonwealth games these are exciting times for young women getting involved in elite sports , as evidenced by the bbc sports personality of the year team award to the england rugby team , ahead of competition such as paul mcginley 's ryder cup victors
the paying public are yet to be convinced in many instances , but there is a big drive to promote women 's sport among governing bodies , backed by many in the media
but it was not always a fashionable cause , as the younger kate daughter recalls when she was given a place in lancashire 's boys academy at the age of 15
' at the time there seemed to be some mixed feelings about it in a few quarters
there were quite a few people set in their ways with their cricket who were saying she has taken the position of a boy
because i would never play in the lancashire men 's first team they did n't see it as the right investment
' although there was a bit of negativity it gave me the realisation that i could go further with my cricket
' priority given to the women 's game has grown to the point where the national team are now on full - time contracts that also involve them doing promotional work for the sport with the chance to shine charity
kate ( left ) is pictured here with sportsmail 's mike dickson at the ecb 's national academy at loughborough kate is just back from a tour of new zealand where england edged both the one - day international and twenty20 series , with kate in particular shining with the ball in the odis
greater financial commitment in several countries is quickening up the evolution of the women 's game
while cross bowls her late outswing at around 70mph , and the very fastest in the women 's game are in the mid-seventies , power and speed are on the rise
as serena williams has consistently shown with her serve in tennis , it is possible that women can propel a ball with similar power to men
' i do n't see it happening in cricket in the near future but i think it could happen , ' says kate
' it starts as a young cricketer and if girls are now able to focus on cricket at an early age you will definitely see the speeds go up
' women 's cricket has changed in the past few years , it used to be a lot more tactical because we did n't have the strength , but in the last few years we have really worked on that and power hitting
the england women 's cricket team celebrate their ashes victory at the waca in perth last year ' it 's more about boundaries
a few years ago it was more about hitting the gaps but we have got a lot stronger
i really noticed at the twenty20 world cup in march how much other teams are improving
i 'm sure deandra dottin ( the phenomenal west indian hitter ) can strike it as far as any man in the game
she is not someone you want to bowl at
' kate and her fellow squad members are grateful for the financial support they get from the ecb that has allowed them to train full - time
but what about the argument that you can not really be professional in sport unless people , or television companies , are prepared to part with money to watch ? ' i 've heard that said , and it 's true that we certainly do n't get the crowds the men get
but it has to start somewhere and the ecb have invested that money in us and hopefully our game will improve , and that will bring more crowds in
' we sold chelmsford out last year for a twenty20 and got 2,000 at wormsley for the test against india
we get a bit lost at lord 's because it 's difficult to pack the ground out
but i have seen a difference in the crowds we are getting , and it 's different to australia , who commented on how many came
when we played at the mcg there were about 200 spectators , which was n't many in there
' cross in action with the bat for england in a test match against india at wormsley last august her career highlight was her test debut in january , when she helped bowl england to victory in the ashes test at perth with 6 - 70 in temperatures that got up above 100f
' i will remember that for a long time , one of the reasons we won the game was because we were more mentally prepared for the heat
i have never felt so shattered afterwards
we had won by lunchtime and went to a waterfront pub and i had some food at 4pm , and then it just hit me
i went to bed at 6pm and slept through until 9 the next morning
' she admits to not following women 's sport a great deal , but wants to make sure that there are more names to look up to for the next generation
' i really got into the winter olympics this year , watching athletes like lizzy yarnold
when i was growing up i looked up to andrew flintoff , and remember the 2005 ashes
hopefully in the future there will be more female names and role models
