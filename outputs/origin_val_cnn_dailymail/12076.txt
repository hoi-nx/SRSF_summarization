goal - kicking forward tickle has missed just two matches since joining the vikings in 2014 ' patrick has got some concussion issues at the moment , ' betts said
' we 're just being really smart with him
' he got hit on the head in a game and had a bit of delayed concussion
his symptons have kept resurfacing when he 's been putting the effort into training so , under medical advice , we 've had to step him back and take our time with him
' at the moment he 's in some kind of sabbatical
he 's sat at home waiting for his symptons to calm down
we 're monitoring him almost daily
' when he 's ready to go , he 'll have to go through six or seven days of training before he 's allowed to be up for selection
that 's in the medical people 's hands
