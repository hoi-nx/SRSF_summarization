many are happy to let potential buyers let a property before deciding if they want to buy
mark tunstall , of ' ultra prime ' specialists london , said : ' the practice of ' try before you buy ' is more prevalent with overseas purchasers who often look to rent a property before committing to a major financial investment
' someone from overseas , who is unfamiliar with areas of london and how london is as a city , often has a number of friends living in different neighbourhoods , each feeding back differing opinions on areas such as mayfair , knightsbridge , kensington , chelsea , marylebone and so on
' however , it is impossible to really get a feeling for an area without living or visiting there for a period of time and this , coupled with the increase in stamp duty which has made buying a property even more expensive , often leads overseas buyers to first rent a property to get to know a certain area , location or development before committing to a substantial investment in their property of choice

' in the 18th century , justice walk gained its name , as it was a place where prisoners , many charged for similar crimes to the legendary highwayman dick turpin , were tried

three centuries ago , the feeling around the court house , with towering ceilings , would have been that of despair and despondency , as magistrates decided the fate of highwaymen , drunkards and tax dodgers
the dominance of these grand historical masterpieces remains , although they now have an ambience of luxury and comfort

if its four walls could whisper , they would tell of trials held for highway robbers , petty thieves and drunks
the court house was built in the early 18th century , and witnessed hundreds of trials of petty criminals
most of the crimes dealt with inside its court rooms were for highway robberies committed by footpads along the dark lanes between chelsea and the capital
convicted criminals were taken on short walk to prison ships moored on the river thames , before being shipped to british penal colonies
legend has it there is a secret underground passage located underneath both buildings , which was used to transport the old court âs most dangerous convicts to the prison ships moored on the nearby banks of the river
after the last prisoner was sentenced , the court house - one of the few buildings surviving from chelsea 's early days , became a wine warehouse before becoming home to a warren of tiny artists ' and architect 's studios
today , while the interior has been transformed , the building 's exterior remains largely untouched .
