electrical giant pc world has been censured by the advertising watchdog for selling ultra-high definition televisions with bogus promises about extra clarity
the retailer claimed the smart lg sets with 4k , starting at Â£ 849 , would allow customers to ' watch your favourite christmas movies in greater detail '
but the asa has ruled that this was exaggerated and misleading because no british tv channel is yet broadcasting in 4k
these broadcasts are currently only available via internet based subscription services such as netflix
false claims : pc world - pc world claimed that the smart lg sets , like the one pictured , would allow viewers to watch christmas movies in ' greater detail
' the asa found this to be ' exaggerated and misleading ' as no british tv channel is broadcasting in 4k yet pc world - pc world said the lg set has ' automatic upscaling ' to ensure images are sharper and clearer than on a normal 4k ultra hd set manufacturers including lg , samsung and sony have spent millions of pounds developing the technology â said to be four times sharper than existing hd tv
pc world - pc world said the lg set has ' automatic upscaling ' to ensure images are sharper and clearer than on a normal 4k ultra hd set
as such , owners of the sets would see an improvement in picture quality regardless of whether the broadcast was in 4k
an offer of a ' free trial ' of amazon 's prime delivery service has been banned after the watchdog found the online retail giant misled consumers about subscription fees
the direct mailing sent to consumers with amazon accounts included a plastic card stating ' 30 - day free trial ' , information about the associated amazon prime instant video and a letter
small text at the bottom of the letter said : ' paid subscription starts automatically after free trial unless cancelled
' six people complained that the ad was not sufficiently clear that a paid subscription would start automatically if not cancelled during the trial and did not state the cost of the subscription
the asa ( asa ) said a paid subscription starting automatically at the end of the trial was a commitment and a significant condition of the ' free ' offer , and should therefore be made clear to consumers
but the asa said the advert failed to give evidence of how effective this would be , although it accepted images may well be better on lg sets
it said : ' we also considered viewers would understand that the improved quality was achieved because the televisions were ' 4k ultra hd ' , that this particular technology was therefore used to achieve the image quality and that the image quality achieved was subsequently of full and genuine 4k quality
' because there was such limited native 4k content available in the british , we understood that any improvement in quality in films or programmes watched over the christmas period was unlikely to be achieved by the use of 4k technology specifically
' it ruled the advertisement should not be repeated
the first ' hd ready ' sets and services emerged in 2006 to be followed by a new generation of sharper still ' full hd ' tvs in 2011 and then 3d televisions in 2013
since then , there has been the super slim oled screens that mean the sets can be hung on the wall like a work of art , together with curved screens claimed to improve viewing angles
and the innovations do not stop at 4k , as leading manufacturers are starting to demonstrate the new 8k tvs , which are eight times sharper than conventional hd sets and will be arriving in stores within two years
pc world - pc world said there were only three complaints to the asa
a spokesman said : ' we will of course ensure future adverts are clear on this topic for customers
