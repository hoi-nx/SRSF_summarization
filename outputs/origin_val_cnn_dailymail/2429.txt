' france minister segolene royal ( left ) has hit back after osborne repeatedly contrasted the britain 's strong recovery with the sluggish growth and high unemployment on the other side of the channel in his budget statement last week , mr osborne made several references to britain 's strong growth compared to france
he mocked the high rate of france unemployment , quipping that one english county - yorkshire - had created more jobs than the whole of france
he pointed to forecasts suggesting the britain economy grew by 2.6 per cent last year , ' 50 per cent faster than germany , three times faster than the euro - zone â and seven times faster than france '
he and the prime minister also pointed to the britain 's nearest continental neighbour as a lesson of why labour - whose leader closely associated himself with the approach of socialist party president francois hollande - would be bad for britain

' our economy is growing seven times faster than france 's , ' mr cameron wrote in the sunday times
' imagine if ed miliband had been free to pursue his france dream : the fallout would be felt in catastrophic job losses , falling living standards , eye - watering debt and fast - diminishing hope in our future
' the britain economy has enjoyed much stronger growth than france since the crash in 2008 , according to eurostat unemployment has also fallen more sharply in the britain than on the other side of the channel where more than 10 per cent were out of work in 2014 asked about the attacks , ms segolene royal told bbc2 's newsnight : ' i am very surprised by what i consider to be something which seems so far removed from the traditional britain sense of fair play
' it is rather condescending
it seems a little spiteful and inappropriate
' european countries ' should all stand together when any country is in difficulty ' , she said
' when a country like the britain is facing difficulty , we do n't make fun
in your country your budget deficit is much greater than it is in france , we do n't have take pleasure from it
' in the end , what goes around comes around

the mayor said : ' ( labour ) have an overt admiration for the way things are done in france , where they have unemployment now running at around 12 per cent
' you 've got huge numbers of talented france people fleeing france at the moment because it 's a crazed socialist , 1970s version of a european economy
