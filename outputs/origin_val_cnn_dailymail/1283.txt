but the driver was clearly angered by mr pickering 's attempts to take a photograph and lunged at him , sinking his teeth into his chest
mr pickering , who is 6ft 10ins tall , said : ' when you get on a bus you do n't expect you to end up being someone 's lunch
' i mean , who bites people ? i was so taken aback
i could n't believe it had happened
' the driver of the double decker bus has been cautioned by police and mr pickering has been awarded an out of court settlement
mr pickering was travelling back from a day out in derby with his daughters , to his home on the outskirts of the city
he claims the driver on the number 45 bus charged him around Â£ 1.50 more for the outbound journey than he paid for the tickets on the way into the city
mr pickering sent his daughters to sit on the top deck and then claimed he attempted to reason with the driver who refused to give him an explanation
he said : ' he charged me a different price from the way into town
' i was asking him for an explanation , but he could n't give me one and was just being grumpy and mumbling
mr pickering was paid an out of court settlement of Â£ 1,500 after the bus driver lunged at him and bit him ' i asked him for his details but he was n't really saying anything
' i could n't see his badge so i took my phone out and i thought to myself that a photo of him would be just as good to take to the company
' but he put the engine off , and it turned the lights off on the bus , and he started to get his paperwork together and he put his hand up and he knocked it out of my hand
' it went to the floor
' then he bit me
he bit me on the boob
mr pickering was bitten by the driver of a number 45 arriva bus as he rowed over the ticket price in derby ' he was only 5ft 10 and i 'm 6ft 10
i assume if we were the same height he would have bitten higher
' security officers then boarded the bus and the police were called
a spokeswoman for derbyshire police confirmed the driver was arrested the following day on suspicion of assault and was cautioned
pickering hired solicitors who have now secured a Â£ 1,500 out of court settlement following the incident in december 2013
