then new york city skyline is perhaps one of the more noticeable landscapes from paul reiffer 's work behind the scenes of pauls shoot in shanghai ; the photographer has spent three years collating his work each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails ; here the lights of sydney harbour reflect in the waters paul reiffer said : ' some of my images require a lot of planning , unfortunately , one of the ways i decided to get a different view was to get onto rooftops
' some with full permissions and authorised access , others less so
' ironically , while legitimate access takes a lot of bureaucracy , it 's the more ' unofficial ' shoots which take the most planning
' generally if you search online , or see a city in a magazine , the same old shots will appear time and time again , so while i use other images for reference , i tend to then start researching using tools like google satellite view and 3d maps along with sunrise / sunset apps to plan my own take on the view of a city
the serene and still waters reflect the bright lights of singapore , a hive of activity a gorgeous sunset of the golden gate bridge , san francisco reveals a beautiful side to the urban sprawl the roads may be devoid of traffic here in kuala lumpur , but it simply gives the light trails more prominence ' the shot of the nanpu bridge in shanghai was the most difficult shot to take of the collection , while hanging from helicopters and lying in the middle of roads sounds challenging , photographically this was a real pain
' let 's just say you need to trust the front half of your feet to get to the place , as that 's the only part which will be touching the ledge of a building as you walk along it 30 - odd storeys up in the air
the shimmering auckland skyline in new zealand looks majestic against the backdrop of the dark waters the buildings of kuala lumpur look palatial , and show off in terrific lighting by paul reiffer 's camera skills paul reiffer captures the jam - packed nature of new york city from high above most of the buildings ' i 've had to run from some locations with a memory card in my underwear before now ! not because of anything illegal , more an argument with an overzealous security guard on a building i was photographing from
' because of the resolution of these images , they can be printed big and when you see a cityscape at two or three meters wide and are able to see every detail of every parked car , building window or landmark in the distance , it 's quite impressive
' the shanghai interchanges are mesmerising , and only at night would you ever see them this quiet hong kong , china ; the british photographer is able to capture huge city landscapes in extraordinary detail
