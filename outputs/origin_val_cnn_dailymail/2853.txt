britain 's first dedicated hedgehog conservation area is launched today in an attempt to slow the species â dramatic decline
the number of hedgehogs in the country are estimated to have dropped 40 per cent in the last two decades
conservationists have created a â hedgehog improvement area â which opens today in solihull , the west midlands
a group of volunteers will manage the green space , helping to establish a central sanctuary from which it is hoped the hedgehog population will be able to disperse and inhabit the surrounding countryside
but thompson , hedgehog officer for warwickshire wildlife trust , said people across the country can do far more to help by taking simple measures in their own back gardens
part of the reason that hedgehogs have decline so far is thought to be linked to the widespread loss of bushes and hedges , which have been replaced in many back gardens by hard wooden or metal fences
hard barriers make it impossible for hedgehogs to move from place to place - if they are isolated in smaller and smaller areas of greenery , they can not feed or mate
mr thompson said : â something as basic as linking up a series of small isolated green patches with a hole no bigger than the size of a cd is a remarkably powerful and positive action for hedgehog conservation

â fay vass , chief executive of the britain hedgehog preservation society , which is backing the project , said : â we are delighted to be funding such an exciting and important project in warwickshire wildlife trust that will hopefully benefit many hedgehogs
â simple measures such as ensuring there is a five inch square gap in boundary walls and fences make a massive difference to local hedgehog populations
â there are many ways people can assist this declining species and we hope this project will complement our work to highlight the plight of the hedgehog
