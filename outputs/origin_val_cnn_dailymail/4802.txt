the australia and india squads have had ample time in the past four months to work each other out , ensuring a level of tension for their world cup semi-final expected to go well beyond the usual for a knockout game
australia all - rounder james faulkner wo n't be surprised if there 's some niggle and verbal exchanges , just like he 's not surprised that defending champion india shook off their poor form leading into the world cup to win seven consecutive matches
' they 've spent a fair bit of time in the country , so they 've adapted well to the conditions , ' james faulkner told a news conference monday
' it 's no surprise they 're up against us in the semi-final , they 're a very strong team

' australia have won the world cup four times and reached the final on two other occasions , but never on home soil
india have two world cup titles , and became the first team to clinch it at home in 2011 after beating australia in the quarter - finals , pakistan in the semi-finals and sri lanka in the championship match
watson bats during the 2015 world cup match between australian and pakistan at adelaide oval india did n't win a competitive match between the time the squad landed in australia in november until its opening world cup game against pakistan on february 15
in that time , it lost a test series to australia , and was winless in a limited - overs tri-series against australia and england

james faulkner said that exchange was ' all in great spirit , ' and he expected more spirited exchanges with a spot in the final at stake at the sydney cricket ground on thursday
' there 's going to be words said and it 's going to be a really tough contest , ' james faulkner said , adding that there 's usually some sledging on the field
' it 's the nature of the game , it 's a semi-final
neither team will be backing down

the sydney cricket ground venue is expected to be packed with traveling india fans who may outnumber australia supporters and possibly make it seem more like an away game for the locals
' we were talking about it last night at dinner , the last game we played here it definitely felt like that , ' james faulkner said
' the passion the indian fans show toward their cricket team is sensational , so we 're definitely expecting that
