kabul , afghans the afghans woman is dragged onto a roof and hit with a stick , as a horde of angry , screaming men swarm around her
at one point , video shows her standing with her face covered in blood
she is pushed and falls over , and her beating continues with feet , with rocks , with boards
then , in the last part of the video , her body is engulfed in flames -- though it 's not known whether , by that point , she was already dead
this horrific scene played out in kabul on thursday
it 's already had ripple effects , including a u.n. statement on friday condemning what it called " the brutal killing and burning of a 27 - year - old mentally ill woman
" that corresponds with what the woman 's parents told cnn affiliate tolo , saying their daughter suffered from mental health problems for the last 16 years
it 's not known whether her attackers knew this , or that it would have mattered
what motivated the mob , according to witnesses , was a belief that the targeted woman had burned the quran
cnn has n't seen any proof that she set a copy ablaze
afghans 's ministry of hajj and religious affairs has found no such evidence , either , according to tolo
bowden , acting head of the u.n. afghans mission , said that burning the quran hurts efforts to promote " understanding and mutual respect between cultures and religions
" " however , the brutal murder of this woman is an unspeakably horrendous act , " bowden said , " that should result in those responsible being prosecuted , to the fullest extent possible , under afghans law
" nahid , a 45 - year - old woman who goes only by one name , told cnn what she saw and heard outside the shah do shamshera shrine , which is opposite a mosque by the same name
a group of women were shouting at the eventual victim , accusing her of burning the quran , according to nahid
this got the attention of men nearby
police tried to close gates to keep them out but it did n't work , said the witness , noting that many men jumped a fence and began beating the accused woman
the hits and kicks ended after someone poured fuel on the woman and lit her on fire , said nahid , who watched from inside the shrine
" ( they ) burned her and then threw her corpse away in the kabul river , " she said
as of saturday , 11 people had been arrested in connection with the woman 's death , according to interior ministry spokesman seddiqi
seddiqi said that the investigation is ongoing
president ghani ordered two investigations related to the case -- one into the beating itself and another including religious scholars
his government is " committed to protecting and safeguarding all islamic values , " including prohibitions on burning the quran ( if that is , indeed , what this woman did )
that 's a responsibility of the nation 's security and legal system , ghani said , not of individual afghans
" no individual is allowed to make oneself a judge and use violence to punish others in degrading manners , " the president said
" launching personal trials and choosing who to punish stands in clear contradiction to sharia and islamic justice
