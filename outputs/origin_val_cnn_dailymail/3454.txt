a municipal court judge who resigned after being slammed in a doj report has announced he is stepping down from two more roles
ronald j. brockmeyer left his ferguson position earlier this week after he was directly criticised in the report , which was prompted by the fatal police shooting of michael brown
he also left his post as a dellwood prosecutor
he has now announced he will no longer be the prosecuting attorney in vinita park and florissant
he has also left three other roles
state appeals judge roy l. richter ( right ) was appointed to take his place in ferguson the report , released on march 4 , singled out the 70 - year - old and suggested he was behind ferguson âs aggressive strategy of using its municipal court to generate revenues
it added that ronald j. brockmeyer was particularly ' creative ' when it came to traffic fines and fees , including dismissing tickets for himself and friends
announcing his resignation ronald j. brockmeyer said he wanted to help the city ' begin its healing process ' and to promote public confidence in the court
roy l. richter , a state appeals judge , was appointed by the missouri supreme court to take his place and make ' needed reforms '
richter will be authorized to overhaul court policies in order to ' restore the integrity of the system ' and ensure the respect of defendants ' rights , according to the high court
he will start on march 16
chief justice mary russell said she believes richter will bring a ' fresh , disinterested perspective ' to the court
' he is able and willing to implement needed reforms , ' she said
' extraordinary action is warranted in ferguson , but the court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis
' but vinita park mayor james mcgee said that ronald j. brockmeyer âs service would be ' dearly missed '
a doj investigation found patterns of racial bias in the ferguson police department and at the municipal jail and court
ronald j. brockmeyer stepped down to help the city ' begin its healing process ' , he said two ferguson police department commanders - rick henke and william mudd - also resigned last thursday after racist emails were discovered by the doj 's investigation , while mary ann twitty , a court clerk , was fired
it is unclear whether the three were the recipients or senders of the ' racially biased ' emails included in the 102 - page civil rights report
the st. louis reports that rick henke was associated with a 2008 email suggesting that president barack obama would not complete a full presidential term because a black man ca n't hold ' a steady job '
william mudd is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a new orleans woman was paid by ' crimestoppers ' to terminate her pregnancy
the doj highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless women dancing , with the caption ' michelle obama 's high school reunion '
the report states that the emails illustrate racial , ethnic , or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the doj 's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week
evidence found shows not only racial bias , ' but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case '
in fact , the report states , there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails
instead , the emails were forwarded along to others
the investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts
sgt. william mudd ( left ) and capt. rick henke ( center ) resigned from their positions on thursday
city court clerk mary ann twitty ( right ) was fired over racially charged emails discovered in the report u.s. attorney general eric holder called the doj 's report ' searing ' and said the investigation showed policing and municipal court practices were ' disproportionately harmful to african-american residents '
he said : ' this investigation found a community that was deeply polarized
' a community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents
' a community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue
' ferguson mayor knowles revealed last week that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the doj , reuters reports
knowles did not comment on whether police chief tom jackson would step down
the doj 's investigation into the st. louis suburb came after a white ferguson police officer , darren wilson ( right ) , fatally shot an unarmed black teen , michael brown ( left ) , in august last year the grand jury 's decision not to indict the ferguson police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast ferguson 's mostly white police force in a negative light the report found that some practices of the ferguson police department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the fourth amendment the report highlighted the department 's practices , saying the city 's focus on revenue greatly impacted on the police department 's approach to law enforcement and the role of ferguson 's municipal court
it states : ' the ferguson municipal court handles most charges brought by the ferguson police department , and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice , or protecting the rights of the accused , but of maximizing revenue
' it also highlighted the fact that african - americans make ' extraordinary ' efforts to pay off overly expensive tickets for often minor , unfairly charged violations
the investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts
the report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help
the clerk responded : ' your ticket of $ 200 has magically disappeared ! ' some practices of the ferguson police department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the fourth amendment , which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause .
