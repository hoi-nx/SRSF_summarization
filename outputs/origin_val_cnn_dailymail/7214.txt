education secretary nicky morgan yesterday accused her labour opposite number of calling her â love â in the house of commons
labour âs tristram hunt allegedly made the remark during a parliamentary debate last week
mrs morgan raised the comment when asked about sexism in parliament in an interview to mark international women âs day
nicky morgan today claimed she was condescendingly called ' love ' in the house of commons by her labour opposite number tristram hunt a tory source said of shadow education secretary mr tristram hunt last night : â he ought to think what sort of message it sends to young girls in the classroom to see him use chauvinist put - downs to one of the most senior women in government
â in the interview with sky news , mrs morgan also defended david cameron against accusations of sexism , calling him a â feminist â
mr david cameron came under fire in april 2011 after he responded to heckling from labour frontbencher angela eagle by saying : â calm down , dear
â he later said he was â hugely sorry â for the remark , which was taken from a tv advert
mrs morgan denied that the comment showed the pm was an â innate sexist â and said he has a better record promoting women than the lib dem â pointing out there are no lib dem women in the cabinet
nicky morgan said tristram hunt made the remark ' in the heat of the moment ' during a fiery commons debate on schools she added : â i have to say the shadow education secretary said to me last week in education questions â not my responsibility , love â
â i âm afraid to say there can be things that are said in the heat of the moment on all sides of the house
â the heckle is thought to have come as mrs morgan confronted labour over its tuition fees policy
higher education fees are strictly a matter for shadow business secretary chuka umunna , not mr tristram hunt
mrs morgan also revealed she did not find the commons chamber during prime minister âs questions intimidating
she added : â prime minister âs questions is a tiny part of the week ... the work we do in our constituencies , our surgeries , helping people , making the case for our areas to government , that is something women are absolutely brilliant at doing
â the tone of the debate when you get women ... is very different
we need more women in parliament
â labour last night declined to comment .
