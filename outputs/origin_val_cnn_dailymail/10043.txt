mike dean had a good game in very difficult circumstances and over the 90 minutes , to the independent eye , did nothing to add to jose mourinho âs claims of a campaign against his team
sure enough some referees would have waved away appeals for the penalty which mike dean awarded against matic , but replays confirmed what i thought when agreeing that the midfielder had caught sadio mane before playing the ball
there were some referees who would have given the home side a penalty of their own when costa was challenged by jose fonte
referee mike dean ( right ) had some tough calls to make in chelsea 's draw with southampton some officials may have waved away this penalty claim awarded to southampton , as matic brings down sadio mane , but replays confirmed midfielder had caught the winger before getting the ball chelsea striker costa appeals for a penalty but is denied this time by mike dean replays were inconclusive but pundits felt mike dean was correct
had he awarded the penalty of course jose fonte would have had to be dismissed
the one decision i had to disagree with was when matic cynically tripped his opponent and mike dean , after due consideration and perhaps realising that matic was already on a caution , decided to keep his cards in his pocket
jose mourinho wisely subbed matic shortly afterwards
chelsea could also point to a trip by tadic on branislav ivanovic just inside the penalty area in the first half but to the naked eye at high speed it looked like a dive which mike dean did well not to caution
branislav ivanovic went down in the box but in real time it looked like a dive - replays showed contact from tadic but it would have been tough to give costa claims he was fouled by diego fonte - if the penalty was given the defender would be been sent off jose mourinho claims a campaign against his side but mike dean 's performance did nothing to support his theory
