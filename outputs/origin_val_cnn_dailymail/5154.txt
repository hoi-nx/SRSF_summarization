newcastle legend moncur maintains that teams deserve the â big club â tag by winning trophies
commenting on the study in thursday 's sportsmail , moncur said the rankings of chelsea ( 4th ) and manchester city ( 5th ) in the â big clubs â league table were justified despite owners splashing hundreds of millions of pounds in recent years
newcastle were listed ninth in our findings , one place above rivals sunderland , who moncur later joined

â moncur , the last man to lift a trophy for the magpies when they won the inter-cities fairs cup in 1969 , added : â if you were ranking newcastle on supporters alone i âd have them in the top three
the fans are loyal , passionate and fill the ground week in , week out , regardless of what happens on the pitch
â in that sense , both they and sunderland are huge
but , as we know , newcastle have not won a trophy since 1969 and sunderland since 1973
former newcastle captain moncur holds aloft the inter-cities fairs cup in 1969 - the club 's last trophy sportsmail 's extensive study found that manchester united are english 's biggest club with arsenal and liverpool second at third respectively while newcastle and sunderland are ninth and tenth chelsea won the second league title in the club 's history in jose mourinho 's first season in english â you could say manchester city have bought success but they were always a big club in my day , people sometimes forget that
chelsea have won a lot of trophies after financial backing but they âve had good days in the past too
â some north-east fans might argue their teams should be higher but ranking them in the top 10 is fair and actually recognises how big they are
â moncur , 70 , also agreed with placing arsenal in second , above liverpool
â arsenal have always been a big club , all the way back they âve been in the top division and won things , â he said
â until bill shankly came in , liverpool did nât dominate like they did in the seventies and eighties
i remember when they were nothing
