nine foreign workers are believed to be in the hands of isis - affiliated militants after an attack on a libyan oil field , according to officials
libyan 's internationally recognized government has blamed " isis militias " for the attack friday in which the al-ghani oil field was set on fire
the kidnapped foreigners were working for vaos , an austria - owned oil services company whose headquarters are in tripoli , the libyan capital
they include four philippines , an austria , a czech republic and a ghana , according to the philippines foreign ministry
the bangladesh government said one of its citizens was also taken hostage
the nationality of the ninth worker was unclear
the abductions come amid libyan 's deteriorating security situation in which islamic militias , some of them pledging allegiance to the extremist group isis , have thrived
egypt carried out airstrikes against isis militants in libyan last month after the killings of egyptian christians who had been kidnapped while working in a libyan city
the philippines foreign ministry said monday that its tripoli embassy had " stepped up coordination " with the austria company and libyan authorities " to locate the abducted philippines and ensure their safe and immediate release
" martin weiss , a spokesman for the austria foreign ministry tweeted monday that " credible sources " had confirmed that the austria citizen and other international workers were in the hands of isis " terrorists
" the attack on al-ghani is the latest in a recent spate of violence by militants targeting oil fields in libyan
the libyan national oil corporation said over the weekend that it had warned vaos more than two weeks ago to leave the area because of security concerns
vaos was n't immediately available for comment tuesday
the philippines foreign ministry said 52 other philippines are employed by vaos but were relocated out of al-ghani " much earlier " and are now in tripoli
three other philippines have been missing in libyan since they were seized at the mabruk oil field in february , the foreign ministry said
" these cases underscore the escalating threat to the safety and security of philippines oil workers in libyan oil fields which have been targeted by armed groups in recent weeks , " said foreign ministry spokesman charles jose
he said philippines authorities were unsure at this point whether the kidnappers were isis members
