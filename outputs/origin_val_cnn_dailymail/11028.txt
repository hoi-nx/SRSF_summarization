ronald koeman has had worse birthdays
on the same day he turned 52 , southampton kept themselves in the hunt for european football , and it was gift - wrapped by burnley themselves
shane long âs first strike in the barclays premier league since november and an own goal by jason shackell did the trick against a burnley team threatened with being sent back to where they came from last season
as for southampton it will take some doing to get rid of them
just when arsenal , liverpool and manchester united thought champions league qualification was primarily a scrap among themselves , this served as a reminder
shane long opened the scoring with his first goal in the barclays premier league since november long celebrates putting southampton ahead in the 37th minute against burnley on saturday southampton ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : fraser forster 6 ( k. davis 14 , 7.5 ) ; nathaniel clyne 6 , fonte ( c ) 6 , alderweireld 6 , ryan bertrand 8 ; schneiderlin 6 , s. davis 6.5 ; mane 6.5 , tadic 6 ( wanyama 46 , 6 ) , long 7.5 ; graziano pelle 6.5 subs not used : yoshida , gardos , djurcic , ward-prowse , elia manager : ronald koeman 7 goals : shane long ( 37 ) , jason shackell ( og 58 ) booked : none burnley ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : thomas heaton 6 ; mee 6 , schakell ( c ) 5 , duff 5.5 , trippler 6 ; ashley barnes 6 ( wallace 82 ) , arfield 6 , jones 5.5 , boyd 6.5 ; vokes 6.5 ( jutkiewicz 74 , 6 ) , ings 5.5 ( sordell 88 ) subs not used : gilks , kightly , keane , reid manager : sean dyche 6 goals : none booked : none match rating by kieran gill at st mary 's stadium jason shackell 's own goal at st mary's.click here for our match zone service â the boys gave me the best present for my birthday , â said ronald koeman , who was serenaded by the st mary âs crowd with their rendition of happy birthday
â yet it was horribly tense at times , as it should be against a team fighting for their barclays premier league lives
burnley , fresh from beating manchester city last week , made the southampton sing for their supper
southampton moved to within a point of liverpool , albeit a game ahead , and did so without fraser forster , the keeper with the most clean sheets in the barclays premier league this season
no sooner had the game got started than it was interrupted when fraser forster , named in roy hodgson âs england squad this week , had to be carried off on a stretcher after 14 minutes following an innocuous challenge by sam vokes
there was nothing in it as the burnley striker tried to block the goalkeeper âs clearance but fraser forster was replaced by the 38 - year - old kelvin davis , and ronald koeman does not think he will be able to feature for england this month
burnley shot themselves in the foot in the 58th minute when jason shackell diverted ryan bertrand 's cross into his own net burnley defender jason shackell looks dejected after scoring an own goal against southampton yet southampton made do without fraser forster , and shane long settled their nerves on 38 minutes
a deflected low drive by nathaniel clyne from the right corner of the penalty area somehow found the unmarked forward at the back post
a simple tap - in was all that was required , and the irishman obliged
southampton have dropped just two points from winning positions this season â fewer than any other team â but this was scrappy , to say the least
graziano pelle should have scored , and passed the dreaded 1,000 - minute mark in the barclays premier league since his last goal
he hit the crossbar from close range , produced air - kicks , had headers saved , and his luck never improved
â the first half was a little bit more difficult
we had good chances to score more than one goal , â ronald koeman added
â there was good movement , good attacking , good chances
â graziano pelle was a little unlucky , but he was working hard
that âs what you have to do if you do nât score
your team - rate is important.the goals will come , â insisted ronald koeman
it was a good win
â the game died when burnley shot themselves in the foot in the 58th minute
ryan bertrand had been a nuisance throughout , and his cross led to an outstretched knee by burnley defender jason shackell turning ryan bertrand âs cross into his own net under no pressure
southampton , then , remain in the race , and the seemingly impossible remains possible
