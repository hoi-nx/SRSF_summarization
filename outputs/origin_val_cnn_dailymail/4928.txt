he had left his millbury home telling his wife he was on his way to work at the waters corporation , despite calling in sick to his accountant job
he left behind a thumb drive with his last thoughts to be sent to his brother

he death certificate lists the official cause as ' cardiovascular collapse
' referencing pslams in his final thoughts , pasceri wrote : ' the doctor is dead

though pasceri was known as a husband and father , a man who regularly attended church and even started a men 's group to help with home repair projects , those close to him said there had long been a dark side
' really deep down , inside , he must have known that he was wrong for some of the things he did , ' sister , marguerite joly , told the boston globe
' i think he slowly lost his mind
' brother john pasceri did not think mental illness was a factor but agreed that pasceri could be unforgiving
' when you were wrong , you had to suffer the judgments of steve , ' he told reporters
a man with a troubled past , he had been arrested at 17 for stealing guns from a neighbor 's house
but his mother got a good lawyer who cut a deal for counseling and military service , and he spent three years in the army until finally coming home in december 1980
it was that dark side that emerged at the hospital when he approached secretary cheryl cantalupo demanding to see davidson without an appointment
' no , you do nât understand , ' he said
' i âve traveled a long way
i have to see dr. davidson
i âm not leaving without seeing him

his last moments were spent warning others
' run , run , he âs shooting , he âs shooting ! ' he was said to have cried out as he ran from the exam room
after shooting the surgeon , pasceri went into another room and shot himself
