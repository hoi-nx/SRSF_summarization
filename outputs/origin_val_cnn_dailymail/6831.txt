the likes of samsung and intel are at the annual wearable technology show ( wearable technology show ) alongside smaller firms and startups
devices on show include samsung 's gear virtual reality headset ( pictured ) , a bluetooth medical splint and a bag that warns owners if they 've left something at home wearable technology show is the industry 's largest event , with more than 100 companies displaying their products , and it is taking place at the excel in london
among those at the show is european 10,000m champion jo pavey , 41 , who is testing the latest in smart training devices
in particular she has been trying out intel 's Â£ 130 sms biosport earphones that work with a smartphone app to measure running pace and heartbeat
the latter normally means wearing a bulky and uncomfortable device on a chest strap , she said
elsewhere samsung has been showing off its gear vr headset and gear s smartwatch
the watch has been discussed a lot over the past 24 hours since its main rival apple launched its own first wearable
the gear s has a 2 - inch curved screen and can be used to show messages and notifications from a connected phone at a glance
there is also a port for a nano sim that gives the watch its own mobile network , and the screen can be customised - as well as the colour of the straps
samsung 's gear vr uses the 5.7 - inch quad hd display of a galaxy note 4 mounted into the specially designed headset to enter virtual worlds
the korean firm also recently unveiled it gear vr innovator edition
both are powered by oculus rift technology but the innovator is 15 per cent smaller than the gear vr wearable technology show is the industry 's largest event and is taking place at the excel in london

it also includes basic head tracking capabilities
the korean firm also recently unveiled its next - generation version of the headset called the gear vr innovator edition
both are powered by oculus rift technology but the innovator is 15 per cent smaller than the gear vr
another product on show is a prototype handbag fitted with sensors that can warn a user if an item they usually carry with them has been left at home optimised to work with the latest s6 and s6 edge handsets , the innovator has reduced pixilation to make images appear more realistic and a wider field - of - view
samsung has also redesigned the innovator model to give a better weight balance making it more comfortable to wear
some of the smaller names showcasing their devices at wearable technology show include burg 31 , osteoid and sunfriend
dutch firm burg 31 make a range of smartwatches for children and seniors , created by lifestyle designer hermen van den burg
its latest $ 129 burg 31 is fitted with gps and offers one - touch emergency calls and speed dialing of up to three pre-set numbers without the use of a connected phone
the watch makes and receives calls using a sim card , but it can also be paired with android phones , iphones and other smartphones to place calls via bluetooth
the water - resistant device additionally lasts for two days on standby
the osteoid splint , designed by turkey - based deniz karasahin , perfectly fits to a patient 's arm using 3d scans
this data is transferred to modelling software , which determines the overall size and geometry of the finished cast
once printed , a locking mechanism and algorithmically generated ventilation holes are added
the osteoid splint ( pictured ) perfectly fits to a patient 's arm using 3d scans
a low intensity pulsed ultrasound ( lipus ) bone stimulator is then placed directly on a patient 's skin
the company said that spending just 20 minutes a day in the cast reduces healing time by up to 38 % sunfriend 's uva = b wristband is said to negate the need for suncream by monitoring the wearer 's exposure to uv rays
wearers begin by entering their skin tone and skin sensitivity , on a scale of 1 to 11
sensors monitor uv levels and leds light up gradually
once the safe limit has been reached , these leds begin flashing the osteoid splint , designed by turkey - based deniz karasahin , perfectly fits to a patient 's arm using 3d scans
once printed , a locking mechanism and ventilation holes are added
according to mr karasahin , a low intensity pulsed ultrasound ( lipus ) bone stimulator is then placed directly on a patient 's skin when the design has been printed
the medical cast is combined with the lipus stimulator system to speed up healing
the company said that spending just 20 minutes a day hooked to the system , which plugs directly into the cast , reduces healing time by up to 38 % and increases the healing rate up to 80 % over traditional casts

the medical cast is combined with the lipus stimulator system to speed up the healing process
the company said that spending just 20 minutes a day hooked to the system , which plugs directly into the cast , reduces healing time by up to 38 per cent and increases the healing rate up to 80 per cent over traditional casts
sunfriend 's uva = b wristband is said to negate the need for suncream by monitoring the wearer 's exposure to uv rays
wearers begin by entering their skin tone and estimated skin sensitivity , on a scale of 1 to 11
sensors inside the waterproof wristband then monitor uv levels and leds light up as uv exposure accumulates
once the safe limit has been reached , these leds begin flashing
it is hoped the watch will help people overcome the problems of vitamin d deficiency
a pair of the Â£ 99 sunnycam hd video recording glasses ( pictured ) is also being showcased
as well as having a camera built into the frame , each pair has a micro sd card to record footage on to
the glasses are capable of recording 1280 x 720 or taking regular photos one of the smaller names at the show is burg 31
