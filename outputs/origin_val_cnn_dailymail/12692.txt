dante , the father of the italian language , is turning in his grave
believe it or not , the land where latin originated and from which many other european languages descend is becoming " illiterate
" not only have italian long forgotten the language of their roman empire , but they hardly know how to speak and write proper italian
they 've been negatively dubbed " asini " ( donkeys ) , as in " stupid
" if you take a look at italian language forums and debate websites it 's clear that many italian are clueless on grammar and do n't even know how to use verbs properly
at age 15 , italian students rank below the oecd average literacy level and eurostat reports that italian has the lowest percentage of university graduates aged 30 - 34 in the european union
evening news bulletins are full of speakers and commentators making grammatical errors and even mispronouncing words
how could dante 's land become " ignorant " and will the government 's plans to institute yet another education reform succeed in turning some donkeys -- if not into nerds -- at least into smart pupils ? the decline in language skills is a trend affecting most of the western world , but the fact that this is happening in italian , home to some of the world 's oldest universities , is quite alarming
the romans built an empire united by the latin language , but italian seem to have lost such heritage
italian were once " literate " -- as in " latin - speakers and latin - writers " -- grammar - savvy , poetry lovers , rhetoric freaks and great philosophers
now they 've forgotten what a conjunctive verb is , mistake adjectives for nouns and write machiavelli with a double " c. " oh -- and they do n't know how to break words into syllables
true , one could say italian is a tough language , one of the most complex in the world
but that 's not a good excuse
the italian people 's declining knowledge of their language is turning into a national emergency
it 's not just lazy students who are responsible
the percentage of lawyers who every year flunk the written examination to become a judge is scary
when i attended university , the most dreaded exam of all was the essay on italian literature and history
few of my buddies passed it at the first go , others had to take it thrice and many just gave up
so how did we fall so low ? fine , ict , smartphones and sms are partly to blame
abbreviations , misspellings and the introduction of many english words into italian have impoverished language skills
yet on its own that explanation is too reductive
the loss of latin teaching in schools is at the root of the problem
learning latin assists in learning italian and other languages as well as opening the mind to all fields of knowledge
it 's been no secret across generations of scholars that being familiar with the complexity of latin phrase structure and idioms is positive for students
up until 1970 , latin was taught in primary and middle schools : kids learned to translate works by virgil without using a dictionary and to recite chunks of the " divine comedy " and poems by carducci , leopardi and manzoni
but today the teaching of latin is restricted to specific humanist and scientific high schools -- called gymnasiums or lyceums -- and at university level depending upon the faculty
the crisis has dealt a further blow to the love of classics
enrollment at classical lyceums , where also ancient greek is also taught , is low : only 31,860 out of a total 530,911 high school students have enrolled this academic year
desperate attempts by modern writers to revive classical culture by translating boccaccio 's " decameron " and machiavelli 's " the prince " into modern italian have n't produced great results
so far just one academy in rome -- vivarium novum -- has succeeded in bringing the " dead language " back from the grave
pupils here exclusively speak in latin and are kicked - out if they get caught saying a few words in italian
but the academy is an isolated case , looked upon as a bit " out of this world
" families think learning latin and greek is pointless because it wo n't help their kids find a job , which is wrong
the trouble is that students have already lost their memory
not in the literal sense , but symbolically
the " ars mnemonica " -- the art of exercising one 's memory , that boring yet useful technique which implies rote learning of phrases , lyrics , novels and even entire epics -- belongs to the past
if you do n't sharpen mental skills , how can there be good writing ? the truth is that italian education is badly in need of a restyle
a series of education reforms in the past few years has lowered the quality of teaching by reducing public resources and the hours of latin and italian language learning , which teaching unions say has had a negative impact on pupils ' text comprehension skills
latin teaching should be given more space but in a new way : not through useless translations ( what do kids care about seneca 's " treaty on birds ? " ) but through open debates and analyses on ancient texts that are still worthwhile studying today
and teachers should also get a makeover
if there are " bad " students it 's because there are also " bad " teachers
pupils want to read more than just one contemporary novel per month
they want teachers who are passionate about their jobs rather than lazily coasting towards retirement
language teaching depends on its appeal
and right now it 's not .
