one women even had a child with a former special branch detective who was tasked with infiltrating the animal liberation front in the 1980s
the unnamed woman only discovered her son 's father was the undercover policeman bob lambert in 2012 after he was outed by other campaigners
the woman , known as jacqui , received Â£ 425,000 in compensation from the metropolitan police last year
mrs may today published an independent review into whether the home office knew what was going with undercover police officers
it found there was no evidence the department was aware of undercover officers ' use of fake identities taken from dead children or the risk of officers forming relationships under false pretences with individuals they were spying on
the sds unit carried out undercover operations into 18 justice campaigns - including the families of jean charles de menezes ( left ) , who was shot by police after being mistaken for a terrorist , and the murdered black teenager stephen lawrence ( right ) in the official inquiry into undercover operations appeal court judge lord justice pitchford will have the power to compel witnesses to give evidence , said the home office
mrs may announced her intention to set up a judge - led public inquiry following the report of the independent ellison inquiry in march 2014 , which found that scotland yard had spied on the family of murdered black teenager stephen lawrence
and the separate police - led operation herne found that the now - defunct sds unit had carried out undercover operations to collect information on 18 justice campaigns over the course of 35 years - including that of jean charles de menezes , who was shot by police after being mistaken for a terrorist
scotland yard chief bernard hogan howe was forced to pay out more than Â£ 400,000 to a women who had a child with an undercover officer posing as a campaigner set up in 1968 to infiltrate pressure groups and operational until 2008 , the sds has been the focus of intense controversy in recent years over claims that undercover officers had sexual relationships and even fathered children with campaigners to help build trust in their false identities
announcing the pitchford inquiry , mrs may said : ' the work of mark ellison and operation herne has unearthed serious historical failings in undercover policing practices
as i said last year , i was profoundly shocked by mark ellison 's findings and committed to establishing a public inquiry to thoroughly investigate undercover policing and the operation of the sds
' i 'm delighted to announce today that lord justice pitchford has been appointed to lead the inquiry
' while i initially said that mark ellison 's further work and criminal investigations needed to conclude before the inquiry commences , it has become apparent that these pieces of work were much larger than initially envisaged
in the interest of learning the lessons of past failures , i have decided to establish the inquiry now while ensuring existing work is not affected
' undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public 's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future
' she added : ' operation herne has previously found that the home office was instrumental in the establishment of the sds in 1968 and that the department initially provided direct funding for the sds
' the permanent secretary commissioned taylor , former director at the audit commission , to establish the full extent of the home office 's knowledge of the sds
i 'm grateful for mr taylor 's report and will consider his findings carefully
