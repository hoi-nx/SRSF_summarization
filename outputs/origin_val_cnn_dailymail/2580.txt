mrs atkinson , an mep for the south east , has now been axed as the party 's candidate for folkestone and hythe in may âs election
the mep had hosted a women âs fringe event â attended by farage âs wife kirsten â during ukip âs spring conference in margate , kent , last month
the reception , where guests drank champagne , bellini cocktails and dozens of bottles of wine , allegedly cost Â£ 950 and was paid by mrs hewitt on a credit card
but 24 hours later , it is claimed , miss hewitt returned to the restaurant and asked the manager to give her an invoice for Â£ 3,150 so she could claim back a larger amount from brussels
she was allegedly filmed telling an undercover reporter from the sun : â the idea is we overcharge them slightly because that âs the way of repatriating [ the money ]
â mr farage this morning attacked mrs atkinson and the member of staff over the ploy
he told lbc : â i was deeply shocked when i saw it
i thought it was one of the most incredibly stupid and dishonest things i âve even seen in my life
â this was a member of staff
exactly what the relationship between the member of staff and the asking of the false bill and ukip i do nât know
we âve suspended ukip and we will hold a disciplinary hearing as soon as possible

' immigrants causing traffic jams farage : ' it took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here
it should have taken three - and - half to four
' that has nothing to do with professionalism
what is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof , chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the m4 is not as navigable as it used to be
' general secretary sex scandal ukip general secretary roger bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate natasha bolter in december
he claimed they slept together , she denied it

the ukip leader added : â it would be mistake for me to pre-judge this but on the evidence of what that member of staff did , it does not look good
â he said he had asked her â what on earth is going on â when he called but did not get a clear answer
mr farage said : â they have asked a commercial enterprise to do something which is against the law
â i was shocked i simply could nât believe we could potentially find ourselves in this position
â mrs atkinson who last year caused outrage after she called a thai woman constituent a â ting tong â , had been due to stand the general election
but a ukip spokesman said last night : â the party is incredibly disappointed with ms atkinson , who appears to have exercised extremely poor judgment in acting in a way that the party has never , and would never condone
' the spokesman added : ' the party has acted swiftly and immediately , and just as we showed when we suspended another mep for financial irregularities , we always maintain a zero - tolerance attitude towards acts of this nature
â mr farage , a candidate for nearby thanet south , told the telegraph last night : â if what she has been suspended for is right , i am astonished she could have done something quite so stupid
' it looks like a claim that was nât made , i am pleased to say , but a claim that was intended to be made that may not have been as genuine as perhaps it should have been
â it is understood mrs atkinson and miss hewitt have been reported to kent police and the eu anti-fraud office
mrs farage is not thought to have been aware of the incident and is not accused of any wrongdoing
mrs atkinson was elected as an mep last year after joining ukip in 2011
on top of a salary of close to Â£ 80,000 , she is able to claim for expenses from the public purse
the 52 - year - old found herself in trouble last year after she was recorded by tv cameras calling the wife of a ukip supporter â a ting tong from somewhere â
she insisted the comments were naive rather than malicious and said she was â incredibly sorry â for offending the woman
in december it emerged that she owed more than Â£ 2,000 in child support to her ex-husband , despite previously criticising â feckless families â who have more children than they can afford
she has also been pictured sticking up her middle finger to a camera and was accused of swearing at protesters
folkestone and hythe is seen as a safe conservative seat , although mrs atkinson was a high - profile candidate
the latest problem for ukip came after mr farage renewed warnings that he expected a â very dirty , nasty â election campaign and urged his party to â turn the other cheek â
mr farage spoke in rochester , kent , where he welcomed former medway tory councillors tom mason and vaughan hewett to ukip to stand in may 's local elections .
