hopping mad or toadly awesome ? a japan nature museum is launching a bizarre menu to celebrate the opening of their deadly poison exhibition
the ' frog menu ' signature dish will feature a deep fried amphibian , sandwiched between a black bun burger , complete with legs dangling out the side
guests will be able to see 25 live different poisonous animals from around the world at yokohama , in south toyko , before heading to the cafe to devour a frog of their own
thankfully the frog is less toxic than its exhibition counterparts , and the black bun can be attributed to a bamboo charcoal dye
orbi yokohama is not the first place to use the dark bun , with burger king in japan launching a range in 2014
if the protruding legs of this dish are enough to put you off , guests can always sample the tamer frog egg sweet for 580 yen ( Â£ 3.17 )
this dessert dish incorporates a family theme , with a frog and ' spawn ' - thankfully only made out of almond tofu and jelly
sega and the sunshine aquarium have teamed up to bring the exhibition to the museum in yokohama from march 21 to may 17
the frog egg sweet dessert includes a frog and eggs
the dish costs 580 yen ( Â£ 3.17 ) and thankfully is only made out of almond tofu and jelly
other poisonous animals at the exhibition include spiders , stingrays , puffer fish and other animals
admission to orbi yokohama is 600 yen ( Â£ 3.28 ) , frog burger not included
