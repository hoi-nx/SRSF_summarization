if you ca nât get rid of your pot belly , no matter how hard you try , blame your plexin d1 gene
scientists believe the gene tells fat to gather around the middle , rather than the bottom and thighs
in other words , it influences whether someone is an â apple â , with a big tummy , or a â pear â , who widens out below the waist
it raises the possibility of pills that stop fat from being stored around the waist â meaning an end to pot bellies and muffin tops
apple - shaped : scientists have discovered that a gene called plexin d1 influences whether a person is an ' apple ' , with a big belly , or a ' pear ' with fat on their hips and thighs and the benefits would nât just be cosmetic
the discovery of the â apple - shape â gene is important because being an â apple â who stores fat around the middle is worse for health than being a â pear â
unlike the fat that pads out pear - shapes , belly fat wraps around the body âs vital organs and produces hormones and other chemicals that tamper with blood pressure , cholesterol , blood sugar levels
as a result it raises the risk of a host of health problems including heart disease , diabetes and strokes
to get to the bottom of how fat is stored , the us researchers studied zebra fish , tiny tropical fish whose transparent bodies make it see their inner workings
by using a dye that turned fat cells fluorescent , they showed that fish without a gene called plexin d1 stored less fat around their abdomen than usual
muffin top : fat around the middle is dangerous to health as it wraps itself around vital organs , and raises the risk of health problems including heart disease , diabetes and strokes instead , the fat was stored in more a pear - shaped pattern , the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences reports
the fish without apple - shape gene were also better at processing sugar â something that should cut the odds of diabetes
with the plexin d1 - 1 gene thought to have a similar role in people , the research paves the way for a drug that stops people from growing big bellies
researcher dr james minchin , of duke university , in north carolina , said that this could also be good for health .
