you could say that luke has followed in his father âs flight path
the 24 - year - old became an airline pilot just like his father , john , and the pair achieved a major milestone today they flew their first commercial flight together
it was a proud moment for the father - son duo , who work for luton - based monarch and were behind the controls as they flew passengers from birmingham to turin , italy
john sharples ( left ) and son luke flew their first commercial flight together with monarch john served as captain and luke as first officer on the flight , which was made even more special by the fact that it coincided with john âs 56th birthday
thanks to his father âs job luke was given access to places that most children can only dream of , and it led him on a path towards becoming a pilot
he said : â dad really is my inspiration when it comes to flying
aviation was all i knew from a young age
â the house was full of books that were either flying related or an aviation manual of some kind
i started logging flying hours towards my pilot âs license from the age of 14 and i was flying before i could drive
â john sharples ( right ) served as captain while his son , luke , was his first officer on the flight he added : â i was very fortunate to have seen so much of the world and industry growing up , going away on trips with dad and back then , before the " locked flight deck door " policy , i was sat in the flight deck watching it all first hand
' i âve tried other jobs in different industries but nothing compares to flying
â luke wears a pilot 's uniform as a boy the father - son flight occurred nearly 25 years to the day that luke was born
that night , john was a pilot on a monarch flight from madrid to london âs gatwick and joined his wife at the hospital just 15 minutes before luke arrived
during the flight he received a call from operations staff , who asked him when the aircraft would be landing
he thought the question was unusual until he landed at gatwick and learned that his wife , liz , was in labour
john said : â unbeknown to me operations had kindly arranged for a taxi to be waiting to whisk me to the hospital where luke was born 15 minutes after i arrived
â john joined monarch from british midland in 1986 and has flown its fleet of boeing 757s and 767s
when monarch âs 757s were retired last year , he flew one of the final three planes remaining from mallorca to birmingham
luke obtained his private pilot licence in 2007 at the age of 17 and later studied in new zealand before he joined monarch as a cadet on its airbus a320 and 321 fleet in 2012
they were able to fly together after john retrained on the british carrier 's airbus a320 fleet
the pair 's first commercial flight together , from birmingham to turin , coincided with john 's 56th birthday john said : â what a unique and wonderful way to celebrate my 56th birthday
this flight will be a little strange for me in that i am still quite new to this type of aircraft , although i have over 21,000 flying hours
â luke will be the more experienced pilot on the airbus a320
i will be expecting some constructive criticism
â luke added : â it has been an aspiration to be able to fly with him
it has taken a long time and a lot of luck but finally i can tick off one of my major life goals
â knowing how hard and long i have worked for this opportunity to fly with my dad makes it very exciting
