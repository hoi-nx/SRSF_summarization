traditional british cooker manufacturer aga , favoured by tv chefs mary berry and nigella lawson , has today launched in china with a brand new feature : a wok burner
taking the leap into the new market is arguably the biggest gamble the firm , which has been selling ovens in british since 1929 , has ever made
most chinese kitchens have just two gas hobs and , if they have an oven at all , it is usually cheap and the size of a microwave
gamble : aga has been selling cookers in british since 1929 and launching in china is seen as a big gamble
wong ( front ) , aga âs director of business development in china , said shifting eating habits among the country âs rich influenced the company âs decision to launch there british staple : aga is a favourite of merry berry and nigella lawson
even the pm has one of the firm 's cookers in his kitchen but aga is targeting the country 's new middle class and chief executive mcgrath told mailonline he was confident he could convince people to spend between Â£ 5,400 and Â£ 27,000 on the british favourite
the launch was announced in 2012 , but due to china âs unfamiliarity with ovens and laws about accreditation for them , it was derailed
accreditation rules have been re-drafted by authorities and now , three years later , agas are finally available to order
mr mcgrath , speaking in beijing ahead of the official launch event , conceded that the cookers could just become popular with a â small niche market connecting with expats in china â
however , he said that it was worth the risk because if they prove popular with the country âs 1.35 billion population it will be a â game changer â for the firm
â we âre quietly confident , and that comes from talking to people in the industry as well as consumers , â he said
â the answer to whether it âll work seems to be , â it âs definitely worth a go â
but nobody is saying this is definitely going to work
â aga products are synonymous with cosy comfort food such as sunday roasts and victoria sponges
the prince of wales , david cameron , delia smith and even jeremy clarkson , who was dropped by the bbc this week , own one
despite the company 's rich british history , it has teamed up with china - based firm beijing hi seasons for the rollout and mr mcgrath said he âs hoping that families in china will use the cookers to make traditional chinese food
aga chief executive mcgrath ( pictured ) denied that succeeding in china was essential for the company but added : â we want to win some away games ' cooker model : british fashion model daisy lowe was enlisted to advertise the popular cooker , which has not launched in asia as such , the aga models being launched in china resemble those available in british but with a crucial difference : a wok burner on top
china âs new moneyed middle class has a huge appetite for western luxury brands , from chanel clothes to land rovers
wong , aga âs director of business development in china , told mailonline that shifting eating habits among the country âs rich also influenced the company âs decision to launch there
â five years ago in china , when people got money they just dined out in expensive restaurants , â he said
â but affluent people have started cooking at home more , showing off to friends , saying : â i can cook â
we âve seen a rise in cooking schools and sales of cooking magazines
â nobel prize - winning physicist dr dalã©n invented the world 's first heat - storage cooker in 1922
after a failed experiment cost him his sight , the doting husband wanted to make a better appliance for his wife elma
according to the aga website , dr dalã©n created a cast - iron cooker capable of every kind of cooking simultaneously , with two large hotplates and two ovens
the aga was invented and by 1929 , manufacturing was underway at the aga heat ltd factory in smethwick
agas are now made at the company 's shropshire foundry in coalbrookdale and are still made by pouring molten iron into moulds
however the modern cookers contain state - of - the - art technology
aga 's history dates back to 1929
this picture , taken in 1968 , shows two children at the ideal home exhibition can you really do every kind of cooking that there is ? this advert was published in a 1955 edition of punch magazine a cascade of recent high - profile food safety scandals in china has also contributed to a rise in home cooking , as confidence in restaurant standards has dropped
although aga sales were up in 2014 in the british , the company is reaching near saturation point in the country â after all , you âre only likely to buy an aga once
last year the company , which produced its millionth rangemaster cooker this month , released a slimline city60 model aimed at british city dwellers in an attempt to find new buyers
mr mcgrath denied that succeeding in china was essential for the company but added : â we want to win some away games
' china and germany , where we âre also expanding , are fascinating because they âre outside of our comfort zone
â consumer analyst paul french recently told the financial times : â in china , if you have the kind of money to spend on an aga , you generally have someone who cooks for you
â but mr wong and mr mcgrath said that the aga is billed as a family - orientated product and this would chime well in the country
the aga models being launched in china resemble those available in british but with a crucial difference : a wok burner on top british : aga has been selling these popular ovens in british since 1929 but hopes to break into the asia market â now , in china , the generation that earns money does nât just leave behind their parents , â mr wong said
â they bring them back home
so we see families with one kid , two kids , together with grandparents , and chinese love family gatherings
â another potential pitfall for the aga is the risk of copycat manufacturers ripping them off and undercutting them
trademark , copyright and patent abuse in china is often flagrant , and it seems inevitable that if aga takes off , knock - off products with similar names will start popping up
â we âre just going to concentrate on pushing our brand really hard , â said mr mcgrath
â we know those stories [ of rip - off products ] are a concern for everyone , but you âve got to go with what you know
this brand has stood for 90 years because it stands for something
â while it âs hugely ambitious to try to get a generation of chinese to ditch cooking traditions that stretch back generations , mr mcgrath said that if the gamble pays off , he âll set his sites on conquering the rest of asia
â china could be an entry point to asia , â he said
â if it works here it âd obviously follow on to look at other markets here
