it was hugs all round and a few curtsies too when the dutch ' king willem-alexander and queen maxima arrived in danish this morning
waiting at copenhagen 's kastrup airport was the scandinavian country 's 74 - year - old monarch , margrethe , her husband prince henrik , 80 and their son crown prince , 46
but queen maxima , glamorous in a grey coat by dutch designer claes iversen , had serious competition in the style stakes from australia - born crown princess mary , 43 , who was elegant in a nude coat and purple pillbox hat
also on hand to welcome the dutch royals at kastrup airport 's private royal terminal were other members of the danish royal family , among them crown prince 's younger brother prince joachim
45 - year - old prince joachim 's french wife princess marie was also there and wore an ensemble that echoed her sister - in - law 's
queen margrethe , who along with elizabeth ii , is one of the world 's only queens regnant , then led the way out of the airport , escorted by king willem-alexander
the dutch royals are at the start of a three - day state visit to danish , aimed at strengthening links between the two countries
unsurprisingly , the programme is a busy one , with queen maxima and king willem-alexander set to criss - cross the country over the next couple of days

afterwards , the royal couple will travel north to aalborg in north jutland where they will attend a conference at the city 's university before flying back to copenhagen for a reception at the christiansborg palace
tomorrow will see them visit the carbon - neutral sams達存 island , accompanied by crown prince and his wife crown princess mary , to visit a special type of danish boarding school called an efterskole
most danish teenagers spend at least a year at the state boarding schools , where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music
the efterskole on sams達存 focuses on aquatic sports , diving , aviation and golf , with pupils due to give the royal party , among them sport - mad crown prince , a tour of the school

a second programme , this time being made for australia 's channel ten , could also cause some discomfort , thanks to claims that crown princess mary had had second thoughts in the run - up to her 2004 wedding
by contrast , queen maxima and king willem-alexander have enjoyed a smooth ride of late , with queen maxima in particular becoming increasingly popular
one of the most glamorous royals in europe , the argentina - born mother - of - three has proved a hit with her dutch subjects , thanks in no small part to her charity work
she will have plenty of opportunity to do more of that during this week 's state visit , with a trip to bispebjerg hospital also on their itinerary
