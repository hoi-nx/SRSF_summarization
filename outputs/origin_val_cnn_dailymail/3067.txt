szczesny can regain his place as arsenal number one if he dedicates himself completely to the task , according to former double - winning goalkeeper wilson
the poland international is expected to feature in the fa cup quarter - final at manchester united on monday night , provided he recovers from the virus which stopped him from being on the bench for the midweek barclays premier league win at qpr
szczesny , 24 , has not started a league game since the 2 - 0 defeat at southampton on new year 's day , where he was culpable for the goals and afterwards was also caught smoking in the showers
that indiscretion resulted in a fine from the club
szczesny ( right ) has not started a game for arsenal since southampton on new year 's day the polish shot - stopper has been ousted by ospina ( right ) but is likely to play on monday night despite colombian ospina making the most of his opportunities in recent weeks , wilson , part of the gunners ' 1971 league and fa cup - winning side , still believes 6ft 5in szczesny has what it takes to cement a regular place between the posts once more
' from the time szczesny got into the arsenal first team there were a lot who asked if he was good enough and i thought , " this boy has the potential to really be a solid , outstanding goalkeeper "
i still believe that because he is - for his position - still relatively young , ' wilson said
' all i would a say to him is " look , arsenal is one of the greatest football clubs
if you go from here i am not sure you are ever going to get a club as good as this
at your age now you need to dedicate yourself to being the best you can be , to the exclusion of a lot of other things in your life "
' former arsenal goalkeeper wilson says szczesny must work hard to regain his place in the team ospina has made the most of his opportunity , tying down the no 1 goalkeeping position at the emirates wilson recalled : ' i was a very late starter , but once i was in the arsenal side , my family almost came second to my ambition
' i devoted every moment to regular training and then when the boys went in for their bath , i stayed out [ on the field ]
' i wanted to make sure i never ever left the game saying i could have been better , so my message to wojciech would be " come on , prove how good you can be "
' gunners boss wenger is confident szczesny , who has played in arsenal 's last two fa cup ties , will be sharp if selected again
wenger ( centre ) will have a tough choice on his hands if szczesny ( right ) impresses in the fa cup ' wojciech is used to playing in big games and i think he will take that as a big challenge to show his quality , ' the gunners boss said
' he works very hard in training , so i do n't think that will be a problem
' arsenal head to old trafford in search for a first win there since september 2006 , but on the back of good league form
wenger said : ' we are the holders of the fa cup , this competition is important to us and we want to go there to produce a result
