a freshman basketball player with rare brain cancer who made it through full season despite being given only a few months to live is now having problems swallowing as her condition worsens
during her senior year of high school , hill was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ) , a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 per cent
but she still made it through a full season at the cincinnati university while raising more than $ 1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor she has
she posted : ' hill sleeps about 12 hours a day and still does not like to take naps
' her appetite is not as big as it use to be
she has been having increased issues with swallowing
we had to add some thickener to her water to make it easier to swallow
food we cut down into bite sizes these days to prevent chocking
' diagnosed : during her senior year of high school , hill ( left and right ) was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ) , a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent she said her daughter 's pain medication has been increased to help her deal with headaches and aches across her body
she added : ' she still has a sense of humor even if her legs give out and she falls
my favorite quote of the week ...
" i did n't fall , i gracefully assaulted the floor
" got to love her
' despite the diagnosis , hill decided to attend college and play for the division iii school
in september 2014 , hill 's doctor told her she would not live past december , fox reports
but hill drastically defied expectations
she played four basketball games with her team early in the season , making five layups
as her condition worsened , she became an honorary coach , attending games when possible
she tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often
the ncaa granted permission to move up the school 's opening game because of her worsening condition , and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at xavier university 's 10,000 - seat arena
the team : the mount st. joseph 's women 's basketball team ( pictured ) held its postseason banquet in a hospital room with hill the team had planned to have its annual end - of - the - season banquet on feb. 22 â a date that matches hill 's uniform number â but the final game got pushed back because of the weather
hill was getting treated at cincinnati children 's hospital
so the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital , using a meeting room
instead of having a big meal and awards , the players got sandwiches and spent time together
' we were going to get something to eat , show up , talk about the season and celebrate being with each other , ' benjamin said
the team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at xavier 's arena
the ncaa prohibits schools from giving gifts to players , so they bought them for $ 22 , another way to support hill 's fundraising for cancer research
hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet
in a recent interview with wkrc-tv , hill said , ' life is precious
... every moment you get with someone is a moment that 's blessed , really blessed
' life : doctors did n't expect hill ( center at hospital ) to live this long with the tumor , which folds around parts of her brain
