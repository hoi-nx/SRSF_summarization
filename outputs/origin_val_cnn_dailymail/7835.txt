whoever agreed to schedule villa âs fa cup quarter - final with baggies at 5.30 on a saturday evening showed a dangerous lack of foresight
it seems nobody at the fa , the bbc , the clubs or west midlands police seriously considered that trouble might follow a day off work when fans of the two local rivals had all afternoon to drink
that miscalculation contributed significantly to scenes described by several former players as from the 1970s â pitch invasions , seats ripped out and used as weapons , players barged and forced to fight their way to the sanctuary of the dressing rooms
police clash with unruly fans in scenes reminiscent of the of the 1970s following villa 's fa cup defeat of baggies baggies players look concerned as villa fans invade the pitch at the end of their fa cup quarter final villa fans celebrate by racing on to the pitch following their 2 - 0 victory over baggies at holte end fans of both villa and baggies behaved irresponsibly and have been condemned by their own clubs
but it is clear questions need to be asked about the way matches that carry the potential to be â tasty â , as tony pulis described this fixture , are arranged
in the past , police have insisted derbies kick off early in the day
in this instance , the local force claim it was out of their hands , with the decision down to the fa
sources at english football âs governing body say scheduling is a collaborative effort , including police guidance
the wishes of broadcasters play a huge part and evening slots are good for ratings
it is the reason some arsenal fans will find it impossible to get back to london from manchester by train
insufficient numbers of police and stewards attempted to deal with the hundreds who invaded the field of play police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after villa booked their place in the semi-finals villa fans leap over hoardings at the final whistle - while the decision to stage the game at 5.30pm is being questioned but the bbc , who reportedly paid up to Â£ 120million for the rights to show the world âs oldest competition over four years , declined to accept responsibility
a spokesman said : â both baggies and villa , along with the police , agreed to the kick - off time and raised no objections
â if this was a ball rather than the buck , villa boss tim sherwood would be pleased at how quickly it was being passed
following the match , the national lead officer for football policing appeared on bbc radio 5live , and he questioned the decision to play the match on a weekend evening
' saturday night football is here to stay , we appreciate that , friday night football is due to be coming in , ' he said
baggies manager had described the midlands derby fixture as ' tasty ' ahead of the game baggies goalkeeper boaz myhill is mocked by an villa fan following the home side 's second goal ' when you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play
all games have potential ( for crowd trouble ) but clearly some games have more potential than others
' they are big clubs , not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture , late on a weekend in particular , alcohol is a factor
' if you give people four , five , six hours more drinking time , do n't be surprised if in a highly - charged atmosphere , their behaviour is n't good
' broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously
' what we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately
if you look at the four games for the fa cup quarter - finals this week , you could n't probably have picked a worse one to have on a saturday tea - time than a local derby between two big clubs
' the baggies goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full - time whistle scorer sinclair ( second left ) is mobbed by a fan and team - mates ashley westwood and jack grealish fans sing and chant on the pitch following villa 's win during what has been a disappointing season baggies sources suggested the kick - off time did cause concern but no formal objection was made
similar timings have been used before for derbies but with 6,500 baggies fans travelling across town on saturday â significantly more than usual â the risk of trouble was surely increased
villa face the prospect of a fine in the region of Â£ 100,000 for failing to adequately control hundreds of fans who ran on to the pitch before referee anthony taylor blew for full - time
the top - end punishment would be a partial stadium closure
the fa have launched an investigation and will ask why only a dozen or so stewards were at the holte end corner where villa fans burst on to the pitch , causing a two - minute delay
there had been invasions after both goals and the final 60 seconds were played out with a mass of people congregated on the sidelines
thousands spilled on when villa âs win was confirmed
many were in a celebratory mood , wishing to hug their players , even if first goalscorer fabian delph was inadvertently bitten by fans overly eager to plant a kiss
on this basis , pitch invasions have been previously celebrated
but there was a sinister undercurrent too
many wanted to goad beaten opponents
baggies goalkeeper boaz myhill was repeatedly shoved in a confrontational manner
a group encircled him , filming on their mobiles
he picked one phone up and chucked it away
villa players leandro bacuna ( centre ) and jack grealish ( right ) are mobbed by fans after the game goalscorer fabian delph claims fans nicked his captain 's armband as well as his left boot during the invasion baggies forward callum mcmanaman is escorted off the field after a row with an villa fan callum mcmanaman had to be shepherded to safety after an altercation with a villa fan left him shaken , while sub keeper ben foster had a finger pushed in his face
even those who feel pitch invasions can joyously mark a momentous occasion must recognise the inherent danger of saturday night
during the 93rd - minute surge those who remained in their seats booed loudly
former villa striker stan collymore said on talksport : â absolute disgrace , drunken yobs besmirching the name of villa
â mark lawrenson , commentating on the bbc , said : â there are not enough stewards at the holte end
it âs like a scene from the 1980s all over again
â an villa supporter is escorted off by stewards after invading the pitch before full time sinclair is crowded by villa supporters after scoring his goal in the 2 - 0 victory there appeared to be almost three times as many stewards at the other end , forming a line in front of the north stand housing baggies fans above those supporting villa
those seating arrangements have been questioned after one fan was left with a bloody wound when a seat ripped from the tier above hit him on the head
kevin phillips , who played for both clubs , said : â seeing those seats come down , it could kill someone
those people should be found and banned
â a baggies statement read : â the club is aware of reports of serious misbehaviour involving some of its own supporters
it issues an uncompromising reminder that any supporter found guilty of disorder can expect the appropriate sanction from the club
we will continue to operate zero tolerance to any fans who bring the club âs reputation into disrepute
â privately , baggies were perplexed about the seating arrangements
a match against fierce rivals from across town , finishing as night descended , was always going to carry an edge
villa manager tim sherwood admitted he could understand the fans ' emotions after the victory the pitch at holte end can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass also of concern will be coins thrown at craig gardner as he took corners
baggies chairman jeremy peace is said to have left holte end in a rage
no injuries have been reported to west midlands police , who said 17 arrests had been made for public order as well as drunk and disorderly offences
chief superintendent chris johnson said a probe had also been launched to identify people involved in a disturbance before the match at the witton arms pub , down the road from holte end
stadium cctv will be studied as will any footage obtained from the police helicopter
but those investigating should look at themselves
villa fans celebrate victory on the pitch after what has been a highlight of a lacklustre season villa supporter mark villers needed his hair cut and wound glued together on saturday night
