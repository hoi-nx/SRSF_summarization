giroud strutted out of st james ' park and was the last player to board arsenal 's team bus , having been first to pretty much everything else for his team during a hard - earned win on tyneside
it brought two more goals for the france against newcastle
that 's 17 in 26 games this season and 10 in his last 12 , one of the best strike rates in europe
while harry kane is cherished by supporters down the road at tottenham , some arsenal fans have yet to embrace giroud fully
the statistics speak for themselves , however
arsenal striker giroud has been dubbed ' world class ' by his manager arsene wenger the france scored two goals for arsenal as the gunners ran out 2 - 1 winners against newcastle arsene wenger believes that giroud has developed significantly since joining arsenal back in 2012 giroud now has eight goals in six games against newcastle , including scoring with all five headers on target against them in the premier league
and even though giroud is 29 in september , arsene wenger believes the best is yet to come from a 6ft 4in striker who developed late and was still playing lower league football in france as recently as 2010
asked if giroud is world - class , arsene wenger said : ' i think so and he is scoring the goals to prove it
but i believe there is still room for improvement
' technically , he is a much better player than he was
his touch , his link play , his finishing , they have all improved
if you saw footage of him when he first arrived and now , it is obvious he is a better player
' he is a fighter as well and a player with good mental strength
at 22 or 23 he played in division three in france , and now he is at arsenal
' giroud is refusing to write off arsenal 's chances of a late push for the premier league title this season giroud 's goals gave arsenal a sixth straight league win and kept them on the fringe of the title race
but you wonder how much closer they would be had he not spent three months on the sidelines after breaking his leg at everton in august
arsene wenger 's side won only three of nine league games in his absence
while retaining the fa cup would appear to represent their best chance of a trophy this season , the former montpellier man has not given up the title chase just yet
' we need to win every game and that 's what we want to do â step by step , ' said giroud
' you never know if city or chelsea will miss one of these steps
we 've got to be here with great belief and faith
' giroud 's brace against newcastle has brought his tally for the season up to 17 goals in 26 games arsenal still had to hold on in the face of a fierce second - half fightback from newcastle that revived memories of a famous 4 - 4 draw in 2011
it was not enough to prevent a third defeat in a row for the home side , placing even more importance on the forthcoming tyne-wear derby with sunderland
having admitted in the build - up to this game that he expects a clear - out of players in the summer , caretaker boss john carver is already looking forward to some of the big signings coming through the door
' without naming any names , i 've seen some of the players they are talking about and i 'm quite excited about them , ' said john carver
' it 's major work that has to be done , we know that
i know the type of players the fans like and they 're the ones on the list , absolutely
' newcastle head coach john carver insists that the club will strengthen their squad with top players
