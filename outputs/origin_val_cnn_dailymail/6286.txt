investigators searching for the gunman who shot two police officers in ferguson , missouri , were no closer friday to arresting anyone , and a top police official admitted that he was no longer sure if the shooter specifically targeted cops
st louis county police chief belmar appeared to have stepped back from his earlier statement , in which he described the attack in no uncertain terms as ' an ambush ' on ferguson 's police force
belmar also told reporters friday that he ' honestly could n't tell you for sure ' whether the mystery shooter was associated with the protesters who were picketing the ferguson police department wednesday night
' i can not tell you at this point that an arrest is imminent
there is certainly nobody in custody , ' belmar said
' when we get to the point where we feel like we have active leads , if we can do anything through you to have the community assist us , we will certainly let you know
' ferguson hit the headlines in august when a white policeman fatally shot unarmed black teenager brown , setting off protests that spread to major cities across the american and triggered a national debate about police tactics , especially in relation to americans

wednesday night 's shooting came hours after ferguson 's embattled police chief thomas jackson resigned
the city manager and municipal judge have also quit
one of the police officers was hit in the face , the other in the shoulder , sparking a manhunt for those responsible and putting the flashpoint town on edge once more
neither police officer was seriously hurt , and both have since been released from the hospital
in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , chief belmar told reporters the officers , a 41 - year - old county police officer and a 32 - year - old colleague from a nearby police department , were attacked ' just because they were police officers ' by someone ' embedded ' among the protesters
he added : ' i would have to make an assumption that these shots were directed exactly at my police officers

the chief also said during the press conference that the department has received more than two dozen tips , although he conceded that not too many people saw what exactly happened that night
