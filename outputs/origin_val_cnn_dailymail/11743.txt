claim : dragons â den star jones revealed he limits his children âs pocket money to Â£ 25 a month his work ethic has seen him build a business portfolio worth millions of pounds
and it seems dragons â den star jones implements the same principles at home
yesterday the business tycoon , 48 , revealed he limits his children âs pocket money to Â£ 25 a month - and expects them to earn it through household chores
he said he has also told them he wo nât be funding their first homes , but will reward money they earn themselves with contributions
giving an interview , in which he also criticised the national curriculum for not teaching children business skills , jones said : â my pocket money is based on incentive
it âs like , â you âve got to clean your room , to get this , â and if they do nât do it , they do nât get the money
it âs a bone of contention
â another prickly topic of conversation , no doubt , will be that jones , who is worth an estimated Â£ 475 million , has told his children he will not be buying their first homes
instead , he said will reward them by making small contributions on top of whatever they earn themselves , but offer nothing if they do nât make money
he said : â i want my kids to be polite and respectful , stand on their own two feet
in the future if they want to go and do charitable work , then i âll fund that charitable work
i âve said that rather than me buying them a house , i âll give them a contribution on top of what they deliver
so if they earn Â£ 20,000 a year , i âll give them a tiny contribution on top
if they decide not to work , they do nât get anything
i want them to do it for themselves
â jones and his partner tara have three daughters : natalia , 12 , isabella , 10 , and talula , nine
his two eldest children , annabelle , 22 , and william , 18 , from his marriage to ex-wife caroline â are now both older than he was when he set up his first company , a tennis coaching academy , aged 17
jones â extensive business portfolio includes technology website expansys , gifts company red letter days , and the re-launched camera chain , jessops
and he has also established an entrepreneurs â foundation for schools , after growing frustrated at the lack of business training in the national curriculum
speaking to radio times about the foundation , jones said schools are â obsessed â with times tables but fail to teach children about entrepreneurialism
jones said he has also told his children he wo nât be funding their first homes , but will reward money they earn themselves with contributions he said : â i âve been campaigning as much as i can
i âve been an advocate for ten years now , across two governments â first with gordon brown , then with david cameron â on enterprise , and really encouraging , pushing , cajoling , to do everything we can to embed enterprise in our national curriculum , and i continue to be disappointed that we just pay lip service to the issue
we talk about going back to basics , and we talk about times tables
we âre far too obsessed with times tables
â jones added that while â it is important for us to be able to add up , obviously , we take it as read that our kids should be able to do that â , it should also be â taken as read â that children are taught about entrepreneurism as well
