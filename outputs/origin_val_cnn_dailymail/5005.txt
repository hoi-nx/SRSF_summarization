there had been a question about whether prosecutors would call shayanna , who has been in a relationship with hernandez , 25 , since high school and is the mother of his two - year - old daughter
on friday morning , she told the judge and lawyers during a session without the jury present that she had spoken with hernandez after she found out about the murder of semiprofessional football player odin lloyd

' i do n't really remember the size
' when she found it , she found hernandez and gave him a ' stern look ' - but did n't remember having any conversation about the firearm
later , the gun was gone
it was the only gun she had seen at her home , she said
miss shayanna was then asked if the gun she had seen in the junk drawer was the same as hernandez was allegedly seen on surveillance camera holding by his basement door
shayanna told the court that she could n't be sure if her fiancÃ©e was holding a gun , as it looked like a ' black blob '
assistant district attorney mccauley held up a glock in the courtroom , and shayanna said it was similar in color and shape , but she was unsure how it compared in size
shayanna furrowed her brow when the weapon was brought close to her and asked if the gun had been secured
