spacewalking astronauts who ventured out for the third time in just over a week on sunday have completed an extensive , tricky cable job at the international space station
but , dramatically , right before sunday 's spacewalk , engineers spotted problems with american astronaut wilmore 's suit
while it had functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks , on sunday morning , a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out
mission control told wilmore that he would need to pay extra attention to how his suit was feeling throughout the seven - hour excursion
meanwhile , nasa said a small amount of water got into american astronaut terry virts helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurized on wednesday
they were forced to spend two days analyzing his suit after the water leak occurred at the end of an outing earlier this week
engineers concluded it was the result of condensation , and a safe and well understood circumstance that had occurred several times before with the same spacesuit
terry virts was never in danger , according to nasa , so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks , friday , to install cable
but in 2013 , another astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet
duties : nasa said another main part of the astronauts task was to route 400 feet ( 121 meters ) of cable leak : in this file image made from video provided by nasa , astronaut terry virts points to his helmet as he sits inside the international space station on wednesday , feb. 25 , 2015 , during an inspection for water in his suit
virts reported the water while he waited in the air lock for wednesday 's spacewalk to formally conclude spacewalk : nasa on friday cleared virts ' spacesuit , pictured , for the last of three spacewalks to install cable italian astronaut , luca parmitano , barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk
the water escaped from his suit 's cooling system and nasa spent months investigating the mishap , before clearing the way for more spacewalks
on wednesday , the amount of water seepage in virts ' helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when terry virts was already inside
' they 're very different occurrences , ' said alex kanelakos , a spacewalk officer in mission control
cable : american astronauts terry virts and wilmore had 400 more feet of power and data cable , as well as two antennas which they installed sunday astronaut : terry virts is seen during the third spacewalk outside the international space station sunday during the six hour , 45 minute outing , they plan to set up antennas and communications equipment nasa : astronaut terry virts , left , and wilmore began the spacewalk at 6:52 am ( 1152 gmt ) when completed the work will allow future crews launching from florida on american commercial spacecraft to be able to park at the space station the advance work , involving nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks was carried out to create new crew capsules commissioned by nasa
the work done by american astronauts virts and wilmore meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed , as well as two antennas installed on sunday
a pair of docking ports will fly up later this year , followed by the capsules themselves , with astronauts aboard , in 2017
the astronauts successfully routed 364 feet on their first two excursions , on february 21 and last wednesday
they carried out complicated work sunday , yet the astronauts completed their task an hour early making it a five and a half - hour spacewalk
they spent 20 hours altogether on three outings
neither virts nor wilmore experienced any more suit trouble during their task
mission control joked by radio : ' you guys have done an outstanding job even for two shuttle pilots
' the 260 - mile ( 418 - kilometre ) spacewalk unfolded 50 years to the month of the world 's first spacewalk by soviet cosmonaut alexei leonov on march 18 , 1965
nasa has n't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days , and the amount of cable work is unprecedented

wilmore is due to return to earth next week following a five and a half - month mission
virts is midway through his expedition
a russian soyuz spacecraft carried them both up , with nasa paying for the multimillion dollar tickets
to save money and stop being so reliant on the russian space agency , nasa has hired boeing and spacex to develop spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the space station
the two contracts are worth nearly $ 7 billion
spacex already is delivering cargo under a separate agreement with nasa .
