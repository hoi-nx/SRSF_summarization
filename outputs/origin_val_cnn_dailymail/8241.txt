jigsaw enthusiasts each have their own method of tackling a tricky puzzle - some start with the edges while others work sections of the image at a time
but the latest design will test even the most methodical puzzler
each of the 1,000 pieces in the ' 1000 colours ' puzzle is a completely different colour to the next and they have to be placed according to the cmyk system
' 1000 colours ' ( show ) was designed by illustrator clemens habicht
each of its 1,000 pieces are a different colour on the cmyk system
cmyk refers to cyan , magenta , yellow , and key ( black ) inks used in printing cmyk refers to the four inks typically used in colour printing - cyan , magenta , yellow , and key or black
the puzzle was designed by paris - based graphic artist clemens habicht
mr clemens habicht said : ' the idea came from enjoying the subtle differences in the blue of a sky in a particularly brutal jigsaw puzzle
' i found that without the presence of image detail to help locate a piece , i was relying only on an intuitive sense of colour

' unlike ordinary puzzles where you are in effect redrawing a specific picture from a reference , you have a sense of where every piece belongs compared to every other piece , ' mr clemens habicht said ' and this was much more satisfying to do than the areas with image details

however , researchers have revealed that under certain conditions , the retina can sense infrared light after all
an international team of researchers used cells from the retinas of mice and people
by firing powerful lasers that emit pulses of infrared light , the researchers found that light - sensing cells in the retina sometimes get a double hit of infrared energy
when that happens , the eye is able to detect light that falls outside the visible spectrum
' there is a real logic in doing that
it is weirdly soothing and therapeutic
' as each piece clicks perfectly into place , just so , it 's a little win - like a little pat on the back
