sanaa , yemen the u.s. military is in the process of evacuating about 100 special operations forces members from the al anad airbase in yemen due to that country 's deteriorating security situation , sources in the region familiar with the situation told cnn
those being evacuated are the last u.s. troops stationed in the arab nation , which is home to aqap , the terrorist group also known as aqap
the u.s. closed its embassy in sanaa last month , after houthi rebels took over the yemen capital
and hundreds of aqap members escaped two yemen prisons thursday and friday , raising further security questions
for years , the u.s. military has worked closely with yemen 's government to go after aqap , together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent aqap figure anwar al-awlaki
and u.s. president obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign
" yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability , " obama said in january , promoting the policy of " partnering and intelligence - sharing with that local government " as the best approach in a bad situation
" the alternative would be for us to play whack - a - mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country , " the president said
but while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month , these cooperative efforts have been hampered by yemen 's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace
these include the rise of the houthi , their battles with forces loyal to ousted president hadi and the presence of not only aqap fighters but other militants
on friday , for instance , isis purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in sanaa what , if true , would mark that group 's first large - scale attack in yemen
the claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried isis proclamations , but could n't be immediately authenticated by cnn
those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others , according to yemen 's state - run saba news agency
while isis and aqap are both sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of islamic and violent opposition to the west , that does n't mean they will be working together anytime soon
in fact , aqap strongly rebuked isis in a video released in november , characterizing its leader abu bakr al-baghdadi 's declaration of an islamic caliphate as illegitimate
more than anything , the idea of the group calling itself the islamic state violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there
with no one really in control , that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the west -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over
meanwhile , the main players for control of yemen 's government -- those siding with hadi , who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year , and the houthi , a minority group that 's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds
just two days ago , a yemen jet commanded by the capital 's houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing hadi in the port city of aden
no one was injured , but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides
the airstrikes came on the same day opposing yemen military forces -- some under the houthi , others led by officers loyal to hadi -- battled in aden , said aden gov. hobtour
at least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes , according to hobtour
hadi took to the airwaves of adan tv , a station he recently started , on saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest
he called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the saudi capital of riyadh , condemning the aden strike and urging yemen troops to refuse orders from houthi officials
hadi tied the houthi to iranian , which he was said supported the " coup " that led to his departure from aden
" the iranian agenda of the houthi will not last , " he said
needless to say , the houthi are n't convinced
al bukhaiti , a top member of the houthi political council , said hadi 's speech wo n't help yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last september to transfer power
" we blame hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved yemen 's ongoing crises , " al bukhaiti said
" hadi will be held responsible for the country 's failures and that chaos that could follow
