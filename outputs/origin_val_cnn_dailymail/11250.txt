a million women were raped by allied soldiers in germany in the immediate aftermath of second world war , a new books claims
â when the soldiers came , â by historian gebhardt , is hailed as the definitive account of the treatment meted out to the defeated women of germany which they remained silent about for decades out of shame and humiliaton
' at the very least 860,000 women and girls - and also men and young boys - were raped by the occupying allied soldiers and their helpers
it happened everywhere , ' begins the book
a new book claims allied troops raped german women during the second world war by manipulating them with gifts of chocolate and cigarettes

' soldiers of the western allies were also guilty , ' said mrs. gebhardt , a renowned historian in germany who tracked down some victims to interview them about their ordeal at the hands of briish and american soldiers
' i researched the book for over a year and - a - half , ' she said
' i wanted to tell the story of what ' happened from the perspective of the victims
i wanted to reconstruct the crimes as gently as i could
' she said the ' terrible crimes ' did not only take place in the soviet zones of occupation - long chronicled and well - known about - but also in french , british and american sectors
a familiar slogan of the times was : ' it took six years for the american to struggle against the german armies but it only took a day and a slab of chocolate for them to conquer german women
' but not all collaboration in the bedroom was voluntary , writes gebhardt
german author gebhardt made the claims in a new book she said the false impression grew up after the war that german women gave themselves to western soldiers because they brought with them things they desperately needed - nylons , food , cigarettes , coffee
' the impression grew that there was no rape in the west but rather a kind of prostitution grew up , ' said the author
but in fact countless women were raped , she said , with soldiers believing they could treat the as they wanted after bearing coveted gifts
' post-war society was hardly ready to differentiate between voluntary and forced sexual contact
' between women who prostituted themselves out of emergency needs and those who had become victims of rape
' added to the trauma of the western victims was the shame suffered by the children they bore from their attackers
' their fathers were , mostly , unknown , and the women received no financial help at all , ' said gebhardt
she said in parts of southern germany , occupied by american troops , there were often ' free nights ' where soldiers were encouraged to abuse women at will for up to 48 hours at a time
the alleged victims are ' relieved ' their hardship is coming to light , she added .
