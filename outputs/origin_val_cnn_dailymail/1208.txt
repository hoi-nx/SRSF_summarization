a middle - school teacher in china has inked hundreds of sketches that are beyond be-leaf
politics teacher wang , 35 , has created 1000 stunning ink drawings covering subjects as varied as cartoon characters and landscapes to animals , birds according to the people 's daily online
the intricate scribbles on leaves feature wang 's favourite sites across the city of nanjing , which include the presidential palace , yangtze river bridge , the ancient jiming temple and the qinhuai river
natural canvas : artist and teacher wang has done hundreds of drawings , like this temple , on leaves she collects in the park and on the streets delicate : she uses an ink pen to gently draw the local scenes and buildings on the dried out leaves ' although teaching politics is my job , drawing is my passion and hobby , ' said wang
' i first tried drawing on leaves about 10 years ago and fell in love with it as an art form immediately
' it 's like drawing on very old parchment paper , you have to be really careful that you do n't damage the leaf because it is very fragile and this helps focus your attention and abilities
' wang started giving the drawings away on christmas eve in 2012 when her junior high school son came home saying he wanted to prepare some gifts for his classmates
being an avid painter , wang decided to give her son 's friends unique presents of gingko leaf paintings
wang loves gingko leaves and will often pick them up along gingko avenue , near to her school , in nanjing in east china 's jiangsu province
every autumn she collects about 2,000 leaves from the ground to ensure she has enough to cover spoils too
intricate : teacher wang has drawn hundreds of local scenes on leaves she has collected from the park hobby : the artist collects leaves every autumn and dries them out so she can sketch these impressive building scenes ' the colour and shape of gingko leaves are particularly beautiful , ' she said
' i need to collect around 2000 leaves because this will include losses '
she takes them home where she then presses them between the pages of books
' luckily , i have quite a lot of books and i try to use old ones or ones that i 've already read so i do n't end up with nothing to read
' once they are dried , she carefully takes each one and using an ink fountain pen creates her masterpieces
she said : ' some people are into capturing beauty through photography , but for me , a digitalised image just is n't the same
new leaf : politics teacher wang has drawn hundreds of doodles on leaves for the last 10 years ' by drawing what i see i become far more a part of the process and part of the final piece
' one day i hope to be able to put my collection on display , but for now it 's really just for my own pleasure
' wang 's leaf paintings are turned into bookmarks , postcards and sometimes even given as gifts to her her students so she can share the beauty of leaf paintings
but locals who have had the luck of being able to see wang 's art have been gobsmacked
local art collector on hao , 58 , said : ' these are truly remarkable and beautiful creations
' she has so much talent she is wasted in teaching
