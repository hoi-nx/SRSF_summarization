' there is currently no official longest hula hoop as such finds are not covered by any guinness world records record category
however , a spokesman told mailonline that the closest would be the record for the largest bag of potato chips which weighed 2,515lb 7.52oz , and was made by corkers crisps in pymoor , cambridgeshire , uk , on september 13 , 2013
record categories involving large food only cover scaled - up versions of the items , which must be made in the same way as the ordinary sized versions , but on a grand scale
' guinness world records does not monitor cases where people find unusually large versions of an item of manufactured food that has been made in a factory , ' the spokesman said
' these aberrations are not uncommon and finding them does not involve the challenge of record - breaking
' kp snacks , the hula hoop parent company , is yet to comment on the find .
