toffees 's players jog around the running track at dynamo kiev 's olympic stadium on wednesday bubbling confidence had toffees travelled here last week , their prospects would not have been so positive but the mood is significantly different thanks to back - to - back victories at goodison park against kiev in the first leg and then newcastle on sunday
it is the first time since november toffees have managed to put two results like that together and it has made a big difference to the mood of the squad
once this group gets on a roll and has confidence , they can meet challenges head on and they wo n't shirk what is in front of them
' we know that it is going to be a tough game , ' said seamus coleman
' we were very impressed with kiev in the first leg and they have got good players , like ( andrei ) yarmolenko
but we have come here with confidence and we want to go through to the next round
' toffees midfielder ross barkley scores his side 's final goal in their 3 - 0 win against newcastle on sunday lethal lukaku after enduring a difficult spell in the middle of the season , toffees 's record signing is beginning to deliver big goals at the right moments
he has scored 10 goals in his last 14 appearances , including the scruffy penalty which secured a first leg advantage
that strike made him toffees 's leading european scorer with seven and he has been proficient at coming up with big moments in this competition , such as hat - trick in berne and a group - winning goal in wolfsburg
he will fancy his chances of maintaining that sequence tonight

roberto martinez puts domestic struggles down to the fact they lost a lot of ground in the race for fourth place early on and ultimately lost heart for a period
in europe , though , they have had a sense of freedom and have been liberated by the chance to achieve something significant
they have won six of their nine games so far and the players are determined to not let the opportunity slip
' we are going to approach it the way we approach every game , ' said ross barkley , who will have a key role to fulfil
' we did well at home and hopefully now we can do that in the away game
we have to be positive and give our all
' manager roberto martinez ( left ) and seamus coleman speak to the media ahead of thursday 's last 16 tie roberto martinez poses with a group of local children inside dynamo kiev 's olympic stadium on wednesday something in the year ? this is a pithy point but seasons ending with a ' 5 ' have been good for toffees ; 1985 saw them win the european cup winners ' cup
1995 brought the fa cup , their last piece of silverware ; 2005 ended with david moyes guiding them to a top four finish , while 1915 heralded their second league title
toffees will , of course , need more than omens to get through but there has long been a feeling within the squad that they have the ability to go all the way to the final in warsaw and they want to create their own history
graeme sharp , kevin sheedy , trevor steven and andy gray hold the european cup winners ' cup in 1985 no fear much has been made of dynamo kiev 's formidable home record â they are unbeaten in the olympic stadium this season â but toffees are not going to sit back and hope to sneak through
by playing their natural game , roberto martinez believes they have an outstanding chance of progress
' we have to be attack minded and when we are on the ball , we need to be a team that wants to score goals and make it very much eye to eye and an open game , ' said roberto martinez
' that 's what i 'm looking for tomorrow , that we can make it a game full of chances for us ' i do n't want it to be a game where they are a home team , and let them see if they can break us down
that would be a big mistake
it is wanting to achieve something historic and special for us and make our fans proud in europe â which is what we are doing
