this murder has nothing to do with anything - except the guy who killed jill , ' she told the irish independent

' she said jill was n't particularly religious , but was ' very spiritual '
she also said that jill and her husband tom had a very strong code of ethics by which they led their life
' but she was n't saying the rosary every night , ' she told the irish independent
' even religious people get killed in not - so - nice ways
' at least 100 people , including students , staff and parents , witnessed the comments at st christopher 's primary school at airport west on friday
monsignor greg bennett , vicar - general of the archdiocese of melbourne , condemned the priest 's homily on friday and said the ' offensive ' comments did not represent the views of the church
' we do not share the sentiment of the homily this morning and we certainly apologise for the hurt that this homily may have caused today , ' he told 3aw
' the reference to jill meagher in particular was offensive and inappropriate and the people of victoria and ireland mourn her sad and tragic death
' he said he has spoken with the priest who acknowledges that the homily was not appropriate and apologises for the ' upset ' and ' offence ' it may have caused
family members have rallied around mr tom after the priest 's ' ridiculous ' comments worth , manager of the south eastern centre against sexual assault , told fairfax media that the comments were an ' extreme ' form of ' victim blaming '

it 's not about what she was doing , ' she said
the revelations come amid comments from victoria police , spurred by the stabbing murder of masa vukotic , warning women to take reasonable precautions when walking in parks at night , and if possible avoid it all together
dangerous predator : mr jill meagher was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of raping and killing mrs meagher in a brunswick laneway in september 2012 ms worth said women ' have a right ' to walk the streets alone without fearing an attack from a ' dangerous predator '
' it 's offensive to all women , certainly to jill meagher 's family
in some ways it 's insulting to religious people too because it is n't about being out at 3am , ' she said
' [ masa vukotic ] was out at 7pm at a time lots of us would be out walking
you expect to be safe from being attacked at any of those times
' to have someone suggest that the problem is that you do n't believe in god enough is ignoring completely what actually happens when there are dangerous men out attacking people
