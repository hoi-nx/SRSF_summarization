warren enthusiasts have been offered the dream prize of a stay in the investment guru 's childhood home - so long as they invest in his company and have a healthy appreciation of omaha
the three - bedroom house , where the billionaire finance whizz lived from the age of six , has been put on airbnb ahead of a may 2 investors ' meeting in the nebraska where he grew up
it was from that home , which his family left in 1966 and no longer owns , that warren , now 84 , earned his first cents selling coke and chewing gum door - to - door , and also started investing in stocks
big prize : warren superfans will be able to stay in his old house if they win an airbnb competition
the investment guru is pictured left in march 2015 , and right in the 1930s where the heart is : the warren family moved to this house in 1936
his mother continued living there until 1966 the online listing , which boasts that the home still has several warren - era features , explains that airbnb will offer a free stay , for up to three nights , to a lucky winner
to be eligible , entrants must be shareholders in warren 's berkshire hathaway holding company , and answer four questions
as well as listing their best airbnb experience and travel ' bucket list ' , hopefuls must explain what excites them most about the berkshire hathaway annual meet - up - and then wax lyrical about omaha in general
the competition is part of an airbnb publicity push in the city , which regularly runs out of hotel space when some 40,000 warren acolytes descend each year to hear from the investment guru himself
times change : this is the room where a young warren slept through his youth - though it now features twin beds and has likely seen some other changes since the billionaire - to - be last spent the night there eyes on the prize : only berkshire hathaway shareholders are eligible to enter the competition , and must answer questions including one on their excitement to be in omaha the phenomenon also sees hotels hike their rates , with some locations insisting visitors book rooms for at least three nights , despite the event only lasting a day
strategies like this roused the ire of warren , who personally recommended airbnb to his shareholders as a way to get round it
in an interview with the wall street journal , the self - confessed ' mother bear ' said he plugged the home - sharing site , in which he has no financial stake , to protect his shareholders from exploitation
the prize home , on north 53rd street , is around 15 minutes from the centurylink center where the meeting will be held
many parts of the house are still as they were during the warren family 's 30 - year stay , including the shelves in the library and a chandelier which warren 's parents installed in the dining room
original feature : the dining room chandelier , above , was installed by warren 's parents more than 50 years ago original : the shelves in the library , pictured , were those used by warren 's father in what was then his study mod cons : the home has two bathrooms and three bedrooms , as well as a track record producing billionaires however , other rooms have changed dramatically from 1930s central plains fashions , with modern kitchen appliances and a basement dedicated to mexican folk art. this year 's annual meeting is expected to draw its biggest crowd yet because this is the 50th anniversary of when warren took over berkshire hathaway
over the past five decades , warren has transformed the struggling new england textile maker into a conglomerate that owns more than 80 subsidiaries , including utility , furniture and jewelry firms
the company also has major investments in such companies as coca-cola co. , ibm and american express
according to cnn money , warren 's return across over his 50 - year tenure is 1,826,163 per cent , an average annual return of 21.6 per cent
cooking up a business plan : some rooms , such as this , have likely seen very extensive renovation transformed : the former warren basement is now turned over to displaying mexican folk art
