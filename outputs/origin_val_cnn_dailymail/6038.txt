in the much - loved road runner cartoons , it seemed that anything was possible â but the mayhem on the screen was born from writers that had incredibly strict rules to abide by
a former animator for warner brothers , which made the show , revealed in his autobiography that there were nine rules every cartoon had to follow
the star of each one was the road runner and his nemesis - wile e. coyote
a desert predator obsessed with catching and eating the road runner , he often used a bewildering and hilarious array of contraptions to snare his quarry
the writers also had to try and â make gravity the coyote 's greatest enemy â and ensure that he â is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures â
the rules come from the 1999 autobiography of former looney tunes animator chuck jones , called chuck amuck : the life and times of an animated cartoonist
the star of each show was the road runner and his nemesis - wile e. coyote
a desert predator obsessed with catching and eating the road runner , often using a bewildering and hilarious array of contraptions they were posted on twitter by director amos posner and have since generated considerable excitement on social media
one reddit thread has been dedicated to a discussion about the rules , and whether they have ever been broken
one rule â â the road runner must stay on the road , otherwise , logically , he would not be called road runner â â was broken many times , with the creature often appearing on rocky outcrops and once even pushing coyote along as he drives a speedboat
the cartoon first appeared in 1948 , with 48 made altogether , along with one half - hour special
the road runner can not harm the coyote except by going ' beep - beep ! ' no outside force can harm the coyote - only his own ineptitude or the failure of the acme products the coyote could stop anytime - if he were not a fanatic no dialogue ever , except ' beep - beep ! ' the road runner must stay on the road - otherwise , logically , he would not be called road runner ( though this seems to be a rule that was often broken ) all action must be confined to the natural environment of the two characters - the southwest american desert all materials , tools , weapons , or mechanical conveniences must be obtained from the acme corporation whenever possible , make gravity the coyote 's greatest enemy the coyote is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures
