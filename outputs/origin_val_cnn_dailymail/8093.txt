a principal has claimed radicalisation is not a problem at his islam school because he tells pupils that the islamic state death cult is manufactured by western countries
al-taqwa college principal hallak reportedly shows his almost 2,000 students â evidence â that islamic state terrorists are â not linked to islam â
â we do nât believe muslims are creating is , â mr hallak told the age
he believes that the murder and brutality carried out by islamic state terrorists is actually a plot by western countries to control oil in the middle east
the school , which is based in melbourne âs outer - west , victoria , is focussed on educating australian muslims that â follow australian law â , he said
â in the mosque , we talk to them many times
we show them evidence it 's not linked to islam , â mr hallak explained
al-taqwa college principal hallak reportedly tells his pupils that islamic state is a plot manufactured by western countries he said his islam school in melbourne does n't have problem with radicalisation the principle âs belief that is is simply a plot caused by israel and us stems from his theory that the terrorists use â shiny new equipment â
al-taqwa college is an independent primary and secondary school
daily mail australia has contacted mr hallak for comment
a spokesman for the islamic friendship association of australian trad told fairfax radio on monday the principle was just trying to discourage young people from joining the terror group
' i can understand anyone taking offence to being in any way implicated in the type of crimes that is has been reported to have done , ' mr trad said
' but in the bigger picture scheme of things , the real issues are that we have to find as many ways as possible to convince young people to keep away from this group and have negative feelings towards this group
' instead of criticising the principal for blaming the west , mr trad said the principal should be told ' we appreciate what you 're doing , but we do n't need the " us and them " approach '
abdullah elmir , a 17 - year - old australian who went missing from his home in sydney âs west at the end of june 2014 , is fighting with islamic state terrorists mr trad said is had done an ' unprecedented level of damage ' to the image of islam
he said there was a minority view that it was ' a plot from forces outside of islam ' , either the west or syria 's asad regime
mr hallak 's remarks come after more than 100 australian are thought to have flown to syria and iraq to fight with the islamic state terrorists so far

' i would just like everyone to know that the buck stops here with me
i knew there was something not right with his behaviour , ' he said
the teenager is believed to have converted to islam in 2012 when he was in year 10 , shortly after his mother died of cancer
' just out of the blue he said , " i 've gone muslims " , ' his father said
' to see him sitting there with that gun ... i just could n't believe that was my son , ' mr bilardi said about the photograph of his son holding a rifle , flanked by other is members , in front of the terrorist group âs black and white flag
