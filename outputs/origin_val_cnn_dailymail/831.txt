the key to a happy home is regular meals together , more than one tablet computer and a netflix account , a new study has revealed
research into the lives of 2,000 british families found that traditional values such as regular heart - to - hearts , hugs and knowing when to say sorry were still important factors for domestic bliss
but the study also revealed that modern families believed that having modern technology and gadgets such as a netflix account , fast wi - fi and sky tv were also key to harmonious home life
a new study has found that one of the keys to domestic bliss is having more than one tablet computer per household ( picture posed by models ) monthly trips to the cinema , a good coffee machine for mum and dad and at least three televisions were also deemed necessities for happiness
the research , commissioned by british manufacturer origin , found the highest rated tips for domestic bliss included eating together regularly , laughing a lot and keeping the home tidy
despite the importance of eating together proving the most popular source for a happy family , a third said they rarely find time to do this
a quarter of families also felt they have n't got a good work / life balance with the average family getting less than 12 hours a week together
andrew halsall , managing director at origin , said : ' the list of things that people attribute to happiness at home is an interesting mix of traditional processes , efforts to create a warm environment blended with the presence of technology and modern comforts
the whole family regularly eating together topped the list of things that helped create a harmonious family life ' it 's nice to see that eating together is still seen as the biggest sign of family bonding and a significant part of what people say makes a happy home
' modern life can be so hectic that families can struggle to get time together or ensure they appreciate their home life fully
people and their lifestyles change over time and homes need to be able to change with them
' whether it 's through physical changes like extending or developing the property , or through making a conscious effort to do things together more , building that home environment clearly leads to happiness
after all , an englishman 's home is his castle
' the study also revealed that keeping the place tidy , cooking with the children and having in - jokes makes all the difference in fuelling a great home environment
unsurprisingly , a dishwasher helped to avoid arguments about who is going to do the washing up , while a netflix account was seen as an important factor in keeping the peace despite items such as fast wi - fi , sky tv and everyone having their own smartphone or tablet , old fashioned bonding such as hugs and eating together were in the top five ways to keep a happy home while a lock on the bathroom door , movie nights and well - lit rooms were also important factors to a house being free of doom and gloom
a good stack of board games , a comfortable sofa everyone can pile on and picking up clothes from the floor also goes a long way
narrowly missing out on the top 50 elements for family happiness was the ability to share the remote control , having blinds to keep out nosy neighbours and a set of bi-fold doors opening out to the garden also help
more than two thirds of the families studied also felt that they were in definite need of more space at home
but children had other ideas when it came to essentials for a happy home with a tree house the most wished - for item , followed by a swimming pool in the garden and a bigger playroom
andrew halsall added : ' space plays such a big part in creating a happy home environment
' lack of adequate space for a household has also been shown to have significant impact on health , educational attainment and family relationships
