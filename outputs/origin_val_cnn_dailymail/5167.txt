' offered in this lot is the only known copy of either of the two styles of three sheets created for the debut of the film
' this is the style c and is arguably the best graphic of the two styles

' it underwent professional restoration and the poster now displays beautifully
' the spokesman said posters for the film had always been ' infamously difficult to find '
