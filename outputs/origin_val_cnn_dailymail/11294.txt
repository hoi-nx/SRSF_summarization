diarist anne frank likely died a month earlier than previously thought meaning there was little chance of her surviving the holocaust , according to new research
it was previously believed that the jewish teenager , who was sent to the bergen-belsen concentration camp , died of typhus on 31 march 1945 , two weeks before the camp was liberated
however a new study puts the date of her death at some point in mid february , meaning that even if british troops had reached the camp a little sooner , she would likely not have survived
the book documents how anne frank , her sister margot and her family went into hiding in a canal house , but were eventually betrayed and sent to bergen-belsen concentration camp , where she and her sister perished
anne frank wrote her diary while in hiding from nazi persecution during world war ii. by 1940 the nazis had occupied the dutch , leaving the family trapped
in 1942 the family went into hiding in secret rooms of frank 's office building
but after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the bergen-belsen concentration camp , where anne frank died of typhus in 1945
frank , anne frank 's father , returned to amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved
it was published in 1947 , leading to her posthumous fame
after the war the dutch government set the official date of her death as march 31 , based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in march
because the allies liberated the camp on april 15 , this added a bitter twist to her tale - the thought that if she could have hung on a few weeks longer she might have been saved
however , prins , a researcher at the anne frank house museum , has now revised that date having studied witness accounts , archives , and conducted at least one new interview
ms prins said she now believes that anne frank and her sister began exhibiting symptoms of typhus at the beginning of february
according to dutch health authorities , most patients do not live for more than 12 days after that
' in view of this , the date of their death is more likely to be sometime in february
the exact date is unknown , ' the study says
ms prins added : ' it was horrible
but when you say they died at the end of march , it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation
bergen-belsen concentration camp was liberated in april 1945 , meaning if anne frank died in march , then she was two weeks from rescue
but this new study shows she was months from safety ( anne frank pictured left , with father frank , and right ) anne frank and her sister margot died during a typhus epidemic that swept through the bergen-belsen concentration camp camp in 1945 , killing an estimated 35,000 people ( pictured , typhus patients inside the camp ) ' so maybe if they 'd lived two more weeks ... well , that 's not true anymore
' it is unlikely that the exact date of anne frank 's death will ever be uncovered , as disease was so common in the camps that individuals passing away often went unnoticed
in the words of one witness , rachel van amerongen , who knew the frank sisters and was cited by researchers , ' one day they simply were n't there anymore
' anne frank and margot were just two of an estimated 35,000 deaths at bergen-belsen concentration camp when a typhus epidemic swept through the camp in early 1945 .
