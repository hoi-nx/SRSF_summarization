dube is pleading not guilty to abduction and murder , arguing that somebody else committed the crimes
during a court hearing last week , it was alleged dube was intending to abduct her then stage a fake rescue so he could be hailed as a hero
according to the prosecution , the bogus account was traced to his home , his dna was found on a hat at the end of nichole cable 's driveway and cell tower records show that he was in the area of nichole cable 's home
accused : prosecutors say dube , pictured with his attorney during a hearing last monday , left a hat with his dna on it near nichole cable 's home defense attorney wendy hatch said last monday that the state rushed to judge dube , and she argued that someone else had committed the crimes
' we are here to show you the state has holes in their case
they have mistakes , big mistakes , ' hatch told the jury , adding that dube ' got up the next morning , got dressed , kissed his daughter goodbye and went to work
' assistant attorney general macomber said dube 's dna was also found on cable 's fingernails , and he had scratches on his face after she disappeared
he also said dube alluded to the crime while having an emotional outburst as officers tried to calm him down while he reported to jail for an unrelated traffic offense
' dube responded it was what he had done , that they did n't know he had done , that he was worried about , ' macomber said
horrifying : the court heard dube ( mugshot left ) covered nichole cable 's ( right ) body in leaves so she could n't be seen from the sky and took her clothes off so police dogs could n't smell her the trial is expected to last two weeks and includes a witness list with more than 80 names
the case prompted discussions about the appropriate use of social media at the high school she attended in old town
nichole cable 's mother , kristine wiley , testified that she knew dube as a friend of her daughter 's who came by their house two or three times before her disappearance
between tears , she testified that dube reached out to her with an offer to baby - sit her other children after nichole cable vanished but before her body was found
wiley said dube first told her he had heard wiley said he was responsible for nichole cable 's disappearance
wiley said she denied the accusation and that dube then told her ' if i needed anything , call ' and that he would watch her other children for her
she said she never took him up on the offer
