albert park - australian grand prix it seems incredible to think sepang has been hosting the malaysian grand prix since 1999 , but it appears one of herman tilke 's circuit designs has actually become part of the furniture on the f1 calendar
sepang 's sweeping nature can be a challenge to the drivers , but the biggest factor that can have an outcome on the race is the highly unpredictable weather which can leave plans and strategy in absolute ruins
in the past , race day always threw up a challenge whatever the conditions
if it was n't the flash storm catching out the drivers , it was the hot and extremely humid sun which sapped the energy from the drivers
a later start time since 2009 has limited the factor played by the sun , but race day tends to be an exciting affair as sportsmail looks back at the archive and memories from the malaysian grand prix
for albert park memories i included a quiz half - way down the page but this week we will start with one
the sepang circuit has n't changed its layout since the first race in 1999 but in which year was this overhead shot of the track taken ? ( answer at the bottom of the page ) ' not only is michael the best no 1 driver - he is also the best no 2
' eddie irvine ( right ) knew exactly who to thank after he won the first ever malaysian grand prix in 1999
michael schumacher dominated the race after returning from a mid-season leg break , and allowed eddie irvine to win to aid his title bid
mika hakkinen ( bottom left ) finished third but would go on to win the 1999 world championship leading the pack under the safety car and heading into the final corner is michael schumacher ahead of ferrari team - mate rubens barrichello in 2000
michael schumacher would go on to win the race with rubens barrichello finishing third behind the mclaren of david coulthard michael schumacher had already been crowned world champion in 2000 , but the double ferrari podium allowed the team to clinch the constructors ' championship
here both drivers ( with that red hair ) celebrate with test driver luca badoer ( right ) and team boss jean todt ( bottom right ) the 2000 malaysian grand prix was a joyous occasion for ferrari , but it was the end of the road for johnny herbert who driving for jaguar competed in his final race
the brit 's sad eyes appear to reflect that an 11 - year career as an f1 driver was about to come to an end legend has it that the 2001 minardi was so slow that fernando alonso needed a push up the hill from a track marshall to make it round the circuit during qualifying
giancarlo fisichella passes in his renault which fared little better performance wise over the season race day in 2001 was hit by a flash storm , and clever tactics by ferrari saw them change tyres at the right time before claiming a one - two with michael schumacher ( front ) leading home rubens barrichello
it was the first year where the race took place in its now traditional early - season slot montoya ( complete with a ferrari nosecone for company ) runs his williams off the circuit in 2002 after a collision with michael schumacher
despite the colombian not being at fault for the clash , it was he who would pick up a controversial drive - through penalty a quick glance in his mirror at the first corner and giancarlo fisichella will be stunned to find his team - mate takuma sato climbing all over the back of his jordan in 2002
this was just one lap after michael schumacher and montoya collided benefiting most from the montoya-schumacher incident was ralf schumacher who led home a williams one - two in 2002
it proved a false dawn for the team as ferrari went on to win 14 of the following 15 races during the campaign heinz-harald frentzen appears to be a little distracted as miss india of 2001 , celina jaitley , sits on the front tyre of his sauber in 2003 antonio pizzonia had clearly learned nothing from takuma sato 's first - corner antics in 2002 when he took to the air a year later in his jaguar
unfortunately it was the williams of montoya who was again the innocent victim as his rear wing takes the full force of the impact ferrari 's rubens barrichello waves hello to the future of f1 after mclaren 's kimi raikkonen celebrates his first ever grand prix win in 2003
joining the pair is renault 's fernando alonso ( who started from pole position ) and was also celebrating his first podium in the sport drink up , jenson ! the 2004 season was all about michael schumacher 's dominance but a sub-plot from it was the emergence of jenson button who here celebrates his first f1 podium with second - placed montoya ( left ) and race winner michael schumacher another malaysian grand prix , and another williams taking a battering
this time it is in the final corner heading into the pit - straight as webber collides with giancarlo fisichella 's renault - putting both out of the race - which was won by the italian 's team - mate , fernando alonso having been at fault the previous year for the crash with webber , giancarlo fisichella ( left ) stormed back in 2006 to take his final career win
the italian led home fernando alonso in a renault one - two with the duo celebrating with team boss flavio briatore fernando alonso will mark his mclaren return by making his second debut with the team this weekend , but he 's already driven at sepang for the outfit back in 2007
here the spaniard tackles a fast double right hander with the iconic start - finish stadium section in the background it was n't often that you found fernando alonso and lewis hamilton looking happy in the same picture during 2007 but here they are all smiles for mclaren following a one - two led home by the double world champion
lewis hamilton 's second place finish came after a third on his debut in melbourne kimi raikkonen was world champion , but here it 's felipe massa leading the ferrari cars round the first corner of the 2008 grand prix
kimi raikkonen would win the race with his team - mate retiring , but it was the brazilian who would lead ferrari 's title charge during the season the track is dry for now but not for long as dark clouds loom over sepang during the 2009 race
here nico rosberg pilots his williams around the first corner in front of jarno trulli 's toyota and the brawn of jenson button as a monsoon hit the track , jenson button took advantage to storm to the front ahead of toyota 's timo glock ( who would finish third )
as conditions became too severe , the race was halted after just 31 laps with jenson button pronounced the winner and all drivers receiving half - points michael schumacher retired after just nine laps with a wheel fault for mercedes in 2010 and there appears to be no shortage of marshalls offering a lift back to the paddock for the seven - time world champion following his return to the sport after three seasons away it 's usually a one - finger salute from sebastian vettel after he wins a race , but he is n't celebrating second place here
the world champion has just recorded two straight wins at the start of 2011 in a season he would go on to dominate before claiming his second world title all eyes were on perez in 2012 after the sauber driver narrowly missed out on a famous win having made a late error in trying to catch and pass ferrari 's fernando alonso
mclaren 's lewis hamilton congratulates the mexican on a fine drive to finish second
at the end of the season , it would be perez replacing the brit at the woking outfit following lewis hamilton 's departure to mercedes well this is n't the happiest podium you will ever see
mercedes ' lewis hamilton is sensing the tension in the air after race winner sebastian vettel ( centre ) controversially ignored team orders by passing team - mate webber during the 2013 malaysian grand prix sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton look on at webber during the champagne ' celebration ' as the furious australian hit - out at his team - mate for ignoring the now infamous ' multi- 21 ' order - a team call that indicated the red bull drivers held position with webber in front of sebastian vettel it was easier for lewis hamilton to celebrate on the podium in 2014 as he stormed to his first victory of the season ahead of team - mate nico rosberg 1999 : eddie irvine ( ferrari ) 2000 : michael schumacher ( ferrari ) 2001 : michael schumacher ( ferrari ) 2002 : ralf schumacher ( williams ) 2003 : kimi raikkonen ( mclaren ) 2004 : michael schumacher ( ferrari ) 2005 : fernando alonso ( renault ) 2006 : giancarlo fisichella ( renault ) 2007 : fernando alonso ( mclaren ) 2008 : kimi raikkonen ( ferrari ) 2009 : jenson button ( brawn ) 2010 : sebastian vettel ( red bull ) 2011 : sebastian vettel ( red bull ) 2012 : fernando alonso ( ferrari ) 2013 : sebastian vettel ( red bull ) 2014 : lewis hamilton ( mercedes ) bold indicates driver still active on f1 grid quiz answer - what year was the first photograph on this page taken ? the overhead track shot was taken on the thursday before the 2000 malaysian grand prix
