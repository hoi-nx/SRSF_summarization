events in dublin on sunday served as a jolting indication that england remain a work in progress and are running out of opportunities to establish momentum going into the world cup
the rbs 6 nations title is now ireland âs to lose and it is joe schmidt âs team â on the back of 10 successive victories â who are emerging as europe âs primary challengers at the global showpiece on these shores later this year
on monday , 200 days before the tournament begins at twickenham when the hosts confront fiji , england dropped a place to fourth in the world rugby rankings , behind their irish conquerors
lancaster and his assistant coaches are running out of time to prepare for the world cup lancaster and his assistant coaches have some key issues to address this week as they seek to orchestrate a prompt revival
first up , major tests are running out arguably , the really momentous occasions england need to sharpen preparations for the world cup have already passed
facing ireland on sunday was the last such encounter
the national team now have home games against scotland and france , who are in a state of near - disarray , which will not challenge them to the extent they were challenged in cardiff and , especially , in dublin
england 's players look dejected after they conceded the opening try of the match against ireland robshaw could nât set the same authoritative tone as captain that he had in wins over australia there are home - and - away clashes with the french in august but by the time england take on ireland the following month , both countries will be keeping their powder dry
there are also no short - cuts
lancaster is attempting to fast - forward the evolution of a squad largely made up of young players
but what the defeat on sunday proved is the importance of nous and experience , which the irish had in abundance
england have a glaring caps deficit against most of the leading nations and it is too late to rectify that
the coaches must hope their rookies learn fast
lancaster struggled for nous and experience in the defeat to ireland as he fastracks a young lions squad slow starts are another problem , with england falling behind in all three of their rbs 6 nations matches this season
they were under siege early on in dublin and cardiff
fundamental errors keep occurring in the opening minutes which leave them playing catch - up
against wales , they managed to do just that â impressively so â but ireland never let them back into it
lancaster and his team will review the tone of their match build - ups to see if they can find a way of ensuring the players start at the right pitch of emotional intensity
decision - making under pressure has become a major issue
the men charged with steering the english ship struggled in dublin
minds were scrambled and execution levels dipped

lancaster is reluctant to deploy danny cipriani from the bench but he will be far more willing to turn to owen farrell when the injured lion is available again
ireland âs air and ground assault exposed english shortcomings , not just their aerial blitz , but also with their work at the breakdown
the visitors â kicking often lacked accuracy and threat , and they were beaten to the ball in the air far too often for comfort
that is a concern , given the prowess of world cup pool rivals australia and wales in that area
those nations also have the personnel to cause trouble at the ruck and england can not afford to regularly concede the initiative in the battle over the ball
they have predatory runners like joseph and anthony watson out wide , but without quick ball , they are hampered
as for selection conundrums , there were no hindsight - driven grumbles about the make - up of the team in dublin , it âs just that the chosen men could nât deliver
richard wigglesworth of saracens is seen as the leading scrum - half in the country in terms of his tactical kicking game , so he may come into consideration for a starting place
dylan hartley had a couple of costly lineout - throwing lapses but he has performed well enough to be given the benefit of the doubt at hooker
dylan hartley had a couple of costly lineout - throwing lapses in the disappointing defeat to ireland george kruis was less prominent than in the previous two matches and courtney lawes will be back on the radar , as will another northampton forward , tom wood
meanwhile , mike brown is likely to return at full - back against scotland if he is over his concussion
finally , there is the question of what to do with tuilagi
there will soon come a time when lancaster and his assistants have to confront the issue of what to do in midfield when the leicester centre is fit again
joseph has been a revelation in this championship but he could nât force his way into the game on sunday , as the pack and inside backs were under the cosh
the coaches have suggested tuilagi could play at inside centre , but that does not appear to be a natural , instant solution and england âs whole attacking approach will hinge on the balance of their selections at 12 and 13
leicester âs wrecking - ball runner is a match - winner , but so is joseph and both are better in the thick of the action , rather than out wide
dejected england players richard wigglesworth , george kruis and robshaw react to the ireland defeat
