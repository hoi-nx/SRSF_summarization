a notorious anti-semitic comedian has been spared jail for tweeting his sympathy for the terrorist behind the paris jewish supermarket massacre , which killed four people
dieudonne m'bala m'bala , 48 , used the rallying slogan ' je suis charlie ' to make a joke relating to gunman amedy coudlibaly , who murdered a policewoman and carried out the devastating attack on the kosher supermarket in the wake of the charlie hebdo attacks in january
the provocative entertainer had denied any wrongdoing and said the case exposed the hypocrisy of a country which ' pretends ' to be a bastion of free speech
comedian : dieudonne m'bala m'bala has been found guilty of ' apologising for terrorism ' after posting a joke on facebook which referred to the gunman behind the paris kosher supermarket attack he also maintained that he ' condemned the attacks without reservation and without any ambiguity
' but dieudonne m'bala m'bala , who has previous convictions for anti-semitism , was found guilty of ' apologising for terrorism ' following his trial at the palais de justice in paris
the court heard how , just days after the paris attacks in january , he had posted on facebook ' tonight , as far as i 'm concerned , i feel like coulibaly '
the post combined the ' je suis charlie ' slogan with the name of one of the gunman involved in the supermarket hostage
terrorist amedy coulibaly was also a close friend of saã¯d and chã©rif kouachi , the gunmen involved in the charlie hebdo shooting at the satirical magazine
staff working at the publication 's headquarters were targeted in january for drawing insulting cartoons about the prophet mohammed and for attacking muslims generally
during the trial , defence barrister sanjay mirabeau said dieudonne m'bala m'bala 's arrest in january was disproportionate
yet it was followed by police questioning more than 70 others for similar alleged crimes
mr sanjay mirabeau said the case against his client should be thrown out ' because it is the job of humourists to make people laugh '
he was given a two - month suspended prison sentence
french comedian dieudonne m'bala m'bala ( left ) and his defence barrister sanjay mirabeau leaving court on wednesday president francois hollande 's government ordered a major clampdown on hate - speech following the terrorist attacks , which left a total of 20 people dead , including coulibaly and the two other terrorists
dieudonne m'bala m'bala drew international attention last year when football star anelka celebrated an english premiership goal with a salute popularised by the comic which critics said was anti-semitic
called a ' quenelle ' , it has been described as a reverse nazi salute , and was used by anelka while he was playing for west bromwich albion
al qaeda in yemen claimed responsibility for the paris attacks , but intelligence officials believe the terror group provided inspiration , rather than any logistical or financial support
since the attacks , french has deployed 10,000 troops and 120,000 security forces to protect sensitive sites , including synagogues , mosques and travel hubs .
