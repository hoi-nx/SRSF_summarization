the islamic state has released a new propaganda video showing two deaf fighters speaking in sign language and urging more westerners to join the terror group
the video is titled ' from who excused [ sic ] to those not excused ' - suggesting that disability is no excuse for not serving for isis
in the five minute clip the two men , who are deaf - mutes and brothers , are shown working as traffic police in iraq 's second city mosul , which has been under isis control since last summer
' as for my message to the apostate peshmerga ( kurdish fighters ) we will strike you soon , by allah 's permission
i am living in a land in which allah 's sharia is established
' wearing black jumpsuits , ammunition pouches and carrying what appear to be m16 assault rifles , the pair also speak about their desire to ' slaughter ' their enemies including britain , america , france and italy , saying ' you will not stop our advance '
the fighters also threaten saudi arabia , kuwait , qatar and those who have allied with the west , vowing to destroy them
in the final section of the slickly produced and professionally edited film , the brothers are shown assembling simple rocket launchers which they claim are used to fire at kurdish fighters
the weapons consist of little more than crudely made explosives balanced on a metal frame which is tilted upwards and held in place using a few rocks
in the last seconds of the film , which features the islamic state 's logo in the top right hand corner , one of the men presses a trigger , launching the rockets
the last seconds of the film show the pair wiring up and launching two crude missiles which they claim are being aimed at kurdish peshmerga fighters alex kassirer , a researcher at flashpoint intelligence , who spoke to nbc news , said the video ' represents an attempt by the group to recruit other physically or otherwise impaired individuals , as well as demonstrates the multifaceted responsibilities of those in its ranks
' isis 's ability to recruit western jihadis using online propaganda films and its monthly magazine , dabiq , is well documented , and the films often feature fighters speaking about their daily lives , in an attempt to present life under the extremist caliphate in a positive light
however this is thought to be the first film which deliberately features disabled people in an attempt to recruit more from european and the west .
