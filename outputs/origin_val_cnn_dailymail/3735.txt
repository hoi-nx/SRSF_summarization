freddy describes himself as â 50 - 50 â british and australian , though the soft queensland accent seems a giveaway
it is nât quite as simple as that , because freddy is the son of steve , 1980 olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of british sport , whose rivalry with sebastian coe captivated a global audience
three decades on , freddy is forging his own path â but as a cyclist , not a runner , having switched sports 18 months ago and made such rapid progress that he has trained with chris froome , the 2013 tour de france winner , and recently signed with french âs top development team
cyclist freddy is all smiles as poses for a picture with his former athlete father steve ovett ovett jnr spent his first seven years in dumfriesshire , where his parents moved after steve âs retirement , and where his father competed in the odd cycle race until he collided with a car in 1994 â by coincidence , the year freddy was born
freddy knows little about his father âs brief cycling career , and laughs as he says : â i can imagine him rocking up , thinking he was stronger than anyone
â but he knows everything about his running : â my depth of knowledge about the history of athletics is more than my dad âs
i have to correct him sometimes on what he did and did nât do
â freddy and his father steve hit the running track , somewhere steve is very familiar with father and son are cut from the same cloth
â we âre so , so close , and so similar , â he says
that augurs well for freddy and badly for opponents , since the older freddy , now 59 , was famously competitive
he was equally famously prickly with the press â a trait that does nât seem to have been inherited by the genial , open ovett jnr
had social media existed in the 1980s , it âs difficult to imagine steve asking a journalist to publish his twitter handle ( it âs @ freddyovett , since you ask )
freddy recently signed with french âs top development team after swapping running trainers for a bike freddy was a promising middle - distance runner , just like his dad , and in 2012 won a scholarship to the university of oregon
then he suffered a knee injury
â it was so frustrating
i came back to australian and did a bit of cycling to keep in shape , â he says
tests at the victorian institute of sport suggested he had promise
â i think i was meant to be a cyclist all along , â freddy says
â i always followed it , i was always staying up to stupid hours watching the tour de france
it fascinated me , despite the scandals
i was a big fan of lance armstrong before the whole downfall
â medals : 800m olympic gold , 1500m bronze ( 1980 ) ; 1500m europe gold ( 1978 ) ; 800m europe silver ( 1974 , 1978 ) ; 5,000m commonwealth gold ( 1986 )
world records ran a 3:48.8 mile in 1980 to beat sebastian coe âs record battled with sebastian coe for the mile record in 1981 â it changed hands three times in nine days set three 1500m records between 1980 and 1983 set a two mile record in 1978 that lasted nine years freddy was also bbc sports personality of the year in 1978 what did his father make of him turning his back on running ? â when i started cycling , we were nât speaking , â says freddy
â it was a strange time , it lasted about a year , which was tough on both of us
â his parents are divorced and while his mother is still in noosa , queensland , his father lives down in melbourne with his new partner
â when i went to europe last year , my dad and i got back in contact , â freddy continues
â he sees the way athletics is at the moment and he saw how difficult it was for me to break through
â he âs super supportive about my cycling â and excited more than anything
when i speak to him i can sense that
â freddy has a lot to live up to if he wants similar levels of success as his father steve one of the challenges in athletics , says ovett jnr , is dealing with doping , which â surprisingly â he thinks is worse in his original sport than in his new one
â cycling has taken more of an aggressive approach in trying to stamp it out , â he claims
â in athletics , a lot of dodgy stuff is going on that the general public are not aware of , because they âre not knowledgeable enough
â freddy , 21 , is based in chambery in the alps , in an apartment owned by his new team , ag2r
they are as french as cycling teams come , but manager , vincent lavenu , a top rider in the 1980s , was interested in a rider called freddy
â he was a fan of my dad âs , â says freddy
steve cram and freddy during the heats of the men 's 1500 metres event at the summer olympics in 1984 he shares an apartment with a french rider and a chef comes in to cook lunch and dinner
the team is paying for french classes â he goes to school for three hours a day
the question of his nationality is unresolved
enquiries were made about him riding for scotland at last year âs commonwealth games , but he is undecided
â i have dual citizenship
i do nât want to rush anything , â he explains
he is wary of declaring for british or australian when he feels he has nât proved himself deserving of a place in either national team
steve was a 1980 olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of british sport â i need to learn in under 23 racing before trying to be a hero , â he says
â but i âm definitely not opposed to representing the british
â what does his dad think ? â i do nât know , he âs good at letting me feel my own way
he âs trying to not put too much pressure on me
both ( british and australian ) set - ups are really good â both have incredibly strong national teams
â last year , during his first racing trip to europe , freddy stayed with his agent , baden cooke , in monaco , which is also where chris froome and his sky team - mate richie live
freddy , 21 , is based in chambery in the alps , in an apartment owned by his new team , ag2r â it was fantastic , â says freddy
â i went on quite a few rides with richie and got on really well with him â he checks up on me
and i rode with chris froome , including one ride where he was training for the vuelta
â he is such a nice guy and i read a bit about him â he is like this african maasai warrior , extremely talented but he could nât get a handle on how to race
â i do nât compare myself with him but i can relate to that
i feel strong enough to make up for my poor bunch racing skills , but i know i âve got so much to learn
