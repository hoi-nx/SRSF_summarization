manchester city goalkeeper joe hart has revealed he 's been working with a psychologist joe hart spoke to sport magazine about his meetings joe hart told sport magazine : ' i 've got a relationship with someone who i 've worked with for a while
it 's a lot of fun
i like what i get out of it
just generally â it 's not necessarily just football and trying to ' unlock doors '
' it 's just general â kind of free - flowing , feeling comfortable and safe to talk
everyone could benefit from it , really , for life in general
' the goalkeeper feels that having a strong mentality is key to being successful - especially being a goalkeeper
' you can feel when someone is in a good place and when someone feels good about what they do , the same as i can feel it with strikers
so , to be in a naturally good place is a lot better
' you 've got to believe in what you do and feel comfortable and confident when you go out
being in the right frame of mind always helps â we all have vulnerable parts , times in our game when you 're thinking the worst can happen
but you need to limit them as best you can
' ' i 've always kind of accepted in my role as a goalkeeper that making mistakes is going to happen
but turning it into a positive is something that i 've improved on , definitely
' england no 1 joe hart denies brazilian ace neymar as the former santos man looms down on goal the england no 1 has been in fine form for his club this season , despite his defence struggling for form , but joe hart admitted that making a save is n't quite the feeling as scoring a goal

' penalties are an easy one to zone in on because it 's a one - on - one duel
there 's nothing that can be done â it 's not like someone can do a sneaky one when you 're not looking
' you try and make the moment as big for them as it is for you
some people are immune to that , and you 're wasting your time
but there 's a few people who it might help with
' saving one is a good feeling
in my head it 's all because of me
but , realistically , they might have just taken a bad penalty or made the wrong decision
anyone is more than capable of scoring past me from 12 yards , whatever team it is
