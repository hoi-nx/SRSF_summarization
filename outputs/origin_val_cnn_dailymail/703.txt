roman zozulya 's first - half strike edged dnipro to a crucial win against dutch champions ajax at the kiev olympic stadium
having squandered a series of early chances the hosts took the lead on the half hour mark when roman zozulya collected yevhen konoplyanka âs cut back to send a left - footed strike across cillessen and into the net
dnipro , playing in their first ever last 16 tie in the europa league , kept frank de boer âs side relatively quiet and head to amsterdam next week in a promising position

the first chance went the way of the visitors after just four minutes as midfielder thulani serero attempted to chip keeper denys boyko but that was a rare moment of progress for ajax
however in first - half stoppage time joel veltman spurned a glorious chance to level the contest when standing all alone at the back post , but the centre - back blasted a volley way over the bar from a few yards out
frank de boer âs side improved after the break but failed to register a single shot on target and will have to improve drastically for the second leg in amsterdam next thursday
it was n't all good news for the hosts as artem fedetskiy , ruslan rotan and roman zozulya all picked up booking to rule themselves out of the second leg in holland
