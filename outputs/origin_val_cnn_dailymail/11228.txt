those who have skied will have experienced the nerve - racking moment a ski lift temporarily stops mid-journey to dangle in the wind above jutting rocks below
but imagine if your lift had n't stopped because someone was having momentary trouble disembarking at the other end
imagine if it stopped because a tree had fallen on its cable
well for a group of skiers enjoying the slopes on a windy day in val gardena , italy that terrifying image came true
videoed in the cabin suspended some distance above the ground below , the skiers huddle around as they wait to be rescued
a man , who appears to be attached to the top of the cabin via a harness , prises open the door from the outside before climbing inside himself
the video maker captures himself in the frame along with the other skiers waiting to be rescued from the ski lift attaching a woman to another harness , the rescuer sends her out of the door and watches over her , feeding the rope through his hands , as she abseils down to safety
a pair of rescuers at the bottom wait with hands outstretched for the woman as she descends
according to one of the people in the cabin , the group were required to wait an hour and a half before they were rescued
after making his way inside the cabin , the rescuer attaches a woman to a harness and begins lowering her safely to the ground a helicopter , an ambulance and firefighters were all apparently called to the scene to help with the evacuation
