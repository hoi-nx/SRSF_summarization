sherwood says villa are ready for the home straight and wants to avoid a photo finish in the relegation battle
the boss takes his premier league thoroughbreds to sunderland on saturday for a crunch clash
the sunderland are a point and a place ahead of fourth - bottom villa , who themselves are just three points above the drop zone
sherwood hopes the premier league relegation battle does not end up being a photo - finish and with the cheltenham gold cup on friday , sherwood is hoping villa , who have never been relegated from the premier league , can avoid being unseated
he said : ' i think it 'll be a photo finish and i hope we 're not in it
' we 're probably just coming around the corner but it 's probably the longest run - in in racing history
' all we 're looking at is the next fence and that 's sunderland
after that we hope we can stay in the running
there might be a few who fall along the way and we 're hoping that 's not us
' villa have won their last two under sherwood , beating west brom twice in the league and the fa cup to reach the semi-finals
they were the new manager 's first wins since replacing paul lambert in february and sherwood has been impressed with the squad 's attitude
' they 've been good and a win makes an awful lot of difference
they have been focused and up for the fight , ' he said
' they have n't dwelt on the position
it 's about looking forward now , what we have done previously counts for nothing
' sherwood , before becoming head coach , was at tottenham as assistant first - team coach under harry redknapp and worked with sunderland striker jermain at white hart lane
the 32 - year - old returned to england in january after a year with toronto in major league soccer and sherwood believes jermain is the sunderland ' chief threat
he said : ' if they are going to survive it 's going to be jermain who keeps them in the premier league , that 's why they forked out that sort of money for him
' he did n't have to go , he went for a lifestyle change to canada but he still has that appetite to come back and play for sunderland , in a relegation battle
' jermain can score goals on his own but he prefers people to slide the ball across the six - yard box for him to be in the right place at the right time , that 's what he 's done all of his career
