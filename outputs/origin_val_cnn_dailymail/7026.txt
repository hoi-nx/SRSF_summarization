a drought in the western us has left water levels in the colorado river basin far below their normal levels
lake , a reservoir at the arizona - utah border , is 45 per cent below its capacity , and the lack of water has left a ' bathtub ring ' at the bottom of its majestic rock formations
the lake , from which the colorado river eventually snakes through grand canyon national park , has lost 4.4 trillion gallons of water in a recent drought
the river 's basin has been experiencing the drought for eleven of the last 14 years , shrinking a reservoir that was one - fourth the size of rhode island when it was at ' full pool ' , according to national geographic
seven states and 40million people get water from different parts of the river 's basin , which extends into the southern reaches of wyoming
many climate scientists think that the southwest is also due for a megadrought this century that would far outlast the current phenomenon
lake mead , the reservoir next to hoover dam , shrunk to 39 per cent of its capacity last year and was at its lowest level since the dam was built in the 1930s
to help the other reserve keep a steady supply , lake will release 8.23 million acre - feet ( 2.68 trillion gallons ) downstream over the course of this year
the release is estimated to lower the water level at lake , the second largest reservoir in the country behind lake mead , by another meter
it is in danger of seeing its surface elevation fall below 1,075 feet above sea level by september , which would be the lowest level on record , set in 2005 , and increase the size of its bleached white ring
minerals in the water turn the walls of the sandstone canyons white , according to the weather channel
minerals in the colorado river turned the sides of lake 's canyons white before the water levels dropped and the discoloration could be seen lake provides water to nevada , arizona , and california , which has been experiencing its own drought problems the reservoir is now at 45 per cent capacity after losing water from drought for most of the past 14 years around 40million people get water from different parts of the colorado river basin , and lake ( pictured ) used to be one - fourth the size of rhode island lake has lost 4.4 trillion gallons of water this century , rapidly decreasing in size from 1999 to 2013 sections of extreme drought have hit many states of the southwestern us , including arizona , colorado river , nevada and california the colorado river basin stretches from the southern reaches of wyoming to southwestern states such as arizona ( pictured ) lake is a major arizona vacation spot and draws more than 2million visitors to the reservoir each year sections of lake that used to be under water , such as this are of big water , utah , now stand dry and pebbles from the riverbed are exposed lake will release trillions of gallons of water through glen canyon dam ( pictured ) so that lake mead , next to hoover dam , will not dramatically lose water levels the diminishing of the colorado river has exposed vegetation from the riverbed , such as that on this section around horseshoe bend motorboats can still navigate on some stretches of the river , though paddle boats are necessary for other parts water lines are visible on a section of lake that used to be under water but has now been exposed by a drought not all areas sport the white bath tub ring from where water used to be , though areas such as this part of big water , utah , are also dramatically diminished from their surging heydays lake reached a record low of 3555 feet in 2005
above , boaters tour the cathedral in the desert formations in 2007 scientists believe that the western us may be due for a megadrought sometime this century this map shows the severity of the drought in the western us , with ' exceptional ' drought in dark red , ' extreme ' drought in red and ' severe ' in orange
