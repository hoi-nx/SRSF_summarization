anyone who has flown back from a holiday at night will have marvelled at the twinkling blanket of lights that cover towns and cities after dark
but the crew of the iss has gone one better , by capturing this light show from the iss 's orbit around 250 miles ( 400km ) above the earth
the six - second vine loop was posted at 9.32pm gmt last night and shows the station soaring over the uk and scandinavia
cornwall and devon are in relative darkness
as the station moves towards scandinavia , the bright lights of brussels and antwerp in belgium and rotterdam in the netherlands can be seen the vine was taken by expedition 42 crew member cristoferetti
during the clip , the iss begins by approaching the uk from the south west hitting cornwall first , the north west coast of france is visible in the bottom right - hand corner but paris is just out of shot
the bright section of light in the east of the uk is london , while devon and cornwall are in relative darkness
and as the station moves towards scandinavia , the bright lights of brussels and antwerp in belgium and rotterdam in the netherlands can be seen
the 37 - year - old flight engineer - alongside her colleagues commander barry wilmore , flight engineer terry virts and russian cosmonauts elena serova , alexander samoukutyaev and anton shkaplerov - has been on board the station since 9 november last year
tweeting the vine from her @ astrosamantha twitter handle , ms cristoferetti wrote : ' of all the lights from uk to scandinavia ... which ones are yours ? # spacevine '
the italian astronaut then posted the same tweet in her native language the team is due to return to earth in may

during her four - month stay on the station ms cristoferreti has filmed herself getting a haircut in space and released a collection of images called nasa : landscapes
one of the most striking images in this collection shows the lights of the south coast of england and the north coast of france , taken above the english channel in january

the entire iss was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit last month so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station
the remarkable manoeuvre saw a european spacecraft â slow â the speed of the station
this changed the height of its orbit by about 1.6 miles ( 2.5km ) , before the station was spun back again to its original position
this is the same location where this vine was taken
the iss is marking its 15th anniversary of continuous human occupation on 2 november this year and since expedition 1 in 2000 , the space station has been visited by more than 215 people
as of november 2014 , there have been 100 russian launches , 37 space shuttle launches , one test flight and three operational flights by spacex âs dragon as well as a test flight and two operational flights by orbital science âs cygnus
a total of 184 spacewalks have been conducted in support of space station assembly totaling over 1,152 hours , or approximately 48 days
the space station , including its large solar arrays , spans the area of a u.s. football field , including the end zones , and weighs 924,739 pounds
the complex now has more livable room than a conventional six - bedroom house , and has two bathrooms , a gymnasium and a 360 - degree bay window
a second image in the nasa : landscapes collection was taken above the big island of hawaii in the north pacific ocean
it was captured on 28 february and the peaks of volcanoes mauna loa and mauna kea can be seen in the centre of the 4,028 square mile ( 10,432 square kilometre ) land mass. mauna loa is the world 's largest , and one of its most active , volcanoes
