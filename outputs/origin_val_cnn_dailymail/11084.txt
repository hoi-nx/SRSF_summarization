great players with baggage like yaya toure are always worth the aggro when they are on top of their game
but when their form dips and yet they remain high maintenance , there is only ever one outcome
it happened to roy keane whose tantrums and outbursts were tolerated by sir alex ferguson at manchester united until the moment he no longer justified his place in the team
after the embarrassing mis - match in the nou camp when barcelona could have scored at least six against man city , you feel that time is rapidly running out for yaya toure and others like vincent kompany and edin dzeko
this summer will surely see a major transfusion of personnel at the etihad if they are to challenge europe 's best
midfielder yaya toure struggled to impress as man city crashed out of the champions league to barcelona city were happy to put up with the baggage that came with yaya toure ( right ) while he was performing at his best man city captain and defender vincent kompany ( right ) contests for the ball alongside barcelona 's luis suarez defender pablo zabaleta has been left out of man city 's team for their biggest games this season yaya toure became the premier league 's best - paid player when he signed for roberto mancini from barcelona in 2010
in domestic football , he has been an unqualified success and scored 24 goals last season as man city won their second championship
his world - class strike against sunderland at wembley won pellegrini the capital one cup
when things were rosy , the club were happy to overlook constant talk about him being linked with other clubs , his pushiness to secure improved contracts and a farcical stand - off about not being treated with enough respect on his birthday
premier league managers felt the midfielder did n't do enough of the hard yards to protect man city defensively but they were unable to capitalise much because when yaya toure had the ball he was an unstoppable force of nature
but those days have gone and the 31 - year - old 's hapless showing against barcelona as man city crashed out of the champions league underlined he is not the man to push the club forward any more
his dereliction of duty to allow ivan rakitic the space to score barcelona 's winner was noted immediately
going forward , his shooting was wayward and he was taken off before the end by pellegrini â unthinkable one or two years ago
remember , yaya toure had been banned for the previous three games in europe and this was his big chance to show the world what he was still capable of
the club are in no hurry to offer the current african player of the year a new deal at anything like the Â£ 240,000 - a - week terms of his last contract
indeed , with financial fair play now increasingly important , the temptation to offload him and his wages to inter milan this summer to allow new blood is very tempting
striker edin dzeko could be considered as dispensable by man city in the summer if they have an overhaul joe hart ( right ) was in inspired form during man city 's 1 - 0 defeat to barcelona on wednesday striker aguero ( left ) missed a penalty as man city were eliminated 3 - 1 on aggregate by barcelona city defender martin demichelis ( left ) challenges messi of barcelona for possession of the ball man city 's failure to reach europe 's last eight under their abu dhabi owners will create a major rethink at the club this summer
all their marquee names like aguero and silva were signed before pellegrini 's arrival in 2013
while their rivals are signing young , hungry , world - class players like eden hazard , alexis sanchez and philippe coutinho , man city looked ageing and stilted in the nou camp
yaya toure symbolises the malaise but he 's not the only one
skipper vincent kompany has been off the boil all season and can no longer lead while his personal form is so patchy
at 30 years old , pablo zabaleta is still able to cope with run - of - the - mill league games but it 's interesting he has been left out of the really big matches like chelsea away and barcelona away
edin dzeko is n't going to get any better , neither is martin demichelis or aleksandar kolarov
if they stay at man city , they will only be squad players and in the case of edin dzeko in particular his wages are astronomical compared with strikers at other clubs
the new signings from txiki begiristain have been flops
fernando , eliaquim mangala and wilfried bony cost Â£ 72million and yet none of them are considered good enough to start
stevan jovetic , a young and skilful import from serie a , has fallen so far down the pecking order he was sacrificed from man city 's champions league squad , reduced as an fpp punishment
aleksandar kolarov ( centre ) is crowded out by messi ( left ) and ivan rakitic of barcelona stevan jovetic was removed from man city 's champions league squad to accommodate wilfried bony james milner ( right ) chases after messi in the champions league clash between barcelona and man city it is such a far cry from the excitement of the first few years under sheik mansour
he broke the british transfer record on his first day and while robinho did n't work out , it did create a buzz around the place
aguero , silva and yaya toure were dazzling signings
city need to get back to that and go for the likes of raheem sterling , gareth bale and arjen robben if they are going to threaten clubs like barcelona
it means a major clearout this summer and yaya toure could well be on the list .
