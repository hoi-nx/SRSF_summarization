when winston was caught looting the fridge for hot dogs , his owner decided this old dog needed to learn some new tricks
so in what looks like a bizarre tribute to swiss folk hero william tell , scott cromwell got his canine companion to pose with a shiny red apple on top of his head , among other fruity treats
then he matched the color of the background to the fruit to create this series of eye - catching photos
do n't shoot ! winston looks worried at the prospect this picture may be a preamble to some amateur archery sour grapes : the dog appears less than impressed with this set of headgear he 's been asked to balance on his snout by owner scott cromwell for this series of quirky photograph superfoods for a super dog : winston looks on inscrutably while balancing a mound of blueberries leaves a sour taste : winston looks a little shocked after being persuaded to grip a lime in his jaws not impressed : but the loyal dog does n't flinch even with a slimy half - eaten banana balanced on his bonce anticipation : winston looks like he better get something a little more meaty to justify all this posing ' winston 's very eager to please me and will do about anything for a treat
he absolutely loved doing these shots , ' mr scott cromwell said
' he knew when we were about to do a shoot and would beat me to the room where i had it set up and be sitting in the exact spot i wanted before i got there
' naturally , he loved the fridge shoot too , being that he got to eat a whole package of hotdogs
' i kept replenishing the one you see him eating with a new one until we went through a package of them , just to make sure i got a good shot
' mr scott cromwell , a tv repairman - cum - animal photographer from oklahoma city , spent two months working with winston to create the quirky shots
he had planned to just take a picture of the banana but after he got such a great reaction from people who saw the shots , he could not resist taking more
now there 's a snack i can sink my teeth into ... winston got to scoff a whole packet of hotdogs for this picture mr scott cromwell said : ' winston does stick his nose in nearly every time i go to the fridge and open it and that is what gave me the idea , so luckily i never taught him how to open it to get me a beer or he would be in there a lot
' the pictures have been very well received and are some of my most popular ones
' most people love dogs and pictures of dogs done well with a wide angle lens tend to be popular
