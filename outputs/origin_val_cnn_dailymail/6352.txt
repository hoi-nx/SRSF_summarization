for three long years claire put her regular , excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high - flying career in sports marketing
long hours spent at her computer , plus business trips abroad were surely responsible for triggering the searing headaches that made it feel as though her head was being gripped in a vice
â i was 30 when the migraines began , randomly at first , but then they came every month , â says claire , 35 , who lives in huddersfield , west yorkshire , with her husband brendan , 42 , a fitness centre owner
â i blamed my career and lifestyle
at work , i âd have to sit in a dark room and shut my eyes as the pain was all - consuming
sometimes , the migraines would wipe me out for a week
claire ( pictured ) used to put her regular , excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high - flying career in sports marketing â despite being a virtual workaholic , there were times i was unable to function and would have to phone in sick , which left me feeling terribly guilty
â things got so bad that last year claire gave up her job to work part - time for her husband , helping to market his firm
but then claire had an epiphany when she began keeping a diary of her headaches â her migraines were linked to her menstrual cycle
â i noticed they always came the day before my period , and it was a relief to finally realise what the trigger was
â it altered the way i tried to deal with them
i took advice , mapped out my cycles , and upped my dosage of magnesium ( said to regulate hormones ) and took over-the - counter drug migraleve to try to prevent a migraine coming on 24 hours before i knew my period was due
this has staved off a full - blown migraine for the last few months
â claire is not the only woman suffering from this commonly misdiagnosed side - effect of the menstrual cycle
claire ( pictured after a migraine ) gave up her job to work part - time for her husband last year when the migraines got really bad according to charity the national migraine centre , a staggering 50 per cent of women suffer menstrual migraines immediately before , during or just after their period
but , like claire , very many do nât make the connection between the two for years â and neither do their gps
online forums are awash with women discussing the â lightbulb moment â they finally realised their cycle was to blame
although migraines are an age - old problem , the diagnosis of specific menstrual migraines is a modern phenomenon , following extensive research over the past 25 years
professor anne macgregor , a leading specialist in headaches and women âs health , says : â the most common cause is a drop in oestrogen towards the end of the cycle
this hormone is released at the start of it , and levels rise , eventually triggering ovulation and an egg âs release
claire ( pictured ) has seen various gps and doctors about her severe migraines but none have been able to come up with a treatment that has worked completely â progesterone is released and prepares the womb lining for a fertilised egg
if pregnancy does nât occur , both levels drop and cause a period
â it âs this sudden drop that triggers a migraine as the body deals with the hormone withdrawal
â she says hormones used in contraceptives , such as the pill , coil and patch put all women of menstruating age at risk â but those in their 30s and 40s more so
â this is because hormone levels fluctuate more in the years building up to the menopause , mean ing the drop in oestrogen and therefore withdrawal symptoms are greater , â she reveals
â traditional headache remedies do nât work
this is why we âd like to see greater diagnosis , so women can get the right treatment
â claire âs work was not the only thing that suffered
she often found herself saying to brendan : â not tonight , darling , i âve a headache â â and meaning it
â thank goodness he âs very understanding , â she says
her social life was often wrecked , too : â i âve had to regularly cancel social engagements , including a close friend âs baby shower
â claire saw various doctors : her gp , another for a second opinion , plus a consultant â but none came up with a treatment that worked completely
â all they suggested was that i take migraleve , but until i started taking it as a preventative measure it did nothing to help me
â dr jud pearson , at the national migraine centre , advises patients who suspect their headaches may be menstruation - related to start keeping a diary like claire
â i think women have always suspected they have menstrual migraines but doctors have not always believed them until now
â now , however , there is a growing awareness of the condition , which means more women are finally being diagnosed
â marie brown 47 , a dental company sales consultant living in milton keynes , buckinghamshire , has had migraines for more than a decade , but only found out two years ago they were linked to her menstrual cycle , thanks to the migraine diary she was keeping
marie brown , 47 , ( pictured ) has also suffered from severe migraines for more than ten years but only discovered two years ago that they are related to her periods she reveals : â the first migraine i suffered was in my late 30s , and even going from bed to bathroom caused agonising pain in my head
there were times i wondered whether the headaches were a symptom of something horribly sinister , such as a brain tumour
â only when the migraines became a monthly occurrence , at age 44 , did marie brown made the connection
she now has a supply of the migraine drug sumatriptan on hand to take on her â danger â days to prevent attacks
â it was such a relief to finally find something that worked for me
but if i do nât take a tablet in time , the ensuing migraine is hell
â even with the medication , she still plans her social life and work meetings around her periods
â i deliberately do nât book anything for the week of my period , as on so many occasions i âve had to bolt when a migraine has started
marie brown ( seen here age 27 ) uses medication to combat the headaches but still has to plan her social life and meetings around her periods â last new year âs eve i had to abandon dinner with my partner and go to bed at 10pm , when one came on
â unlike most women , i âm actually longing for the menopause in the hope that once my periods stop , so too will the migraines
â for sarah , 31 , a special educational needs support assistant who lives in croydon , surrey , with partner paul , 33 , a sales manager , and their son jack , two , the severity of monthly menstrual migraines was so great last easter that her gp sent her to a&e fearing she had a bleed on the brain
â i spent five days in hospital on morphine
a ct scan ruled out anything sinister , but i had felt as though my head would literally explode
it was so frightening , all i could think was my lovely little boy needs his mummy and what if something serious was happening to me ? â marie brown ( pictured ) suffered her first migraine in her late 30s , but they became a monthly occurrence when she reached 44 , at which point marie brown connected the pain to her menstrual cycle however , unlike many other women , sarah has suffered from menstrual migraines for all of the years of her adult life
â i first had the headaches at school but blamed exam stress for them
they worsened at university and my gp sent me to a neurologist
â he diagnosed migraines , but did nât link them to my cycle
â it was nât until i was talking to my great aunt , now in her 80s five years ago , that i realised the cause
she said she used to suffer terrible migraines during her period and suspected this was my problem , too
â after that , i used the period tracker deluxe mobile phone app to record my symptoms and periods and , sure enough , a pattern soon emerged
â subsequently i also tried homeopathy , specifically a herbal remedy called sepia , which is supposed to help problems associated with your period problems
â sarah is an extreme case
but , for many women , the stark facts are that a migraine is another monthly misery they have to endure .
