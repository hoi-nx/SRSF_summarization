lord mandelson said there was almost certainly going to be a ' stalemate hung parliament ' former cabinet minister lord mandelson has dismissed labour 's chances of winning a majority at the election
the labour peer said there was almost certainly going to be a ' stalemate hung parliament '
lord mandelson also stopped well short of offering his enthusiastic endorsement of miliband and once again attacked labour 's proposed ' mansion tax ' on expensive homes
he said the tax on properties worth over Â£ 2million would not ' in a month of sundays ' raise the Â£ 1.2 billion a year predicted by the labour leader
asked if the party would be doing better under another leader , the peer said : ' do you think your product would be better if you changed the wrapping ? it depends what you think people are voting for
' the tories seized on the former business secretary 's comments as proof that labour is relying on support from the snp to propel mr miliband into 10 downing street
looking ahead to the election during a speech at the retail week live conference in london , lord mandelson said : ' people basically are unhappy with what is on offer
' they are therefore shopping around in politics in a way that the large parties are ill - equipped to deal with and which will almost certainly deliver us a stalemate hung parliament in two months ' time
' answering questions after the speech , lord mandelson was asked if labour would be doing better in the polls ' if it had a leader the public liked better '
after a long pause , the labour peer replied : ' do you think your product would be better if you changed the wrapping ? ' it depends what you think people are voting for
people are voting for more than simply the personification of a party
' of course that is important , but they are voting for the party 's values and the party 's relevance , the quality of that product and whether they think that product - or in our case as politicians , that policy - will do for them
' of course , the leader has a responsibility for being the chief brand carrier of that product or policy
' i think you will see that , as the real election campaign gets under way , the leader of the labour will have the opportunities as well as the pressure to explain , get his message across and to draw others more towards him and the party in order to shape their voting decision
' lord mandelson stopped well short of offering his enthusiastic endorsement of miliband in a question and answer session today speaking later at a fabian conference in westminster , lord mandelson said he had been trying to make the point that people should not become ' infatuated with personality - driven media - obsessed politics ' which focus entirely on the identity of the leader
discussing the mansion tax , he said : ' not in a month of sundays will it raise the amount of money that is projected
everyone knows that it wo n't
' conservative party chairman grant shapps said : ' lord mandelson is confirming what we now all know - the only way miliband will get into downing street is if he 's carried there in alex salmond 's pocket
' that would mean more borrowing , higher taxes and weaker defences
hard - working taxpayers would pay the price for the resulting economic chaos and a weak leader who simply is n't up to the job of being prime minister
' fallon wrote to the labour leader demanding that he formally rule out a deal with the scottish nationalists miliband is facing mounting pressure to rule out negotiating with the snp over britain 's trident weapons system â after ministers announced Â£ 285million of new cash for the next generation of nuclear submarines
defence secretary fallon wrote to the labour leader demanding that he formally rule out a deal with the scottish nationalists
mr fallon said the labour leader could only make it to number 10 with the support of the snp , who want the next government to scrap britain 's nuclear deterrent
he wrote : ' in an increasingly dangerous world , maintaining britain 's continuous - at - sea nuclear deterrent , which has kept our nation safe for nearly 50 years , is paramount
' that 's why , today , i am announcing Â£ 285 million of investment to continue design work for the royal navy 's next generation of nuclear deterrent submarines
' he said the snp were putting the ' future of britain 's defences at risk '
mr fallon wrote : ' will you now end the speculation and confirm that a future labour government led by you will not enter into any kind of deal whatsoever with the snp â on trident , or any other issue ? ' if you do not , the britain people will conclude that you are willing to sacrifice britain 's national security just to get your hands on the keys to number 10
' the letter came after cameron claimed the former scottish first minister alex salmond would be ' calling the tune ' if mr miliband made it to downing street
in prime minister 's questions , mr cameron said labour was not hoping to win an outright majority any more
' they are just trying to crawl through the gates of downing street on the coat tails of the snp , ' he said
but mr miliband said there was ' only one person preparing for defeat and it is this prime minister ' .
