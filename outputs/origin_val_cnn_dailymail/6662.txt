an abandoned ohio mansion that was once the opulent home of heavyweight boxing champion tyson is being turned into a house of worship after a church splashed out $ 750,000 for the property
pastor nick of living word sanctuary has revealed that he and his congregation are delighted to have secured the 58 - acre property as their new home
he is especially pleased to have purchased the derelict mansion - still dripping with gold and marble - at the knockdown price of $ 750,000 , compared to the $ 1.3 million pricetag when tyson sold it in 1999
scroll down for more intimidating : the iron gates at the entrance to the derelict mansion in southington , ohio , still bear the name of the former heavyweight champ stagnant : the vast indoor swimming pool complex , the same size as many family homes , has also fallen into disrepair
it will now be filled in and become an area for sanctuary ' the skylights , arches , and windows in the pool area , it literally looks like a church , ' said pastor nick of his new home opulent : tyson 's jacuzzi hot tub features a mirrored ceiling , lashings of black marble and gold plated taps ' the skylights , arches , and windows in the pool area , it literally looks like a church , ' pastor nick told tmz
before worship can begin , the church is carrying out some rennovations and repairs including turning the former boxing glove - shaped swimming pool into an area for sanctuary
they also plan to renovate part of the land into a workout facility with a jogging path
the church , which only has a congregation of 140 , saved nine years worth of tithing donations to pay for their new home
the property was once home to the self - declared ' baddest man on the planet ' and the scene of many a wild party , but pastor nick says tyson is welcome to come and join the new owners for worship any time he likes
tyson lived in the 33,000 sq. ft. home in southington , ohio , during the late 1980s and 1990s until his dramatic fall from grace following a conviction for rape and financial problems

and while the iron gates inscribed with his name may now be shut , one photographer johnny , 24 , was allowed inside to explore the property
it features five bedrooms , several living spaces , seven and a half bathrooms , a full kitchen , a mini-kitchen / washroom , two attached garages , one external garage , full size pool and jacuzzi , tiger cages and a basketball court
tyson decked out the mansion with crystal chandeliers , a pool larger than most homes , tiger print carpet and everything else necessary to make it his private party pad
but now the property lies eerily quiet with just the shell of what was once home to the youngest boxer to win the wbc , wba and ibf heavyweight titles at age 20
photographer mr johnny , from cleveland , ohio , said : ' my journeys have taken me to some strange places but nothing quite like the abandoned home of a former professional boxer

' i knew tyson had once just hung out here and now i stood staring down everything that had been left behind
' i loved the bathroom simply because of the view and the mirrored ceiling above the jacuzzi tub
' but the pool was probably my favourite just because of how incredibly large it was and thinking how vibrant it was at one point in time
' the room was bigger than three of my houses , it was pretty incredible to look at while standing at one end
everything was so full of life and now simply collects dust
' as i wandered the halls and rooms i imagined the wild parties which must have taken place within these walls
' i looked across a living room once full of life but now empty of parties , tigers and celebrities
' the boxer was taken into custody in 1991 on allegations of rape and in 1992 a jury found him guilty with the ruling committing him to a six year prison sentence with four years of parole

because of his increasingly desperate financial situation he put the mansion up for sale and sold it in 1999 for $ 1.3m
it has since had multiple owners - including one who was the subject of an fbi investigation when he tried to sell it
the living word sanctuary bought the property in december 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015 , allowing johnny to explore before the work takes place
he added : ' i 've seen a few restorations throughout my work but nothing so contrasting as this
' but it 's definitely one of the more well - preserved structures i have been in through years of exploring and photographing abandoned places
' it makes a perfect candidate for the church to move into and build their sanctuary
structurally the home is wonderful and i ca n't wait to see the restoration completed over time
' the group would like for tyson to attend the first gathering inside the churches sanctuary
' i hope to help by sharing this story far and wide , maybe bringing his attention to this matter
it could be quite an experience for him walking through his former home , seeing it brought to a completely different light
