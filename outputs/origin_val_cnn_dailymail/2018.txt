a legendary and outspoken jewish comedian is blasting president obama â and the hollywood community â for letting israel twist in the wind following netanyahu 's stunning re-election on tuesday
in a radio interview set for broadcast on sunday , mason complains that obama ' does n't see that hamas is a problem
... he does n't care that they want to wipe us out
' ' i 'm not saying he is on the side of the people who literally want to wipe us out , ' mason cautioned , ' but if he 's not on their side , it 's certainly hard to tell which side he 's on
because you do n't hear him attacking the hamas half as much as he is attacking netanyahu
' mason phoned the tel aviv - based aaron klein investigative radio program from his home in new york
daily mail online heard an advance copy of the segment
scroll down for an audio clip biting : comedian mason lashed out at obama , saying ' you do n't hear him attacking hamas half as much as he is attacking netanyahu ' finger pointing : obama has been on a streak of aggressive reactions to israel prime minister netanyahu 's come - from - behind re-election on tuesday the sharp - tongued comedian focused on the white house 's continued objection to settlements build by the israel government in places the palestinian considers ' occupied ' territories
' how often have you heard him say " we have to do something because we have to put a stop to hamas 's aggressions " ? to hamas bombing israel every day ? to all the bombs that are falling ? ' mason asked
radio host aaron klein scored the interview with mason , who called the tel aviv - based program from his new york home ' i never heard him complain
you know what he complains about ? a settlement was extended
two more toilets were added to a certain settlement
and a kitchen was extended on the other side
' ' between the kitchen and the toilets , that 's creating the whole problem , ' he fumed
' and there 's too many kitchens and too many toilets
' he said obama 's ' design is to intimidate the prime minister of israel
... he wants a peace - making process that will leave hamas intact and [ so ] that the enemies of israel should n't be too disturbed
' ' " just because they want to squash israel or eliminate israel " , ' mason imagines obama saying , " there 's no reason why they should n't be given a chance to operate "
' the 83 - year - old had his claws out for hollywood as well , saying us 's entertainment moguls â even those who are jewish â tend to be aligned against israel
' the truth of the matter is that hollywood is basically anti-semitic , ' he claimed
' it 's hard to believe that a jewish organization like hollywood â hollywood was created by the jewish and they were the original creators of almost all the major studios of hollywood
... almost every studio is either a partner with a jew , or a jewish is a boss , or a jewish is involved in it
... the jewish were always attracted to show business
so what do you think happens ? ' victor : netanyahu 's likud party won enough seats in israel 's knesset to control a governing coalition for another four years â long past obama 's sell - by date in the white house no settling : hamas and other palestinian factions continue to clash with israel soldiers in ' occupied ' territories as they object to new housing erected by netanyahu 's government they 've changed their politics , he told aaron klein , ' as they became richer and richer without working for a living ... where else do you know a person who is not too bright , and never went to college or went to school and cant talk english and is a total moron or an idiot
and he becomes a star and two minute later he is getting $ 20 million a picture
' ' now we expect these people making $ 20 million a picture who are comparatively retarded â how will we expect them to suddenly make sense when it comes to the state of israel ? ' ' when you make this much money for nothing , you feel guilty and you feel like you have to prove you are a humanitarian
so you have to start forming organizations that help the underdog , ' mason said
' and they convince themselves that the palestinians are the underdogs
' ' how they became the underdogs nobody knows
but they feel they are being persecuted by the israel
because the israel are too successful
and they 've done too well
and they ca n't identify with people who are doing well because they feel guilty for making all this money for nothing so they have to help the underdog
