there are only two places on earth where tectonic plates are visible above sea level : kenya 's rift valley , and in the south west of iceland
on mount hengill , an active lava field , just outside ãingvellir national park , the striking ion hotel stands on a craggy outcrop close to where the north american and eurasian plates meet , drifting further and further apart , each year
boiling water bubbles just 25ft underground here , so when it was built on the site of a geothermal power plant , its creators had to use building materials seven times stronger than standard materials used in reykjavã­k
the striking ion hotel is situated on mount hengill , an active volcano whose last eruption was around 2,000 years ago the 45 - room hotel is an extension and renovation of the old workers ' quarters of the nesjavellir geothermal power station , bought in 2011 , with the intention of being the only hotel in this isolated - and beautiful - part of the country
ion makes use of iceland 's unique geography in two ways : the biothermal energy is harnessed in a spectacular outdoor natural hot spring ; and a glass building - the northern lights - allows guests to admire the frequent aurora borealis displays
owner sigurlaug sverrisdã³ttir , who was born and raised in the region , knows all too about extreme weather , and said the northern lights never get old
she says : ' this respect for mother nature is in our blood ; our parents and grandparents certainly knew not to mess with her
one month before i was born , in january 1973 , there was an eruption on the westman island , a small island south of iceland
a glass extension to the building - the northern lights - allows guests to admire the frequent aurora borealis displays ion is surrounded by natural hot springs , which provide geothermal hot water and energy to the hotel 's own natural outdoor pool rooms at the ion hotel start at Â£ 184 ( bed and breakfast ) go green offer tours green and sustainable tours of iceland for flights , see icelandair.co.uk ' overnight almost the entire island was covered in lava
the rescue to move the islanders to the mainland was successful mainly due to the fact that all of the fishing boats were in harbour as these as were too rough for the locals to fish
' the first boat left with habitants to reach the mainland only 30 minutes after the volcano erupted
even though i was born here , i âm still fascinated about the lava , moss landscape around ion
' i still feel amazed when i see the northern lights dancing in the sky on one of my late returns from work
even though you have experienced it several times before it is different when you are outside of the city , it 's much more intense
the northern lights bar has floor - to - ceiling glass windows on three sides , making it the perfect vantage point for watching aurora borealis inside , there 's a modern , natural aesthetic created by iceland wool throws , iceland art , and flower vases , hand - blown by local artists ' i also thrive from the energy ; i find immense power in the iceland nature
hence the reason we chose ion for the hotel 's name
' everything about the hotel screams iceland
inside , lava , reclaimed wood and iceland wool are used to furnish rooms , bathroom products are made from iceland herbs and everything from the bed linen to the restaurant is organic and fair trade , in line with the island 's strong emphasis on preserving its natural beauty
to experience the tectonic plates up close , the hotel offers snorkelling and diving trips to silfra , the world 's most easily accessible tectonic fissure , where visibility exceeds 330ft
it is here that you can touch the continents of america and europe at the same time
among the moss and lava : the ion hotel is designed to make use of and complement its rugged and beautiful surroundings the restaurant - aiming to be iceland 's first with a michelin star - serves up such delicacies such as reindeer , onions , spruce and bone marrow , smoked bone marrow ice cream , sea buckthorn and malt molasses and iceland langoustine , locally caught arctic char and skyr ( homemade yoghurt )
venturing into the wilderness , guests are offered a range of activities from horse riding in mountains around ãflus , fly fishing on lake ãingvellir , sã³lheimajã¶kull glacier tours , rafting and hot spring hikes
as well as excursions to the golden circle - south iceland 's most famous sightseeing route , which includes the waterfall gullfoss and the geothermally active valley of haukadalur , containing the strokkur geyser - which erupts every five to 10 minutes , guaranteeing an ' ooh ' or an ' ahh ' from an ever captive audience
the restaurant - aiming to be iceland 's first with a michelin star - serves up reindeer , iceland langoustine and arctic char the underwater silfra fissure : guests can snorkel and scuba dive here and can touch the tectonic plates of america and europe the geologically unstable rift valley of ãingvellir national park has few houses or hotels , due to its status as a national park iceland 's spectacular gullfoss waterfall is situated on the popular golden circle , a route tourists can arrange to travel through the hotel
