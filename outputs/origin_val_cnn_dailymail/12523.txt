dame maggie smith , whose tart - tongued lady violet crawley has most of the best lines on " downton , " caused a fuss this week when she implied that her beloved character wo n't be around much longer
" i mean , ( my character ) certainly ca n't keep going , " maggie smith told the times
" to my knowledge , i must be 110 by now
we 're into the late 1920s
" no more dowager countess ? ! ? you could almost hear the genteel wails of protest on both sides of the atlantic
the speculation about maggie smith was hurriedly squashed by a " downton " publicist , who said maggie smith , 80 , has agreed to stay with the series " for as long as the show runs
" but that did n't stop rumors about the demise of " downton " itself from continuing to crop up
maggie smith even hinted during her interview with the times that the next season of the hit show would be its last
" they say this is the last one , and i ca n't see how it could go on , " maggie smith let drop
creator julian fellowes is developing another period drama , " the gilded age , " for nbc and has been noncommittal about how much longer the show might endure beyond season six , which is filming now
" it wo n't go on forever -- i 'm not a believer in that , " he told the new york times in a recent interview
" but i ca n't immediately now tell you where the end will be
" it is hard to imagine " downton , " which just wrapped its fifth season on pbs in the american , without the wit and wisdom of lady violet , whose acerbic commentary leaves few around her unscathed
so let 's hope maggie smith just misspoke
and until season six , which airs this fall in the uk and early next year in the american , here are some of our favorite dowager countess zingers
-- isobel : " how you hate to be wrong
" lady violet : " i would n't know , i 'm not familiar with the sensation
" -- robert : " they do say there 's a wild man inside all of us
" lady violet : " if only he would stay inside
" -- isobel : " i admire it when young people stand up for their principles
" lady violet : " principles are like prayers ; noble , of course , but awkward at a party
" -- lady violet ( to cora ) : " i 'm so looking forward to seeing your mother again
when i 'm with her , i 'm reminded of the virtues of the english
" matthew : " but is n't she american ? " lady violet : " exactly
" -- isobel : " i take that as a compliment
" lady violet : " i must have said it wrong
