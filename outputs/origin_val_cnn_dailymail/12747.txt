might sound extreme , but breast cancer experts say she was spot on
" i understand what jolie did , and i would have done it , too , " said dr. brawley , the chief medical officer of the american cancer society
brawley said if he were jolie 's doctor he would have advised her to do what she did because her mother , aunt , and grandmother all had ovarian cancer , and her mother had breast cancer as well
plus , jolie has a gene that gives her about an 87 % chance of getting breast cancer sometime in her life
" she has one of the particularly bad breast cancer genes , " brawley said
the decision is made even easier by advances in breast reconstruction and by hormone treatments that help ease women into menopause , which is induced by removing the ovaries
the ovary surgery was a no - brainer , doctors say , and some wondered why she did n't do it sooner
in her op - ed , jolie explained that every year she 's had a blood test called ca-125 , to monitor for ovarian cancer
but that test often has false positives and false negatives , said dr. dr. olopade , director of the center for clinical cancer genetics at the university of chicago
" you really ca n't rely on it , " she said
instead of screening , experts in cancer genetics recommend that women at a very high risk for ovarian cancer , like jolie , remove their ovaries as soon as they 're done having children
" i ca n't emphasize enough how important this is , " olopade said
olopade was glad to hear tuesday morning that jolie had decided to move forward
" what she 's done is really important to save her life , because there 's no way to detect ovarian cancer , " she said
jolie 's decision about her breasts ( also documented in an op - ed ) , however , is not so clear cut , olopade explained , because it would have been perfectly acceptable if jolie had decided to keep her breasts and to get regular mris instead
" we have lots of survivors who went that route , and they 've done well , " she said
some made the decision to keep their breasts because they could n't afford a good plastic surgeon for breast reconstruction , she added
" celebrities have access to that kind of surgery , but that 's not the life everyone lives , " olopade said
brawley added that jolie 's decision likely would n't be right for someone with a different kind of breast cancer gene mutation
for example , some women have a mutation that gives them a 15 % chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime
that 's not much higher than the 12 % chance a woman has of getting breast cancer even if she has no mutation at all
he says he worries that some of these women with just a slightly increased risk will hear about jolie 's decision and want to remove their breasts , too
" to get surgery in their situation is really overkill , " he said
" most of these women would be just fine if they took tamoxifen for five years and got regular mammograms
" but all in all , doctors say they 're glad jolie has been so public with her decision making
" these very publicly shared medical sagas from respected figures play a very powerful role in creating these teachable moments , " said dr. ken offit , chief of clinical genetics at memorial sloan kettering cancer center
