the u.s. senate failed wednesday to override president obama 's veto of a bill approving construction of the controversial keystone
it 's expected to be the first of many confrontations between the republicans - controlled congress and the white house this year over energy policy
the 62 - 37 vote involved eight senate democrats voting with all 54 republicans
a ninth democrat , who also favors the pipeline project , missed the vote
at best , then , the north dakota gop would have needed four more democratic converts to override the veto and send the package to the white house for its own attempt
joe donnelly of indiana was the nonvoting supporter of the override
the same exact group of nine joined together earlier this year to give senate majority leader mitch mcconnell enough votes to pass the bill , dubbed 's
1 ' because it was the senate 's first order of business in january
already , the white house has issued more than a dozen veto threats on legislation favored by republicans lawmakers
the white house did not have an immediate comment on the vote , but senior adviser dan pfeiffer tweeted a rejoinder almost immediately
' it seems north dakota gop 's decision to spend most of their first couple of months in charge on keystone was not as good an idea as it seemed on paper , ' he wrote on twitter
obama himself told reuters in an interview monday that he would reach a final decision on the project by the end of his term , leaving wiggle room for a future deal
and danielle droitsch , canada project director at the natural resources defense council , vlaimed canada 's ' dirty tar sands oil pipeline is simply not in u.s. 's national interest
' proponents of the keystone bill have said since its introduction that they did n't have the two - thirds of the senate vote needed to override obama 's veto
they 've already been discussing other way to force the pipeline 's approval , either by attaching it onto must - pass spending bills or other , broader , energy legislation
' if we do n't win the battle today , we will win the war because we will find another bill to attach this pipeline to , ' said north dakota gop sen. john hoeven , the chief sponsor of the bill , before the vote
democrat heidi heitkamp , the state 's other senator , said afterward that ' more work remains to gather additional support for this project
' ' last congress i successfully recruited ten senate democrats to support keystone , ' she said , ' and i âm not one to back down from a fight
' mcconnell pleaded with senate democrats for more support of the bill , which he said advanced the president 's own priorities
' if you 're interested in jobs and infrastructure and saving your party from an extreme mistake , then join us , ' he said
' vote with us to override a partisan veto and help the president pursue priorities he 's advocated in the past
' obama has repeatedly resisted congress ' attempts to force his hand
short - lived : republicans signed their keystone bill on feb. 13 and sent it to the white house , but it came back to them with obama 's ' veto ' signature his veto of the bill , the third of his presidency , said that the bill circumvented longstanding and proven processes for determining whether cross-border pipelines serve the national interest and cuts short consideration of its effects
the $ 8 billion project would transport oil extracted from canada 's tar sands to pipelines linked to gulf coast refineries , and would also include some oil from north dakota
environmentalists have framed the pipeline as a test of obama 's commitment to address climate change , arguing that it would open up a path for tar sands oil to get to market
republicans have pushed the pipeline as a job - creating infrastructure project that will supply the u.s. with oil from a friendly neighbor , rather than unstable regimes
the state 's analysis found that the oil would be harvested regardless of whether the pipeline is built , a conclusion that the epa said needed to be re-examined given low oil prices
the same review said the pipeline would create thousands of jobs during construction , but ultimately it would require 35 permanent employees to maintain
state did not tackle an estimate of how many jobs the project might create in the petroelum industry as a new gusher of oil flows to the u.s. gulf coast .
