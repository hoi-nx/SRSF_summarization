england test captain cook could only make three runs as he opened the batting for mcc in their match against lv = county championship winners yorkshire in abu dhabi
having top - scored in mcc 's t20 defeat to sussex on friday , cook could not replicate his form as he was trapped lbw by sidebottom , with his side all out for 221 in their first innings
yorkshire 's reply started strongly and they ended day one on 82 for two , with lyth - the man who could partner cook on england test 's tour of the west indies - hitting an unbeaten half - century
cook was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in abu dhabi yorkshire 's sidebottom celebrates after trapping cook lbw for just three runs cook will now be able to see at the closest of quarters whether or not lyth has what it takes to occupy that spot in the wake of his first call - up earlier this week
sidebottom removed nick compton - someone who has partnered cook in tests - with the first ball of the match as the mcc captain edged a delivery into jonny bairstow 's gloves
cook soon followed nick compton back into the pavilion before carberry and james hildreth steadied the ship
james hildreth scored 89 to help mcc up to a score of 221 in their first innings in abu dhabi lyth was unbeaten on 53 as yorkshire closed day one on 82 for two in response the duo put on 74 for the third wicket before carberry fell for 36 , but james hildreth pushed on and made 89 before tim bresnan got him out lbw after lunch
daryl mitchell ( 54 ) and ansari ( 24 ) were the only others who could make it into double figures as the final five batsmen could only add five runs between them
lyth then took centre - stage as he started the yorkshire reply , although he lost fellow opener and captain alex lees as he was caught behind off the bowling of matt dunn for 11
the sheikh zayed stadium in abu dhabi is once again playing host to the floodlight contest a 72 - ball half - century from lyth kept the reigning champions ticking over until jack leaning was caught off ansari late in the day - with steven patterson brought in as night - watchman to see out the closing overs
he will return to the crease with lyth ( 53 not out ) on monday with yorkshire trailing by 139 runs with eight first - innings wickets in hand .
