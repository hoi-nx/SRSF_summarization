when on the bbc it was suggested to sunderland manager gus that the dvd of their thrashing at home by aston villa would n't make very edifying viewing , the phlegmatic gaffer replied ' you can not pick what you like to watch '
well , if gus tuned in to watch his centre half brown on all star family fortunes on sunday evening , he might well have decided to pick up the dvd of that aston villa game again , and stick it straight back in the recorder
playing against soap and strictly star jill halfpenny and her family , things were actually looking pretty good for the browns at the start
as in , before they 'd actually started playing
brown ( left ) appeared alongside his family in all star family fortunes , where his team lost heavily the browns appeared to have got host vernon onside early , but soon lost their advantage the halfpennys hail from the north east , while brown was playing a flat back four of sister , brother , wife and mother - in - law from manchester
this had the man in the middle , bolton 's own vernon , immediately looking to favour the team from the north west
but even with the man in black in their pocket , the browns were still about to have an absolute mare
and just like on saturday , it began badly , and just got worse
brown was first up at the buzzer with jill
and on beating her to the ball , suggested that the thing you 'd hang onto when it was windy was ' a railing '
and our survey said ... well , i 'll leave you to do the noise
so the halfpennys nipped in , and nicked the lead
yet a couple of the browns ' other answers - namely ' a child ' and ' the elderly ' - were n't far off , surely , from an actual correct answer ' somebody else ' ? brown is brushed off the ball by gabriel agbonlahor in one of two poor performances this week gus did n't enjoy watching his side 's defeat to aston villa , but brown 's tv appearance was even worse soap star jill halfpenny and her family made it a torrid weekend all round for the sunderland midfielder frankly , the fact the browns were n't surrounding the official on that one showed remarkable restraint on their part
then , before you could blink , the halfpennys had doubled their lead
and this time , it was very much through a brown own goal
who , as we had seen earlier in the show - when discovering about him from his family on a home video they 'd made - has his own mini cinema and a grand piano in the front hall
so it 's not all bad , eh ? the challenge this time was to name a small bird
' pigeon ' , said brown
vernon did his best for him
' compared to an ostrich ' was how he defended the defender 's answer , but suffice to say ... that noise again
yet amazingly , there was arguably worse to come
the next question had the browns pondering a variety of potential trouser malfunctions you might have while wearing a pair at work
brown shares a joke with the host , but he failed to produce the goods on the pitch or the telly this week i 'm writing this sentence here now to give you a bit of time to think about a few possible answers for yourselves
i 'll even point out , to give you a little more time , that vernon did acknowledge that wearing trousers at work was not exactly in brown ' area of expertise
brown said ' they 'd changed colour '
anyone else out there ? anyone ? frankly , this was turning into a rout
so even brown was probably grateful when vernon took time out to ask everyone to join him for a song from brown ' favourite musical - which happens to be the sound of music
that 's right , brown 's fellow footballers
just in case you think you might want to remind him of the fact next time you 're with him in a dressing room or on the field of play
the sunderland defender did however manage to raise plenty of money for charity perhaps something along the lines of the fact that he clearly could n't von trapp a house brick ? no , too much knowledge , that
brown did finally get off the mark with a correct answer about lying on a dating website , but when you looked up at the scoreboard come the end of the game , it was still something like 581 the halfpennys , but most certainly the browns close to nil
in the end then though , the plucky , affable footballer and his family still managed to raise money for their chosen charity
and did at least give it a bit of a go in the process
but all i can say if that if gus had been in charge of this team 's performance , chances are he 'd have cleared his desk at the training ground and said goodbye to the players before you 'd even had the chance to read this
no big deal though , brown
put that one behind you
you can fix it in the next game
you 're away at only connect .
