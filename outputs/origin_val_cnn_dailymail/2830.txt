the region of molina de aragon , in central eastern spain , is as barren as it is beautiful
since the 1950s and continuing through to today , the process of de-industrialisation and de-population has left behind a vast region of central eastern spain that is infamous for its staggeringly low number of inhabitants
in fact , there are so few people who live in these particular municipalities that the area now competes with siberia and the arctic provinces of lapland as the least populated zone in europe
spanish photographer , david ramos , captured images of the de-industrialisation and de-population occurring in central eastern spain despite the barren landscape , agriculture and ranching remain the main economic sources all around the vast region
the square footage of the underpopulated central eastern spain region is as large as austria , and just two hours drive from madrid
quickly becoming known as europe 's largest desert - at least in terms of population - the area is made up of the provinces of soria , guadalajara , teruel and cuenca
and the population that remains is aging
currently , 41 percent of the whole population is over 65 years of age , while a shocking eight per cent is under the age of 15
