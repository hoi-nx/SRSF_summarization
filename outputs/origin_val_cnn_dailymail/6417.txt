scott peterson horrified the nation when he was convicted 10 years ago for murdering his 8 - months - pregnant wife laci and their unborn son conner
while he was sentenced to death for the crime , the likelihood that the 42 - year - old will actually be executed is unlikely in california where the last death row inmate was killed in 2006
perhaps most shocking though is the fact that scott peterson lives a relatively ' cushy ' life at the bay area 's 163 - year - old san quentin - which houses the largest death row population in the nation

nancy mulane says scott peterson is living in an ' exclusive ' part of the historic prison , in a single cell with the ability to socialize with other prisoners on a roof deck with a half basketball court
' i saw this quite , i would have to say , buff - looking young man with his shirt off , ' nancy mulane said
' and he was playing basketball
he looked like you were watching some college athletes out on a neighborhood court play basketball
' ' you 've been around a lot of prisons , ' fox news ' geraldo rivera remarked
' it sounds to me like what you describe is the cushiest environment that you 've seen
' nancy mulane went on to add that there are many death row prisoners in california who spend 23 of the 24 hours in a day locked in their cells
' they are not having the life scott peterson is having

gruesome : scott peterson ( left ) was convicted in 2005 of murdering his wife laci ( right ) when she was 8 - months - pregnant with their son conner heartless : laci 's body and that of her unborn fetus washed up on the san francisco bay shoreline a little more than three months after she went missing
above , scott peterson looking unconcerned in his mugshot and in court life in prison ? scott peterson was sentenced to death for the murder , but his execution looks unlikely in california where a death row inmate has n't been killed since 2006 scott peterson 's comfortable accommodations add insult to laci and conner 's deaths , since he has also shown no remorse for the crime
laci was reported missing on december 24 , 2002
in the early days of the search , family and friends supported her husband scott peterson , believing he had nothing to do with her disappearance
but that changed when it was revealed less than a month later that scott peterson had been having extramarital affairs , and had even struck up a relationship with a massage therapist who did n't even know he was married
the fetus of the scott peterson 's unborn child was found in april 2003 , after washing up on the shoreline of san francisco bay north of the berkeley marina
the next day , a woman 's torso belonging to laci was also recovered
prosecutors argued that the state the bodies were in indicated that laci was suffocated or strangled to death
scott peterson was sentenced to death on march 16 , 2005 for the crime , with the judge calling the murder of laci ' cruel , heartless and callous ' .
