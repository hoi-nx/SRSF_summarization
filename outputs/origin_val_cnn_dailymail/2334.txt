a stag party were ordered off a flight bound for spanish after they were accused of being ' disruptive ' and reducing an air steward to tears because of their behaviour
the group of 20 revellers from wrexham in north wales said they had paid more than Â£ 4,000 for the weekend break to benidorm , in order to celebrate wayne roberts ' wedding next month
after they made a male flight attendant cry , the pilot called the police and ordered the party to leave the plane - which was due to take off from manchester airport and fly to alicante
ryanair defended the decision and said it ' will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time
' a group of 20 men who were due to go on a stag do to benidorm were thrown off a ryanair flight after they boarded at manchester airport , following claims their behaviour was ' disruptive
' the group claim they have lost Â£ 4,000 between them after they were forced to get off the plane and celebrate in wrexham instead the incident took place friday , march 13 , after the 20 strong group boarded the plane
police were called , with some members of the group removed and others leaving voluntarily
one of the group , jones , 32 , who lost around Â£ 200 , said : ' we had a bite to eat and a beer and got on the plane
' no one was drunk
we were not wearing stag t - shirts or being loud or offensive
we took our seats and were talking in groups , as you do
' about five to ten minutes later , we heard a whisper the police had been called to kick someone off
we had no idea it was us
' we had been joking around , saying how embarrassing it would be for the person , and the next thing the officers came up to us and asked us to leave
' they claim they received no warnings before being ordered off the flight
according to the group , a male steward said he ' could n't cope ' with them and broke down in tears
mr jones added : ' the police did try reasoning with him but the captain then came out and put his arm round the steward and said he would n't fly with us on board
' ryanair backed the decision and said it would not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour on any of its flight he claimed police told them to go and book another flight because they were not overly drunk but there were none left that evening
the group went back to wrexham in an attempt to salvage the celebrations
the planned trip was meant to be similar to a previous stag party they had all gone on , when they travelled to prague last year
it is understood every member of the party - including the ' devastated ' groom , have now made formal complaints to the budget airline about their treatment
a spokesman for ryanair denied the group was treated unfairly
he said : ' the crew of this flight from manchester airport to alicante requested police assistance prior to departure after a number of customers became disruptive during the boarding process
' greater manchester police removed a number of individuals from the aircraft , while others disembarked voluntarily
' ryanair apologised to the other customers for the slight delay to their flight departure , but reaffirmed that the safety and comfort of its customers , crew and aircraft is its priority
' ryanair will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time
' a spokesman for greater manchester police said : ' officers attended and , as requested , the group left the aeroplane in a peaceful manner
' no offences were committed
' british visitors on a spanish news website backed the airline 's tough action

' another briton , steve , said : ' quite right too
