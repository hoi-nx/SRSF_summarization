cristiano ronaldo scored his 30th league goal of the season but could nât prevent real madrid dropping two points in a 1 - 1 draw with villarreal
he is now only one goal from his tally for last season with 12 games left and has become the first striker to score 30 goals a season for the fifth consecutive campaign in one of europe âs top leagues but he left the pitch annoyed at real madrid âs failure to pull away from barcelona at the top of la liga
they are now just two points clear of their rivals with a trip to the camp nou later this month still to come

the arsenal loanee was bundled over by pepe in one of villarreal âs first attacks and from the free - kick the visitors won a corner which led to their first clear cut chance
it fell to gerard moreno but with only casillas to beat he shot straight at spain keeper
when the rebound ran to moi gomez his effort was dived - headed to safety by dani carvajal
the keeper congratulated the full - back â both had saved certain goals
gareth bale was seeing plenty of the ball down the real madrid right although he was at times handicapped by his preference for crossing with his left
he should have been awarded a penalty when jaume costa grabbed his arm at a corner and stopped him taking off to connect with toni kroos â kick
it was a spot - kick but the referee waved away the welshman âs appeal
from another toni kroos corner on the half hour gareth bale this time jumped unimpeded and headed just wide
varane came even closer shaving the post from another corner kick as real madrid pushed for the opening goal
as the half went on real madrid took more and more risks with marcelo flying forward and throwing himself at an isco pass but failing to connect effectively
gareth bale then hit the top of asenjo âs bar with a cross-shot from the right and cristiano ronaldo blasted a free - kick over from 35 - yards
cristiano ronaldo fights for the ball with sergio marcos as real madrid found villarreal difficult to break down at the bernabeu on sunday night karim benzema gets up above villarreal defensive pair chechu dorado and ericn bailly but he could n't direct his header past asenjo ronaldo apologies to marcelo after failing to play the brazilian in when well - placed during a frustrating night for the european champions villarreal had defended well and for the first time in the league since august real madrid went down the tunnel at half - time with the score at 0 - 0
the bernabeu crowd had not helped with the usual nervous whistles for gareth bale when one of his passes went astray
he had shown more than most for the home side and in the second half his pass to cristiano ronaldo brought about the opening goal
as the ball was played in eric bailey tried to take the portuguese for a dance grabbing him around the waist and and spinning him around
the referee pointed to the spot and cristiano ronaldo stepped up to score goal number 30 in the league this season
he could have got his second moments later from another gareth bale assist but this time asenjo blocked the effort and took an accidental cristiano ronaldo knee to his face in the process
cristiano ronaldo then returned the favour to gareth bale but the he pulled his shot high and wide
real madrid now looked in complete control having broken villarreal âs dogged resistance but they were in for a shock
with a sweeping eight - pass move from one end of the pitch to the other villarreal went from keeper asenjo to striker gerard moreno who leveled the scores
he played a one - two on the edge of the real madrid area with substitute luciano vietto and shot past casillas to silence the bernabeu
tomas pina keeps a close eye on the world player of the year , who was not at his best against the yellow submarine ronaldo probes at the villarreal defence , but he and his expensively assembled team - mates struggled to find a way through gareth bale failed to have much of an impact , with the exception of one cross which looped up onto the crossbar late in the first half toni kroos expresses his frustration as real madrid missed the chance to extend their lead over barcelona to four points real madrid were almost back in front from their next attack but when cristiano ronaldo ran on to isco âs pass and shot goalwards asenjo blocked the effort
gareth bale then crossed from the right and cristiano ronaldo rose highest in the area but against asenjo made the save brilliantly tipping the ball over his bar
carlo ancelotti risked the wrath of the bernabeu by taking off fans favourite isco to put on asier illaramendi and he even threw on chicharito for karim benzema but chicharito failed to make a difference going down dramatically in the area but not convincing the referee to point to the spot
vietto fell over when clean through with only casillas to beat and he then saw the spain keeper brilliantly turn away his diving header
for real jese shot wide with the goal gaping after asenjo dropped the ball but a point was the very least villarreal deserved
juame costa goes to ground in an attempt to stop gareth bale getting past him , but the welshman got the better of the defender gareth bale gets up above three defenders , but for all their chances real were unable to find a crucial winning goal
