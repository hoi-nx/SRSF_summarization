i had been a little moody beforehand but i just put that down to lack of sleep from having amber
' when kirsty parker told her partner lee wren on the phone what had happened he said he did not believe her
lee , 34 , said : ' i thought she was joking , it was just a complete shock
' ruby is sister to kirsty parker 's daughter crystal stevenson , seven , lee 's two sons harry , five , and ronnie , four , and the couple 's baby ambe , nine months
kirsty parker 's mother said : ' it 's all quite a shock but i think there are some things in life you can control and this is not one of them

' i had my first child crystal who was born eight weeks early on the bathroom floor
that was a shock but i knew i was pregnant with her - and with amber - but on neither occasion did i know i was in labour
' kirsty parker said she did not have any morning sickness - and thought she had just struggled shifting the baby weight from amber 's birth nine months previously
she said : ' if i knew i was pregnant there are things i would have done differently
' i would not have had any coffee or egg mayonnaise
i am very good when i am pregnant and fortunately i am not a very big drinker anyway
' i did feel guilty about some of these things but both lee and my mum said i should n't as i had no idea i was pregnant
