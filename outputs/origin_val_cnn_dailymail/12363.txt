sony pictures is expanding its " ghostbusters " movies with ghost corps , a collective headed by original " ghostbusters " director reitman and star dan aykroyd , that will oversee the expansion of the movie franchise beyond a cinematic universe into television and merchandising
the first order of business will be to develop a new male - oriented " ghostbusters " that will be released after the much ballyhooed female - centric movie being put together by paul feig
the movie , which is to star kirsten wiig and melissa mccarthy , shoots this summer and will be released july 22 , 2016
new all - female ' ghostbusters ' cast chosen g.i. joe and anthony russo , the duo behind " captain america : the winter soldier " and who signed a first - look deal with sony pictures last week , are being tapped to produce and direct the new movie
drew pearce , who penned " iron man 3 " , will write the script while channing tatum , another sony pictures favorite after the 22 jump street movies , will also produce with his partners reid carolin and peter kiernan
if all goes as planned , channing tatum would also star in the movie
read the original 1984 thr review of ' ghostbusters ' reitman will also produce the new movie
sony pictures is one of the studios less franchise - rich than others , such as disney or warner bros. or even paramount , which is cranking out " transformers " and " g.i. joe " movies
female ghostbusters ? why studios want more women - led blockbusters how seriously is sony pictures taking this ? enough that reitman is moving his entire staff of his production banner the montecito picture co. onto the studio lot to focus on this endeavor
montecito and ghost corps will be separate entities , however
