three and a half decades after calling for homosexuals to be stoned , former bju president bob jones iii has apologized
" i take personal ownership of this inflammatory rhetoric , " bob jones iii said
" this reckless statement was made in the heat of a political controversy 35 years ago
" the weekend apology came days after the conservative christian school in south carolina received a petition asking for an apology for a statement bob jones iii made to the associated press in 1980 at the white house
" i 'm sure this will be greatly misquoted , " bob jones iii said at the time
" but it would not be a bad idea to bring the swift justice today that was brought in israel 's day against murder and rape and homosexuality
i guarantee it would solve the problem post-haste if homosexuals were stoned , if murderers were immediately killed as the bible commands
" when he made the comments , bob jones iii was part of a group of fundamentalist ministers who went to the white house with 70,000 signatures on a petition opposed to extending provisions of the civil rights act to homosexuals
" upon now reading these long - forgotten words , they seem to me as words belonging to a total stranger -- were my name not attached , " bob jones iii said in saturday 's statement
" i can not erase them , but wish i could , because they do not represent the belief of my heart or the content of my preaching
" bju has long been a center of controversy for its fundamentalist stances
in 1975 , the school adopted rules banning interracial dating
bju received national attention on the issue in 2000 when george w. bush , then a presidential candidate , visited the campus
the uproar over the ban prompted the school to drop it
the petition by bjunity , a group that bills itself as a network " for lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer , questioning , intersex and straight affirming people affected by fundamentalist christianity , " garnered more than 1,900 signatures
" we are grateful that bob jones iii has taken responsibility for these words ; words that have caused deep harm for many more people than any of us knows , " the group 's website said
" this means a lot to us because it represents the beginning of a change in the rhetoric and conversation
