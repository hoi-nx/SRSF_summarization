musgrove had 30 days to find Â£ 140,000 so her son kian could fly to the u.s and have his neuroblastoma treated
she was struggling to raise the final bit of money until an anonymous donor from luxembourg stepped in
kian musgrove , two , will receive revolutionary treatment for his rare cancer after a mystery benefactor donated Â£ 40,000 neuroblastoma is the cancer of specialised nerve cells , also known as neural crest cells
it is the second most common childhood tumour
the symptoms range from tiredness to lack of appetite and pain in the bones
most children who are diagnosed with the condition are younger than five years old
treatment includes surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy and antibody treatment
almost half of neuroblastoma cases are an aggressive form and , despite very intensive treatment , it has a high chance of returning
it affects around 100 children every year
the 27 - year - old , from newcastle , said : ' i ca n't believe it
there was a note with the money saying " good luck to your son "
' i still ca n't get my head around it
i keep looking to make sure the money is actually there
' kian will fly to michigan for the treatment on march 31
he was first diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma on october 31 , 2013 , after doctors discovered 27 tumours around his kidneys and in his bones
despite chemotherapy and numerous operations kian still had an 80 per cent chance the cancer would return , doctors said
the new trial treatment - called dfmo - aims to prevent the cancer returning by stopping a certain cell that creates the neuroblastoma cell
his mother kat ( centre ) had just 30 days to find Â£ 140,000 so kian could fly to michigan and have the trial treatment

ms musgrove , who is in the process of booking her flights , said : ' i 'm so excited by what has happened , people have just been incredible
' i want this for kian so much and i want this to work so badly
' but i 'm also scared
scared because i 'm flying over there alone , not knowing what the future is going to hold
