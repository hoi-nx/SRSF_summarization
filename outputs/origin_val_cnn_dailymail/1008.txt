this is the shocking moment a death - wish driver risked disaster as he raced under closing level crossing gates with a horse box in tow
the jaw - dropping drama was captured on camera at a level crossing in colchester , essex
with drivers sat waiting patiently in traffic , a mad motorist in a ford ranger pick - up truck can be seen overtaking the queuing cars on the wrong side of the road whilst red warning lights are flashing
had the pickup been a couple of seconds slower , it would have got stuck on the railway track and caused a horrific crash with an oncoming passenger train just moments away
the incident was captured by a fixed onboard video camera on goodyer 's work van
the 43 - year - old security company sales director shared the footage on facebook and has said he is willing to give the details to police
' i could not believe what i was seeing , ' mr.goodyer said
' the drivers were all sat waiting patiently in a queue as we had to stop to avoid ending up on the train track
had the pickup been a couple of seconds slower , it would have got stuck on the railway track and caused a horrific crash with an oncoming passenger train just moments away the automated level crossing is at east gates and crosses a railway which connects the main station with the smaller colchester town station ' suddenly the guy behind me in his pick - up truck with horse box pulled out and overtook me on the wrong side of the road
' the lights had started to flash yet he decided to jump it - the barrier was coming down and he could have got trapped and stuck on the railway line
' it was an absolutely crazy thing to do and i am just pleased it did not end up with more serious consequences
' the incident took place just after 8am , although mr goodyer 's clock time shown on the screen incorrectly shows 5.08pm
mr. goodyer added : ' we have video cameras positioned on our works ' vans which capture four hours of footage in short bursts and that 's why i caught it
' i was so shocked by what i had seen that i put it on facebook to show other people just what a crazy act this was
' i 've had contact from people all over the world since i posted it , so the word of what happened is clearly spreading
' i 've also got the registration details of the van should the police want them
