after little more than an hour of a match that was proving difficult for liverpool , jordan henderson removed the captain âs armband from his left bicep and handed it to gerrard
he did so out of respect
he did so because he recognises that a player who only joined this contest as a second - half substitute remains arguably the finest to have represented the club
but four minutes after the exchange of that iconic piece of elastic came a moment when gerrard might have felt it appropriate to hand it back
jordan henderson scored a second - half winner for liverpool as they continued their impressive recent form jordan henderson runs off to celebrate his winner that moved liverpool within two points of the premier league 's top four a delighted jordan henderson let out a roar for the liverpool fans in the liberty stadium jordan henderson 's shot was deflected over the top of swansea goalkeeper fabianski 's head and into the back of the net jordan henderson was mobbed by his team - mates after scoring what proved to be the winner in wales swansea : fabianski 6 , kyle naughton 6.5 , amat 7 , ashley williams 7 , neil taylor 6.5 , sung-yueng ki 6 ( dyer 80 ) , cork 6.5 , jonjo shelvey 7 , gomis 7.5 , sigurdsson 7 ( emnes 89 ) , routledge 6 ( montero 73 )

ref : roger east ( wiltshire ) ratings by dominic king jordan henderson , whose heat map is shown above , produced another commanding performance in liverpool 's midfield-click here for match zone it was then , 68 minutes into this contest , that jordan henderson did something that has long been synonymous with gerrard : he came to liverpool âs rescue
if it lacked finesse , and owed more to good fortune , a winning goal that narrowed the gap to manchester united in the fierce battle for champions league places owed everything to jordan henderson âs desire and determination
it was an ugly goal , amat âs attempted clearance spinning off jordan henderson âs shin and flying beyond the reach of fabianski
but it was jordan henderson who made the run in pursuit of sturridge âs flick - on and jordan henderson , after a stuttering first half , who had given liverpool impetus with his ambition and endeavour after the break
the goal was jordan henderson 's third in the last three premier league games after his strikes against manchester city and burnley liverpool recorded their fifth successive premier league victory ahead of their huge clash against manchester united on sunday jordan henderson clattered into jonjo shelvey with this kick to the head after just 16 seconds but roger east opted not to even book him
if gerrard had an impact , it was his deployment as a holding midfielder that allowed jordan henderson to get forward
and the fact the goal came so soon after gerrard âs first appearance in eight games reflected well , once again , on brendan rodgers
brendan rodgers deserves enormous credit for the run of results liverpool are enjoying
it is now 13 games unbeaten since they lost at old trafford in december and six away from home in the league without conceding a goal , an achievement that equals the club record set by emlyn hughes and co in 1972
brendan rodgers has succeeded where some of his counterparts have failed in addressing the problems of a struggling side
it has been tactically astute leadership
but brendan rodgers also needed players to step out of gerrard âs shadow and prove they can survive without him
nobody has met that challenge with more authority than a young midfielder in jordan henderson now reflecting on three goals in liverpool âs last three games
the pressure was on here with sunday âs game against manchester united at anfield and a trip to arsenal to follow
and against a swansea side displaying a find blend of ambition and graft under the guidance of monk , liverpool struggled in that opening 45 minutes
monk might have been the managerial apprentice but brendan rodgers would have recognised how well swansea âs players had mastered their boss âs instructions
they were excellent , using the pace and power of gomis to good effect
liverpool goalkeeper mignolet makes a full - stretch save to deny swansea 's sigurdsson a goal in the first half liverpool 's belgian goalkeeper mignolet had to make a number of important stops in the first half as swansea piled on the pressure swansea midfielder routledge evades a challenge from liverpool midfielder jordan henderson liverpool , by contrast , were disappointing , with jordan henderson among those losing possession far too cheaply
gerrard brought much - needed composure to liverpool âs midfield
given how well liverpool had been playing , the decision to omit gerrard from the line - up was understandable
he had been injured , after all
and liverpool started with their usual intensity , the pressing game that is designed to dominate their opponents and stop them playing
but swansea were managing to attack effectively on the counter , with gomis accelerating past emre can only for joe allen to make an important interception
in the end ki sung-yueng had a real chance to score but his header was weak and cleared by the outstanding skrtel
liverpool 's raheem sterling takes on swansea left back neil taylor at the liberty stadium jordan henderson hands the captain 's armband to gerrard after he came off the bench for liverpool in the second half jordan henderson looks set to be in charge of the armband for the long term when gerrard leaves anfield at the end of the season gerrard made a return from injury as he came on in the second half of the premier league clash in south wales monk rues missed chances liverpool have kept six straight away clean sheets in the top - flight for the third time in their history , and the first since 1972
the other run came in 1966
skrtel would make another headed clearance to deny gomis , who had escaped the clutches of the liverpool back four to meet a cross from kyle naughton with a better header
swansea were dominating possession and gomis was proving a proper threat
a neat one - two with routledge and he was through on goal with only mignolet to beat , but much to monk âs dismay his shot was scuffed and liverpool âs goalkeeper made the save
an effort from philippe coutinho aside â it was gathered neatly by fabianski â liverpool offered little in response
liverpool striker sturridge tries to wriggle away from a challenge from swansea 's jack cork swansea 's sung-yueng ki drifts away from liverpool 's philippe coutinho , who loses his footing liverpool defender skrtel clears the ball under pressure from swansea centre back ashley williams swansea were offering plenty , mignolet making a hugely impressive diving save to deny sigurdsson before adam lallana diverted a powerful strike from jonjo shelvey to safety with a courageous header
but after the interval liverpool were better â there was more urgency , more composure , with jordan henderson very much at the centre of things , even if the arrival of gerrard from the bench was important
that gave jordan henderson freedom to bomb on and in the 68th minute he chased a fine ball forward from skrtel that was diverted into the swansea box by sturridge
sigurdsson attempts a shot from distance for swansea as joe allen and mamadou sakho attempt to close him down amat and jordan henderson gave chase , with amat winning the race but not the contest
it was tough on swansea and monk
brendan rodgers would have admired his former student for the way he prepared his team
until jordan henderson âs goal , they looked the more likely winners
but liverpool , rather like jordan henderson at that crucial moment , have what teams need come the business end of the season : momentum
so much so that they almost scored again moments before the final whistle , sturridge sending his shot against a post .
