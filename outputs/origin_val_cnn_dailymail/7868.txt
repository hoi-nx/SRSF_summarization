a major player in online travel has finally ' fallen into line ' by removing excess credit card charges two years after the rba ruled that surcharges should be limited to â reasonable costs â
online booking agent wotif confirmed they are dumping their $ 5.50 hotel booking fee which could put some $ 20 million dollars back into the pockets of australian consumers
they are also removing credit card costs and surcharges on full service flights that would have set consumers back $ 16.95 however they will keep a surcharge on low cost airlines of $ 9.95 per person
wotif have dumped excess booking fees which could save australian $ 20 million a year while wotif has been praised for the move , consumers who expected to see a drop in prices may be disappointed as the company is believed to have increased the commission levied on accommodation for bookings made via its website from 12 to 15 per cent , reported newscorp
godfrey thinks there needs to be a regulatory body to stop companies from charging exorbitant prices for using a credit card or booking online godfrey from choice told daily mail australia that an increase in commission prices could be an effort to further ' fleece ' customers in a bid to offset losses from dropping the controversial credit card fees
wotif said the change is not a bid to recoup costs lost by the surcharge but a reflection on their recent acquisition by competing company expedia
mr godfrey said the rise in commission will increase up front costs of travel however the removal of the credit card surcharging is win for consumers and a clear warning to other companies who continue to â flout â the ban on excessive charges
â it âs great to see consumers unite to drive change because it sends clear signal to businesses that we are n't happy
â he said excessive credit card charges are costing australian âs over a billion dollars a year , with some of the â worst offenders â being qantas , jetstar , virgin and tiger
â people are sick and tired of being ripped off by the top end of town , ' he said
bartosch , the business man responsible for an anti surcharge petition that 's been signed by over 100,000 people , welcomes the change and agrees this move puts more pressure on other major players to respond to ' consumer sentiment ' by removing ' outrageous fees '
' no where else in the world does this exist , ' he said
mr bartosch started an online petition to stop airlines and travel companies from taking advantage of consumers by charging ' ridiculous ' amounts for using credit cards mr bartosch said prices are ' misleading ' and not an accurate reflection of what businesses are actually paying to use credit cards
' they are just plucking these figures from their backsides to rip of consumers , ' he told daily mail australia
choice recently released a report that shows merchants are only paying around 0.8 per cent for visa and mastercard and 2 per cent for prestige cards like america express and diners club
according to the latest research data made available by mastercard , australian consumers are being surcharged about $ 1.6 billion each year
qantas , tiger , jetstar and virgin continue to flout the ban on excessive credit card surcharges mr bartosch believes these numbers prove that australian 's are facing excessive surcharges and that companies ' can not be trusted to self regulate '
choice have also called for a regulator who have explicit legal power to limit credit card surcharges
according to mr godfrey excessive surcharging needs to be regulated by a body with the power to demand evidence of fair pricing and subsequently enforce significant penalties for non compliance
' for too long hotels and airlines have been thumbing their nose at the government and there needs to be a regulatory body who have more power to enforce the ban , ' mr godfrey said .
