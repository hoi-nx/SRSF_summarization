this is the heartbreaking moment a four - year - old syria girl ' surrendered ' to a photographer when she mistook the man 's camera for a gun
taken at the atmen refugee camp on syria 's border with turkish last december , the image shows the young girl frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed
the child has been identified as adi hudea , whose father died in the 2012 hama massacre and who has been living with her traumatised mother and three siblings at camp atmen ever since
palestine - based photojournalist shaban tweeted the image along with the caption : ' thought he has a weapon not a camera so she gave up '
turkish media researching the origins of the photograph later suggested adi hudea was a four - year - old boy , not a girl , and revealed he was a resident of the atmen refugee in syria
but bbc trending have subsequently spoken to osman sagirli himself who confirmed the image shows a little girl
ms shaban 's tweet has since been reposted more than 14,000 times and prompted emotional responses from social media users
one wrote : ' i 'm actually weeping seeing this
we 've made this planet a horrible place , have n't we ? ' , as another said : ' we are failing the younger generations and those still to come
