the fa are set to decide evans âs fate today after the united defender denied allegations of spitting at newcastle striker cisse
a disciplinary hearing was hastily set up last night after evans confirmed his intention to fight the charge which will carry a six - game ban if he is found guilty
the fa wanted to make sure the matter was dealt with swiftly before the northern ireland international played in united âs fa cup quarter - final clash with arsenal at old trafford on monday night
evans has decided to contest the fa charge of spitting on newcastle forward cisse evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the newcastle striker , who then retaliates evans and cisse clash near the half - way line at st james â park following the unpleasant exchange arsenal ( h ) , monday ; tottenham ( h ) , march 15 ; liverpool ( a ) , march 22 ; aston villa ( h ) , april 4 ; manchester city ( h ) april 12 ; chelsea ( a ) april 18
they tweeted confirmation of evans âs decision on friday , just over an hour after the 6pm deadline he had been given to respond to the charge
it read : â united âs evans denies fa charge in relation to incident involving cisse
independent regulatory commission hearing tonight , decision expected tomorrow
â it is understood that united will submit video evidence to support evans âs claim that he did not spit directly at cisse
both players were charged over the unsavoury incident in united âs 1 - 0 win at st james â park on wednesday night
cisse issued a public apology and accepted his guilt , triggering an immediate seven - match ban
the senegal striker âs suspension is one game longer because he had already served a three - match ban earlier this season
evans was expected to contest the charge after issuing a statement on thursday denying any knowledge of a spitting incident , which followed a tackle between the two players in the first half
he said : â having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night âs match
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at cisse
â i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor
cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the fa on thursday tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from newcastle and united gather on the pitch cisse was banned for an extra game after being sent off for elbowing seamus coleman in december â during the game cisse and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting
â it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do
it is certainly not something that i did last night
â united boss louis van gaal also defended his player , insisting that he believed evans âs version of events
spitting is understandably reviled among the majority of premier league players , but stoke striker walters mounted a surprisingly robust objection on friday by threatening to leave any opponent who targeted him in such a manner â eating through a straw â
the fa are unlikely to take any action against walters but will not welcome any talk of physical violence on the pitch
walters told talksport : â as a player you take anything off the ball ; pinches and kicks that are meant to wind you up
little things like that go on in any match
â but spitting is pretty low
if it happened to me and someone spat at my face or towards me then i think he âd be eating his supper through a straw that night
i would nât be that happy
it âs the lowest of the low
