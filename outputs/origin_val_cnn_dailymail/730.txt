a businessman who once owned the world 's most expensive home but was then exposed as a fraudster has failed in his claim to claw back Â£ 66million from the taxpayer after his mansion was seized by the state
baljit singh bhandal bought and developed updown court , a 100 - room mansion in surrey , using the proceeds from money laundering and evading tax on alcohol sales

however , today a high court judge told him he was not entitled to compensation because it was ' beyond any reasonable doubt ' that he was in fact guilty of the crimes he was accused of
court case : baljit singh bhandal , who built updown court , pictured , has lost his claim for compensation over the seizure of the property luxurious : the home was once the world 's most expensive property when it went on sale for Â£ 70million baljit singh bhandal bought updown court in the 1990s , after it had been practically gutted by the great storm of 1987 , and rebuilt the interiors in a lavish style
the home was raided by hmrc in 2001 , after baljit singh bhandal was accused of smuggling duty - free alcohol out of the bonded warehouse where it was stored and selling it on the black market
he was taken to court , but the case collapsed when it emerged that the manager of the warehouse was a police informant
