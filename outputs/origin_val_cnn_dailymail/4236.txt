the family run school , which is based at several houses in kensington and chelsea , has previously been described as ' eccentric ' in the good schools guide
it has almost 1,000 pupils who attend from the age of four to 11
the department for education said the next stage in the process is for ministers to review the report
a spokesman said ' all options ' remained open , despite the school 's independent status
this includes closure or helping leaders come up with an action plan to improve
lily allen is among the school 's famous alumni among the criticisms leveled at the school by inspectors , who visited at the beginning of december last year , was the poor educational attainment by pupils
the report said : ' too few pupils make adequate progress across the school , particularly in writing and mathematics
' leaders and proprietors do not have the capacity to secure essential improvements
they are not taking any action to secure effective teaching
they do not know if pupils are making the progress of which they are capable
' behaviour and safety of pupils also achieved a blistering ' inadequate ' rating by inspectors
while pupils were regarded as polite with ' excellent manners ' and generally good behaviour , their safety was raised as a concern
inspectors highlighted poor attention paid to health and safety
it said ' the safety of pupils and adults is compromised on some of the school sites
the report branded fire evacuation procedures ' flawed ' , with records lacking detail and staff lacking training to deal with problems
it said the supervision of children was sometimes ' lax ' and some fire exits could be a hazard
ofsted inspectors rated the school as ' inadequate ' in each of the five categories of leadership and management ; behaviour and safety of pupils ; quality of teaching ; achievement of pupils ; early years provision
the prep school was ranked as inadequate in all five areas that were inspected by ofsted in december a spokesman from the department for education said : ' we have just received a copy of ofsted 's published report following an inspection at hill house international junior school
' ministers are studying that report and will confirm their decisions about regulatory action shortly
' it would be wrong to take any decisions until we have studied the findings , but all options remain open - including closure

' the school was founded in 1956 by the late lieutenant colonel townend , and has been run by his son richard for the last 13 years , supported by his wife
hill house international junior school was founded in london in 1951 by the late lieutenant colonel townend
it is now run out of several houses in kensington and chelsea , and has a site in switzerland
five years later in 1956 prince charles went to the school - the first time an heir to the throne had attended a school outside the royal household
the queen , prince philip and princess anne visited the school for sports day in 1957
after his time at hill house , prince charles was enrolled at cheam preparatory school in berkshire and later was moved to gordonstoun in scotland
girls were first accepted into hill house in 1981 and lily allen is a former pupil
the school offers trips to switzerland as well as the chance to practice sport at the duke of york âs barracks in chelsea
pupils have gone on to win scholarships at a number of exclusive schools including cheltenham ladies college , eton college and harrow
scholarships have also been awarded to pupils to study overseas including at st mary âs waverley in johannesberg and new canaan country school , connecticut
hill house was founded in london in 1951 while it offers trips to switzerland and sports practice at the duke of york âs barracks in chelsea , as well as compulsory swimming lessons , inspectors were less than encouraged by the way teachers ensure pupils make progress
the report said : ' teachers do not routinely assess pupils â progress in lessons
they do not ask searching questions to probe pupils â understanding in order to adjust the activity and secure pupils â better engagement and progress
it added : ' older pupils do not learn in depth across a range of subjects
they spent much of their time practising test papers to secure a place in the school of their choice
' on its website the school lists a number of scholarships won by its pupils at exclusive schools including cheltenham ladies college , harrow and eton college
inspectors also said that because the school measures pupils against its own system of attainment it is not possible to compare this with national achievement of children
richard townend , who now runs the school , has attacked the inspectors ' findings , insisting that pupils attending the school are kept safe
in a letter to parents , he said : ' as i go around the school , i see happy children enjoying being at school , working hard and making great progress in a safe environment
' he added : ' we provide opportunities in art , music , drama and sport which others envy
' each wednesday , the assembly astonishes visitors with its display of talent in our school and the feeling of corporate warmth , friendliness and support of the whole hill house family - pupils , parents and tutors
these are things of the greatest value
' mr townend added : ' the school will explore in detail every criticism they have made and correct anything which needs attention '
the school has already asked the firm capita to report on the school 's health and safety standards and is holding a security audit
it was last inspected in december 2012 , when it was rated ' good
' an emergency inspection last may , carried out at the request of the department for education , found the quality of education was effective but the school was failing to meet safety requirements , the evening standard reported .
