this is the horrific moment a five - year - old boy fell to his death after getting tangled in a kite and being dragged more than 60ft in the air
dat , aged five , had been helping his mother out at her drinks stall at the dong dieu kite field in ho chi minh , the largest city in vietnam , when the accident happened
dat was fatally injured when his legs accidentally got caught up in the kite 's string and he was flung into the air before the string snapped when he was around 65ft above the ground
although still alive when he hit the ground the little boy died in an ambulance on his way to hospital
his aunt , who witnessed the accident , said the giant kite - which had a 49ft span - was being launched by members of the saigon kite club
she said : ' everyone was looking at them because the kite had fallen to the ground a couple of times as the weather was a bit erratic
' one of the lines snagged a table near the drinks stand and knocked over some chairs as well
the little boy was flung into the air and can be seen being pulled across the sky by the giant kite ' dat had run over to pick up some of the fallen soft drink bottles when his leg got tangled in the kite string , which just took off when it was hit by strong winds
' she said she and others rushed over to try and pull the kite back down but it shot into the air and was impossible to stop
dat fell when the string holding him snapped and although it is believed he tried to grab a second string it was too late
the field was being used by kite flyers who were practising for an upcoming festival
a city council spokesman said there were officials on hand designed to keep children away from the kites and prevent such a tragedy , but because the boy was with his mother working at one of the stands he had apparently been overlooked
a full investigation is being carried out
dat can be seen being lifted by his legs and dragged up into the air as the kite pulls him into the sky
