if the thought of running on a treadmill makes you shudder , then you may soon have an excuse to avoid it altogether
us researchers claim they have found a hormone that mimics the effects of exercise , allowing people to lose weight and regulate their blood sugar
the hormone , dubbed mots - c , has been proven to work in mice and clinical trials on humans could begin in three years
us researchers claim they have found a hormone that mimics the effects of exercise , allowing people to lose weight and regulate their blood sugar
the hormone , dubbed mots - c , has been proven to work in mice and clinical trials on humans could begin in three years the discovery of mots - c - a molecule that acts as a signal for the body - was made by scientists at the university of southern california
mots - c works by increasing insulin sensitivity , allowing the body to more effectively process glucose sugars , researchers claim
insulin is a hormone that moves the sugars from food into the blood stream
resistance to insulin can be triggered by a poor diet and may lead to type 2 diabetes
the hormone mainly targets muscle tissue , where it restores insulin sensitivity , counteracting diet - induced and age - dependent insulin resistance
the hormone may give people yet another excuse to avoid the gym
but researchers say its real benefits are in tackling age - related diseases , such as diabetes ' this represents a major advance in the identification of new treatments for age - related diseases such as diabetes , ' said pinchas cohen , a researcher at the university of southern california

to test the effects of mots - c , the team injected the hormone into mice fed a high - fat diet , which typically causes them to grow obese and develop a resistance to insulin
the injections not only suppressed both effects in mice , they also reversed age - dependent insulin - resistance , a condition that precedes diabetes
' this discovery sheds new light on mitochondria and positions them as active regulators of metabolism , ' said changhan lee , assistant professor at usc davis and lead author of the study
mots - c is unique among hormones in that it is encoded in the dna of mitochondria - the ' powerhouses ' of cells that convert food into energy
other hormones are encoded in dna in the nucleus
while all of the experiments on mots - c to date have been performed on lab mice , the molecular mechanisms that make it work in mice exist in all mammals , including humans
the mots - c intellectual property has been licensed to a biotechnology company , and clinical trials in humans could begin within the next three years , researchers said .
