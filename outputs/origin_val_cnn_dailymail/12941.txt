you think march madness is all about basketball ? think again
sure , millions will be watching the 2015 march madness to see whether kentucky 's bid for an unbeaten season can be quashed or whether a 14 seed can make it to the final four
but the popularity of the tournament also spawns another kind of madness -- one that includes college applications , vasectomies and hdtv upgrades
what are the odds ? ( probably a heck of a lot better than picking a perfect bracket
) here are some of the more unusual aspects of the march madness : glass slipper , golden payoff cinderella teams do n't just provide a couple weeks ' entertainment ; according to some studies , their success has long - term effects
thanks to exposure from the ncaa , such teams as florida gulf coast and george mason see rises in applications and endowments
academics call it the " flutie effect " after the charge boston college received from a last - second 1984 win against miami , thanks to a hail mary pass from quarterback doug flutie
( go ahead and watch it again , we 'll wait
) experts debate how much of an influence athletic wins have on admissions , but there 's no question a cinderella turn gives schools greater exposure , which certainly ca n't hurt
george mason , which went to the final four in 2006 , and gonzaga , which broke into nationwide consciousness in the late ' 90s , saw applications go up after their turn on stage
money in the basket march madness pulls in more national tv revenue ( as of 2013 ) than any other postseason sports franchise : $ 1.15 billion
a lot of that money comes from fast - food franchises , which know you like to eat while watching the games
and those franchises may benefit more from losses than wins
according to wallethub , there 's a 19 % increase in pizza orders and a 9 % rise in dessert orders by fans after their teams lose
investors certainly know it : buffalo wild wings stock has traditionally gone up in march
making the cut doctors report up to a 50 % rise in the number of vasectomies during the ncaa tournament
well , if you have to spend a few days resting on the couch ... everybody into the pool according to a survey by the outplacement firm challenger , gray & christmas , 50 million u.s. participate in march madness pools
productivity , shmoductivity , part 1 all that bracket - filling costs employers an estimated $ 1.2 billion in unproductive workers ( assuming each worker spends an hour filling out a bracket )
wallethub puts the figure at $ 1.9 billion
for all that , employers say the tournament is a net positive on morale
productivity , shmoductivity , part 2 twenty - seven percent of respondents to one 2014 survey say they watch games at work
( that could explain the morale situation
) would you like an upgrade with that ? according to the same 2014 survey , 12 % would upgrade to hdtv if their favorite team made it to the sweet sixteen
( as of 2014 , 59 % of u.s. households have hdtv
) bet on the humans of the 76 champions , almost one - third -- 25 -- have had mascots based on a human figure , such as hoosiers and tar heels
fourteen have been bear - related ( largely thanks to ucla 's bruins , who have won 11 championships ) and 10 have been feline ( kentucky 's wildcats , mainly )
perhaps you should play the lottery odds of picking a perfect bracket are 9.2 quintillion to 1 , assuming each team has a 50 % chance of winning every game
odds of winning powerball : about 175 million to 1
