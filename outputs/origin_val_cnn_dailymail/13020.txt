icelandic photographer sigga ella wanted to show that people with down syndrome are more than a chromosomal abnormality
they are diverse and they 're unique , just like everyone else in the world
sigga ella 's series , " first and foremost i am , " consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old
she chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21 , the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition
it is currently on exhibit at the reykjavã­k museum of photography and will be featured in may at the warsaw festival of art photography
sigga ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at the school of photography in reykjavik
she recently shared the images with cnn ireport
the inspiration started with a radio interview sigga ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects
she hopes her photos shine a light on " the beauty and diversity of mankind " and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable
" i am not against prenatal / genetic testing for abnormalities but i think we need to stop and think what 's next
... it 's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about down syndrome
it 's not a disease or a flaw
parents of children with down syndrome ... would n't exchange them for anything in the world
" the title of the series , " first and foremost i am , " comes from a newspaper article by jonsdottir , a 30 - year - old woman who is also featured in sigga ella 's project
" i have down syndrome but first and foremost i am halldora , " jonsdottir writes
" i do a million things that other people do
my life is meaningful and good because i choose to be positive and see the good things in life
i go to work , attend school and have hobbies
" jonsdottir goes on to say , " who is perfect ? who can say , that we who have down syndrome are worth less that anyone else ? we are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike ? " sigga ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects " to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together
" the photo shoots lasted from one to three hours
she said she did n't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose ; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot
" my favorite part of this project was how relaxed the atmosphere was
no one was pretending to be anything , the emotions were real and some of the times , there was such genuine happiness
