bangladesh gave co-hosts new zealand a real scare but fell just short of securing another pool a victory at the world cup on friday
the tigers established a strong position thanks to a ton from top - scoring mahmudullah , yet new zealand boasted a centurion of their own in martin guptill , who shrugged off injury to make 105 at seddon park
shakib al hasan was the pick of the bowlers with his four wickets maintaining belief bangladesh could restrict the new zealand in hamilton
a late flurry from tim southee , however , got the home team over the line as they recorded a three - wicket triumph

they registered 288 for seven from their 50 overs , having been put into bat
mahmudullah , having become his country 's first world cup centurion in monday 's win over england , made it back - to - back hundreds with a brilliant 128 not out
the bangladesh innings got off to a shaky start , with openers kayes ( two ) and iqbal ( 13 ) dismissed within the first 10 overs
mahmudullah followed up his century against england on monday with another ton against the new zealand trent boult snared both , knocking over kayes ' off stump and inducing an edge from tamim which was snapped up by anderson at second slip to send the bowler back top of the 2015 world cup wicket - takers ' list
soumya sarkar ( 51 ) and mahmudullah steadied the ship with a 90 - run third - wicket stand , before the former bottom - edged a daniel vettori delivery to anderson at long - on
anderson then got in on the action with the ball , accounting for the wickets of shakib al hasan ( 23 ) and mushfiqur rahim ( 15 ) - both caught behind by ronchi
rahman contributed 40 and nasir 11 before falling to elliott in the final three overs
nasir drops a catch that would have dismissed new zealand 's daniel vettori new zealand also made a wobbly start , quickly losing both brendon mccullum and williamson
the former was snagged by shakib al hasan for eight while williamson sliced over to iqbal for a single off the same bowler
it fell to martin guptill and taylor to steady the ship and the pair brought up 50 runs before the latter reached 5,000 odi runs with a four off rahman
anderson made 39 runs to help new zealand to a 290 for 7 victory against bangladesh martin guptill was fast approaching his century when he suddenly pulled up after glancing for a single
after a few nervous minutes it became clear the opener was suffering from a bad bout of cramps
he gritted his teeth and soon brought up his maiden world cup ton with a single off ahmed
martin guptill was , however , gone for 105 when shakib al hasan struck again , the bangladesh bowler making another key breakthrough as his opponent tried to clear rubel only to find him at long on
elliott had contributed 39 runs before slicing to ahmed at sweeper cover and succumbing to rubel tim southee proved the matchwinner for new zealand as he smashed a six and a four in back - to - back balls taylor followed in the 42nd over , nasir striking him in front of middle and leg
anderson 's intervention meant the decision went to review , but drs confirmed the end of his 56 - run stand
ronchi ( nine ) became shakib al hasan 's fourth victim and anderson followed for 39 as nasir tricked him with a flatter delivery , but the new zealand held their nerve
tim southee was the matchwinner , sealing a three - wicket victory as he smashed a six and a four in back - to - back balls .
