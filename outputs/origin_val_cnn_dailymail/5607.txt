west indies virtually secured their place in the world cup quarter - finals with a six - wicket triumph over the united arab emirates in napier
the united arab emirates were six wickets down early on , after being put in to bat , but javed ( 56 ) and aziz ( 60 ) dug deep to help them post 175 from 47.4 overs
the west indies - even without the injured chris gayle - never looked in danger of failing to chase down their modest target , though , johnson charles ( 55 ) and jonathan carter ( 50 not out ) leading the way as they romped to victory from 30.3 overs for the loss of four wickets

united arab emirates were on the ropes at 46 for six at mclean park , with none of the top six batsmen managing double figures , but javed and aziz helped give the scoreline some respectability
holder ( four for 27 ) and taylor ( three for 36 ) accounted for the united arab emirates top order , as amjad ali ( five ) , andri berenger ( seven ) , krishna chandran ( nought ) , khurram khan ( five ) , shaiman anwar ( two ) and swapnil patil ( six ) all fell cheaply
javed and aziz shared a 107 - run seventh - wicket stand to get united arab emirates back on track , as the west indies failed to fully capitalise on their early superiority
