an aspiring transgender hip - hop artist who bragged of carrying out black - market ' body sculpting ' on thousands of women has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed a british dancer
windslowe 's testimony during her philadelphia trial included claims she was ' the michelangelo of buttocks injections ' and model amber rose was ' a walking billboard ' for her work
however , the former ' black madam ' had no medical training , using only tips she picked up from the overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service
today , she was found guilty of third - degree murder after one of her ' patients ' , claudia aderotimi , 20 , a london break - dancer and college student , died from an illegal silicone injection in her buttocks
she died just a few hours later
it was later revealed the silicone in her buttocks had moved to her lungs and stopped her heart
during her murder trial , windslowe said of her ' body sculpting ' : ' i was the best , and i do n't mean that to be cocky , ' explaining why celebrities would have sought her out over a licensed plastic surgeon
the 45 - year - old described herself as a serial entrepreneur who once ran a transgender escort service , as well as a gothic hip - hop performer who called herself ' the black madam
' last week , her trial was halted for several days after she was hospitalized with chest pains
she has been in prison since 2012 after an 18 - month inquiry led to a homicide ruling and an arrest warrant
the jury got the case friday
they were choosing between third - degree murder - not premeditated but involves malice - and involuntary manslaughter , involving reckless disregard for a person 's life
aspiring hip - hop artists : today , the defendant ( pictured left and right ) was convicted of third - degree murder after miss aderotimi , 20 , a london dancer and college student , died from a silicone injection in her buttocks tragic death : miss claudia aderotimi ( pictured ) , who was injected by windslowe at an airport hotel in the city in 2011 , was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath
she died a few hours later in addition to third - degree murder , windslowe was also convicted of aggravated assault for injuries to a philadelphia woman who became seriously ill after paying for one of the injections
and the jury found her guilty of two weapons counts - the weapon in question being the industrial - grade silicone
windslowe faces 20 to 40 years in prison on the murder conviction alone
miss claudia aderotimi 's family in england chose not to attend the trial
the long - time friend who accompanied her to philadelphia to celebrate her birthday also declined to make the trip
the friend 's 2012 testimony , read aloud in court , described the meeting as ' a touch - up ' after their prior visit to the woman they knew as ' lillian
' windslowe name - dropped the likes of rappers nicki minaj and kanye west and athlete serena williams during her testimony
she also claimed to have been baptized ' genevieve ' by the late roman catholic cardinal anthony bevilacqua
amber rose 's agents did return messages seeking comment about the claim she was a client
the evidence showed that windslowe traveled to hotel rooms and ' pumping parties ' with her tools of the trade stuffed into a shiny pink purse : a water bottle filled with silicone , a red plastic cup , needles and syringes , and krazy glue to close the injection sites
claims : windslowe 's colorful testimony during her philadelphia trial included claims she was ' the michelangelo of buttocks injections ' and model amber rose ( pictured ) was ' a walking billboard ' for her untrained work there have been several similar deaths nationwide involving underground buttocks injections
a mother of three who died in texas after having work done at a tile store died in april 2011
a columbian couple is serving up to eight years in prison for manslaughter in that case
windslowe , who went on the run after miss claudia aderotimi 's death , lowered her head during the closing arguments friday as a prosecutor described her victim as ' a regular girl ' who had asked if the injections could interfere with her ability to have children
when miss claudia aderotimi began having chest pains afterward , windslowe ' kept up that ruse ' of being a physician 's assistant , assistant district attorney kirn told the jury last week
' she put her hand on this young lady 's chest as if she were doing an exam , ' kirn said
' but there was no exam
' addressing the court , defense lawyer rudenstein said the potential dangers of her injections were not clear to his client , windslowe , because she only knew of satisfied customers
' clearly with all the information from this case , we know it should n't be done , it 's too risky , ' rudenstein told the court
' we know that now
but we did n't know that then
