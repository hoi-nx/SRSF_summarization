you get what you pay for , so they say
but the high street is adept at doing tailored pieces in smart fabrics
tv presenter kate garraway tried three top - to - toe outfits
could she spot the bargains from the bling ? dinner date dress , Â£ 20 , oasis - stores.com necklace , Â£ 2.99 , and bag , Â£ 14.99 , newlook.co.uk ring , Â£ 7 , asos.com shoes , Â£ 5 , everything5pounds.com total : Â£ 49.98 a belt would improve the overall shape of this dress , but at a smart evening event no one would know it cost the same as a posh bottle of wine
i ca nât believe the shoes are only Â£ 5 ; they look as if they âd be at least Â£ 50
dress , Â£ 650 , beulahlondon.com necklace , Â£ 3,195 , caratlondon.com ring , Â£ 235 , monicavinader.com bag , Â£ 195 , lkbennett.com shoes , Â£ 725 , arunaseth.com total : Â£ 5,000 this dress looks sweet and fits perfectly , but it does nât feel expensive ( 75 per cent stiff cotton , 25 per cent nylon with a 100 per cent silk lining )
but the necklace ( set in nine - carat gold , but these are nât diamonds ) does not look as if it âs worth thousands
winner : split : i prefer the pricey dress , but the cheaper shoes and jewellery
out for drinks dress , Â£ 30 , axparis.com jacket , Â£ 5 , and shoes , Â£ 5 , everything5pounds.com necklace , Â£ 7 , and earrings , Â£ 3 , claires.co.uk total : Â£ 50 this dress may be less than a tenth of the price of the more expensive one , but i prefer it 100 per cent
the colour is better â it âs a warmer golden shade rather than a silvery grey â as is the fit
on looks , i âd think it was the more expensive of the two
the jacket is smartly tailored , worn - in looking and lightweight for spring
the shoes have a natty asymmetrical cut at the toe line and feel incredibly comfortable
rag and bone dress , Â£ 460 , oxygenboutique.com leather jacket , Â£ 1,845 , michaelkors.com star necklace , Â£ 1,495 , sheeva.com earrings , Â£ 695 , astleyclarke.com shoes , Â£ 505 , giuseppezanottidesign.com total : Â£ 5,000 this is a great dress : sexy , but the length prevents a mutton - dressed - as - lamb situation
the fabric feels a little viscose , though
the jacket is suspiciously shiny , but butter soft
the necklace is set with miniature white sapphires , but i would nât have spotted this as different to the budget version
winner : the cheap option â it makes a better impact all round
shopping trip coat , Â£ 30 , boohoo.com george at asda sweater , Â£ 4 , direct.asda.com shoes and jeans , Â£ 5 each , everything5pounds.com tote bag , Â£ 19.99 , hm.com necklace , Â£ 7.99 , daisystreet.co.uk total : Â£ 49.98 i love this ( admittedly thin ) coat , which looks far more costly
the necklace looks almost identical to the dear one
the jumper is a bit see - through , but the jeans fit like a glove
coat , Â£ 1,450 , aquascutum.com adam lippes silk and cashmere sweater , Â£ 740 , net â a-porter.com j brand jeans , Â£ 300 , selfridges.com tote bag with inbuilt phone or ipad charger portal , Â£ 1,500 , aspinaloflondon.com shourouk necklace , Â£ 590 , benna.co.uk shoes , Â£ 420 , arunaseth.com total : Â£ 5,000 a classy outfit
the jeans are soft and supple , the jumper warm , but not heavy , the coat smart if shapeless and the handbag is obviously top quality
but the shoes and necklace were nothing special
winner : the cheap option
with neutral colours and fail - safe cuts , i had to look hard to tell which was which .
