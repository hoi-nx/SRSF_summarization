the financial crash has left the poor even poorer than they were before the recession â while the rich have got richer , a new report has revealed
despite the economic collapse in 2008 , the average financial wealth of the richest 20 per cent has soared by almost two - thirds between 2005 and 2012/13
the poorest families meanwhile have seen a collapse in their savings and higher debts than before the downturn , a report by the smf think - tank found
despite the economic collapse in 2008 , the average financial wealth of the richest 20 per cent has soared by almost two - thirds between 2005 and 2012/13 the report said those aged 25 to 36 and those on the lowest incomes are ' ill - prepared for future financial shocks or rises in interest rates ' , limiting the capacity of consumer spending to fuel growth in the britain economy
it cast doubt on claims that the britain population as a whole had reined in spending in order to pay off debts and build up savings in response to the crash
in fact , it found that most of the saving took place among the top 20 per cent of earners , who built up savings in the aftermath of the crisis to the point that their average financial wealth increased by 64 per cent between 2005 and 2012/13
the proportion of high - income individuals with debts fell from 43 per cent to 31 per cent over the same period
by contrast , the 20 per cent on the lowest incomes were unable to pay off debts and start saving
over the same period , the value of debt held by poorer households rose by 67 per cent - equivalent to around 28 per cent of their income - and use of overdrafts rose , while savings shrank to an average of less than six days ' worth of income
the amount being saved by families has steadily fallen since the coalition took over , as people dip into their savings the intergenerational gap in incomes and wealth widened over the same period , as the amount of savings held by 26 - 35 year - olds fell by 36 per cent
while the proportion of this age - group in debt fell , the average amount owed by those with debts increased by 45 per cent
just 45 per cent of 26 to 35 - year - olds owned a home in 2012/13 , sharply down from the 74 per cent seen in 2005
the report 's co-author , smf chief economist nida broughton , said : ' our findings show that the wealth gap between rich and poor and young and old increased further during the downturn
' the economic uncertainty following the crisis prompted many to pay down their debts and build up their savings
but the young and those on low incomes missed out
' greater support is needed to help these individuals prepare for the future ; yet this will be a challenging feat. it is likely that the process of repairing their personal finances will only begin once sustained wage growth materialises
