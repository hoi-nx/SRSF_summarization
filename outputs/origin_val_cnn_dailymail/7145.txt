england âs fledgling wine industry is threatened by a group of devastating plant diseases discovered in the country for the first time
experts at the rhs in recent months have identified four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops
the diseases , spotted on vines at rhs gardens in wisley , surrey , and the brogdale at brogdale
kent , have damaged vineyards in wine - growing countries around the world
outbreaks of the disease can result in reduced yields , delayed fruit ripening and overly - acidic grapes
the only way to properly deal with the problem is to pull up the plants , experts say
experts at the rhs have identified four separate viruses which can obliterate grape crops ( file picture ) the warning comes after wine producers announced this week that they are to apply for the name â sussex wine â to be given protected â designation of origin â status , putting it in the same league as champagne and bordeaux
the reputation of england wine has grown immeasurably in recent years , particularly in warm and sunny sussex , which has similar soil and climate to the champagne region of france
sales of sparking england wine are expected to hit Â£ 100million in 2015 , following a boom in the number of vineyards in recent years
in 2014 alone 46 wine producers opened in southern england , a 50 per cent year - on - year increase in new firms
vines are also becoming a popular plant in back gardens , with many homeowners trailing one over a trellis or up the inside of a conservatory
dr clover , head of plant health at the rhs , said there is no sign the viruses have yet made it into commercial vineyards , but warned producers to be wary of the disease
writing in the trade journal the grape press , due to be published next month , he said : â the discovery of four grapevine viruses not previously reported in the british during an in initial survey suggests there is no room for complacency
â these viruses have the potential to spread and cause damage to the british âs developing grapevine industry
â the four viruses cause different problems to plants , including leafroll disease , stem pitting , and fleck disease
outbreaks of the disease can result in reduced yields , delayed fruit ripening and overly - acidic grapes ( file picture ) they are thought to have come to our shores on imports of infected plants , but can also be spread by mealybugs and scale insects
dr clover urged commercial vineyards to be aware of the risk and to only use plants that are certified as being virus - free
speaking to the daily mail last night , he said : â we found four of these viruses in wisley and one at brogdale
but we found them because we knew what we were looking for
â the symptoms could easily be mistaken for something else - nutrient deficiencies for example , or other problems
â we visited two commercial sites in suffolk and surrey and found no signs of the viruses at either
â but he said that until now there has been limited monitoring for viruses in british vineyards , so the diseases are likely to be i8n other sites as well
he added : â it is reasonable to suggest that they could have spread further , but it is impossible to say how far
â luckily we have caught this early so we have opportunity to do something about it
