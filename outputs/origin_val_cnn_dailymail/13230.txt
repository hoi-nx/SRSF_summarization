it 's a controversial question that 's sparked debate since officials revealed the identity of the masked man known as jihadi john
was mohammed emwazi , the man with a british accent who 's appeared in numerous isis beheading videos , pushed toward extremism by authorities ? or was he someone who 'd long been heading down a militant path ? a london - based advocacy group that worked with mohammed emwazi says emails he sent them paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help
and a report from the daily mail , also citing emails purportedly sent from emwazi to the british publication , said the kuwait - born london saw himself as a " dead man walking " and contemplated suicide because of his alleged harassment by authorities
but some analysts say the emails are only part of the story , arguing that investigators targeted emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups
" you ca n't start the story at how he 's been treated by british officials
you certainly ca n't start the story from the email trail , " said rashad ali , director at the counterextremism consultancy centri and a fellow of the institute of strategic dialogue
" you have to go back to why the intelligence services got in contact with him
well , because he was part of a group of a people who were going to join shabaab -- a very extremist organization and jihadist group that got involved in horrific terrorist attacks in somalia
" mohammed emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it , according to cage , the human rights and muslim advocacy organization that worked with him
one email details mohammed emwazi 's account of his detention at a british airport , when authorities stopped him from traveling to kuwait in 2010 and questioned him for hours
" i told them that i want to be left alone , as i have an ambition of moving from the british and settling in kuwait
that is why i found a job and a spouse ! ! but they laughed , " mohammed emwazi wrote in a message dated june 3 , 2010
" one of them got aggressive with me , he pushed me to the wall
... i was just baffled i did not know why he had done that after this long 6hour interview , fingerprinting and searching
when i asked for their names they said ' we do n't give out our names
' " mohammed emwazi wrote that the way he was treated by british security and intelligence officials reminded him " of criminals that you see on tv who have committed a serious crime , only i was a person never charged or arrested for anything
i was a person looking to start a new life in my country kuwait ! " that 's a key detail , cage spokesman amandla thomas-johnson said
" if someone is going to carry out some violent attack in any kind of way , then the law is there to be in force and apprehend them , " he said
" in the british , he was n't arrested once , prosecuted or cautioned whatsoever
" british authorities have not responded to cnn 's requests for comment on the case
in the emails , mohammed emwazi pleaded for cage 's help
" please help me as i do n't want to stay in the british because i have found a job in kuwait , found a spouse in kuwait and thus found a new start for my life in kuwait
kuwait is where i 'm from , i was born their
i just want to go their and start my new life again ! ! " mohammed emwazi wrote that he had also made a formal complaint at the ipcc , before going into detail about how he was apparently " assaulted by the police officer " as he attempted to leave for kuwait
but it was a difficult complaint to prove , thomas-johnson said
" the ipcc says there 's no camera in the room where this took place , so we ca n't really do much about it except put a black mark against the officer , " he said
" these things happen in the shadows and the dark
so it is very difficult to independently verify once it 's taken place
there is n't much of an opportunity to gain redress and accountability
" details from court papers reported in british media paint a different picture
they say mohammed emwazi was part of a group of extremists sometimes called the " north london boys " who allegedly funneled money and recruits to shabaab
the guardian has reported that mohammed emwazi was part of a terror cell with links to the failed london bomb attacks in 2005
to british authorities , his face was a familiar one for more than five years
but authorities lost track of him in 2013 , according to friends
he changed his name and made his way to syria
analysts who 've studied isis recruiting say they are n't buying the argument that harassment from authorities turned mohammed emwazi into " jihadi john
" " i think it 's an absurd claim , " said peter neumann , director of the international centre for the study of radicalisation
" it was not the cause of his radicalization
the reason the intelligence services harassed him was because they suspected him of trying to join the shabaab in somalia
" rashad ali argued that abuse at the hands of officials is not an excuse for terrorism
" people do not turn around , when harassed and have grievances , and become terrorists , " he said
in addition to the emails released by cage , another series of emails from emwazi came to light over the weekend
the messages were sent in 2010 and 2011 to the daily mail 's security editor , verkaik
the daily mail published excerpts from those exchanges , including mohammed emwazi 's description of an incident where he tried to sell his laptop through a website , but only stated his surname
when he met a potential buyer at a london underground station , he says the person he met shook his hand and said " nice doing business with you mohammed emwazi
" " i never told this person my first name ! ! " wrote mohammed emwazi to verkaik
" & i never give out my first name ! ! it was impossible for him to know my first name ! ! " he also hinted at suicidal thoughts
" sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking , not fearing they may kill me
" rather , fearing that one day , i 'll take as many pills as i can so that i can sleep for ever ! ! i just want to get away from these people ! ! ! " verkaik said he met emwazi in 2010 when he was investigating his claims of being harassed by police and intelligence
mohammed emwazi 's concerns bordered on paranoia , verkaik wrote , and he desperately wanted his story to be told
" like many young muslim men at the time , he appeared to have a grievance
but this man was different , " verkaik wrote
" in him was a warped sense of injustice that could never justify the barbaric acts of murder that he has gone on to carry out in syria
" cnn 's brian todd and jim sciutto contributed to this report .
