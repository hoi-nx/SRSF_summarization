an estimated one in five people will suffer with depression in their lifetime
but scientists have now found that macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans , such as shying away from a group , losing their appetite and adopting a hunched posture
by studying creatures in a social situation , they hope to learn more about why humans may become depressed , which could improve treatment for the debilitating mental disorder
scientists have found that macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans , such as shying away from a group ( shown in e ) and adopting a hunched posture ( shown at a , b , d and e )

intimidating behaviour ( b and d ) may explain the monkeys ' depression previous studies have used rodents , which ' do not realistically resemble the etiopathological [ causal ] development of depression , which occurs naturally in a social context , â according to the study , published in nature
researchers at chongqing medical university , china , and wake forest university in north carolina , examined depression in cynomolgus macaque monkeys living in social colonies at zhongke experimental animal co. in suzhou , eastern china
the cause of depression in some cases , appears to be down to bullying behaviour by dominant members of the colonies , such as intimidating and even attacking lower status monkeys
each colony was made up of two males and approximately 20 females as well as their offspring , reflecting how they would live in the wild
twenty females showing symptoms of depression , such as no interest in food , grooming or mating
dominant behaviour is marked with red arrows , above and depressed monkeys with blue arrows
feeding : the depressed monkeys spent less time eating and drinking than their healthy peers
behaviour : they spent less time resting on elevated perches such as shelves and hanging chains , which are favourites with healthier and more dominant monkeys
movement : depressed subjects spent more time sitting on the floor and less time walking around
grooming : the sad monkeys spent less time grooming each other and being groomed , which is a sign of sociability in healthy monkeys
they also spent less time taking care of themselves , by scratching , for example
nursing : they also nursed their infants less than healthy monkeys
a total of 52 colonies were observed and 1,007 female monkeys screened for depression , real clear science reported
twenty females showing symptoms of depression , such as no interest in food , grooming or mating , were chosen and compared to 20 â happy â monkeys and 10 that had been kept in isolation and were also thought to be depressed
the researchers found that the naturally depressed and isolated monkeys behaved in a similar way , such as â stereotypical prostrated and socially unresponsive posture as well as exacerbation of socially submissive behaviours , â the study said
naturally depressed monkeys displayed a slumped posture , less interest in feeding and sex and diminished communication and reciprocal grooming with others
' one to two subjects per stable social colony ( 17 â 22 subjects ) manifested a depressive phenotype that may be attributed to psychosocial stress , â the study said
the authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops than humans ( illustrated with a stock image ) than rodent models as well as behavioural changes , they also identified metabolic differences between depressed and healthy monkeys , which has also been witnessed in humans
the healthy monkeys spent longer feeding and drinking compared to their depressed peers who were not as interested in eating , for example
the authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops in humans than rodent models
â this model 's stable depression phenotype demonstrates superior validity to traditional rodent models of depression by better approximating the psychosocial stressors encountered by adult humans living in a resource - based competitive society and can aid further investigation into the mechanisms underlying depression , â they wrote .
