bigger is better when it comes to selling bras because according to new market research , women are more likely to buy lingerie if it 's modeled by a plus - size woman over a thin blonde
adore me , a rapidly growing lingerie start - up based in new york , has revealed that its television ad featuring a plus size model quadrupled online sales when compared to the brand 's commercial starring a group of blondes
' there 's an overall mentality that you have to be super skinny , ' the company 's founder hermand-waiche told cnn
' we are showing that we offer lingerie for everyone
when adore me debuted its first national television campaign last january , the company used the testing method for its three different commercials , which aired on channels such as bravo , lifetime and mtv
one television ad featured a cast of all blonde models , another showcased all brunette models and the third starred one plus - size brunette
after the company monitored online traffic and sales throughout the month , they came to the - perhaps surprising conclusion - that the 30 - second commercial featuring the dark - haired plus - size model generated four times as many sales than the one featuring the blondes

the online retailer also learned that its female consumers preferred the commercial that left its models unretouched
adore me did n't do any digital retouching to the ad featuring multiple brunette models - and that commercial was the one that was favorited by consumers
a / b testing is an important strategy for the company , which unveils a new collection every month
blondes do n't sell : last year 's research showed that women are far more likely to buy lingerie online if it 's modeled on a brunette over a flaxen haired beauty coveted curves : this year 's data revealed that women prefer model to remain digitally untouched last year 's marketing research showed that women are far more likely to buy lingerie online if it 's modeled on a brunette over a blonde
keeping that information in mind , the company was n't surprised when its commercials featuring brunette models fared better than the ones that starred blondes during this year 's round of testing
' at the end of the day ... it 's [ our ] customers who choose the model they like [ and ] the pose they like instead of us imposing on them , ' mr hermand-waiche told cnn 's rachel crane
' its really the customer who builds the [ adore me ] website based on what they prefer , ' he noted .
