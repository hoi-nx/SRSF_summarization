in my career , i never spat at anybody
it âs such a disgusting act and is one of the most disrespectful things you can do to another human being
in some cultures , people do spit on the floor when they âre angry , but i ca nât understand why people would spit at all
jonny evans certainly is nât part of one of those cultures
i do nât understand why people do it , but i did think there was some provocation on wednesday night
manchester united defender jonny evans ( left ) and papiss cisse have been charged with spitting during the game jonny evans and papiss cisse were both caught on camera appearing to spit at each other on wednesday night papiss cisse has accepted a possible seven - game ban while jonny evans has until 6pm on friday , february 6 to respond it looked like papiss cisse ran his studs down jonny evans âs achilles and also made a straight - legged challenge on him
that âs why we saw a transformation in the seemingly mild - mannered jonny evans
he says he was unaware of any spitting incident , but i find that hard to believe
i was once spat at during a game in turkey while i was playing for everton
it was supposed to be a pre-season friendly but it was anything but
our bus was even stoned by local fans
when i was spat at , it was right into my face
but it was nât a case of being so angry i wanted to hit him , i was mostly just shocked
it was an abusive act and it is unacceptable
luis suarez ( top left ) was caught biting branislav ivanovic during a premier league clash in april 2013 the chelsea defender appeals to the referee , with luis suarez later receiving an eight - game ban for biting as for punishment , you could argue it is as bad as , if not worse , than biting â and luis suarez , then of liverpool , received an eight - match ban for biting branislav ivanovic
biting causes physical pain , but that is almost a childish , instinctive reaction
to spit in someone âs face is more deliberate and insulting
for me , spitting is worse
but i do nât think spitting merits more than a three - match ban
yes , there has to be a suspension , but it âs more important to educate players as to how badly incidents such as these come across to those watching the game , particularly youngsters
â having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night âs match
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at papiss cisse
â i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor
' during the game papiss cisse and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting
â it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do
it is certainly not something that i did last night
â the games he could miss for united : arsenal ( h ) , monday ; tottenham ( h ) , march 15 ; liverpool ( a ) , march 22 ; aston villa ( h ) , april 4 ; man city ( h ) april 12 ; chelsea ( a ) april 18
â i have apologies to make to a lot of people today
firstly to my team - mates and to our supporters , secondly to jonny evans , and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and jonny evans
â i reacted to something i found very unpleasant
sometimes it is hard not to react , particularly in the heat of the moment
i have always tried hard to be a positive role model , especially for our young fans , and yesterday i let you down
â i hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry
perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake , not copy it
â the games he âll miss for newcastle : everton ( a ) , march 15 ; arsenal ( h ) , march 21 ; sunderland ( a ) , april 5 ; liverpool ( a ) , april 13 ; tottenham ( h ) , april 19 ; swansea ( h ) , april 25 ; leicester ( a ) , may 2 .
