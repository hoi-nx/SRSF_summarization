many consumers buy ' green ' or organic household products in the belief they are safer and kinder to the environment
but many of these products also contain cancer - causing chemicals , a new study has warned
australia researchers found that common products marketed as â green â , â all - natural â , â non-toxic â and â organic â emit compounds that could harm health and air quality
at this time , consumer products sold in australia , the us and around the world are not required to list all ingredients , or any ingredients in a chemical mixture called ' fragrance '
this means consumers can not check what the item contains and whether it is potentially dangerous
household items marketed as ' green ' , ' organic ' , ' all - natural â and â non-toxic â could still emit compounds that damage health , a study has warned the researchers analysed 37 different products , such as air fresheners , cleaning products , laundry supplies and personal care products found all over the world , including those that claimed to be â green â or â organic â
then , they investigated the number of volatile organic compounds ( vocs ) the products emitted
vocs are a large group of carbon - based chemicals that easily evaporate and get into the air at room temperature
they can cause short term health effects including irritating the throat and mouth , causing dizziness and can make conditions like asthma worse
in the long term , exposure to these compounds has been linked with an increased risk of cancer , liver damage , kidney damage and damage to the nervous system
the reseachers found 156 different vocs emitted from the products , with an average of 15 vocs per product
of these 156 vocs , 42 are classified as toxic or hazardous under us federal laws , and each product emitted at least one of these chemicals
they found the cancer - causing pollutants were found in many of the fragranced â green â products and they were just as damaging as those from regular chemical products that are n't marketed as organic , researchers said
the most common chemicals in fragranced products were terpenes , which were not in fragrance - free versions
researchers analysed 37 household products and found they all emitted volatile organic compounds ( pictured )
these are chemicals that get into the air easily and have been linked with cancer and liver damage terpenes react very quickly with ozone ( a pale blue gas found in the air ) to generate pollutants such as formaldehyde and ultrafine particles , the researchers said
the researchers also warned that fewer than three per cent were disclosed product labels or product information
lead author professor anne steinman , of melbourne school of engineering , said this means the public is unable to check which chemicals their household products contain
she said : ' the paradox is that most of our exposure to air pollutants occurs indoors and a primary source is consumer products
â but the public lacks full and accurate information on the ingredients in these products
â our indoor air environments are essentially unregulated and unmonitored
â given the lack of information , consumers may choose products with claims such as green , natural , or organic , but those claims are largely untested
