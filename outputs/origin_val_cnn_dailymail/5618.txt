pictured , his baby mother liza gorbani outside court today gallagher was today hit with a second $ 5,000 ( Â£ 3,300 ) fine by a new york judge who said she was tired of his â frivolous conduct â
judge laura drager said that she could not â excuse him any longer â and said his america child custody battle was going to trial
the lawyer for liza ghorbani , mr gallagher âs baby mother , said that mr gallagher had not turned up for a deposition he was supposed to give last month either
garr also revealed that their daughter gemma , two , is exhibiting â delays â in her development and is having problems with speech
with no settlement the case will now go to trial on march 26 with both sides digging their heels in
so far mr gallagher has only flown to america for one hearing in two years and was last month hit with his first $ 5,000 fine by judge drager
in the latest hearing she opened by asking mr gallagher âs lawyer felder : â mr felder , where is your client â
mr felder said : â my client is not here
â judge laura drager said : â is there a reason why he is not here ? â mr felder said : â i have no good reason â
judge laura drager said : â i am imposing a sanction of $ 5,000 for what i deem to be his frivolous conduct in not appearing in this court ...
â ... i had him appear by phone and i excused his ( non ) appearance but as we proceed to trial i can not excuse his ( non ) appearance any longer
â there is no reason that i have been given as to why he can not appear â
in his submission mr garr attacked mr gallagher for his â willful failure â to attend court
he ran through his litany of non appearances dating back to 2013 and said : â the history of non compliance is about the most flagrant i can consider â
mr felder however accused miss ghorbani of â greed â
he said that mr gallagher had been paying $ 5,000 a month to her for two years now even when there was no court order forcing him to do so
he said that with miss liza ghorbani : â it âs a desire not to collect child support , it âs a desire to get support for herself , to change her lifestyle
â she wants bodyguards , a doorman , she wants to be treated as maybe a wife is treated if it was a long marriage ... â we are talking about greed here
if this was street talk i âd say the court was scammed â
he cast doubts on miss liza ghorbani âs claims she was poor by pointing out that she lived a comfortable life and was taking gemma to music lessons and baby ballet
mr gallagher met miss liza ghorbani when she interviewed him in 2010
at the time , he was married to singer nicole appleton ( pictured together in 2005 ) he also claimed that she spent $ 2,000 a month on her apartment in manhattan to retain the â fantasy â she was still living in the city when she was actually living with her parents in virginia
in her ruling , judge laura drager rejected a motion by mr garr for the case to go into default , which would mean that the court would make a decision on how much mr gallagher should pay based on a per centage of his income
miss liza ghorbani is currently being paid $ 5,000 a month by mr gallagher until a final decision about child maintenance can be agreed
when mr felder raised the prospect of mr gallagher attending the trial the judge said : â that would be great ! â mr gallagher , 41 , met miss ghorbani , 40 , after she interviewed him for the new york times in 2010
at the time he was still married to all saints singer nicole appleton with whom he is now divorced
speaking after the hearing mr felder said that mr gallagher was in the uk but he did not know why he had not come to court
asked if mr gallagher would attend the trial he said : â i do nât know â
mr garr would not elaborate on the nature of gemma âs health problems but said that the â delays â were being monitored
a spokesman for mr gallagher said : ' we believed that the case was resolved on an extremely generous basis to the lady until we got to court when she apparently received advice from others that prevented this
' gallagher always wanted to be more than fair and has always accepted responsibility for the child
the lady and her advisors have not allowed this to happen
