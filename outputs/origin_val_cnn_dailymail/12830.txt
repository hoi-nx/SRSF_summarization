police raided millionaire heir robert durst 's home in houston , texas , on tuesday , a day after he was charged with first - degree murder
deguerin , robert durst 's attorney , confirmed that investigators were searching the home
it was not immediately clear what they were looking for inside robert durst 's 14th - floor condo , where he has lived for many years , cnn affiliate ktrk reported
the raid comes days after fbi agents arrested robert durst in a new orleans hotel
the los angeles county district attorney filed a first - degree murder charge against him on monday , accusing robert durst of shooting and killing his close friend berman in december 2000
if convicted , he could face the death penalty
" i think it 's ridiculous for them to be making a search 15 years after berman was killed , and they 're searching a place in houston , " deguerin told cnn
robert durst remains jailed in new orleans , where he 's facing drug and weapons charges stemming from his arrest over the weekend
robert durst 's alleged connections with berman 's death and two others were the focus of hbo 's true crime documentary , " the jinx
" deguerin has claimed it 's no coincidence authorities moved in to arrest robert durst just as the documentary 's finale was about to air
and on tuesday , he said he was n't surprised about the houston raid either
" i 'm not surprised they 're acting like a bunch of keystone cops , particularly after being embarrassed by the tv program , " he said
" and i 'll be even more surprised if they find anything of any evidentiary value whatsoever
" prosecutors accuse robert durst of " lying in wait " and killing berman , a crime writer and his longtime confidante , because she was a witness to a crime
she was shot in the head shortly before investigators were coming to speak with her about the disappearance of robert durst 's first wife in 1982
robert durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with berman 's death or his wife 's disappearance , though some have questioned whether comments he made at the end of the documentary -- muttering under his breath in the bathroom that he " killed them all " -- could be interpreted as a confession
deguerin told reporters monday that his client did n't kill berman
" he 's ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial , " deguerin said
but it 's unclear when a trial could take place
robert durst waived his right to fight extradition to los angeles , but because prosecutors in new orleans are pursuing charges against him , he remains jailed there
robert durst had a smith & wesson .38 - caliber revolver on him when he was arrested , according to new orleans police department records
investigators found marijuana and a " substantial " amount of cash in robert durst 's hotel room , a source familiar with the investigation told cnn
he was booked in new orleans monday on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm and possession of a firearm with a controlled substance
he may be moved soon to a different louisiana prison where inmates with " an acute medical condition " are sent , deguerin said
court documents filed tuesday say robert durst will receive medications while imprisoned , " including but not limited to hydrocodone as needed for pain
