common sense would suggest that when molten lava meets a sheet of ice it will simply melt through
but geologist professor jeff karson and artist professor bob wysocki from syracuse university in ny found that the results can be far more spectacular
using a lava furnace to heat gravel to temperatures of more than 1,100 Â° c ( 2,000 â° f ) they were able to pour it onto a slab of ice to produce a seething , bubbling mass of molten rock
lava turns ice directly into steam which bubbles up through the molten rock to form bizarre glass bubbles professor jeff karson , who has been pouring lava in a series of experiments to better understand how it behaves and forms geological formations , described it as ' scrambled eggs from hell '
rather than melting straight through the ice , the lava instead flows rapidly on top of it on a cushion of steam
steam from the ice below bubbles up through the molten rock as it tries to escape , forming a layer of glassy bubbles
professor jeff karson said : ' the first guess is that it is going to explode or it is tunnel down and make a hole in the ice
of course it did n't do any of those things
' it did things we just did n't really expect
' professor jeff karson and professor bob wysocki have together set up the lava project at syracuse university 's department of earth sciences to study how lava behaves in different situations
they create lava by melting basalt gravel in a giant gas fired furnace and then pouring it over sand , ice and through water
according to alistair linsell , a nuclear chemist working with edf energy and a science presenter with the science channel , the extreme heat of the lava is what causes the strange formations to form when it hits the ice
he said : ' the lava is so hot that when it is poured on to the ice , the ice turns not into water but straight into steam
' the formation of all of this steam helps the lava to flow
it is sitting on top of a blanket of steam rather than the ice itself , this means the friction between the lava and the ice surface is very low
the lava flows rapidly across the surface of the ice on a cushion of escaping steam it creates as it moves ' as the lava cools we start to get a thick black layer forming on top and that starts to trap those bubbles of superheated steam inside the rock
' it is kind of like a natural form of glass blowing
