the newborn child of murder - accused u.s. teenager mack was rushed to a prison clinic today after falling ill in her mother âs bali prison cell
just one week after the child âs birth in an indonesian hospital , baby stella schaefer - named after miss mack âs co-accused boyfriend tommy schaefer - developed a high fever and her dark skin took on a yellowish color in the cell , which her mother shares with eight other prisoners
the little girl was hurried into the clinic , which is located within the prison walls , and given immediate treatment by doctors
but it was the yellow appearance of the baby âs skin that was causing the greatest worry
with miss mack being concerned about the child âs health , doctors told guards at kerobokan prison that she wanted her boyfriend , who is being held in the men âs section , to be present in the clinic while the baby was being treated
this was allowed and , according to sources , miss mack and tommy schaefer held hands while doctors attended to the child
tommy schaefer had first set his eyes on his baby daughter on monday afternoon after his girlfriend returned from the sanglah hospital , where she gave birth to the baby via caesarian
he was escorted by guards to miss mack âs cell where , in a tearful meeting , he held his daughter in his arms , tears running down his face
trial : mack ( left ) and her boyfriend tommy schaefer ( right ) , both from chicago , are accused of murdering mack 's socialite mother sheila von weise-mack , 62 , and hiding her body in a suitcase at an upmarket bali hotel women sharing miss mack âs cell also gathered around mother and child , but miss mack has been warned that their congratulations could turn to anger if the baby wakes them up with her crying night after night
â keeping the baby in a humid , unclean cell , where prisoners sleep on the floor , is hardly the place for a newborn baby , â said a bali resident who visits the jail regularly
â adults get sick in there , so what chance does a newborn have ? â victim : miss mack with her late mother sheila von weise-mack , whom she and her boyfriend tommy schaefer are accused of murdering reports from a jail source say that the baby will be kept in the clinic under observation while her mother remains in her cell
but if the child , born a few weeks prematurely , does not improve within the next 48 hours she will have to be returned to hospital
â there seems no doubt that the baby needs pretty intensive treatment , â said the jail visitor after talking to prison officials
â it may be that she will have to be returned to hospital within a few hours
â the drama surrounding the baby âs health was being played out on the day that miss mack and tommy schaefer were due to return to court for the continuation of the murder charges against them
they have been accused of killing miss mack âs 62 - year - old socialite mother , sheila von wiese-mack , from chicago , in the upmarket st regis hotel in bali âs seaside nusa dua district
tommy schaefer has admitted hitting her with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self - defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase , which was then loaded into the boot of a taxi they had ordered
the three judges who were due to hear the case were informed that the accused couple would not be available due to the baby âs health
the case was adjourned and is expected to resume next week
but while miss mack faces ongoing concerns about the baby âs condition and the prospect of being sentenced to death if she is convicted of her mother âs murder , she is understood to be under pressure in another direction
tommy schaefer âs mother , kia walker , visited miss mack in hospital and , after setting her eyes on the new - born baby , is understood to have begged miss mack not to take the child back to the prison with her
but as events have shown , that is what she did - but if the baby âs condition does not improve she will be sent back to the hospital again .
