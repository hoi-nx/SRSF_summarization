tory efforts to rein in spending and curb welfare payments have won a resounding vote of public approval , according to nation - wide research
there has been no public backlash against five years of austerity and even labour voters support reforms to the benefits system , the british social attitudes survey found
the report also said that voters have broadly accepted student tuition fees , while the majority of the population is satisfied with the nhs
david cameron 's efforts to rein in spending and curb welfare payments have won a resounding vote of public approval , according to nation - wide research this support for what are effectively coalition policies is not reflected in the polls , however , even though the general election is in six weeks â time
over the past few months , labour has mostly had a lead of between one and three points , on 31 to 33 , with the conservatives on 30
a daily mail / comres poll this week had both parties on 35 points
in a major vote of confidence for the government , almost three in four people backed the benefits cap â one of david cameron âs reforms which has been most severely criticised by the left
among labour supporters two in three back the cap , which restricts handouts to the level of an average wage â currently Â£ 500 a week for a family
despite the support for the tory policies , ed miliband 's labour is still ahead in the polls half of voters are unsympathetic to the idea of increasing welfare handouts , with 52 per cent believing unemployment benefits are too high
and a similar percentage think that unemployed people could find a job if they wanted to
the annual report , which is based on 2,878 interviews with people across britain in autumn last year , also revealed concerns about how welfare claimants spend their money
six out of ten said that claimants should be able to spend benefits only on specific goods and services , as with food stamps in the us
fewer than one in ten people think that immigrants â from the eu or elsewhere â should be able to claim welfare payments indefinitely , while even half of labour voters would set a six - month limit on giving eu arrivals access to the full range of benefits
the findings suggest that voters have not responded to left - wing outcries against government cuts
however , there are warnings for the leading parties
more than nine out of ten people think the nhs is facing a funding crisis , and while a majority want to see the health service free to users and paid for out of taxes , fewer than half think it will still be so in ten years â time
rachel ormston of natcen , which carried out the research , said : â the public ... has seemingly accepted many of the coalition âs big reforms
in spite of the narrative of austerity ... nhs satisfaction is back up , there is acceptance of tuition fees , and at least some benefits cuts are popular
â researchers said they had expected to find a public reaction against spending and benefit cuts
but the report said : â the most common position remains that taxes and spending should stay at the same level
â in 2002 nearly two out of three people said they wanted higher taxes and more spending on health , education and benefits
that fell to just 32 per cent by 2010 , and is now up slightly to 37 per cent
the new report added that labour supporters were more sympathetic to welfare spending than other respondents , but â even so they can hardly be regarded as enthusiasts for more , and would prefer that people of working age were in work
