this can leave them tired and moody and lower the quality of their work , oat producer flahavan 's said
while two in three people are eating breakfast every day , the study found one in 13 never had a morning meal
of those who are regularly missing out , two - thirds said they found it difficult to eat early in the morning , with other reasons including not considering breakfast important , not having time , preferring to stay in bed and having too many chores
the results showed more people were regularly missing the first meal of the day , compared with the 20 per cent who were skipping it three years ago
the time taken to eat the meal is also lower , now at just over nine minutes compared to almost ten in 2012
what the nation is eating for breakfast appears to be constantly changing , too
while cold cereals , porridge , fruit and toast remain the staple morning fuel for the majority of breakfasters , the fry up has now become an occasional treat with only 1.5 per cent of respondents saying they started the day with a traditional breakfast most days of the week
john noonan , of flahavan 's , said : ' our findings show a shift in the number of people having breakfast - the eating occasion renowned for being the most important meal of the day
just 1.5 per cent of people have a traditional fried breakfast before work every morning , a study found ' it 's no secret that we all need a good breakfast to get the day off to a good start
' and while it 's great to see that people are becoming more health - conscious with their breakfast choices - opting for porridge and healthy cereals - the number of people who are regularly going without breakfast is certainly surprising , particularly given that making a nutritious , tasty breakfast takes no time at all
' we know that people are time - pressured , particularly from monday to friday , but skipping breakfast only results in people feeling worse in the long - run , as they do n't have enough energy to power them through the day
