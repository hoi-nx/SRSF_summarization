cesar azpilicueta may be chelsea 's mr reliable but it 's doubtful blues boss jose mourinho will be seeking his advice on team selection if his five - a - side line - up is anything to go by
the defender nicknamed ' dave ' was asked to select from his favourite team - mates and the 25 - year - old spaniard went out of left field by picking two goalkeepers , petr cech and thibaut courtois , and arsenal 's nacho monreal as his only defender
chelsea boss jose mourinho is unlikely to be talking tactics with cesar azpilicueta but cesar azpilicueta made up for his unorthodox defence by selecting eden hazard in midfield and diego costa as his striker
â firstly , i apologise to any of my old team - mates if i missed you out , but it was so hard just picking five , â cesar azpilicueta told the chelsea website
cesar azpilicueta picked an unorthodox five - a - side team with two goalkeepers including petr cech cesar azpilicueta 's side would be hard to score against with petr cech and thibaut courtois between the sticks â i 've played with some great goalkeepers
i do n't know , there are too many to choose from ! â can i pick two goalkeepers ? well , it is my team ! i 'm going for petr cech and thibaut courtois
â arsenal 's nacho monreal would have his hands full as the only defender in the five - a - side team at least the attacking options looked good with chelsea 's eden hazard as the midfielder chelsea striker diego costa would link up in attack with hazard in cesar azpilicueta 's side â i 'm not going to pick myself , so the defender in my side is going to be nacho monreal from arsenal
he is my good friend , we know each other from osasuna and he is a good competitor
â my first attacking player is eden hazard
it 's for obvious reasons
â â my striker will be diego costa
i know he 's going to compete , be strong
i think we are going to have a good team with these players
