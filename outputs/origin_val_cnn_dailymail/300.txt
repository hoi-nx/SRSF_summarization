a tennessee church is drawing criticism after it posted a message on its marquee which appeared to link satan and the lgbt community 's quest to secure equal rights
the tabernacle posted the controversial message , but took it down after experiencing some backlash
before it was removed , the marquee read : ' remember satan was the first to demand equal rights
many people felt the sign was meant to offend individuals who identify as gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender , but the knoxville baptist tabernacle 's pastor said that was not the case
pastor greene said : ' our sign referencing satan demanding his equal rights to ascend into the heavens and be god was simply all about that individual
' it was not a statement against any one group in particular , you know what about the rights of the unborn babies , the rights of children , the rights of everyone ? ' some did not buy greene 's explanation
andy henry told wbir : ' it 's clearly a sign that was meant to offend a particular community - the lgbt community
' because of ( the church 's ) lack of foresight , they ended up offending everybody who had ever fought for equality or civil rights in general
' the sign was changed to read : ' glad you reading , did not intend to offend , we all need christ
' greene said : ' we are a diversity congregation of people
' we 've reached people that know us and know our stand in this community know what we 've done
' my heart breaks in the dividedness of our country
' the tabernacle ' not only supports soul - winning at home , but also supports evangelism and church - planting in america and around the world ' , according to its website
the church has missions in brazil , peru , mexico , haiti , ireland and scotland
it will have another message posted later this week , according to the pastor .
