i âm trying to make sure everybody gets involved in the games
i want to be fair on the club managers
â at this moment , i have nât picked the team so i ca nât pick a captain
once i pick the team , i âll have an idea

â i have other decisions to make as well
who âs the goalie ? who âs going to be the main one up front ? who âs going to be the wide players ? they are smashing decisions to have to make
