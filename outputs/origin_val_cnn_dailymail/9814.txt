a comic relief fundraiser sparked a large - scale police alert when he was seen walking along a busy road in full camouflage carrying a ' large rifle '
armed police , a helicopter and patrol cars were called to the whitefriars area of norwich after members of the public raised the alarm this morning
but officers have now revealed that the man , who lives locally , was just on his way to a fundraising event in a costume complete with a toy ak47
chief inspector chris spinks said the man surrendered the ' weapon ' and was ' apologetic and very embarrassed '
armed police are hunting a ' gunman ' in full camouflage clothing seen walking through a busy city centre ' as a result of the media attention we had a phone call come in saying they thought they had identified the man , ' he said
' we went to see him at 2pm and he was very apologetic and very embarrassed
two of our officers offered him some strong words of advice
' he surrendered the weapon which was an imitation firearm
it was a plastic model ak47 which he had painted himself to make it more realistic
' what he has been told and what we would tell other people is that anybody who wants to do something out of the ordinary should think about it first
' obviously when you have dressed yourself like that you know what your motives are but clearly some people this morning were not and they rightly called the police
' we were relatively certain that it would be something around the fundraising issue but we could n't be sure so we responded with our armed unit , our dog unit and a helicopter
' there have been no sightings of the man since officers responded to a number of calls this morning ' this is the second similar high profile incident which has taken place in the last month
' we would like to remind people to think carefully about the consequences of carrying imitation weapons and of their general appearance which , as in this case , could be misconstrued by other members of the public
' no offences were committed , but the man was visited by officers and has been given strong words of advice about the consequences of his actions
officers were called to the whitefriars area of norwich - near the city 's law courts - at about 8.30am today and a helicopter was deployed to help with the search
a taxi driver , who captured video of the ' gunman ' , said : ' i saw a man in the full combat clothing carrying a rifle in his right hand
' i was n't sure if it was an imitation but i thought it was a bit strange
' eliza o'hara tweeted : ' arrive at work to find the area surrounded by police with guns and a helicopter circling
' john m hayes â tweeted : ' our norwich office was surrounded by armed police and helicopters , thankfully none of the team was wearing camouflage
' police mounted a full - scale search operation in norwich on february 18 when a teenager was spotted waving around a machete
it turned out he was a second - year media student participating in a film project - and was actually waving a toy sword
