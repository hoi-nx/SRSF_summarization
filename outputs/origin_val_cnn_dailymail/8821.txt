he has already made abolishing the obamacare the centerpiece of his young presidential campaign , and once spoke for 21 hours straight on the floor of the senate in a bid to block its funding
but now cruz says he and his family will be the latest to use the system , signing up for medical insurance coverage through the obamacare law 's government - run marketplaces
cruz 's wife heidi has taken an unpaid leave of absence from her job at goldman sachs to campaign with him â and lost her employer - funded plan in the process
as democrats gleefully mocked the irony , though , cruz insists he 's just following the law
obamascare : cruz announced his presidential run on monday , the same day his wife took a leave of absence from her job â forgoing the family 's medical insurance pediatrics on line one : the cruz daughters , catherine ( left ) and caroline ( right ) need a health plan and for now the obamacare system will have to do â while their father works to ' rip it out , root and branch ' transition : heidi cruz left her goldman sachs ' cadillac plan ' behind when she took a leave of absence to campaign for her husband ' we will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care and we 're in the process of transitioning over to do that , ' cruz , a gop senator from texas , told the des moines register on tuesday
the exchanges , created by the obamacare law , are designed to be state - specific insurance marketplaces where the uninsured can find coverage
using them is mandatory for middle - income americans who want to receive federal government subsidies to help pay their premiums
the obamacare originally left members of congress alone , but iowa grassley senator grassley famously inserted a ' poison pill ' amendment requiring them â and their staff members â to participate like other american if they lacked insurance from other sources
' the more that congress experiences the laws it passes , the better , ' grassley said back then
democrats did n't budge , and the provision now requires cruz to join millions who have signed up for obamacare - brokered coverage
he could get the last laught , however , using his experience to construct a first - hand testimonial about the law 's shortcomings
liberal lawmakers were mum tuesday on the development , passing up an easy opportunity to call cruz a hypocrite
daily mail online asked five senate offices and five house offices , all democratic , for comment
planned parenthood , american 's biggest abortion lobby , did use the ' h ' word
it has defended the obamacare law , largely because it forces insurers to provide contraception coverage
' luckily for sen. cruz , hypocrisy is n't a pre-existing condition , ' the group tweeted
the democratic national committee weighed in , but offered only a half - swing at the softball question
' the obamacare , by design , helps american who have gaps in employment get coverage , and it 's working , ' democratic national committee national press secretary holly shulman told daily mail online
' we encourage others to follow presidential candidate cruz to www.healthcare.gov and get covered
' the houston firebrand wo n't exactly get a grassroots experience when he enrolls , however
glee : the democratic national committee piled on , but never called cruz a hypocrite the ' h ' word : abortion lobby planned parenthood heaped on the scorn at cruz 's predicament the washington city government extends congressional offices a sweetheart deal that 's not part of the obamacare itself , allowing federal lawmakers and their aides to enroll through the city 's small business health options program
that system was designed for ' small businesses ' with fewer than 50 employees
the congress employs more than 20,000 people
it also makes medical insurance customers eligible for payments from their employers for most of the premiums
the obama administration 's office of personnel management made the arrangement legal by quietly issuing a rule just before the obamacare law took effect â and setting the typical reimbursement level at 75 per cent
some customers , including well - paid senators , will get that benefit even though their income levels would be too high to qualify for subsidies if they had to buy coverage on the open exchanges like millions of others
cruz told cnn on tuesday that he has no choice but to ' follow the text of every law , even laws i disagree with
' ' it 's one of the real differences â if you look at president obama and the lawlessness , if he disagrees with a law he simply refuses to follow it or claims the authority to unilaterally change , ' cruz said
not too late , ted : even though the obamacare open - enrollment period is over , american can still sign up if they ' have certain life changes in 2015 ' he also took a verbal swing at senate minority leader harry reid , who has allowed professional staffers on senate committees to exempt themselves
' harry reid and the democrats did n't want to be under the same rules as the american people , ' he sniped
but cruz still believes the obamacare law should be killed â ' ripped out , root and branch ' is how he put it during an iowa event in january
' and i believe it will be , ' he told the paper , the largest and most influential in the early presidential caucus state of iowa
' i believe in 2017 a new president , a gop president will sign legislation repealing every word of it , ' he insisted
' there are a fair number of gop in washington and elsewhere who have quietly and privatively given up on that fight and i have not
