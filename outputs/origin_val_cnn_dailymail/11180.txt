the interior walls of training complexes are invariably decorated with motivational slogans
simple truisms to feed the mind on days when the body is weak
for gordon , the old wisdom â fail to prepare , then prepare to fail â is more a way of life than a fleeting thought
to the uninitiated , tomorrow âs final will be settled over 90 , maybe 120 minutes , with the lingering possibility of penalty kicks
celtic keeper gordon is fully focused ahead of the scottish league cup final with dundee united
but , long before the first ball is kicked in earnest , the celtic goalkeeper fully expects to be ahead in the battle of wits
while much of what will transpire between celtic and dundee united will be random and instinctive , gordon believes his slavish devotion to studying what âs liable to be thrown at him can significantly shorten the odds on his side coming out on top
â every game , â he replied when asked how frequently he âd dip into video analysis
â free kicks , penalties , the way strikers like to finish the ball , how they strike the ball
â i just look at those things and keep mental notes on how they like to do things and what âs their favourite side
notes are taken on different players so i know
gordon fails to hold the ball allowing rodrigo palacio of inter milan to score in the europa league â it âs about taking that research out on the training pitch , too , and practicing for who you âre going to be playing against - a team that likes to put a lot of low , early crosses into the box , for example
â for the rangers game , it was deep early crosses hung up to the back post so we focused our training around that
that played out during the game too as i was able to come and take the deep crosses that were taking the pressure off
between all of us we come up with a plan for the game
â and when that plan comes together in the form of a victory and a clean sheet ? gordon will be hoping to celebrates his first showcase occasion since hearts earned cup glory in 2006 â absolutely , it âs satisfying , â gordon added
â it becomes a team effort with woodsy ( stevie woods , the goalkeeping coach ) and the video analysis guys to ensure we âre as well prepared as possible
and that âs not just me - john collins does it with midfielders and defenders , so it âs preparation
â what we âre trying to do is make the game as easy as possible for us so we know what we âre coming up against
â celtic have not reinvented the wheel with their forensic approach
nine years ago , gordon played in the scottish cup for hearts against gretna â his last major final as it would transpire
few neutral observers fancied the borderers to go the distance that day but they did just that
gordon âs intervention in the final chapter was key , however
as hearts hit four perfect kicks , he saved from derek townsley before watching gavin skelton sky the eighth and final kick over the top
celtic goalkeeper gordon celebrates their goal during the scottish premiership match against aberdeen â i had a fair idea of most of the gretna penalty takers , â he recalled
â i had seen penalties from them
with penalties , nowadays everyone does their homework
â that stop from 12 yards not only allowed gordon to lift the only major honour of his career to date - it cemented his reputation as one of the finest goalkeepers scotland has produced
when a Â£ 9million move to sunderland was completed a year later , it seemed he âd spend half his life on the winner âs podium
little did he realise at the time , how unique those scenes of celebration would prove
a year ago , with the road back from injury seemingly never ending , the chance of another fix of the winning feeling seemed fanciful
â i probably did nât appreciate at the time like i should have done - playing in a cup final , winning a cup , â he reflected
celtic keeper gordon speaks with referee craig thomson after the scottish cup quarter final â albeit it âs a different competition this sunday but it âs still to win a cup , i probably did think it would come around again , that i âd get another chance
â i have nât been close until now so i âm going to enjoy this one a little bit more , but then i âll only really enjoy it if we win the match
â it âs not something i âll look back on fondly if we do nât
certainly i want to take it in a little more this time
â gordon is beaten by rangers striker nacho novo during hearts ' 3 - 2 defeat at ibrox stadium in glagow hearts â 2006 hampden park triumph was obviously memorable
yet lurking just beneath the surface lay a sense of regret
george burley âs side had started the campaign like a train but being unbeaten and top of the league in october was nât enough to shield him from romanov âs axe
john mcglynn took temporary charge before graham rix arrived
in time , he was bulleted to make way for valdas ivanauskas
despite the endless turmoil , hearts still split the old firm , with rangers nudged into third place
there are those in gorgie who will go to their graves believing they could have gone one better had it not been for in the insanity of the man at the top
hearts goalkeeper gordon during the bank of scotland premier league match against celtic at parkhead â we âll never know , â gordon shrugged
â would more have been achieved ? it may have but it may not
you can speculate but no - one at the time could have told if there was more to come from that group of players
it was still a successful time and one i âll remember fondly for the rest of my years
â they were , to put it mildly , colourful days
romanov âs liking for self - harm culminated in gordon , pressley and hartley taking the unusual step of holding a press conference to air their frustrations
the riccarton three , as they were dubbed , all lived to tell the tale
â it was great days playing in a great team and enjoying playing football , â gordon reflected
â they âre the things people remember when you finish
gordon in action during the tennents scottish cup semi final between against celtic at hampden park gordon and andrew driver celebrate in front of the fans as hearts beat hibernian 1 - 0 at easter road â it was a really good team and when that team gets back together it âs a special time for the hearts fans because they were packing out the ground every week and winning most matches at home and scoring lots of goals
â there was always a downside but on the other side of that we were quite successful on the pitch
it was a good team
â whatever went on elsewhere was something which did nât really affect us
that was because of the strength of the characters we had
gordon throws his gloves in to the crowd following the premier league match with kilmarnock â there are players from that team and some really good characters
quite a few of that team have gone into management and will probably continue to do so
â while hartley , pressley and robbie nielson have done just that , gordon still has many races to run as a player
still in contention for three trophies as celtic âs no1 , a nine - year wait to feel a winner âs medal around his neck again could be emphatically bookended in the coming weeks
ronaldinho celebrates scoring past goalkeeper gordon during a pre-season friendly at murrayfield stadium â it âs hard , we have played a lot of games already , â gordon added
â but that âs something you have to deal with when you âre fighting on so many fronts
trying to win three trophies is going to take its toll but these are the games you have to get through and recover well between times
â up until now we âve managed it pretty well
even when we âve not been playing well we âve still managed to get through and get the results
â i do nât think that âs a problem
it âs part and parcel of having a successful season
it âs something you have to deal with and we will
â scottish goalkeeper gordon in goal for sunderland after his Â£ 9million exit from hearts back in 2007 so far , he âs dealt with just about everything that been cast his way
from the cynics that felt signing a long - term crock to replace fraser forster would only end one way , to the strikers in scotland and across europe who have found him back to his imperious best
it âs not taken long for the smoke signals to be seen down south either
chelsea have been linked with a move for the 32 - year - old as back - up for thibaut courtois this summer
but surely gordon , who effectively still has a two - year tie to parkhead , has spent enough time watching football these past three years to not voluntarily do so again ? â who says i could nât be no1 , like ? â he laughed
â it âs flattering but i âll just concentrate on doing what i âm doing and we âll see what happens after that
