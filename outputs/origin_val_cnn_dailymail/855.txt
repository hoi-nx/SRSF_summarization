and while some might think that ella 's health - focused food strategy would fail to catch on in the u.s. - where more than two thirds of adults are classified as obese or overweight - ella feels that her strong u.s. following is down to that fact that health foods , and veganism , have become so incredibly popular , even more so here than in the u.k. ' i spent a lot of time in los angeles last year , and taking care of yourself is just so normal there , ' she remarks
' no one thinks you 're mad for going hiking and drinking green juice for fun
' fan favorites include ella 's brownies , which are made from a base of sweet potatoes , and her coconut thai curry , a creamy medley of squash and chickpeas

the little - understood disease affects the nervous system , and , quite out - of - the - blue , left her in constant pain , sleeping for 16 hours a day , riddled with infections and so bloated she had to wear her father âs clothes
after giving up all animal products and all processed food , however , ella managed to heal herself , where months in hospital and endless courses of medication failed to do so
' i have nât felt symptoms returning since i came off my medication , which is incredible , ' she says
' i âm conscious of the way i live and do things every day that nourish my body
i eat well , i work out , i try to manage stress , i get a good sleep in , and together that does wonders
' holistic lifestyle : ' i eat well , i work out , i try to manage stress , i get a good sleep in , and together that does wonders , ' says ella , pictured in london at red 's women of the year awards in september one criticism ella does face , however , is how expensive her ingredients are
many of her recipes require large quantities of expensive nuts , medjool dates and obscure ingredients like psyllium husk powder and maca , for example
' the baking part can be expensive , but i do nât bake that regularly , ' she says
' the things i cook and eat on a regular basis are really inexpensive
' i eat mostly seasonal veggies , beans , brown rice and homemade hummus
then i make big batches of soups and recipes , like my chili and curry , which , again , are pretty inexpensive , and they âre great things to stock your freezer with
' healthy spin : one of ella 's most famous recipes is for her brownies ( left ) , which are made from a base of sweet potatoes
pictured ( right ) , the cover of her newly - released cookbook asked whether any aspect of her choice to go vegan was related to ethics , or animal welfare , ella , who wears fur , said no. ' i always say that anyone should adapt my recipes to make it work for them , and if that means adding salmon or chicken , then i âm very supportive of that , ' she explains , adding that she has ' learned a lot ' about the meat and dairy industry recently , and does see problems with it
ella is currently working on two further cookbooks , with plans to spend more time in the u.s. in the near future
in the meantime , her favorite recipes from her debut book ? ' the coconut thai curry , the cacao and almond butter fudge , and the beetroot and chocolate cake with a coconut frosting , ' she says
' awesome , and so easy to make
