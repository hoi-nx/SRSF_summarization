it 's offensive on many levels , ' he said
' it ruined my night so i left without saying goodbye to my friends
' i am constantly judged because i am transgender
i hope i 've made a stand for transculture
' i would have been much happier if this sort of thing did n't happen in the first place but i 'm relieved it 's all been settled professionally
' at the time of the incident he said : ' i was so embarrassed
i do n't know if another punter had said something , but i was in the toilets and a bouncer asked me to leave and use the disabled one instead
he made me feel like a freak
the 24 - year - old said he feels he is constantly judged because he is transgender and was left embarrassed mr browning ( left ) said he only got the confidence to go through sex change treatment after he was born a girl ( right ) with the support of his younger sister , kelly , after he was bullied at school ' if someone genuinely identifies as a man , people need to treat them like a man
that 's just a matter of respect
' we are the only minority still striving for equality and there are a lot of haters out there.people still make insulting comments and say i 'm ' scared to be a girl '
' that 's just ignorant
' mr browning has starred in documentaries , been on the jeremy kyle show , and has started hosting events to raise awareness of lesbian , gay and transgender issues
kay has spoken about the problems he encountered in school as a transgender man he has previously spoken about his struggle with being transgender and revealed he was picked on for wearing boyish baggy clothes , tying his hair back and refusing to wear any make - up
it led to him being labelled a lesbian by classmates , which confused and unsure , the teenager assumed must be true
but at the age of 14 mr browning spoke to a teacher and realised he was transgender and began dressing as a male , and shaved his hair
the 24 - year - old said last year that he had finally got the confidence to go through with gender reassignment surgery following the support of his younger sister kelly
he said he would like to ' shake hands ' with the owners of remedies and start again
he added : ' it 's in my nature to forgive - they did n't understand me but i want to be the bigger person and i want them to move with the times
' it 's not the easiest place to be transgender , but i have made massive changes
' i had a letter from a boy who said when he told his dad he was a transsexual he would n't speak to him - but after watching me on jeremy kyle he changed his mind
' alec carter , director of greendale leisure ltd , said : ' remedies tiverton is operated by a great team and with the training they have received and listening to our customers they are better place then ever to provide a safe enjoyable venue for all
