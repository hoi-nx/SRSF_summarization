djokovic is the ultimate problem for everyone in men âs tennis to solve â and for murray in particular
the british no 1 went down 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 in 88 minutes to his direct contemporary on saturday in the latest match of what has begun to look like a one - sided rivalry
the 27 year - old serb âs victory not only put him into the final of the indian wells at indian wells , it also represented his ninth victory out of 10 against murray , the exception being the 2013 wimbledon final
british no1 murray crashes out of indian wells semi-final at indian wells after losing to djokovic murray plays a shot during his semi-final match against djokovic in indian wells wells on saturday djokovic celebrates his win over murray that sees the serb progress to the final of the indian wells djokovic and murray meet at the net following their quick semi-final in california on saturday and murray said : â the frustrating thing is obviously getting off to a bad start in both sets
djokovic did nât give me any free points at the beginning of either set and i made a few too many errors early on
â at the end of both sets , i started to play a bit better and made it tougher and was able to push him a bit , but not enough at the beginning of the sets to make it challenging enough for him
â djokovic was in sublime form and murray âs only chance appeared to be to serve outstandingly well , which he did not
on the kind of medium - slow hard court that is so commonplace on the atp tour the world no 1 , when fully prepared and motivated , looks irresistible
djokovic said : â i tried to start with the right intensity , i got a crucial break at the start
murray made a lot of unforced errors , his first - serve percentage was low
i âm sure he knows i âm returning well , i know he âs returning well , so that puts added pressure on our serving
â murray 's caoch amelie mauresmo watches on from the stands in indian wells djokovic will play either roger federer or milos raonic in the final on sunday there was nothing in the way of the aggravation that marked their last meeting , the australian open final , where murray looked like he was getting the upper hand before his opponent started hamming up his physical state and the scot became distracted
that was part of what has been , by and large , a decent start to the season for murray , but his problem remains that djokovic plays in a similar fashion to him and does it decisively better
murray had been in impressive form over the past 10 days while djokovic enjoyed a walkover in his scheduled quarter - final against bernard tomic
and djokovic will now face roger federer in sunday 's final after the swiss came through his semi-final against rafa nadal âs conqueror , raonic
roger federer beat the canadian 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 , finally finding the break he needed in the 11th game of the first set
he clinched the opener with a forehand winner , then broke raonic âs serve again at the start of the second set
raonic , enticed to the net repeatedly by roger federer only to see power strokes whizz past him , struggled against roger federer âs serve and the world no 2 completed the victory with a volley at the net
