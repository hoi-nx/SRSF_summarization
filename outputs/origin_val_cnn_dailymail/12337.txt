federal authorities say it 's the largest irs impersonation scam they 've ever seen -- swindling victims out of more than $ 15 million since it began in 2013
" they have information that only the irs would know about you , " said camus , deputy inspector general for investigations with the treasury
" it 's a byproduct of today 's society
there 's so much information available on individuals
" using identity theft technology , the thieves have successfully victimized more than 3,000 people in the past two years , although the treasury cautions that number is only documented cases and the true number might be higher
camus said they 've recorded more than 366,000 reports of contact with the scammers , and it 's increasing at a rate of 10,000 to 12,000 a week
authorities believe the thieves are operating out of india , using phishing technology to make it appear they 're irs agents in washington
call 1 : ' the irs is filing a lawsuit against you ' call 2 : ' your address is under state investigation ' the ftc , which goes after scammers like these from a civil standpoint , and the treasury , which leads the criminal probe , both have open investigations
the largest loss reported was a staggering $ 500,000 , camus said
most have lost about $ 5,000

" frank garcia says he spent five hours driving to various stores around charlotte , depositing $ 500 each time into a paypal account set up by the woman on the phone
he ended up losing about $ 4,000
he , and other victims , told cnn the swindlers never let their victims hang up the phone
" i have never been arrested in my life and was very scared , " said ko , a new jersey resident who lost about $ 5,000 after he says the impersonator told him he was facing five years in prison , and the irs was about to confiscate his assets : his car , his house and all the money in his bank account
the person had a badge number , read him an arrest warrant from a nearby police jurisdiction
