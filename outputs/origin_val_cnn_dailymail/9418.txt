the nra has taken aim at former arizona rep. giffords just as she is seeking to push for bipartisan legislation on gun safety
giffords spoke on capitol hill on wednesday and called for expanded criminal background checks on all commercial firearms sales including at gun shows and internet sales
' giffords : everyone should have to pass background check my attacker passed , ' tweeted the nra , which is n't in favor of the legislation , in response on thursday
he murdered six and wounded 18 other people , including giffords , when he opened fire at an event near tucson , arizona in 2011
the tweet , sent to the organization 's 264,000 followers , included a link to an article published on the right - wing breitbart website that argued that background checks do n't reduce gun violence
the story noted that jared loughner had passed a background check
' stopping violence takes courage , ' said giffords on wednesday
' now is the time to come together and be responsible
democrats , republicans , everyone
we must never stop fighting
' giffords won a tremendous amount of public sympathy and admiration for her brave fightback from serious injury and up until now the nra has refrained from attacking her
several lawmakers have blasted the nra over its tweet mocking giffords
nra executive vice president wayne lapierre is n't in favor of giffords legislation calling for expanded criminal background checks ' giffords is a fighter , ' sen. kirsten gillibrand , a friend of giffords , told the daily news
' personal attacks on twitter are not going to stop her from working hard every single day to pass common sense gun safety laws that save lives
' ' the nra 's brazen response is as predictable as it is pathetic , ' said rep. kathleen rice , who is among the co-sponsors of the bill
she called the attack ' blatant fear - mongering and desperate intimidation ' aimed at derailing common - sense laws
supporters of the law say that even though the likes of jared loughner passed background checks , a uniform federal requirement would help stop many other dangerous people from buying gun and reduce gun violence rates
' no one can deny the fact that it will help prevent violent criminals from buying guns , ' rice said .
