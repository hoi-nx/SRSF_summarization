being at old trafford on saturday was a surreal experience â and i âm not even referring to the wes brown - john oâshea red card cock - up
manchester united dominated the game , were by far the better side , and they won comfortably
but their fans were not satisfied
at one point in the first half , a deep manchester united corner found its way back to david de gea in goal
boos echoed around old trafford , and then a loud chant rang out : ' attack ! attack ! attack , attack , attack ! ' wayne rooney leaps for joy after scoring a brace against sunderland on saturday as manchester united won manchester united only took control of the game after wes brown was sent off against his former club there is a lack of realism among manchester united âs critics and some of the supporters this season
they need to understand and accept that it used to be champagne and caviar with fergie ; last season was bread and water ; this season it âs a bag of chips with one of those little bottles of cheap , weak continental beer
david moyes took the club in the wrong direction in so many ways
we âre waiting to see if louis van gaal is the right man , but manchester united âs football does nât look good when compared with the recent greatness
between 2007 and 2013 manchester united had the most successful period in their history
they won the title five times in that period
they made the champions league final three times in a four - year period , winning it once
it would not be wrong to say manchester united in that spell were second only to barcelona in the world , and that barcelona side under pep guardiola is the best club side i have ever seen
in the years before sir fergie retired , manchester united were phenomenal
that side was arguably their best ever
despite the win there were sections of the home crowd that were not totally satisfied with the performance the champagne and caviar days that supporters were used to under sir fergie are over some great players contributed to that run of success â cristiano ronaldo , carlos tevez and wayne rooney up front
rio ferdinand and nemanja vidic â possibly the premier league âs greatest ever centre - half partnership â were rocks at the back
edwin van der sar was the long - awaited replacement for peter schmeichel in goal
and of course paul scholes and ryan giggs were still weaving magic spells on the pitch in that side , while gary neville was as solid and dependable off the pitch as on it
of all those names only one is still playing for manchester united , and he scored both goals in saturday âs win
another â michael carrick â has been injured for most of this season
there is an array of talent and character listed there , and that can not easily be replaced
shorn of such star quality , a massive rebuild job is now underway
and having sunk to an unimaginable low last season under frankly the wrong manager , expectations of manchester united need readjustment
many of fergie 's title - winning team in 2013 have left the club and it is hard to replace those players fergie celebrates winning his final premier league title in 2013 before retiring some manchester united observers seem to think that the signing of a Â£ 60million player should automatically return the side to the breathtaking football from a few years ago
it does nât work like that â it âs about building a team after that glorious side under fergie was decimated
the football has been far from brilliant but it will take time
angel di maria started life at old trafford on fire , but injuries affected him badly , and a burglary has unsettled his young family in a new foreign country , and that âs clearly impacted on the player ( although his pass to set up ander herrera âs goal at swansea was sublime )
in the first half on saturday he was pretty awful but he was also targeted by sunderland
first lee cattermole , then jordi gomez , clattered into him , yet somehow escaped bookings
it âs too easy to break di maria âs spirit on the pitch at the moment
but as gus poyet said after saturday âs game , manchester united fans have nothing to worry about if they remember this is di maria , who is actually one of the world âs best players most of the time
louis van gaal is rebuilding the manchester united team and it is a work in progress angel di maria has been criticised in recent weeks and was awful in the first half against sunderland there are some surprising positives for manchester united this season â notably ashley young , who has been consistently impressive and effective out wide
but it âs a work very much in progress
i understand that manchester united fans want to play football the fergie way
but you âre asking too much too soon
a few years ago the most successful manchester united side in the club âs rich history dominated domestically and were the only side to challenge the brilliance of barcelona
fast forward a couple of seasons and that team has been ripped to shreds
but it âs unfair to expect ' fergie football ' so soon .
