a germany professor has been forced to apologise for declining an india student 's internship because of the ' rape problem ' in his country
professor annette beck-sickinger 's response to the application went viral after it was posted online and prompted a wave of indignation , forcing the intervention of germany 's ambassador to india
her original response to the student 's application stated : ' dear sir , unfortunately i do n't accept any india male students for internships
professor annette beck-sickinger 's email ( pictured ) stated she did n't accept any male india students for internships because of the country 's ' rape problem ' in response germany ambassador to india michael steiner wrote a letter ( pictured ) stating he ' strongly objected ' to her comments ' we hear a lot about the rape problem in india which i can not support
i have many female students in my group , so i think this attitude is something i can not support
' this was later posted online , with the professor 's and student 's names redacted under the title : ' what should an india male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of india being projected as an unsafe country for women ? ' following the outrage which erupted , she backtracked on her comments , stating in an apology posted to germany 's embassy website that she had ' made a mistake ' and apologized to ' everyone whose feelings i have hurt '
when her email came to light , ambassador michael steiner wrote a scathing letter rebuking her for the comments , stating : ' let me make it clear at the outset that i strongly object to this
' he added , in reference to a notorious 2012 dehli gang rape in which a woman died : ' the nirbhaya case has triggered a lively , honest , sustained and very healthy public debate - a public debate of a quality that would n't be possible in many other countries
germany 's india ambassador michael steiner ( pictured ) condemned the professor 's comments in an open letter ' your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offence to these women and men ( activists ) ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in india ; and it is an offence to millions of law - abiding , tolerant , open - minded and hard - working india
' let 's be clear : india is not a country of rapists
' in the 2012 case he referenced , the student was savagely attacked by six men including with an iron rod after boarding a private bus on her way home from the cinema with a male friend
the woman , who legally can not be named , died from her injuries 13 days later
the brutality of the assault and her determination to survive so she could report her attackers to police sparked large - scale street protests
four of her attackers were convicted and given the death penalty in september after the case was fast - tracked , while a juvenile was sentenced to a correctional facility
another died in jail after apparently committing suicide
the case sparked soul - searching about india 's treatment of women and also led to initiatives to educate men about respect and equal gender rights in the deeply patriarchal country .
