ms rebecca , known to her family as ' boo ' , was described as having been ' the life and soul of the party ' at her older sister , joanna 's , wedding
but the coroner was told she had a row with her partner of four years , salamone , in a taxi on the way home from the party
mr salamone told the inquest he had been planning to ask ms rebecca to marry her this summer
rebecca ( right ) hanged herself hours after her sister jo 's ( second right ) wedding mr salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs to find her dead , the inquest heard
she was still wearing her bridesmaid 's dress and jewellery from the night before
her family members told of their shock , having seen ms rebecca enjoying herself only hours earlier at the wedding in sunbury-on-thames , surrey
her father david told the coroner : ' she was the life and soul
she got everybody up and dancing , which is no mean feat. she was getting everyone involved
' her aunt , nash , said rebecca was a ' happy , bubbly ' person , who had recently organised her sister 's joanna 's hen party and was excited to see her get married to fiancÃ© matt wilson
' she was always fun to be around so you always tried to see boo when you could , ' she said
' she had a real zest for life and everyone wanted to know her
' toxicology tests taken after her death showed she was double the drink driving limit , with 162mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood
mr salamone said his partner had been ' very happy ' on the day of the wedding , on november 8 2013 , and , although she had drunk vodka and cola , had not seemed excessively drunk
taxi driver khalik meah said the couple had been arguing when he gave them a lift back from the party some time after midnight
asked whether the couple rowed a lot , mr salamone said they would argue when they were drunk , but this was only around once a month and this had been no worse than normal
mr salamone told the inquest in woking , surrey that he had met ms rebecca in around 2010 through a close friend who worked with her at alpha hospital in woking , surrey
ms rebecca ( right ) pictured in the bridesmaid 's dress in which she was found dead after her sister 's wedding last november salamone ( pictured with his sister mirella newman-bale , who also gave evidence at today 's hearing ) told the inquest that he had been planning to ask ms rebecca , his partner of four years , to marry him this summer she was juggling work as a youth counsellor specialising in substance abuse with studying for a masters degree in family therapy
' she was my life partner , ' the garage owner said
' that evening at the wedding i had spoken to jo 's husband and arranged the following summer in dubai [ where the newlyweds lived ] to ask rebecca to marry me
i wanted to spend the rest of my life with her
' however , he added : ' rebecca was very good at making everyone feel better
she often had this iron curtain around her
she would never show people her feelings
' the counsellor had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was aged 25 years , the coroner heard , leaving her reliant on insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels
her medication had made her put on weight , which mr salamone said she worried about , weighing herself every morning and evening
once , during a severe hypoglycaemic attack , she fell into a coma which lasted four days and left her with minor memory problems
her father david said his daughter , who grew up in hertford before the family moved to guildford , surrey , had been a perfectionist
he said : ' she set herself high standards , she had aspirations
she wanted to succeed and as a family i think we are all very determined and she had those attributes
' she had found her diabetes diagnoses ' difficult , ' he said , coming quite late in her life , but insisted she had it ' all in hand
' ' we 're not really sure that she did totally , ' he added
ms rebecca ( pictured , third from right ) had been head bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister jo and her husband matt wilson
family had described her as the ' life and soul of the party ' at the event earlier last year , ms rebecca organised her sister 's hen party
family said they could not explain her actions mr salamone 's sister mirella newman-bale said saw the young woman crying by the bar at one point in the evening , when confided her worries about work and study
the pair made plans to see each other the next day to talk about things
rebecca 's cousin samantha nash , aged 24 years , said she had seen ms darnell in a state at about 10pm on the night of the wedding
miss nash said she made plans to see her cousin the following week for dinner to catch up properly and fetched her mother to check on her
however , the head bridesmaid later perked up and started dancing again and the upset seemed to be over , the inquest heard
the coroner heard that ms rebecca started working at visions , a young person 's drug and alcohol service in hounslow , london , in 2011
records showed her caseload had not increased in the months before her death and she was a valued member of the team , providing vital support to young people with substance abuse problems
her line manager luke hedge said rebecca had been a ' natural giver and supporter of others
' offering his sympathies to her parents and partner , coroner richard travers said rebecca had been a ' remarkable force
' ' it is really apparent to me that she was a remarkable force with an exceptional ability to engage with young people , ' he said
' i have absolutely no doubt that she will be a great loss to that line of work
' on a personal note she was diagnosed with diabetes in 2006 , which it seems , was something that sat very heavily with her and which she never came to terms with
' it is also apparent to me that there were issues in her personal life which caused her stress and anxiety - her partner , family , work life - but there is nothing that specifically assists me in boo 's intentions on the day she died
' on the 8th of november 2013 boo 's sister was married
boo had played a major role in planning the hen do , which albeit stressful , seems to have gone very well
' i heard that during the course of the wedding in the main boo was her usual bubbly , lively self and that she , as her father told me , had been the ' life and soul of the party
' ' it is also right that at other times she had been very emotional
clearly she did have things on her mind
how much her emotional outbursts were affected by alcohol , i do not know
' he ruled out a verdict of suicide , as he could not find any clear intention , such as leaving a suicide note and rebecca had made plans to see friends and family for the coming days
' consequently i conclude rebecca died from self - inflicted injuries but her intention was unclear , ' he said
