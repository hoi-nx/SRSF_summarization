roy hodgson had in his hand a piece of paper
well , more of a crumpled scrap , to be honest , and it was more a reminder of his ambition and his faith in the future than a declaration of war
when roy hodgson unfolded his training notes , they included names scribbled in biro for a session at st george 's park and the two circled were rooney and kane
captain rooney , with 101 caps and 46 goals , had started the day with a formal presentation of the england player of the year award for 2014 , as voted for by supporters
is this going to be england 's new strike partnership for the euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania on friday ? kane trains with the england senior squad for the first team at st george 's park on tuesday morning roy hodgson holds a piece of paper which seems to pair rooney and kane together in attack roy hodgson talks with assistant manager ray lewington ( left ) and coach gary neville during the session kane jogs alongside rooney ( 3rd right ) and uncapped tottenham team - mate ryan mason ( 2nd right ) kane goes through a drill with the ball as training gets underway at england 's burton - upon - trent base kane challenges everton midfielder ross barkley for the ball during tuesday 's session games played : 26 minutes played : 1,876 goals : 19 right foot : 10 left foot : 5 headed : 4 inside area : 17 outside area : 2 kane was the new - boy , uncapped , in his first squad , but with eyes and lenses focused on him in search of clues about whether his tottenham goal rate could be transplanted to the international stage
the 21 - year - old tottenham striker took his tally for the season to 29 with a hat - trick against leicester on saturday and inched a little closer to his england debut when sturridge pulled out with an injury
roy hodgson proved with alex oxlade-chamberlain and sterling that he can be bold when it comes to selecting young players and his key decisions will revolve around whether to start with kane against lithuania in a sell - out euro 2016 qualifier at wembley , on friday

' to meet up with england for the first time off the back of a hat - trick , he is in a good place and deserves his place in this squad
' for me he 's ready to play , i 'm sure he 'd relish the opportunity , but so are the other guys
so that 's down to the manager
' it 's always daunting when you 're in the squad for the first time , even if you ' re in fantastic form and i 'm sure kane 's no different
he 's still a young boy
but he needs to carry on doing what he does at club level
everyone is aware of him
this should be no different
i 'm sure he 'll do terrifically well if called upon
' at club level , gary cahill has played against him three times this season , winning twice with chelsea , including the capital one cup final , and losing 5 - 3 at white hart lane on new year 's day , when kane scored twice
kane and his england team - mates listen to instructions during a break in training rooney ( centre ) was presented with england player of the year award as voted for by fans gary cahill applies pressure to the england new - boy during training on tuesday morning ' it 's hard to talk a young player up too much because we do that a lot in this country , but for me he has everything , ' said gary cahill
' he can hold the ball up , he runs in behind , he has two good feet , he can head , he can finish , he has a bit of pace and physically he is strong enough
' for me , the attributes a striker needs are all there
it 's about how he progresses
he comes across as a top professional
' the england players tried to make the transition smooth for kane when he arrived at st george 's park on monday
' you introduce yourself and we train together , ' said gary cahill
sturridge 's thigh injury leaves roy hodgson with three recognised strikers
rooney will start as he closes in on sir bobby charlton 's england goal record after two goals in scotland , in november , and welbeck performed well , scoring twice in a 3 - 1 win against slovenia , three days before
if roy hodgson sticks with a diamond formation kane will be competing for a starting berth with welbeck carrick is hoping the manager plays with a diamond because it will better suit the midfielder if roy hodgson sticks with the diamond midfield formation , which has served him well since he introduced it for the first qualifier in switzerland , he will have to choose between kane and welbeck to partner the captain up front
this shape suits sterling , in behind the strikers , and carrick , in front of the centre - halves , with henderson and delph providing the mileage on either side
delph has been ill and is yet to train with england this week but he reported to the camp yesterday
another option roy hodgson will consider , especially if delph is below full power , is a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system with henderson deep in tandem with carrick and kane up front , ahead of welbeck , rooney and sterling
' we 've played a diamond enough times at manchester united , ' said carrick
' that 's not to say it 's the only position i can play , but it 's a formation that would probably suit me
