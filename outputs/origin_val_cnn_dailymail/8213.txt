long - serving goalkeeper petr cech says he will leave chelsea rather than spend another season as understudy to thibaut courtois
the 32 - year - old czech international has lost his place to the young belgian this term , starting only four premier league games and being primarily used in the domestic cup competitions
while accepting manager mourinho 's decision , petr cech said the situation could not go on indefinitely
petr cech would be willing to leave chelsea in search for first - team football after losing his place ' i do n't know what the club 's idea will be
it looks like it works well with me and thibaut courtois as a duo , ' he told the idnes newspaper
' but that can work for one season only
i do n't want another one like this , ' he added while on international duty for the czechs who play latvia in a euro 2016 qualifier in prague on saturday
petr cech joined chelsea in 2004 and has won three premier league titles , four fa cups , the champions league and three league cups , the last of which was this season when he was in goal for the 2 - 0 defeat of tottenham hotspur at wembley
the czech international is still considered one of the best in the world and would n't be short of offers with mourinho clearly favouring thibaut courtois , petr cech 's future will be of interest to a host of top clubs across european
' there always will be speculation , i leave it for the summer , ' petr cech said
' it will be important to sit down with the club , with the manager , to consider all the pros and cons. we will see what will work out the best
' asked about a possible move to european champions real madrid , petr cech said : ' when a specific offer comes i will consider it
there are offers one can not turn down '
thibaut courtois is chelsea 's first choice and it looks unlikely that petr cech will be able to budge him
