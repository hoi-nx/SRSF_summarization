probe : the ipcc is to investigate a retired officer 's claims he was told to keep quiet about mp after seeing him at a sex party with two boys in stockport in 1988 the police watchdog is to examine claims that a paedophile sergeant ordered a junior officer not to tell anyone after catching mp at a sex party with two boys
the account of the officer , then a young beat bobby but now retired , that he was threatened with the official secrets act after he found the 29 - stone liberal mp at the home of a known sex offender in 1988 was the latest piece of evidence of an establishment cover - up of mp âs decades of abuse
yesterday the ipcc ( ipcc ) announced it would be overseeing the investigation into the unnamed ex-officer âs claims
he came forward earlier this month to describe how as a probationary officer he discovered mp at the party with a prolific sex offender and two drunk teenage boys in stockport
mp and another officer in civilian clothes who was also present walked off , he said , while one boy left and the other was taken back to his children âs home
he claimed that the following day he was called to a meeting by a senior officer and sergeant don mackintosh and told he would be breaching the official secrets act if he ever told anyone
â in no uncertain terms i was told to say nothing , â he said
â they knew mp was there and knew who he was
â don mackintosh was later exposed as a prolific abuser of young boys over more than a decade
he was found hanged in his home last year while facing fresh indecent assault allegations
the retired officer claimed that earlier this year he had an anonymous call from a man who warned him to â keep your mouth shut â
the allegation about mp is already being investigated by greater manchester police âs operation clifton which is looking at how previous reports of child sexual abuse were handled or allegedly covered up
but yesterday the ipcc said it would now â manage â how the alleged incident in 1988 was investigated
â the ipcc âs involvement will ensure independent oversight of the investigation , while ensuring greater manchester police âs wider ongoing criminal investigation is not affected , â a spokesman said
serial child abuser mp , who was mp for rochdale from 1972 to 1992 and died aged 82 in 2010 , escaped possible prosecution at least eight times after orders were made at the highest level to cover up his crimes
the officer was pulled in by sergeant don mackintosh , who turned out to be paedophile , left , who threatened him with the official secrets act and told him to stay silent about his claims over mp ( right ) last year the mail exposed his pervert past when it serialised labour mp for rochdale danczuk âs book , smile for the camera : the double life of mp
it revealed mp avoided police and court action for decades despite leaving a trail of victims
most recently , the mail revealed how a former chief constable of lancashire was told in the late 1970s that an official at the office of the director of public prosecutions had asked his force to lie about past investigations into mp
mr danczuk said : â i welcome the fact that the ipcc are investigating the possibility of a police paedophile cover - up
this incident suggests there could have been a paedophile network straddling both politics and the police
