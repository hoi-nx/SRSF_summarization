once he had come round after emergency surgery , morgan asked the surgeon two pressing questions ; would he ever play again and if so , could he make it back in time for the world cup ? mercifully for the gloucester and england no 8 â who had shattered his leg in a match against saracens the previous night â the answer to both was ' yes '
but that was just the theory ; the practice involves relentless determination and dedication , including endless hours in a hyperbaric chamber , where the 26 - year - old is mastering the art of sketching while wearing an oxygen mask
no stone is left unturned in morgan 's quest to regain full fitness in time to be part of the national squad for the global gathering in september and october
there are no guarantees he will be ready , but despite the magnitude of his injury , the signs are good and he is infused with optimism
morgan is undergoing sessions in a hyperbaric chamber to speed up his recovery from a fractured leg morgan has been out of action since he injured his leg playing against saracens in january morgan was named england 's player of the series following his superb displays during the november tests he simply has to take part in the tournament , and help the hosts excel , because the final takes place on his mother 's birthday and she would like her son to mark it in style ! on january 9 , morgan was driving for the line during an aviva premiership match at kingsholm when his season was crudely terminated
he heard the sounds of breaking bone , and when team - mates and opponents moved sharply away as he lay on the ground , he knew he was in real trouble
' all i remember was that we had a scrum in the left - hand corner , i picked up the ball and went on a usual run , ' he told sportsmail
' i got tackled by jacques burger and having looked back at the clips , i was able to see he wrapped his legs around my leg and i did n't really have anywhere to go
' at the time , i did n't really know what the hell had happened and i just started yelping
i like to think i would n't make those noises unless it was serious ! people moved out of the way pretty quickly and even though i was n't in that much pain , i knew i had done something
gloucester no 8 morgan lines up london welsh fly half olly barkley at the kassam stadium ' i just did n't know how bad it was going to be , but i had an immediate realisation that i was going to be out for a while
when i got to the hospital , the staff were pretty guarded , but i got more of a sense of how bad things were when a few hours had passed
' a surgeon from cheltenham came to the hospital in gloucester to perform the operation during the night and when the anaesthetic wore off , morgan sought to put his mind at rest about his predicament
' when i 'd come round , i fired loads of questions at the surgeon , ' he said
' the first thing was ' is it a career - ender ? '
i knew he could n't be precise , but i needed a ball - park idea of how long i 'd be out for and he told me six months
' the damaged leg contained a significant amount of precious metal ; to help the healing process
he will have another operation next month to replace a pin with more flexible wire , but a plate will remain in place
morgan has not yet had a chance to set off airport scanners , but he quipped : ' i 'm made of meccano â do n't put any magnets near me ! ' morgan is brought to ground by flanker marcell coetzee during england 's loss to south africa in november his self - deprecating humour is part of a philosophical attitude towards the situation he is in
while a home world cup would be a momentous career highlight , he refuses to agonise about whether his recovery happens fast enough , despite moving heaven and earth to make sure it does
a six - month rehabilitation period would mean morgan is match - fit by july 10 and would n't need to miss any of the training camp which starts just before that red - letter date
but he said : ' if it takes longer , that 's just how it is
' the world cup is the carrot , but i have to be realistic ; if i do n't make it , i do n't make it
i 'm not going to tear myself up about it
i 'm doing everything i can to get back for it , but there are certain hurdles i have to clear
i 'm quite relaxed about it
i 'm pretty sure i 'll be back
if i do end up going into the world cup training camp , i 'll be fresh
i 'll be blowing out of my a * * e , but i 'll be fresh ! ' the recovery programme has conventional elements , with morgan spending seven weeks in a cast and following up that initial stage with physiotherapy and weight - training at the club
but he is also employing cutting - edge methods to help his leg mend rapidly
twice a day , four times a week , he spends 90 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber at an ms centre in gloucester
morgan makes another powerful ball carry against the wallabies at twickenham in november ' the bulk of what i 'm doing is oxygen therapy , ' he said
' i 'm being pressurised , to simulate being 10 metres below sea level , and i 'm breathing pure oxygen
the thinking is that it increases the red blood cells in your blood , which is brilliant for healing
' i go in the morning , then go to train with gloucester , get physio and do upper - body weights , then go back to the oxygen chamber
i 'm in there for an hour - and - a - half
' to pass the time , morgan 's creative side is emerging , as he is filling up a large sketch - book with pencil drawings
the subjects are wide - ranging
billy vunipola regained the no 8 jersey in morgan 's absence and has started all three rbs six nations games ' i 've drawn a few pictures ; my dog , my nephew , a little mickey mouse , a turtle , a light - bulb , ' he said
' there 's also a little lizard , a ninja turtle , an owl â¦ i 've just ordered some sketching pencils because it 's difficult to get good shading with the ones i 've been using
i 'm stepping it up ! ' i did a couple of bits and pieces at school
it 's just a bit of fun , a way of passing the time
i 'd be bored out of my brain if i was n't doing something like the sketching
' morgan was on a roll before his horror injury
he was named england 's player of the series after the autumn campaign and had usurped billy vunipola to reclaim the no 8 shirt before his barnstorming progress was abruptly halted
in recent weeks , instead of being at the heart of the national team 's rbs six nations campaign , he has been an observer
he will be at twickenham next saturday to watch against and is aiming to spend a day at the team hotel , while maintaining contact with the england coaches
stuart lancaster will dearly hope to have morgan involved at the world cup and the long - term casualty is confident he will be ready
veteran harlequins back rower nick easter has been another player to profit from morgan 's absence he said : ' i feel really positive and , hopefully , that positive attitude will help my healing process
some people get dragged down with really dark thoughts , but i 'm staying upbeat
' getting back in time is the hardest battle , but then i have to get selected again , which is going to be a very tough task
nick easter has done well since coming back in , billy vunipola is playing well too and i 'm missing a block of games
luckily , i ended on a bit of a high , but i 'll have had six months out of rugby
whether that is a good thing , because i 'll be fresh , or will count against me , i do n't know , but i 'll do everything in my power to be there
' if he makes it , he will have a sketch - book full of souvenirs from his rehabilitation â and a chance to give his mum the ultimate birthday present .
