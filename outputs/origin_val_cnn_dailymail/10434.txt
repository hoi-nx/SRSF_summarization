as any man will tell you , there 's nothing worse than ' splash back '
and in a move that could slash arrests for public urination in surfers paradise , gold coast council are considering applying a coat of waterproof paint to walls there
it 'll be spray - back time for drunken revellers as the council is copying the german party city of hamburg which has painted the walls of its entertainment district with the same sort of paint used on ships to deter party - goers from peeing in public
the gold coast bulletin reported that the local council will look into introducing the move where the paint bounces the offending stream off the wall and back onto the offending person
' it was pr disaster but in keeping urine off the footpaths , it worked really well , ' surfers councillor lex bell said
he said the waterproof paint idea was ' very interesting ' and that he would take it to council officers for consideration
nightclub and bar owners in surfers paradise said the council would be better off just providing public toilets
this local resident registered his displeasure with the situation in the st pauli interest community video liquid poured on one half of a breeze block coated with water - repellent paint runs off in this demonstration st pauli interest community members have put up warning signs - put not every painted wall has them hollywood showgirls strip club owner duffy offered to pay for the installation of public toilets in a disused basement underneath his surfers paradise nightspot
mr duffy wrote to council in january offering 600sqm of underground space for public loos which he âd rent back to council at a market rate - but he âs yet to hear a response , the gold coast bulletin said
' that does nât make any sense to me at all
$ 116 a square metre ? pardon the pun but it âs money down the toilet , ' he said of the pee - proof paint
' it âs not dealing with the underlying problem at all which is that there are no toilets
' but using waterproof paint on walls in hamburg has worked
here residents of the pub - heavy area at the heart of the party town made a stand against so - called ' wildpinkler ' , which literally means ' free pee - ers ' in german
members of the st pauli interest community ( ig st pauli ) fed up with drinkers weeing everywhere from back alleys to underpasses to childrens ' playgrounds used a special paint to give them a nasty surprise
water droplets bounce right off the hydrophobic paint with which the residents have coated dozens of walls across a district which welcomes 20 million often heavy - drinking party guests every year
a man relieving himself in the street jumps back in horror when he gets splash back from the special paint so - called ' wildpinkler ' , or ' free pee - ers ' , have even been caught urinating in playgrounds in st pauli now public urinators will get splash back on their shoes and clothes if they decide to empty their bladders in the street
ig st pauli board member and owner of several local bars uwe christiansen told the local : ' it was a real annoyance that was growing and growing
' we wanted to bring people to reason
' st pauli 's red light district
