for years , they 've wanted six seasons and a movie , and at 3:01 a.m. et tuesday , fans got it ... almost
there 's no movie yet , but " community 's " much - awaited sixth season made its debut
not even cancellation by nbc could kill the fan favorite sitcom , as yahoo streamed the first two episodes of the new season early tuesday
the show appears to have suffered no decline in quality in the move to yahoo , though cast member yvette nicole brown ( now on cbs ' " the odd couple " ) had to leave the show for family reasons
the premiere briefly touches on this in its own way , with shirley 's absence sounding a lot like the setup for a spinoff ( as the character abed points out , along with several other inconsistencies throughout the episode )
the " new shirley , " as dean joked , is paget brewster 's frankie , who exists to play the disapproving authority figure to antagonize the former study group
soon , the group was running a prohibition-esque bar before they could learn to live with frankie
and how about the end of the first episode , which gave us a look at the spinoff , " the butcher and the baker , " with shirley and steven weber as a southern lawyer ? episode two got even more out there , with dean pelton 's adventures in 1990s - style virtual reality and a less - successful plotline involving britta 's parents
most interesting was the introduction of keith david as ' 90s tech genius elroy
critics praised the show , with the hollywood reporter 's amy amatangelo saying , " everything fans loved about community remains -- the first two episodes are chock - full of increasingly bizarre pop - culture references ( portuguese gremlins , anyone ? ) and meta commentary
the show has seamlessly transferred to an online venue
" time 's james poniewozik also liked it ( despite some reservations about the plot ) , writing , " the first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods , and it does
" soon after the show went online , devoted fans on twitter had their say .
