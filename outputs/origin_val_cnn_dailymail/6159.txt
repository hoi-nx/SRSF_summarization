â Â£ 60,000 ? â , he says
â ian , persuade him
he âs not on benefits is he ? well if he is then he can afford it
â he then goes lower , suggesting â Â£ 55,000 ? â at another point in the auction , he comments on the expensive cars the guests are driving
â it âs quite naff to have bentley âs and rolls royce and ferraris because anybody could have them â , he says

he approached the conservative party around six months ago and was also invited to lunch with health secretary jeremy hunt along with other donors
sir alistair graham , the former commissioner for standards in public life told dispatches : â i suspect not a lot of policy issues are dealt with at a dinner like that
but i think it âs about that feeling , if i make reasonable donations , i âm in a special club who âve got access to leaders and that might be extremely useful as far as my business is concerned in the future
â the conservative party say â the fact that donors are invited to attend events with senior figures within the party is clearly and openly stated on our website
â they deny any impropriety and say all donations are properly declared to the electoral commission
mr swire was not available for comment
mr paul is also filmed having a private meeting with labour party âs chris leslie , the shadow chief secretary to the treasury , to discuss tax matters which could benefit his firm â after offering a donation
mr chris leslie tells him in a follow - up email that he will consider mr paul âs views about a possible tax on financial transactions â ahead of our manifesto â
labour party denied that donors influence party policy
the same businessman approached labour party offering a donation , and was swiftly offered a private meeting with a shadow minister
paul discussed making a donation to the party at last autumn âs annual conference in manchester , and was invited to a Â£ 350 - a - head donors â dinner for free

fake donor paul was put in touch with shadow treasury minister chris leslie after offering to make a donation back in london , he was put in touch with shadow treasury minister chris leslie to discuss the policy he was particularly interested in â a tax on financial transactions which labour party is considering
over tea at a hotel in westminster , he is filmed giving his views on the tax and explains how it could help his fictional firm developing software for the hedge fund industry
in a follow - up email , mr chris leslie tells him : â many thanks for this paul â¦ i think you make some good points about the best way to introduce an ftt â¦ i âll have a good think about some of these good points ahead of our manifesto but i appreciate any updates you might have along the way
â sir alistair graham , ex-standards commissioner said : â the point about having access to opposition key leaders like chris leslie is of course normally their policies are much more fluid
they âre trying to develop policies they think are going to be attractive to the public and you see a specific reference to the manifesto â¦ â â i suspect that the labour party would have been quite happy to have his input given his expertise but in this particular case the meeting happened very quickly because he was a prospective donor
â a labour party spokesman said frontbenchers regularly meet with business leaders to listen to their views and that â donations will not influence our policy
