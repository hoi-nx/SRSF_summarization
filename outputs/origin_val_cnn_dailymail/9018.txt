charlie hebdo staff are embroiled in a bitter dispute over who gets to control the french magazine , months after eight of its writers and cartoonists were murdered by terrorists
the row was sparked by a sudden increase in the magazine 's sales and revenue in the wake of the brutal attacks on january 7 , according to the times
it has reportedly made Â£ 21.6million since then after its usual circulation of 30,000 - a - week rocketed to hundreds of thousands
now the surviving staff members want that money and shares of the magazine - 40 per cent of which are owned by its murdered editor 's parents - to be divided equally

below them on the stairs , from left , is editor stephane charbonnier and cartoonist bernard ' tignous ' verlhac terror : on january 7 , brothers said and cherif kouachi raided the charlie hebdo office in paris and killed 11 people , sparking a string of terror attacks across the city as many as 11 employees have instructed their lawyers to turn the magazine - which has published cartoons of the prophet propher muhammad on its cover - into a workers ' cooperative
it would mean they all have a stake in the company but their move has been attacked by another anonymous contributor in a leaked email to french news agency agence france-presse
the unnamed contributor accused the plotters of trying to grab the shares that belonged to the magazine 's murdered editor stephane charbonnier ' before the worms have finished eating him '
40 per cent of the company is owned by his parents , another 40 by the magazine 's new editor sourisseau and the final 20 per cent belongs to financial director portheault
one of the magazine 's journalists laurent lã©ger said : ' a new distribution of the capital would allow for the incredible influx of funds to the newspaper to be used in the most transparent manner possible
' and patrick pelloux - who writes a column for charlie hebdo - believes a co-operative would bind contributors to the newspaper
he said : ' when a company has been decimated , you feel completely tied to it
it is not a question of sharing the cake
the money does not interest us
' however a spokesman for sourisseau and portheault said : ' all this money is doing more harm than good
greedy : an unnamed contributor has accused staff of trying to grab the shares that belonged to the magazine 's murdered editor stephane charbonnier ( pictured ) ' before the worms have finished eating him ' demand : since the brutal attack on charlie hebdo in january , the magazine 's usual circulation of 30,000 a week has boomed to hundreds of thousands ' it makes you think of those funerals where everyone is fighting over the grandmother 's jewellery on the way back from the cemetery
' he added that the owners had promised not to pay themselves dividends for three years and wanted to ensure the Â£ 3million received in donations after the attack went to victims ' families
' we note the desire of the staff to be associated with the life of the newspaper
but we are a long way from thinking about the make - up of the shareholders
' this is not the first time that charlie hebdo has been split over financial matters
in 2008 , it 's then - editor philippe val faced a backlash when it emerged he paid himself dividends of over Â£ 200,000 when sale rose following the controversial publication of issues featuring the propher muhammad .
