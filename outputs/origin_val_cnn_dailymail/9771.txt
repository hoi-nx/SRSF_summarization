mullins has turned the olbg mares â hurdle into a one - man show
the irish trainer would have won it with annie power had she not stumbled at the final fence and thrown off ruby walsh but still ended up lifting the prize with stablemate glens melody
that makes it seven wins running , mullins having lifted the prize for the last six seasons with another record - breaker in quevega before she retired to stud
glens melody capitalises on annie power 's fall to win the olbg mares â champion hurdle it will be a shame if mullins â total domination of day one overshadows the first cheltenham festival win of trainer neil mulholland courtesy of the druids nephew in the handicap chase
neil mulholland , who runs the young master in this afternoon âs rsa chase , is a trainer going places and now has the grand national in his sights for the druids nephew , who won under barry geraghty
there was no redemption for last year âs unlucky champion hurdle third the new one , who could only manage fifth this time around
jockey sam twiston-davies was adamant that his mount was not himself , describing the feel he gave him as â not like him â
his father trainer nigel will begin a retrieval mission next week but i wonder if tuesday âs run means the new one will be over fences next season
jockey sam twiston-davies ( above ) was adamant that his mount the new one was not himself irish trainer elliott is more established than neil mulholland but his efforts in plotting a route back to the cheltenham festival with his national hunt chase winner cause of causes also deserves praise
the gelding was second at the meeting last year and had run only three times since with his novice status preserved
elliott also set up a 64th birthday winner for owner jp mcmanus
the final race of day one now has the less than snappy name of the chaps restaurant barbados novices â handicap chase
quite a mouthful but welsh trainer rebecca curtis is hoping that might work in her favour after irish cavalier won for owner andrew and gave jockey paul townend his second win of the day
admitting she had never visited the island , curtis said : â maybe andrew will take me there now
