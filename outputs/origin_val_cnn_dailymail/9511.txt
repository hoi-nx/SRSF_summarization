it was a privilege to watch messi on wednesday when he produced a performance that will live long in the memory
there have been times over the last 12 months , particularly at the world cup , when i wondered whether we had seen the best of him but what he did against manchester city was magnificent proof that he is still the best around
what he did to manchester city â and the way he has played since christmas â makes me think he has jumped back above cristiano ronaldo in their struggle to be football âs no 1
it will make their battle in this weekend âs el clasico even more intriguing
messi was in inspired form against manchester city and proved he is still the best around cristiano ronaldo has struggled of late and messi may have jumped back above the real madrid star i am hoping that the champions league will produce the dream final of barcelona versus bayern munich â i will be in berlin on june 6 â and it would be fascinating to see messi in this form in a showdown against his mentor
we all saw pep guardiola âs reaction to messi âs trickery during the game and , afterwards in barcelona , i was among a group from sky that went for some dinner when we were fortunate to bump into bayern munich âs manager
he gave us a couple of moments of his time and , inevitably , pep guardiola was asked whether he fancied coming up against messi when the quarter - final draw was made
bayern munich , after all , have been in outstanding form , scoring goals for fun , but his reaction was telling
â no ! no ! no ! â said pep guardiola
â if i have to face messi , i want it to be in one game rather than two ! â if they do happen to face each other in berlin â and after friday 's draw it is not wrong to expect barcelona and bayern munich to reach the semi-finals at least â we could safely say we will be in for a rare treat
