the ligaments in ms sally roythorne 's hands had been so badly damaged while she was trying to protect herself from the blows of matthew lucas ' knife that she spent three months with them in plaster casts
at the time , a court heard that the couple had been celebrating their move from newcastle to cumbria , with a party of 30 friends on may 23 2010
the couple and a few guests who were staying over headed to bed not long after midnight once the party was over
but chef matthew lucas , 39 at the time , went into their kitchen , took a knife and crept up to their bedroom to attack them , with absolutely no warning or apparent reason
the court heard at the time that he had approached several different women at the party but his advances had been turned down each time
mr rob plevin was stabbed twice through the neck
his life was only saved by the quick thinking of other guests who tried to stem the bleeding after emerging from a two day coma , he lost so much blood that he had a full blood transfusion and required seven hours in surgery mr rob plevin had known matthew lucas for around 10 years
they had first met through a friend and had seen each other intermittently over the years , mainly on canoeing trips in scotland with mutual friends
he said : ' in the run up to the party he had checked with us if any single women were going to be there - he was frustrated that he was still single
' we knew that he was also pretty stressed out at work and that money was a bit of an issue for him , but we 'd thought that our party would just be a chance to relax
' ' but the thought never crossed my mind that he would be violent
' when the case finally came to an end and matthew lucas was given an indeterminate jail sentence with a 13 - year minimum tariff
ms sally roythorne said : ' we 'd moved from newcastle to cumbria to be closer to rob plevin 's parents , who were unwell , and had invited lots of friends to celebrate the new chapter in our lives
today rob plevin and sally roythorne , from cumbria , look like any other couple happily posing with their new baby , poppy
but in may , 2010 , the pair were left with catastrophic injuries after friend matthew lucas crept into their room while they were sleeping and stabbed them both in the head ' the house was a stunning four - bedroom detached former police superintendent 's home with a huge garden so we 'd had a barbeque and been playing games all afternoon - we even played rounders on the village green
' she added : ' our physical injuries were only a fraction of what we experienced
it was the mental horror , the post-traumatic stress which caused us the most pain and anguish
' when we woke up in hospital after the attack we were shocked that we were even alive - the doctors had n't expected us to make it
' we came round and just looked at each other with tears streaming down our faces

the court heard he had approached several different women at the party but his advances had been turned down each time ' one thing that gave us relief in the very tough times was the idea of us both floating on a raft , letting go of all the anxiety and things we could n't control - just ' going with the flow '
the couple have since set up the life raft , an organisation to share what they had learnt overcoming their experience and to help others
ms sally roythorne said : ' before the attack , rob plevin and i were both very career - driven
we both had older children from previous relationships and we 'd never even considered having a child together
' but our long road to recovery made us re-evaluate our lives
' we started meditating and we realised we wanted to refocus our lives around our family instead of our careers , and we had poppy in 2014
' she has been a little angel that arrived to finish of the healing process
' if we had n't have nearly died that night , we would n't be nearly as happy as we are today
' ' it 's been a long , long road to recovery but we 're proud to say that our lives are better now than they were before that evening
' it was a blessing in disguise and has given us a second chance at life
