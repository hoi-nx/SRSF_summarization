there have been all manner of cricket world cup shambles for england since they should have won the 1992 final here in australia
but never one as bad as this
this , surely , is the worst yet , worse than 1996 when sri lanka âs pinch - hitters left them trailing in their wake
worse , even , than 1999 when england were eliminated from their own cricket world cup the day before the official song came out
and it is certainly worse than the last three world cups when we had come to expect england to struggle in the one - day game , particularly in 2007 and last time when the biggest tournament in limited - overs cricket followed the ashes

this was the cricket world cup that england were supposed to take seriously and prepare thoroughly for
this was the cricket world cup that the ashes were moved for , leading to a 5 - 0 thrashing last winter and all manner of painful recriminations
yet so far advanced has the one - day game progressed in the last two years since england reached the champions trophy final that clearing the calendar and playing only one - day cricket so far this winter has been akin to trying to put a sticking plaster on a gaping wound
england have been able to defeat just scotland in this tournament and after being thrashed by australia , new zealand and sri lanka they have now been humbled by a team in bangladesh who are little more than minnows themselves
this tournament was set up to virtually guarantee the progress of the big eight teams to the quarter - finals
it was almost impossible for england to fail to at least get to the last eight where defeat would have been far from a disgrace
instead this is a defeat that deserves to be considered as a total disgrace
it is one that leaves peter moores fighting to salvage his reputation as a credible coach of england and paul downton , the man who appointed him , facing huge questions about the big decisions he has made
when the dust settles and england have gone through the motions of their last group match against afghanistan they must have a searching examination of how they play one - day cricket and how they can possibly catch up with the rest of the world before they host the next cricket world cup in four years time
it is not just peter moores and downton with much to contemplate
senior players such as ian bell , stuart broad and jimmy anderson have not provided the proper example needed from senior players in a young team and should retire from one - day cricket to allow a new young vibrant team to be built
and the decision to replace cook with morgan as one - day captain on the brink of this tournament has backfired , the new leader falling for his fifth duck in his last nine innings just when his team needed him most
morgan has been given permission to miss england âs first one - day international after this cricket world cup , against an ireland team having a far better tournament than england , so he can play in the indian premier league
that decision frankly stinks and if morgan does not want to lead england into a new one - day era then he should give up the job now and let joe root , who was seriously considered when cook was sacked , lead them from now on
never mind that buttler almost rescued england after they had fallen to 163 for six chasing 275
and never mind that tv umpire simon fry gave an atrocious decision to rule that jordan had been run out when surely there was doubt over whether his bat had bounced up once he had made his ground

37.4 - 1 - 234 - 5 - chris woakes 's tournament bowling figures
49 - the amount of runs steven finn went for in two overs against new zealand
peter moores went into full graham taylor mode on the sidelines , raging at the fourth official after a truly awful decision , but in truth england did not deserve to get away with this
they were second best to a tigerish bangladesh just as they have been worse than second best throughout this tournament
and it all started off so well too
it looked as though england were going to have an easy night when jimmy anderson found the bite and swing that had eluded him in this tournament to take two wickets in his first seven balls
neither imrul kayes nor tamim iqbal , the dangerman at the top of the bangladesh order , could cope as england made a start full of the sort of aggression and purpose that the seriousness of their plight demanded
yet england could not have expected the resistance and then blossoming strokeplay that came from a batsman who had never made a one - day international century before in mahmudullah
the drop - in pitch at the re-built adelaide oval may have been near perfect for batting but the lack of variety in an england attack that has struggled for penetration in this cricket world cup allowed bangladesh to flourish
mahmudullah found a willing ally in the tiny form of rahim , the bangladeshi â mighty atom â who first faced england as a 16 - year - old schoolboy 10 years ago , and together they preyed on england âs nerves
mahmudullah certainly enjoyed becoming the first bangladeshi to record a hundred in a cricket world cup match and while he and rahim were adding 141 for the fifth wicket a total beyond 300 looked within his side âs reach
that they fell 25 short of that was down to much improved death bowling from england , jordan in particular showing how it should be done after being preferred to steven finn in this winner takes all match
it should have been well within england âs reach but their chase was old - fashioned and flawed with ian bell , involved in a schoolboy run out that saw the demise of moeen ali , leaving them far too much to do after he had taken 82 balls to reach 63
the dismissals of ian bell and morgan in four balls from rubel hossain , faster than any england bowler , left england deep in the mire and even though buttler , their main glimmer of hope for a better one - day future , hit 65 off 52 balls they ended up 16 short
the brilliant rubel hossain finished it by bowling both stuart broad and jimmy anderson in three balls in the penultimate over , leaving chris woakes stranded on 42 , to spark off wild bangladeshi celebrations
for england it was the end of the world
