pulis called for the introduction of video technology after gareth mcauley was sent off in a case of mistaken identity after 90 seconds of west brom 's 3 - 0 defeat at manchester city
the west brom defender was dismissed by swarbrick instead of teammate dawson who sent wilfried bony crashing to the floor when he was clean through
after the match an incredulous pulis said : ' i ca n't believe he 's picked the wrong player - it 's beyond me
' pulis has called for the introduction of video technology to help referees after swarbrick 's error swarbrick showed a red card to gareth mcauley ( right ) during the second minute after a foul on wilfried bony west brom defender craig dawson ( right ) makes the original challenge on wilfried bony just outside the penalty area the ivorian striker heads to the ground under dawson 's clumsy challenge but managed to continue wilfried bony continues but gareth mcauley comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area wilfried bony goes to ground again under gareth mcauley 's challenge , leading to the dismissal of the west brom player he added that rather than criticise officials they should be given support and that technology needs to be introduced
' it is no good moaning about referees , ' pulis said
' we have to find a way to help referees out i would definitely call for managers to have two calls each and every game when there is 30 seconds and they can have a video link up with people upstairs who can watch it on video
' the clubs can make money - there are people who will make money to have their names up on scoreboards
it will eradicate the major decisions referees are getting wrong that actually affect games of football and we have to work hard to do that in what is the greatest league in the world
the sooner that comes in the better
' bt sport showed the incident from referee swarbrick 's perspective , with no 25 dawson the closest to him a difficult task turned into mission impossible following the red card and goals from wilfried bony , fernando and david silva wrapped up a comfortable victory for the home side who are , for now , three points behind leaders chelsea who have two games in hand
city manager manuel pellegrini reflected on a morale - boosting performance after a difficult week which saw them lose at burnley and then bow out of the champions league at barcelona
' of course it is always important to return to victory when you lost the last game , ' he said
' we lost the last two games in different competitions , wednesday in champions league and the last game against burnley in premier league
it is important to return to victory
' fernando ( centre ) scored manchester city 's second of the match after wilfried bony 's opener and before david silva added a third the chilean added that his side are only concentrating on themselves and not on jose mourinho 's leaders
' we are not thinking about that , ' he said
' i spoke with the players , we play now eight games more
we can win the eight games and if chelsea does n't drop points , we can not win the title
the important thing is not to think about other teams , it is to think about our team , to improve and win the next game against crystal palace
