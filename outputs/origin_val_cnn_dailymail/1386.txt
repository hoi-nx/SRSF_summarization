burnley striker danny ings will step out at anfield on wednesday looking to boost his side 's premier league survival hopes at the expense of the team he has been strongly linked with a move to at the end of the season
rodgers has refused to be drawn on speculation suggesting that danny ings , who is out of contract at the end of the campaign , will move to liverpool
but if he does sign a contract at anfield , will he be good enough to make the grade ? sportsmail 's reporters give their verdict
danny ings ( centre ) has been burnley 's star player as they try to stay in the premier league this season dominic king yes , he is good enough to make the step up
it is no mean effort scoring nine goals in the premier league for a side that has struggled to get results and danny ings has never been found wanting at the biggest stadiums
he was outstanding in burnley âs 3 - 1 loss at old trafford last month , his energy and intensity setting him apart that night
it was not a one - off because he has attracted positive reviews all season
danny ings scored for burnley against manchester united in his side 's 3 - 1 defeat and impressed with his display ings could replace fabio borini at liverpool , with the italian expected to depart at the end of the season danny ings has scored nine times for burnley this season and will take on liverpool on wednesday read dominic king 's piece on why danny ings would flourish under the guidance of liverpool manager rodgers liverpool will overhaul their striking department in the summer , with potentially three players moving â rickie lambert , fabio borini and mario balotelli â and a move for danny ings would make sense from both a playing style and an economic point of view
he will have to raise his game again should he eventually arrive at anfield , but that wo nât be a problem
danny ings has been doing that for the last two years and he will welcome the challenge
joe bernstein danny ings is one of those players who does n't have one quality that makes him stand out , but he does n't have an obvious weakness either
he is an intelligent player and at 22 has the potential to get better
he is a good finisher but his tally of nine this season is unremarkable and five fewer than charlie austin at queens park rangers for example
danny ings watches on as his shot hits the back of the net for burnley against queens park rangers liverpool manager rodgers has refused to comment on the speculation linking the club with danny ings ings can show he is capable of playing on the big stage when he plays for burnley against liverpool ings could make the step up to a big club but there is no guarantee
you suspect liverpool 's real interest in him is due to john w henry 's moneyball approach to the game
why would n't you take a promising 22 - year - old on a bosman given you could sell him in two years for a handsome profit , even if he does n't become a first - team regular ? ian ladyman there was a moment when it became clear to me that danny ings was good enough to make the grade at the very highest level and it came early in last month âs defeat at manchester united
the way he showed chris smalling to the front post before checking back and heading in burnley âs goal â by now unmarked â at the far post told you everything you need to know about his natural instincts as a goal scorer
it was high - class finishing
danny ings ' form has also led to talk that england manager roy hodgson ( left ) will include him in his next squad danny ings beats defender martin kelly and goalkeeper julian speroni to score against crystal palace earlier in the season â as he started the campaign slowly â i was nât sure but he has found his feet now and has emerged as a safe bet for the next england squad
on that note , i wrote a story last season saying that danny ings was being watched by roy hodgson âs staff and was likely to figure in the national set - up during the euro qualifiers
i remember one of my colleagues laughing
he is nât laughing any more â¦
chris wheeler there âs no doubting the drive and determination of a striker who was playing for dorchester town in the conference south a little over four years ago , and danny ings will be desperate to put on a performance at anfield
is he good enough to make the step up to liverpool ? compared with the players rodgers currently has at his disposal , you would have to say yes
danny ings has scored nine goals in the premier league for a burnley side that has spent the entire season battling the odds â the same amount as manchester city âs new Â£ 25m signing wilfried bony and arsenal âs olivier giroud , and more than liverpool forwards daniel sturridge , mario balotelli , rickie lambert , fabio borini and lazar markovic put together
danny ings has scored the same number of premier league goals as wilfried bony and olivier giroud danny ings is only 22 and fits the profile of player that liverpool often pursue in the transfer market a player who scored 26 goals in the championship last season has also hit four in seven appearances for england under 21s to stake his claim for a senior international call - up , so there is little doubt that he is capable of rising to the challenge
danny ings is not excessively tall or powerful , but he is quick and possesses great movement and anticipation in and around the penalty box
most importantly of all , he has a goalscorer âs instinct
and at the age of 22 , he is young enough to take his game to another level under a coach like rodgers .
