the easter bunny was invented in german folklore , where an ' easter hare ' was used to determine whether children had been well - behaved
much like father christmas , the brown - coloured animals was often depicted carrying a selection of treats to good children 's houses
but while the traditional version of the rabbit was a natural - looking creature , the modern character has become an often terrifying white , pink , purple and yellow creation
the easter bunny is meant to be a joyful character , but often botched costumes mean they are more horrific than happy , as this picture demonstrates the symbol of the easter often results in a terrifying sight when produced on a budget
children who would usually be delighted to be meeting someone who will be gifting them with chocolate eggs end up screaming for their parents
as reported by metro , unfortunate humans who have been given the task of dressing up as the rabbit end up looking more like the terrifying donnie darko character than a friendly furball
