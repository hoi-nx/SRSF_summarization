one bull is certainly set to have the ladies chasing him around the paddock with his buff appearance
paul the cow , a rescued resident of the animal sanctuary in butjadingen , germany , was filmed as he enjoyed a grooming session on a giant cleaning machine
footage shows him closing his eyes in bliss as the roller combs over his coat
first he angles it on the top of his head
he then gives his eyelids and cheeks a brief scrub
at one point he cranes his head back so his neck can be massaged
he might have had a rocky start in life , but paul certainly appears to be one happy cow now
