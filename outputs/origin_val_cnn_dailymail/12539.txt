london at the time it probably seemed like fun : jeremy clarkson and a crew from the top - rated bbc show top gear driving a porsche in argentina
the only problem was that the car 's registration plate , h982 flk , appeared to refer to the 1982 falklands war between the uk and argentina , fought over a remote uk colony off the coast of patagonia , which both countries claim
the conflict , which claimed the lives of 655 argentina servicemen and 255 uk , ended with a uk victory
jeremy clarkson and the rest of the production team were in the country filming a tv special on a remote highway that passes through chile and argentina , and the number plate sparked anger among locals over the perennially touchy subject of the war
as the crew attempted to flee by road to chile , they were attacked by an angry crowd who hurled rocks and bricks at the porsche and other cars in the convoy
jeremy clarkson , who fronts top gear , later said an angry mob tried to attack them with pickax handles and shouted " burn their cars
" " this was not some jolly jape that went awry
for once , we did nothing wrong , " he told sun. top gear producers said the numbers and letters on the registration plates had not been chosen deliberately
the motoring show , fronted by jeremy clarkson , james may and hammond , has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often treads the line and regularly steps over it
jeremy clarkson is determinedly anti-politically correct among the topics he rails about , both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns
favored topics include environmentalism , traffic laws and liberals
the latest " fracas " has seen jeremy clarkson suspended by the bbc , which broadcasts top gear , for allegedly hitting a producer
the presenter , who is one of the bbc 's highest earners , has previously caused offense during shoots in foreign countries and regularly court controversy at home
in july 2014 , jeremy clarkson came under fire for a racist comment made during a top gear special in myanmar
the slur came during a show segment which showed hosts jeremy clarkson , hammond and may looking at a bridge they had built over the river kwai as a local man walked over it
" that is a proud moment
but there 's a slope on it , " jeremy clarkson said
" you 're right , " co-star hammond replied
" it 's definitely higher on that side
" following complaints , the uk 's media watchdog , ofcom , said the use of the word " slope , " which is a derogatory term , was offensive and that the episode broke broadcasting rules
the show 's executive producer andy wilman said in a statement , that they " [ regretted ] any offense caused , " adding , " when we used the word ' slope ' ... it was a light - hearted word play joke referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local asian man who was crossing it
" over the years , jeremy clarkson has been in trouble for an apparent series of racist comments including characterizing mexicans as " lazy and feckless " and saying that everyone who traveled to india got " the trots
" he was also accused of using the " n - word " while filming the motoring show by uk newspaper the mirror
" eeny , meeny , miny moe ... , " he sang in video footage published by the mirror , " catch a nigger by his toe
" initially , jeremy clarkson vehemently denied the accusation on twitter but following public condemnation and calls for the bbc to fire him , he begged viewers for forgiveness in a video statement posted online
" i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure
i was mortified by this , horrified
it is a word i loathe , " jeremy clarkson said
among the condemnations was a sternly worded statement from 10 downing street , the office uk prime minister david cameron -- a friend of jeremy clarkson 's -- saying he would " certainly not " use the n - word
according to the bbc , the pm 's spokesperson added that he felt it was " absolutely right that there has been an apology
" both jeremy clarkson and the uk prime minister have homes in an affluent , rural part of central english known as the cotswolds
they are part of a wealthy group of media , politics and showbiz acquaintances who live in and around david cameron 's oxfordshire constituency
they have been dubbed " the chipping norton set
" among them is former news international ceo and editor of sun. and the news of the world , rebekah brooks , who came to prominence during the news international phone hacking scandal , for which she was acquitted
they also include former blur musician alex james and elisabeth murdoch , daughter of news corp ceo rupert murdoch
in an article for the daily telegraph , former chief political commentator peter oborne described " the chipping norton set " as " an incestuous collection of louche , affluent , power - hungry and amoral londoners
" jeremy clarkson 's popularity also comes from regular columns in venerated newspaper , sunday times and tabloid the sun. a recent sunday times column with the headline " phrasebook , tick
i 'm off to the north " attracted the ire of people from the northern english city of liverpool
he wrote : " people up there ( north ) earn less , die more quickly , have fewer jobs and live in houses that are worth the square root of sod all
" local newspaper , the liverpool echo , which pointed out that jeremy clarkson is a northerner himself , published a series of responses to the piece from local people who described him as " stuck in the past " and " a fake southerner " whose comments were " as dated as his double denims
