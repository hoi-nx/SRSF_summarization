gdc panel chair mary harley said : â the committee takes a particularly serious view of your conduct because it took place in a professional setting
â your behaviour towards dental nurse a escalated over a short period of time into you deliberately touching her bottom and her breasts and sucking and or biting her arm on 28 november 2012
â this escalation continued despite dental nurse a making it clear to you that your conduct was unacceptable
â both dental nurse a and dental nurse b described you laughing during the course of these incidents
â as a dentist working directly with these dental nurses , you were in a position of authority over them ; you abused that position for your own sexual gratification
â your conduct would be considered deplorable by members of the dental profession and indeed by members of the public
