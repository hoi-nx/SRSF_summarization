pardew has backed palace defender dann to carry on improving and challenge for a place in the england squad in the near future
england boss hodgson opted for phil jagielka , gary cahill , phil jones and chris smalling as his four centre back for the upcoming internationals with lithuania and italy at the end of the month
but dann has been in impressive form for palace in recent months as they moved away from relegation danger
dann has been in brilliant form for palace recently and could be in line for an england call pardew has back his centre back to keep improving and draw hodgson 's attention to him but pardew says that dann , 28 , has his best years ahead of him and can carry on improving
he said : â he is a good age and is coming into his prime age as a centre half and he has a lot of experience under his belt at this level
â he has not surprised me in terms of his character because he plays with an honesty in every game
he has been very impressive since i have been here and his confidence is high
he hit a pass out to a left winger at the weekend that glenn hoddle would have been proud of
â he has some good players in front of him and they have a lot more experience at that top level than he does
â i do nât think he should be disappointed he has not made this squad
he is playing well at the moment and it is there for all to see
what will be , will be , but his best years are still in front of him
â for pardew personally , he would love to see a palace player called up to the england squad
wilfried zaha was the last palace player to be called up to the england squad back in 2012 and pardew says his players must find their place in the premier league first
dann is 28 but pardew says he has his best years ahead of him and has been impressed by his character charlie austin , who was also left out of the england squad , loses out in an aerial challenge to dann wilfried zaha was the last palace player to be called up for england in 2012 in his previous spell at the club pardew would love to see a palace player called up to the england squad during his time as manager harry kane âs rapid assent into hodgson âs squad is something that pardew admires and hopes he can unearth someone of his quality
he added : â there have not been too many palace players in the england squad in recent years and it would be nice to get someone in that squad
sometimes when a team has just been promoted and you are in your second year , you have not got the foundations yet to be proven to show you are good enough at that level
harry kane has won a place in the england squad and pardew has been impressed with his quick progress â our boys are fighting for their status and you need to gain that
â to be fair to harry kane he has done that in a very quick time at a top club , and that is difficult to do , so hats off to him
â lets hope we can produce someone of his ilk as he is a real example to players up and down the country
