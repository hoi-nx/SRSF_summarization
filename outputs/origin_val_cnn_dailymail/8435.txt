wasps director or rugby dai young believes his side can still make the play - offs at the end of the season nathan hughes surges forward with the ball for wasps during the aviva premiership match with saracens wasps had stormed into a 17 - 3 lead through tries from elliot daly ( right ) and christian wade ' we knew what was coming from ( them ) as they do n't play a lot of rugby , ( they ) kick the ball a lot to squeeze you and it 's very hard to play against
' if you can control it , you get options to play as we showed in the first 20 minutes but after that we struggled to deal with the aerial bombardment as we dropped the ball far too often
' despite the loss , which was a huge blow to wasps ' chances of making the play - offs , dai young was adamant that his team were moving forward
' nothing changes as a result of today , we are still a work in progress and we are still aiming for a place in the top six
' we will address what went wrong today for our set - piece did n't function as well as we would have liked and we lacked a bit of control in the second half
' however , we do have individual players who can lighten up any stadium as you saw in the first 20 minutes

he said : ' we had the clarity of thought not to be spooked when they scored two tries in three minutes as we put the ball in the right areas to put pressure on them
' you can see that they have people who can hurt you from long range as they 've scored a lot of tries from inside their own half this season
' we had chances to close it up late on , which we did n't take , but we did deprive them of a vital bonus point
' the only downside for the saracens was the loss of brad , who limped off in the second half following a heavy collision with andy goode
' we are hopeful it is n't too serious and we have our fingers crossed because brad must be very close to england selection next week , ' added mccall
