last year was the safest in the history of commercial aviation despite the loss of two high - profile malaysia airlines flights in which hundreds of people were killed , according to industry experts
while more people died in air accidents in 2014 than the average in recent years , the number of fatal accidents compared with the total number of flights was a record low , the iata ( iata ) said
the organisations said in a new report that there were 12 fatal accidents in 2014 with 641 fatalities , versus 19 fatal accidents and 517 fatalities per year in the five - year period between 2009 and 2013
the downing of mh17 , in which 298 people died , was not included in the safety report because it was not technically classed as an accident malaysia airlines flight mh17 takes off from schipol airport near amsterdam prior to being shot down as it flew over ukraine ' while aviation safety was in the headlines in 2014 , the data show that flying continues to improve its safety performance , ' said tyler , iata 's director general and chief executive officer
the statistics translate into an accident rate , measured in ' hull losses ' per 1 million flights , of 0.23 , or the equivalent of one for every 4.4 million flights
iata 's 2014 statistics did not include the loss of malaysia airlines flight mh17 , which was shot down by a surface - to - air anti-aircraft missile in ukraine last june and so not classified as an accident
all 298 people on board were killed
' to the flying public an air tragedy is an air tragedy , regardless of how it is classified , ' said tyler
' in 2014 we saw a reduction in the number of fatal accidents - and that would be true even if we were to include mh17 in the total
' the other high - profile event of 2014 , the disappearance of mh370 on a flight from kuala lumpur to beijing on march 8 , 2014 , with 239 passengers and crew , has become one of the biggest mysteries in the history of aviation
an extensive search in the southern indian ocean , where satellite data showed that the boeing 777-200er ended up after being diverted from its original flight path , has not found any sign of the plane
an investigation report that was released on sunday did not reveal anything new
australian deputy prime minister warren truss shows a new search area in the indian ocean where rescue crews are continuing to look for any signs of mh370 's whereabouts an australian defence vessel sails through the indian ocean as no trace has yet been found of the missing aircraft u.s. navy aircrewman karl shinn searches from above for any signs of the missing malaysia airlines plane the icao ( icao ) , a united nations body that regulates global aviation , proposed after mh370 that commercial aircraft report their position every 15 minutes instead of the current norm of 30 - 40 minutes
tyler told reporters at a briefing in hong kong that such a system would be in place by november 2016
' at the moment there 's no technology that can track aircraft everywhere in the world over time , ' he said
' these things do n't happen overnight
' new space - based technologies might make real - time tracking possible soon , he added
' the promise is to be able to identify aircraft wherever they are in the world pretty much in real - time with no gaps in coverage , ' he said
' it may well be that this is the way we should go , however that technology wo n't be available for two or three years to come
' three of last year 's 12 plane crashes involved jet aircraft and accounted for the bulk of the deaths
in december , an airasia jet carrying 162 people crashed into the java sea
in july , an air algerie jet went down in mali during bad weather , killing all 116 aboard
the nine other crashes involved turboprop aircraft , including a transasia that crashed in july on the penghu island chain in the taiwan strait , killing 58 people
another transasia turboprop crashed in february this year , killing more than 40 people
the wreckage of airasia qz8501 is removed from a rescue vessel in jakarta , indonesia
the plane crashed into the java sea on december 28 , killing all 162 on board the airasia crash was one of three major incidents to rock the aviation industry last year
