for years wozniak dismissed claims that technology , and particularly artificial intelligence , could threaten humans
but in a recent interview , the 64 - year - old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human - like computers could be a dangerous reality
he even quipped : ' will we be the gods ? will we be the family pets ? or will we be ants that get stepped on ? i do n't know
he even quipped ' will we be the gods ? will we be the family pets ? or will we be ants that get stepped on ? i do n't know ' the apple co-founder made the comments during an interview with paul smith at australian financial review
he said : ' computers are going to take over from humans , no question
if we build these devices to take care of everything for us , eventually they 'll think faster than us and they 'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently
he directly referenced warnings issued by both musk and stephen hawking about the threat ai has on humanity
the pair is part of a group of experts , known collectively as the future of life institute , who recently drafted an open letter saying scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind
the authors said there is a ' broad consensus ' that ai research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of ai had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak
for instance , in the short term , it claims ai may put millions of people out of work

' aldebaran 's human - like robot is pictured mr wozniak directly referenced warnings issued by both musk ( pictured ) and stephen hawking about the threat ai has on humanity
for example , tesla boss mr musk said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will , instead , be controlled by robots earlier this month tesla boss mr musk said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will , instead , be controlled by robots
the entrepreneur claimed that computers will one day do a much better job of driving and that humans are simply â too dangerous â behind the wheel
in a paper called robots are us : some economics of human replacement , lead researcher benzell said : ' whether it 's bombing our enemies , steering our planes , fielding our calls , rubbing our backs , vacuuming our floors , driving our taxis , or beating us at jeopardy , it 's hard to think of hitherto human tasks that smart machines ca n't do or wo n't soon do
' the ' robear ' has a cub - like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair ( pictured ) or a floor - level bed to a bath , for example a recent report by management consulting firm boston consulting group predicted by 2025 the number of ' automatable ' tasks will rise to 25 per cent
this will lead to robots replacing many human jobs - and is a trend that has already begun in japanese
earlier this week riken - srk collaboration centre for human-interactive robot research in nagoya , japanese unveiled its latest robear
the ' robear ' has a cub - like face but has enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor - level bed to a bath
it weighs 309lb ( 140kg ) with extending legs that stop the ' bear ' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms
and at the start of the month , mitsubishi ufj financial group said it will begin employing a humanoid called nao in its branches from april , on a trial basis
and if the trial is successful , the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the japanese bank by 2020
elsewhere , in china there is a hotel manned entirely by robots
from reception desk staff to security doormen and waiters , the pengheng space capsules hotel in shenzhen , china , has built , rather than hired , new employees
start - up costs and robot maintenance aside , staff bills are minimal and the hotel can pass these savings back to the customer as a night 's stay costs just Â£ 6.80 per night
with this in mind , mr benzell and his colleagues at the national bureau of economic research asked whether ' human replacement ' - the act of building better versions of ourselves - will deliver an economic utopia or leave us earning too little to buy the goods the robots are making ? using a simulated economy , they found that the value of coders and developers will increase as the demand for smart machines rise
as processes improve and technology advances , the price to produce these machines will decline , which will deliver a ' tech boom '
this in turn will raise the demand for new code
but over time , the stock of so - called ' legacy code ' will grow because so many people are working on the projects , causing an abundance
plus this code will ultimately cause machines to become smarter and learn how to use the legacy code themselves
using a simulated economy , a recent paper found the value of coders will increase as demand for machines rise
as tech advances , costs will decline to deliver a ' tech boom '
but over time , the stock of so - called ' legacy code ' will grow causing demand for new code and high - tech workers to drop and see them replaced by robots the eventual decline in jobs will limit what young people can save and invest
this means less capital will be available for the future generations and means production could actually fall over time , despite the fact machines are capable of producing goods more efficiently
a robot hotel employee in china is shown this will cause demand for new code and , thus for high - tech workers , to drop and see such workers replaced by robot employees
' the resulting tech bust reflects past humans obsolescing current humans
these robots contain the stuff of humans - accumulated brain and saving power , ' said the paper
' in fact , high - tech workers can start out earning far more than low - tech workers , but end up earning far less
' artificial intelligence has been described as a threat that could be ' more dangerous than nukes '
now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including musk and stephen hawking , have signed an open letter promising to ensure ai research benefits humanity
the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future
stark warning : professor stephen hawking says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence the document , drafted by the future of life institute , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind
the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that ai research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society
it highlights speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research
' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools ai may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of ai had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak
for instance , in the short term , it claims ai may put millions of people out of work
in the long term , it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming
the paper uses the example of junior , the reigning world computer chess champion
junior can beat every current and , possibly , every future human on the planet
consequently , his old code has largely put new chess programmers out of business
the eventual decline in high - tech and , potentially , low - tech workers income will limit what young people can save and invest , continued the paper
this means less capital will be available for the future generations and production could actually fall over time , despite the fact machines are capable of producing goods more efficiently
an alternative outcome of this is that high - skilled workers will move into low - skilled , lower paid positions , which will force these low - skilled workers into unemployment
and once people are out of work , welfare costs will rise putting a greater strain on the economy
the authors suggest people start saving for this eventuality an alternative outcome of this is that high - skilled workers will move into low - skilled , lower paid positions , which will force these low - skilled workers into unemployment
and once people are out of work , welfare costs will rise putting a greater strain on the economy
the authors even suggest people start saving for this eventuality
' the long run in such cases is no techno - utopia
yes , code is abundant
and yes , everyone is fully employed
but no one is earning very much , ' said mr bezell
' in short , when smart machines replace people , they eventually bite the hands of those that finance them
