during a 13 - week trial at reading crown court it emerged that 10 staff at the company falsely claimed they had helped people find jobs to hit bonus targets
some even falsified files using the names of family members , while others offered bribes in the form of vouchers to get people to fill out false forms
four defendants were convicted in connection with the fraud after six of their colleagues had previously pleaded guilty
ines cano-uribe , 39 , of madrid , spain , was found guilty of two counts of forgery , while zabar khalil , 35 , matthew hannigan-train , 31 and hayley wilson , 27 , were each found guilty of one count of forgery

the contract covered berkshire , buckinghamshire and oxfordshire and was funded by the european social fund
a4e was paid Â£ 1.3million for the contract and Â£ 10,500 a month to implement it
the company received payments for each person it helped gain employment
the court heard that while a4e helped 558 people find jobs , staff lied about others

' during the period one of the workers falsified a ' successful job ' in her nephew 's name and another supposedly for her husband
another worker bribed a man with Â£ 150 of vouchers to sign forms saying he had been through a4e training
ten workers at the firm a4e - which was employed by the government to get people off benefits - are being sentenced for ripping off taxpayers in a Â£ 300,000 fraud the crimes came to light when an employee at a4e blew the whistle on the scam
