thousands of square miles of rainforest is cleared in the amazon each year to make way for farming land - a pattern of destruction that takes place all around the world
but despite this , the planet has got greener in the past decade , with the total amount of plant coverage increasing overall
the increase is so noticeable that the world 's trees and plants now store almost four billion more tonnes of carbon than they did in 2003
thousands of square miles of rainforest is cleared in the amazon ( pictured ) each year to make way for farming land - a pattern of destruction that takes place all around the world - but despite this , the planet has got greener in the past decade , with the total amount of plant coverage increasing overall this is thanks to tree - planting in china , forest regrowth in former soviet states because of abandoned farms , and more lush savannas because of higher rainfall
scientists analysed 20 years of satellite data and found an increase in carbon , despite ongoing large - scale tropical deforestation in brazilian and indonesia , according to research published on monday in nature climate change
carbon flows between the world 's oceans , air and land
it is present in the atmosphere primarily as carbon dioxide ( co2 ) - the main climate - changing gas - and stored as carbon in trees
through photosynthesis , trees convert carbon dioxide into the food they need to grow , locking the carbon in their wood
the greening of earth is thanks to tree - planting in china , forest regrowth in former soviet states because of abandoned farms and more lush savannas because of abandoned farms and higher rainfall
an an image of a family on a farming collective in the soviet in 1935 is shown the researchers say that earth is getting greener thanks to a combination of environmental and financial factors
there are more trees in china because of planting programmes that have been running for a few decades
vegetation has increased on the savannahs of australia , africa and south america as a result of increasing rainfall
russia and former soviet republics have seen the regrowth of forests since huge collective farms have been abandoned
the increase of carbon in the atmosphere over the past decade has caused the ' co2 fertilisation effect ' which has improved the growing conditions for plants a little
as earth gradually warms up and ice and permafrost melts in the arctic , the ' tree line ' is moving north , meaning there are more pine forests springing up
while the four - billion - tonne increase is helpful , it is small compared to the 60 billion tonnes of carbon released into the atmosphere by fossil fuel burning and cement production over the same period , said liu , the study 's lead author and a scientist at the university of new south wales
' from this research , we can see these plants can help absorb some carbon dioxide , but there 's still a lot of carbon dioxide staying in the atmosphere , ' dr liu said by telephone from sydney
' if we want to stabilise the current level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - and avoid the consequent impacts - it still requires us to reduce fossil fuel emissions
' dr liu , who specialises in observing the water cycle , including rainfall and soil moisture , used a new technique of collecting satellite data on radio frequency radiation naturally emitted by the earth to calculate the amount of vegetation in a given area
before , scientists measured vegetation through satellite images and other techniques , looking at canopy greenness and plant height
he had expected to find increased forests in china , which has had tree - planting projects for two to three decades , as well as on abandoned farmland in former soviet countries
china has had tree - planting projects for two to three decades and is now boosting the earth 's greenery , researchers say
here , two giant pandas rest on the outskirts of chengdu in china 's sichuan province but he was surprised to discover the large expansion in vegetation due to higher rainfall on tropical savannas and shrublands in australia , africa and south america
but these fragile gains may be easily lost , as weather patterns shift with climate change , he warned
' savannas and shrublands are vulnerable to rainfall â one year can be very wet , and more carbon will be fixed in plants , but the next year can be very dry , and then we will lose the carbon fixed in previous years , ' dr liu explained
verchot , a research director at the indonesia - based centre for international forestry research , said dr liu 's findings were ' by and large what we would expect in the warmer and wetter world that results from climate change '
declines is rainforest vegetation has been particularly dramatic in the amazon and indonesia 's provinces of kalimantan and sumatra

the savannah , serengeti national park , tanzania pictured over 2,300 square miles ( 6,000 square km ) of amazon was destroyed in the 12 months to the end of july 2013 , according to statistics from the brazilian government
this means that deforestation was up by 29 per cent and the most activity was seen in the states of para and mato , where more than 390 square miles ( 1,000 square km ) of land was cleared in each location , the bbc reported
before these figures , there was some decline in the clearing of the precious resource to make room for grazing animals and crops
the increase is thought to be because of illegal logging and the building of new infrastructure such as roads and dams , as well as making space for farmers
' as ice and permafrost melt , they are being replaced by vegetation , and the tree line is moving north as the arctic warms , ' he said by email
vegetation growth is also expected to increase due to rising co2 in the atmosphere , known as the ' co2 fertilisation effect , ' which has improved the growing conditions for plants a little
dr verchot said the value of dr liu 's study is that it puts a number on the contribution of vegetation to moderating greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere
' hopefully this will lead to greater efforts to stop tropical forest loss and to promote sustainable use of ecosystems in ways that preserve enough of the carbon absorption function as we continue to pump co2 into the atmosphere through fossil fuel burning , ' dr verchot added
declines is rainforest vegetation has been particularly dramatic in the amazon and indonesia 's provinces of kalimantan and sumatra
scientists are particularly alarmed by land clearances in these areas because the forests are richer and more diverse habitats than grassland , for example , and absorb more carbon per hectare than savannah and croplands
while total plant cover may have increased over the past decade , it is arguably of lower quality than that found in rainforests , which also support networks of rare inter-dependent species
the report said that only half of rainforest loss has been offset by growth in other types of forests .
