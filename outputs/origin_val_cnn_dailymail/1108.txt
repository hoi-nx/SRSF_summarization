rik sharma rates the players from both sides after an action - packed 90 minutes at the nou camp
barcelona claudio bravo 8 : made two excellent saves , one from cristiano ronaldo 's first - half piledriver , the second from a deflected benzema strike near the end
no chance with cristiano ronaldo 's goal
dani alves 6 : some shocking defending at times , but as we 've come to expect , the brazilian knows how to contribute in attack
his wonderful ball created barcelona 's second goal
gerard pique 9 : this was a performance from the defender which some believed was beyond him after his fall from grace
got his head to every ball when it mattered and executed some perfect tackles
after his impressive performance , gerard pique left the stadium with his pop star girlfriend shakira gerard pique was at his very best at the heart of the barcelona defence against real madrid jeremy mathieu 8.5 : when the frenchman was signed it turned a few heads
he used his own to send barcelona 1 - 0 up and defended expertly after that
one scary moment , when he nodded inches wide of his own goal
jordi alba 6.5 : restrained himself going forward for the most part , but coped perfectly well with gareth bale down the wing
fired a late chance wide after good work by messi
javier mascherano 7 : tried to copy sergio busquets â style of play , instead of rushing around in his usual bulldog style
some unnecessary play - acting aside , a fine performance
javier mascherano was involved in some unnecessary play - acting but otherwise had a fine game ivan rakitic 6.5 : not an indelible presence in this barcelona side , but a useful one
the croatian helped shuttle the ball forwards to the attackers nicely , but could have offered more with barcelona under the cosh in the first half
iniesta 7 : captained barcelona for the first time against real madrid and put in a mature display
showed he can be a tough customer when he needs to be in a midfield battle , too
messi 7.5 : nutmegged toni kroos early on , and set up jeremy mathieu âs goal with a wicked free kick
dropped out of the game for a while , but was running the show by the end
messi set up barcelona 's opener and was a constant menace despite not being at his very best suarez 8.5 : fought hard up front , in a long running battle with pepe
got the goal he deserved with a brilliant piece of control and an instinctive finish
neymar 6 : missed a golden chance in the first half , after which real madrid broke away and equalised
some phenomenal dribbles , which terrified real madrid âs back line , but was too selfish â and wasteful - with his chances
subs sergio busquets 6 : brought on for rakitic as luis enrique tried to shut up shop
xavi 6 : replaced iniesta , coming on in what could be his final clasico
little time to make an impact
rafinha 6 : gave barcelona a safer look , with neymar making way
suarez celebrates scoring the winner for barcelona as he continues his fine run of form real madrid iker casillas 6 : no errors , which was his main concern after his shocking performance against schalke
both barcelona goals were impossible to keep out
dani carvajal 6 : booked and was lucky not to be sent off when he tangled with neymar
pepe : booked for going through the back of suarez , and done for pace by the uruguayan for the second goal
not his finest night , and it ended early when ancelotti hooked him for raphael varane
pepe struggled with the pace of suarez and was eventually replaced by raphael varane sergio ramos 5 : caught out when jeremy mathieu escaped his clutches and headed home the opener
was too slow to react to suarez for barcelona âs second
marcelo 7.5 : the brazilian was a lively attacking outlet down the left , combining with benzema to set up cristiano ronaldo , when he hit the bar
toni kroos 6.5 : a strong first half , helping real madrid dominate proceedings
however , the midfielder has been tired in recent weeks and that took its toll in the second period , when he was quiet
luka modric 7 : after a three - month injury lay - off , he âs slotted straight back into the side and it looks like he 's never been away
a classy customer who can hold his head high despite the defeat , playing a key role in cristiano ronaldo âs goal
luka modric has slotted straight back into the real madrid side following a spell on the sidelines with injury isco 6 : the real madrid press claim he âs a national treasure , and he âs been real madrid âs best player in recent weeks
however , he was quiet here , and outshone by iniesta , the man he âs tipped to replace in spain âs side
gareth bale 5.5 : the welshman nearly had the goal he dreamed of scoring , but his close - range effort was ruled out for cristiano ronaldo being offside in the build - up
this was his chance to prove his doubters wrong , but was often on the fringes of the game , which wo n't ease the pressure on his back
gareth bale had a goal ruled out for offside and was something of a spectator for large parts of the game benzema 8.5 : out of the six forwards , benzema has the lowest x factor
however , he was arguably the most effective here , setting up cristiano ronaldo with an impudent back - heel
cristiano ronaldo 7 : barcelona âs supporters whistled and screamed at him every time he touched the ball â¦ but he âs used to that from the bernabeu
scored , as he tends to do , with a poacher âs finish
subs raphael varane 7 : came on for pepe to steady the ship and made a good tackle on messi in the box
jese 6 : too little time to make an impact
cristiano ronaldo scored the equaliser but was not able to lead his side to victory at the nou camp
