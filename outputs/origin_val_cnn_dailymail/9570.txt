generations have flocked to the isle of wight to see queen victoria and albert 's magnificent seaside home osborne house
it was ' impossible to imagine a prettier spot ' , she famously declared
and now the island is gearing up for a wave of interest after the valentine 's day wedding of oscar - nominated benedict cumberbatch and sophie hunter
fit for a king , queen or prince : the george occupies a splendid spot on the shoreline in yarmouth victoria and albert were newlyweds when they fell in love with the island
they designed and built osborne house as a refuge from the stifling royal court , a place to relax with their nine children
the house still boasts the same private beach where they bathed far from the prying eyes of her subjects
today , you can stay within the grounds - in two cottages called no 1 and no 2 sovereign 's gate
they both sleep four , and you can explore the grounds long after the house has closed to the public
not all the royals were so enthused by the island , however
charles i was a prisoner in carisbrooke castle before being shipped back to be executed
after a couple of nights at osborne house , we set off for the george hotel in the harbour town of yarmouth , driving past 110 - year - old thatched st agnes church and on to the chalk stacks of the needles
the charge of the light brigade was required reading at my school , so i took another detour to faringford , the estate of tennyson , who was a familiar figure striding the downs amid the wild orchids in his distinctive hat
the bracing sea air was worth , according to tennyson , ' sixpence a pint '
a pint costs a bit more these days in yarmouth , where sleek speedboats are moored yards from the hotel garden
keeping it under his hat : benedict cumberbatch enjoyed his last night as a ' free man ' on the isle of wight the wall of henry viii 's fortress gives shelter from the sea winds so you can dine alfresco for most of the year
it might only be a matter of time before the george boasts its first michelin star , which explains why benedict cumberbatch and 140 of his friends spent the night here
in years to come , will there be a plaque saying the sherlock idol spent his last night here as a bachelor ? a much earlier visitor , charles darwin , summed up the isle of wight as ' the nicest seaside place which we have ever seen '
i could n't agree more
