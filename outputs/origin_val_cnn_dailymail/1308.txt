mps have accused bosses of hsbc of being â utterly incompetent â and ducking responsibility for the switzerland tax dodging scandal
meares , who ran hsbc âs global private banking arm between 2006 and 2011 , told the public accounts committee he was not aware of alleged tax evasion taking place on his watch
asked repeatedly whether he accepted personal responsibility for the scandal , he said he took responsibility for â controls failings â which allowed the wrongdoing to occur
but he added : â i do not take fairly direct responsibility for individual actions of people in switzerland that i was unaware of
the committee âs chairman margaret hodge , a labour mp , said : â nobody at the bank ... has deigned to accept responsibility for what was massive , illegal terrible tax evasion
â she added : â either you were incompetent , completely and utterly incompetent , in your oversight duties or you knew about it â¦ i do nât believe you did not know
â her fellow committee members also expressed disbelief that hsbc âs bosses in london were unaware of what was happening in switzerland
conservative mp david burrows said : â you are asking us to accept that switzerland was off on a frolic on its own - that nobody in london knew what was going on â
he added : â i can not believe that nobody knew the unlawful actions that were taking place in switzerland , and if they did nât know then they jolly well should have done
â what we âve essentially got is blind eye knowledge â holding the telescope to the blind eye so that you in london did nât see what you suspected was going on in switzerland
â question time : mps accused bbc trust chairman rona fairhead as either being aware of wrongdoing or being ' utterly incompetent ' hsbc âs chairman flint has already heaped blame on mr meares and his predecessor clive bannister , the son of four - minute mile legend sir roger bannister , who now runs insurance company phoenix
mr flint told the treasury select committee last month that the two men â certainly bear fairly direct responsibility â
yesterday , mr meares - who is now chairman of fund manager quilter cheviot - rejected claims that he was being made the â fall guy â by hsbc
but he was described as a â wholly unreliable witness â by conservative mp stephen hammond .
