' for sturridge it is the latest in a sequence of fitness issues this season
he was hodgson 's first - choice centre - forward at the world cup last summer but missed five months of this season after pulling a thigh muscle during an england training session in september
there was a blaze of controversy about whether he should have been resting or training on that particular day , followed by complications in his recovery process , none of which helped the relationship between club and country
sturridge then suffered with calf muscle injuries and was just getting back to his sharpest form when he hobbled out of anfield with a stiff hip after scoring liverpool 's goal in a 2 - 1 defeat against manchester united
