seven members of congress including two u.s. senators have been caught following an x-rated account on twitter , but those whose spokespersons responded to requests for comment say their staff made innocent mistakes
the account , calling itself ' f * * * box radio , ' went dormant in 2013 but promised ' the best orgasm , porn and sex sounds ever ! we will post sex pics too ! ' the sex - themed account uses a sexually graphic photo as its header image
its official twitter handle , however , is the innocuous - sounding ' @ jukeboxradio2
' lawmakers whose official social media accounts followed ' f * * * box radio ' include minnesota democrats sen. amy klobuchar and south carolina republicans sen. republicans ; democrats reps
david cicilline of rhode island , degette of colorado and sanchez of california ; and republicans reps
issa of california and ann wagner of missouri
oops : seven members of congress followed a twitter account calling itself ' f * * * box radio , ' and two of them were still doing it â including california democrat sanchez â as of thursday at noon bipartisan : california issa rep. issa also followed the account , but his social media staff unfollowed after daily mail online asked about it rep. issa 's office unfollowed the account minutes after daily mail online asked for comment on thursday
his spokesman , carnes , said in an email that the account had ' tweeted on newsworthy items a couple of years ago
since then , they have clearly changed their focus
' ' any twitter follower can make a similar change at any time , ' carnes pointed out , and it is impossible for congressman issa to constantly review tens of thousands of twitter followers for any changes they might make to their profiles
' ' as soon as the twitter handle 's addition of coarse language was brought to the office 's attention , the account was unfollowed
' separately , a legislative communications aide who declined to be identified said during a phone interview that a ' mortified ' boss was n't happy
' it 's not the kind of thing you like to find out , ' the aide said
' not now , not ever
' no comment : minnesota democrats sen. amy klobuchar 's office did n't respond to questions about why she had followed a pornographic twitter account macfarlane , a spokesman for rep. cicilline , explained that his boss was at one time in the habit of uncritically following twitter accounts that followed his
' years ago we had a follow / follow back policy for the twitter account , ' macfarlane said in an email , ' but have since revised that policy and have started vetting followers more closely
' ' we âve un-followed the account in question
' morgan , chief of staff to rep. wagner , issued a denial to a question about how it was possible that her official twitter account had followed a porn - oriented user
' no idea , and its not , ' morgan said in an email
but a report just a day ago in roll call includes a graphic showing wagner was indeed following the account
in a follow - up , he said he had learned that ' the person who does our social media now in the office unfollowed upon seeing the [ roll call ] story
' embarrassing : colorado democrats rep. degette is still following the ' twitter account other lawmakers ' offices did not respond to requests for comment at all
by thursday at noon , only degette and sanchez were still following the salacious account
roll call reported wednesday that its initial purpose seemed to be harvesting followers for internet radio projects , and then complaining about government regulations that stood in the way of a 10 - year - old philadelphia girl , murnaghan , getting a lung transplant
at the time , then - hhs secretary kathleen sebelius refused to grant the terminally ill cystic fibrosis patient an exemption to a policy that gave priority to children over age 12
ultimately a federal court intervened and murnaghan got two double - lung transplants , and according to abc news could breathe 12 hours per day without a ventilator
the ' f * * * box radio ' account owner 's temporary interest in health advocacy could explain how seven federal lawmakers were among its fewer than 200 followers .
