' busy ' : baker made a ' max speed 20mph ' sign after police claimed they â did not have the resources â to monitor motorists outside his home police told a pensioner that they were too busy to deal with speeders using his road â but turned up within 30 minutes after he put up a diy warning sign
officers in newbury , berkshire , claimed they â did not have the resources â to monitor motorists outside pensioner baker âs terraced home
so he made a â max speed 20mph â sign and stuck it on the roadside â only to find an officer on his doorstep demanding that he remove the notice half an hour later
mr baker , 71 , said he and his partner rosemary cribb fear someone will be knocked down and killed by the â mad â drivers
â no one will do anything about the speeding , but put up an illegal sign and all of a sudden you get the police banging on your door , â he said
â all i want to do is stop people speeding before there âs a tragedy â somebody âs got to do something about it
' west berkshire council says it âs not their fault , and thames valley police told me they have nât got the time or resources
â but they can very soon find the time to send someone round to knock on my front door
â i put up the sign and inside 30 minutes an officer was round here telling me to take it down
â i âm just so frustrated â has it got to take someone âs death for them to do anything about the speeding traffic ? â ' west berkshire council says it âs not their fault , and thames valley police told me they have nât got the time or resources , ' mr baker said mr baker âs road was made a 20mph zone in 2010 after repeated requests from worried residents and local councillors
but mr baker said signs warning motorists that it is a 20mph limit are not clearly displayed and pointed out that even some of his neighbours are not aware of the speed restrictions
he said : â this morning a woman complained to my daughter that it is nât 20 along this road , it âs 30mph
she came back and said she was totally unaware it was 20mph
â a police spokesman said they would investigate mr baker âs complaints .
