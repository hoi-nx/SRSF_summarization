from russian with love may be the name of a popular james bond film , but it could also be used to describe the experience basketball superstar lauren jackson had when playing for spartak moscow and taken under the wing of the club 's controversial millionaire owner shabtai von kalmanovic
in fact the james bond similarities do n't end there as von kalmanovic was an ex-kgb spy turned businessman who had spent five and a half years in an israeli prison after he was convicted of spying for the soviet union
from 2007 to 2009 jackson played for spartak moscow on a multi-million dollar contract
her loving benefactor would also shower the australia basketball player with expensive gifts and get her everything she could wish for
â my experience there , the lifestyle , it is beyond belief to most people , â jackson told the sunday telegraph
from the outside she looked to be living a charmed existence with von kalmanovic showering jackson with diamonds when she played well
she would fly the globe on his private jet
and that was just for starters
she 'd a personal driver and lived rent - free in a luxurious six bedroom apartment
the russian millionaire even flew in singer kelis to help celebrate one victory
but von kalmanovic 's smothering obsessiveness took it 's toll
suddenly jackson had no control whatsoever over her life
her russian boss was calling all the shots
spartak moscow owner shabtai von kalmanovic and jackson kiss the trophy as they celebrate their victory in the euroleague women 's final four decider in 2008 moscow 's red square would have been very familiar to jackson who lived in a rent - free luxury six bedroom apartment in the city it seemed that it was only while playing on the basketball court that she could make her own decisions
it was a strange and at times startling period of her life
at one time von kalmanovic âs security detail started following her and other spartak moscow players through a local mall after a game
' he was even wearing a trench coat , ' jackson says
' shabtai von kalmanovic said it was for our own protection
' von kalmanovic would shower jackson with expensive gifts and once bought her diamonds when she played well the kind of world von kalmanovic was involved in could n't have been made any clearer though when in november 2009 he was shot dead in moscow , it was a professional hit
two men just drove up beside von kalmonvic 's luxury mercedes and riddled the vehicle with bullets , in what the guardian reported at the time was a classic assassin 's tactic
jackson was devastated by the loss
but for all the riches that had been given to her she felt empty inside
she had a lavish lifestyle but something was missing
now all she wanted was peace and quiet
she moved back to canberra where she now lives the quiet life
the glitz and glamour of russian could n't be further away
jackson had a personal driver in moscow and lived rent - free in a luxurious six bedroom apartment the 33 - year - old is hoping she will be fit to play for australia in next year 's rio oiympics after being her country 's flag bearer for london 2012 last week the 33 - year - old - who plays for the seattle storm in the us - had her sixth knee operation in the last 12 months , but despite this she still wants to play for australia at next year 's rio olympics
her shimmering record includes playing in four olympic games and winning three silver and one bronze medal , according to basketballaustralia
olympic gold has remained an elusive dream
but whatever the future holds its her time living and playing in russian that has made an indelible mark on her
and she believes she is all the better for the experience
jackson is currently recovering from injury and has had six operations in the last 12 months
