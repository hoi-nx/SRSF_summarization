and also to meet liverpool fans again ; many times i have been back to anfield as an opponent , but this time i 'm going like part of the home team
it 's going to be a really emotional day for me
' the atletico player says he 's fully behind the cause and is looking forward to helping gerrard out
' my first reaction was : ' of course i will be there
i will do anything i can , anything in my hands , to be there with stevie on that day
' the spaniard had an incredible few seasons at liverpool and became one of the best forwards in the world liverpool fans will be drooling over the prospect that two of their best forwards in recent years will be partnering up and torres admits he ca n't wait to play alongside luis suarez
he said : ' i saw what luis suarez did in his time at liverpool and it was amazing , just amazing
luis suarez is a good friend - we have a good relationship and good friendship
we were sitting together for two days at melwood when i was leaving and he was coming
' we made good friends and we are still in touch now
i also know what it means to him to go back to anfield and play there again
it will be great to play up front with him , especially with gerrard behind us
' the 31 - year - old 's move to chelsea did n't work out and he was booed on his last return to the club in his previous returns to anfield , torres was greeted with a chorus of boos - with some fans still upset after he moved to premier league rivals chelsea
but the 31 - year - old was quick to play down the boos and praised liverpool 's fans
he revealed : ' i will say to everybody that what the media says about the relationship between liverpool fans and me after i left was not the reality
everybody knows the kind of reaction liverpool fans had when we met on the street in london or when i went back to liverpool - everybody gave me thanks for everything i did in liverpool
torres could feature up top alongside his friend luis suarez who left the club for barcelona in the summer ' that is what i feel for them
for me , liverpool fans are always going to be different ; i had probably the best period of my career wearing the red shirt and all my memories are great
i have nothing bad to say about them and i never will - they treated me like one of them and i felt at home in my time there
' it is going to be amazing going back ; hopefully the reception will be better than the one i had when i went with chelsea
but it does n't matter what happens really
liverpool fans are part of my heart and my feelings - everything i felt when i was a liverpool player is inside me and no - one is going to take that away from me
' gerrard ( right ) and torres struck up a friendship during his time and are still in contact with eachother he soon became a kop hero after his move to merseyside and torres would love to score in front of the fans once again - and admits he would n't hold back
' if i could do that , i would celebrate like if i was scoring in a liverpool shirt , ' he said
' there are many memories , nice memories - great nights , great games , many goals scored in front of the kop - and they made me feel like i could fly
i 'm sure if i could score a goal , i can remember that kind of situation and try to enjoy it and celebrate like it 's an official game
' torres and gerrard formed a formdiable partnership and relationship on the pitch , which torres has n't forgotten - labelling the captain as the best player he played with
the liverpool captain was described as the best player torres has played with during his football career ' i ca n't wait to play with stevie again
i just wanted to have the chance to play with him , even if it is just one last time
no - one knows if it is going to be the last time , but be sure that i am going to enjoy it
' i have said many times that stevie is the best player that i have played with - by far
he was a big influence for me as a player ; i had one career before i started playing with him and one career after i played with him
he changed my game and changed my motivation and ambition
' he made me feel that i could really do whatever i wanted
for me , he is going to be the best forever , so to have the chance to play with him on a special day like it is going to be on sunday , is a privilege
i want to be there on sunday and be on the pitch with him
