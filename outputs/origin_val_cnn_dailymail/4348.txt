a 4,000 - year - old egyptian statue which was sold by a council for nearly Â£ 16million to an overseas buyer has been banned from leaving britain
the statue of sekhemka , a limestone figure which is just 30in high , was controversially sold by northampton borough council for Â£ 15.76m last year to a mystery buyer abroad
but the council was accused of committing â a great act of folly â by the save sekhemka statue action group , who feared the ancient relic could disappear into private ownership overseas
sold : the statue of sekhemka ( pictured at christie 's , london last year ) , a limestone figure which is just 30in high , was controversially sold by northampton borough council for Â£ 15.76million to a mystery buyer abroad now the culture minister ed vaizey has ordered a four - month export ban on the relic leaving the british isles after arts council england ruled the sale breached standards for how museums manage their collections
that ban could even be extended to march 2016 if a â serious intention to raise funds to purchase the statue is made â , arts council england said
the statue , which dates from 2,400bc , is a tomb model of a kilt - wearing high official surrounded by his wife , son and seven offering bearings
mr ed vaizey praised the figure as a work of â outstanding aesthetic importance â , and â the finest example of its kind anywhere in the world

above , the artifact picture in christie 's 's last year but in july last year the council sold off the piece , which they have owned for more than 100 years , insisting it was nât the centrepiece of their collection
the egyptian government called on the statue to be returned to egyptian if northampton borough council did not want it , and said the sale ran counter to the values and role of museums worldwide
a northampton borough council council spokesman said the export ban had â no impact â on the council âs sale of the statue â and insisted it was a matter for the government and arts council england to resolve between them
tomb model : the statue of sekhemka , on display at christie 's , london , ahead of its sale last year the statue of sekhemka was found during a 19th century archaeological dig near cairo
the tomb model shows a seated man wearing a kilt and wig , with his wife , son and offering - bearers
sekhemka was a high level scribe who lived in the old kingdom sometime between 2,700bc and 2,2250bc - the period of egyptian history when the pyramids of giza were built
in a country that was mainly illiterate , his ability to read and write means he would have been a person of high status with access to high offices
at first , tomb statues - a sign of wealth - were reserved for the royal family
but as the economy improved , officials like sekhemka who held high - ranking positions could afford to pay craftsmen to create likenessess of themselves for their tomb
they served two purposes : to act as a record of the way the person looked , and to ensure that the offerings he desired for his survival in the afterlife - listed on the papyrus carried in the statue 's hands - were made after his death
it is unkown exactly when the statue arrived at northampton museum , but records indicate it was on display before the end of the 1890s
it has been on display at various norhampton museums until two years ago
the statue , which stands just 30in high , has been praised as a work of ' outstanding aesthetic importance ' by culture minister ed vaizey
he added it was ' the finest example of any kind in the world '
its sale in july last year - a bid to raise money to extend northampton borough council 's museum and art gallery - was heavily criticised .
