adorable footage of a puppy husky talking back to its owner has appeared online and it âs making quite a stir
the clip features baby ramsey whining while attempting to speak , much to the delight of texan owner kayla cagnola , who holds the puppy in her arms
trying to perfect what appears to be either a howl or her skills in conversation , the dog looks down on the room and begins yapping while struggling to break free
ramsey appears to be attempting to perfect her skills in conversation by howling in a frenetic manner reacting to a howl , the puppy continues communicating frenetically before coming face to face with another dog â seemingly as baffled as anyone else as to what ramsey is trying to say
according to the huffington post , the dog was reacting to being told off after eating her roommate âs dog food
there are several theories as to how dog - human communication has evolved over the years
looking around the room , the puppy begins its high - pitched yapping while struggling to break free some believe that communicative skills of dogs arose from the social behaviours of ancestral , group - living wolves
while others believe that domesticated dogs have either evolved to mimic the behaviours of humans or that they have been selectively bred to be tame and collaborative
as for howling , dogs do this for a range of reasons including : locating other pack members , keeping strangers away , or calling the pack for hunting
the dog 's owner kayla cagnola laughs hysterically while trying to interpret what puppy ramsey is trying to say dog 's may also howl when they are suffering from separation anxiety as a way of communicating with owners and other dogs from a distance
whether these apply to ramsey â who appears to just like making high - pitched noise â however remains to be seen
