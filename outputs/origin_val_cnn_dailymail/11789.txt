a lawyer for the man accused of shooting two police officers during a protest rally outside the ferguson , missouri , police headquarters last week said on monday that his client was beaten when he was taken into custody , an allegation police called ' completely false
' williams , 20 , had bruising across his back , on both shoulders and his neck , and a welt on his head and a mark on his face , attorney jerryl christmas said , adding that he met with him for two hours on monday but could not take pictures
' he was beat up by the police , ' said christmas
' he was beaten when he was taken into custody
williams had appeared briefly in court on monday morning without counsel and did not enter a plea
he is charged with two counts of first - degree assault , a class a felony that calls for 10 - 30 years , or up to life in prison
the shooting was the latest violent incident in months of demonstrations in ferguson , a st. louis suburb , after a white police officer fatally shot unarmed black teen brown during a confrontation in august
in announcing williams 's arrest on sunday , st. louis prosecutor mcculloch told reporters williams had admitted firing the shots that wounded the officers early on thursday and told authorities he was not shooting at police
' with regard to the allegations that jeffrey williams was ' beaten ' by police , the st. louis county police department calls these allegations completely false , ' spokesman schellman said in a statement
schellman said williams was taken immediately to st. louis county police headquarters after his arrest , interviewed by detectives on video and audio , booked and evaluated by a nurse as every inmate is , to determine if he is fit to be confined
shooting : police take cover after two officers were shot while standing guard in front of the ferguson police station last thursday christmas said williams was taken into custody on a probation warrant and did not know he was being arrested until he was taken for questioning
no one responded monday at the williams address listed in court records , a one - story blue house that had trash strewn on the lawn
police had called the shooting an ' ambush ' of the officers , who were standing side by side , by a gunman embedded with protesters , but mcculloch said on sunday that williams may have been shooting at someone else
several long - time activists have said they did not recognize or know williams as a protester
' clearly this was not a police ambush and police were never the target , ' christmas said , adding : ' it could have easily been the protesters who got shot instead of the police
' the shooting of the officers followed a flurry of resignations and protests in the week after the u.s. justicedepartment released a damning report accusing ferguson of racially biased policing
wounded : in the shooting early on thursday , a 41 - year - old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound
another officer , 32 , suffered a facial wound

its police force is mostly white while two - thirds of residents are black
ferguson police chief jackson , its city manager and its municipal court judge have resigned
williams , who had been on probation for possession of stolen property , is accused of firing shots from a car just as a rally after jackson 's resignation was breaking up
demonstrations erupted into arson and looting after brown 's shooting in august and again in november when a grand jury declined to bring charges against officer darren wilson
police drew criticism for mass arrests and use of gas canisters , rubber bullets and armored vehicles in the days after brown 's shooting , a response officials said was needed to quell the unrest
a u.s. district judge on monday allowed a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by people arrested in august to continue
the lawsuit names ferguson , st. louis , the chiefs of both departments and other officers as defendants
st. louis prosecutor mcculloch said he believed the 20 - year - old suspect attended last week 's protest before the shooting happened
activists said williams was not a consistent fixture in their tight - knit group
' we 're not sure we completely buy that part of it , ' mcculloch said of williams ' contention that he did not fire at the officers
williams is charged with two counts of first - degree assault , one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action
he made a brief court appearance monday , and the case was scheduled for a later date
court officials said he did not yet have an attorney
williams ' arrest came as anti-police protesters ( pictured ) have resumed demonstrations outside ferguson police station mcculloch said there may have been other people in the vehicle with williams and that the investigation is ongoing
williams used a handgun that matches the shell casings at the scene , mcculloch said
he also said tips from the public led to the arrest
williams is being held on $ 300,000 bond
brittany ferrell , 26 , a protest leader with the group millennial activists united , had just left a meeting with other leaders sunday when word of the arrest circulated
she said no one in the group knew williams , and they checked with other frequent protesters , who also had not heard of him
ferrell suspected mcculloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement
' this is a fear tactic , ' she said
' we are very tight - knit
we know each other by face if not by name , and we 've never seen this person before
' john gaskin , a st. louis naacp leader , said of williams , ' i do n't know him
i 've never seen him
