michael carrick believes mata has always been an important player for man united after the playmaker 's double helped the red devils to a 2 - 1 win over liverpool on sunday
the little spaniard has struggled to hold down a first - team place recently but teammate michael carrick was not surprised to see his match - winning performance
â listen , all players have ups and downs throughout their careers , â said michael carrick
â you ca nât look past his quality ; that is why he is here and he is here for a reason
he is such a good player and performances like that do nât surprise me because performances like that are exactly what he is all about
mata scores a superb scissor kick during man united 's 2 - 1 win over liverpool on sunday michael carrick ( right ) insists mata has always been a valuable player for man united â he has always been a great player
i think he has always been important to us because he brings so much to the team , and so much ability
â you have seen it all there on sunday , in terms of what he brings to us and i thought he was terrific
i thought his overall play was good and he obviously scored both goals
i thought the first one was a really good finish and the second one was sensational , so he has had a good day
â he is just so clever , you know
he moves the ball , takes up good positions , he is dangerous and he is just so intelligent
he has such a slight frame so he is not going to have a physical presence but he more than makes up for that with his general ability and how he plays the game
he is just a joy to watch
â michael carrick was not surprised by mata 's match - winning performance and thought the spaniard was ' terrific ' man united had angel di maria and falcao among their substitutes at anfield , and michael carrick believes that demonstrates the depth of resources available to van gaal
he believes the dutchman could pick two completely different line - ups capable of competing at the highest level , with little to choose between the players in training games
â i think it tells you about the squad and the strength in depth , â said michael carrick
â what more can you say ? listen , those boys ( di maria and falcao ) are top players but i think we have got a number of players that the manager can choose from , which is great
â we see in training when we have games that both teams are pretty equal , when we have 11 versus 11 , because that is the strength of our squad now
a lot of players have had game time this year and that does bring options
