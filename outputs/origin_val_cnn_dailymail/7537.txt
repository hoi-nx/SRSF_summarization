michael o'neill is preparing to do battle with a familiar face on sunday , as an old friend attempts to derail northern ireland 's euro 2016 dream
finland are the opponents at windsor park , led by mixu - the man who gave michael o'neill his coaching break as his number two at cowdenbeath
the pair have already crossed paths on the international circuit , sharing an entertaining 3 - 3 friendly draw in 2012 , during michael o'neill 's early days at the helm
michael o'neill is preparing his northern ireland side to do battle with finland in euro 2016 qualifying he will be up against former assistant manager mixu ( pictured ) who is current finland boss there is a whole lot more riding on the follow - up , with northern ireland having taken nine points from a possible 12 in group f , while their opponents face a fight to stay in contention with just four points from their four fixtures
michael o'neill admits he and mixu have declined to swap advice about other teams on the road to france , but accepts the two men know each other 's style ' inside out '
' we 're similar to players , i think
when you 've played at a club with someone and then you 've worked briefly with them as a coach there 's obviously a relationship there
' but we did n't spend hours on the phone or anything up to that , so the relationship has n't changed at all
obviously we are less inclined to discuss the opposition because he probably thinks he does n't want to tell me things i perhaps do n't know and vice versa
but we both know each other inside out and how our team will play
' regardless of what happens it wo n't affect how close we are
' michael o'neill even sees a parallel between the two national sides , with both he and mixu attempting to eke the best out of a small number of top - tier players , while building a strong group in support
' i think mixu has done a great job there and his job is quite similar to mine , ' he said
' you have a limited pool of players to choose from and he has got them playing in a nice style
' there 's no doubt finland are a good team but there is a dependence there on five or six players and the team 's make - up is quite similar to mine
' christophe berra scores as northern ireland were beaten 1 - 0 by scotland in midweek manchester united defender paddy mcnair ( left ) made his debut for northern ireland in the defeat the northern ireland match - winner in recent months has been striker kyle lafferty , who scored against hungary , greece and the faroe islands before being shut out in the defeat by romania
he has had a change of scenery since then , leaving canaries for a loan spell with turkish side rizespor
part of his motivation for that unexpected move was a desire to get regular game time at centre forward , with the canaries having used him predominantly in a withdrawn role
davis , a former rangers team - mate of kyle lafferty , explained : ' he just wants to go out and get regular football , and a chance to play up front
' he 's had a few experiences in other countries so i think at the time he knew it was the time to move on
he had northern ireland in the back of his mind , he wanted to improve his football for international level too
' he 's always going to give you 100 % commitment and effort , give you everything but it 's about getting him focused
' we 've seen a focused kyle lafferty in this campaign so far and long may it continue
