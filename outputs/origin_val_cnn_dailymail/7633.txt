he may be pushing 94 , but prince duke of edinburgh âs not lost one iota of his sense of humour
watching his wife sign an empty picture mount â in which a glossy portrait of the monarch was later placed - the on - form royal remarked waspishly : â it âs not a very good likeness , is it ? â duke of edinburgh had accompanied the queen to southampton to officially name the new Â£ 473 million p&o cruises cruise liner britannia , in which the finished photograph will , eventually , hang
on being introduced to p&o cruises âs human resource director , paula porter , yesterday , he remarked : â humans are not resources ! â fortunately the executive took the off - the - cuff comment in her stride , laughing afterwards : â i thought it was a very good line
i shall be using it again
â queen , 88 , also appeared to be thoroughly enjoying herself , even tapping her feet in time to the music of the band of the royal marines as they played a merry jig before britannia âs official naming ceremony
wit : watching his wife sign an empty picture mount â in which a glossy portrait of the monarch was later placed - the on - form royal remarked waspishly : â it âs not a very good likeness , is it ? â tears of laughter : the queen chuckled during the ceremony and wiped away a tear of laughter nowadays the monarch does nât actually have to swing the bottle of bubbly â in this case a nebuchadnezzar ( 20 bottles ) of english sparkling wine from the wiston estate winery near pulborough , sussex â used to christen the boat herself
instead she discreetly presses a button and the work is done for her
the new mechanised system is nât entirely foolproof , however
when the bottle struck the side of the ship it exploded with an almighty bang , sending one hefty shard of glass speeding to within a few feet of where the queen was sitting
fortunately the forward - thinking people from p&o cruises had erected a plastic screen to protect the elderly sovereign
all the same , it was quite a moment and clearly struck a chord with the guest of honour
when the queen met a line - up of chefs later , including marco pierre white , she referred to the incident exclaiming : â it exploded ! â olly smith , britannia âs wine expert , replied : â it did , did nât it , maâam ? spectacularly ' round of applause : the queen cheers during the naming ceremony for britannia having a chat : the queen enjoys a chat during the naming ceremony for britannia round of applause : the queen claps as the sixth cruise ship she has sponsored is officially named enjoying the sunshine : a dapper duke of edinburgh appeared to be enjoying his day in southampton is that you dear ? the duke of edinburgh flips through the programme and stops at a picture of the queen thankfully , however , some traditions have nât gone by the wayside
â god bless her and all who sail in her , â the sovereign also said
surprisingly , buckingham palace confirmed yesterday , the queen has only named four civilian ships previously ( the qe2 in 1967 , oriana in 1995 , queen mary 2 in 2004 and queen elizabeth in 2010 , with the britannia as the fifth )
but the monarch appeared to be thoroughly enjoying herself , chatting nineteen to the dozen with other vip guests as she toured the vessel
she was heard telling tv chef james martin , one of a number of celebrity chefs who will be offering classes for passengers : â the first time i ever saw white bread was on board the old queen elizabeth
â the ship , which cost its owners Â£ 473m to build , is the third p&o cruises ship to be named britannia but is easily the largest of the trio , with 15 passenger decks , 13 restaurants and four pools on - board
britannia was also the name of the queen 's much - loved royal yacht which was decommissioned in 1997 under the orders of then prime minister tony blair
berthed in edinburgh 's port of leith , the ship is now a static tourist attraction but sailed more than 1,000,000 miles during its 40 years in royal service
the new britannia is expected to rack up a similar number of miles during its own career , although unlike the queen 's yacht , it will host tourists rather than dignitaries
today , however , dignitaries were the order of the day for the new britannia , with the queen and the duke of edinburgh shown around the new ship by a large group of them
is n't it magnificent ? the duke of edinburgh and the queen appear to be sharing their observations of the ship ready to launch : the queen presses the button that will launch a bottle of fizz against the ship smashing ! the queen smashes a bottle of Â£ 24.95 english sparkling wine against the ship job done ! the bottle of english sparkling wine smashes into hundreds of pieces celebration : red white and blue confetti rains down on the queen after the bottle is smashed sponsor : the queen is all smiles as she becomes godmother to p&o cruises ' ship britannia magnificent : britannia is the newest p&o cruises ship and can carry up to 3,600 people gargantuan : the vessel also boasts 15 passenger decks , 13 restaurants and four swimming pools the queen is no stranger to cruise ships in any case , having become godmother to no fewer than five - now six , including britannia
first of the liners launched by the queen was cunard 's qe2 , which was christened in 1967 and made her maiden voyage in 1969
now permanently moored in dubai after retiring in 2008 , its owners plan to turn it into a floating luxury hotel , although plans for the conversion are currently stalled
other vessels launched by the queen include the oriana in 1995 , the queen mary 2 in 2004 and queen elizabeth , another cunard ship , in 2010
well - wishers : the queen was joined by darcy bussell , anneka rice and hairdresser nicky clarke supporter : chef marco pierre white at the event

the same year saw the kate become a ship 's godmother for the first time , with the royal , who was making her last public appearance before the birth of prince george , invited to christen princess cruises ' royal princess
