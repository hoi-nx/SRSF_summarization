campbell , who has anger management issues , injured the infant by his rough handling of it , a court heard a man who broke a baby 's arm and leg through ' reckless cruelty ' has been spared jail
doctors said the infant 's broken leg may have been caused by campbell ' yanking ' it out of its cot , while its broken arm appeared to be the result of a ' forceful rapid rotation injury '
but campbell , who has anger management issues , denied yanking the baby , telling the court he had lifted it out its cot by its arms
at court , the 20 - year - old pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of ' reckless rough handling '
he was allowed to walk free from court after he was handed a suspended sentence
michael hodson , prosecuting , said : ' the crown are opening the case on the basis of rough handling and reckless behaviour
' the crown say there was not deliberate pulling in order to hurt the child , but an impatience to get the child to do what the defendant ignorantly thought the child ought to be able to bear
' it 's clear the defendant has a short fuse and can be an angry individual who has a problem with his temper , especially when drunk
' when he was told about the injuries he became very silent and dropped his head
' court court heard how the baby was taken to hospital because it 's right arm was not moving freely and x-rays discovered fractures to the arm and leg
campbell from south shields , who admitted child cruelty , was given an eight - month prison sentence , suspended for 18 months , with supervision and 150 hours of unpaid work
judge robert adams told campbell : ' you accept you were too rough
the child suffered two separate fractures
' i accept that you bitterly regret this , it is clear from your letter
you were 19 at the time , you are now 20 , have clearly grown up and are determined to put this behind you
but the 20 - year - old denied yanking the baby 's leg at newcastle crown court ( pictured ) and pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of ' reckless rough handling ' ' i do n't consider you are a dangerous offender and sending you to immediate custody is going to achieve very little in this case
' katherine dunn , defending , said : ' he is a 20 - year - old man who is young , immature and naive
' the injuries were caused when he was roughly handling the child
he has learned a very harsh lesson indeed
