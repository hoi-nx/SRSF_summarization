hollywood actor freeman is today unveiled by labour as the first big celebrity endorsement of the election campaign
the star of the hobbit , sherlock and the office is to appear in a party political broadcast in which he contrasts the ' choice ' between labour and the tories
but in a surprise move , the video lasting almost three minutes has no mention of labour 's leader ed miliband
in the video , due to be aired on television tomorrow night , he appears against a white backdrop talking directly to the camera about the choice the country faces on may 7
' now we are in the run - up to a general election and over that time you 're going to hear loads of claims from people on the left , on the right , all over the place
i ' it 's going to drive you mad
it 'll probably drive me mad but do n't switch off yet , ' he says
the 44 - year - old says the election will focus on a ' choice about what kind of country we want to live in '
he adds : ' i do n't know about you , but my values are about community , compassion , decency ; that 's how i was brought up
' he claims the tories will take the country on a ' rollercoaster of cuts ' while labour will ' make sure the economy works for all of us , not just the privileged few , like me , but it 's not just about that '
the 44 - year - old says the election will focus on a ' choice about what kind of country we want to live in ' labour leader ed miliband is not mentioned in the broadcast , as polls suggest the labour is more popular than its leader not every celebrity has been supportive of ed miliband 's labour , not least his plans to impose a levy on homes worth Â£ 2million
singer singer on labour 's mansion tax : ' when you do look at the people who are going to be suffering this tax , it 's true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long , long time
' actor maureen lipman : ' the chuka harman burnham hunt balls brigade ? i ca n't , in all seriousness , go into a booth and put my mark on any one of them
for the first time in five decades , i shall not be voting labour
' presenters ant and dec on labour and ed miliband : ant mcpartlin : i feel we 're both staunchly labour and would vote labour if we could , but i do n't know what their philosophy is any more
' declan donnelly : ' i 'm not sure i could picture him [ ed miliband ] as prime minister
' singer cheryl fernandez-versini : said the mansion tax would ' f * * * me over ' , adding : ' i 've always been labour all my life but i want to hear what they 've got to say for myself
' presenter bill oddie : ' i hereby confess that i am one of the mansion owning north london set that are apparently staunch labour
' the actor claims the tories ' do n't believe in the nhs ' and ' have got sod all to offer the young '
' but , real though all that stuff is and important though it is if you 're young in this country , or broke in this country , or if you 're unwell in this country - and let 's face it we all need the nhs at some point - or if you are just plain working hard and finding life tough , there is a choice of two parts
' the bottom line is what values are we choosing , because in the end this choice we make really does matter
' freeman claims labour ' start from the right place - community , compassion , fairness - i think all the best things about this country '
' i love this country so much and i love the people in it , and i think you do too , but really , for me , there 's only one choice ; and i choose labour
' but mr ed miliband does not get a mention , perhaps an acknowledgement of polling which shows labour is more popular than its leader
conservative mp nigel adams said : ' labour is trying to whitewash ed miliband from their campaign - his mps do n't want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast does n't even mention him
' he 's a weak leader who does n't have the confidence of his party
just imagine the chaos he would cause for uk
' a new comres poll for the daily mail shows 1 in 5 labour voters think david cameron would make a better prime minister than mr ed miliband
overall , 41 per cent of people would prefer a labour - led government compared to 42 per cent who would like a conservative - led administration
the survey puts the tories four points ahead of labour on 36 per cent to 32 per cent , with ukip on 12 per cent and lib dems 9 per cent
