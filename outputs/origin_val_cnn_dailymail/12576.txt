the country 's largest presbyterian denomination has changed its definition of marriage to include gay couples -- though not explicitly
presbyterian church ( usa ) approved an amendment to its constitution after most of its 171 presbyteries -- or governing bodies -- voted for it , pc ( usa ) said tuesday
before , the definition said marriage was between " a man and a woman
" the new definition says , in part , that " marriage involves a unique commitment between two people , traditionally a man and a woman , to love and support each other for the rest of their lives
" already , pc ( usa ) ministers can perform same - sex marriages in states where such marriages are legal , the group said
but no teaching elder or session can be forced to conduct same - sex marriage ceremonies if they do not believe they are appropriate
not all members supported the decision
in a post on pc ( usa ) 's website , jean and robert gorney accused the church of going against the bible and threatened to leave
" we are not to change the bible , " their post said
" i do n't care who disagrees
" but the covenant network of presbyterians , which says it supports " a fully inclusive church , " welcomed the news tuesday night
" the change aligns the church 's constitution with a reality that has long been true : both same - gender and opposite - gender couples have been living in relationships that demonstrate covenant faithfulness , shared discipleship and mutual love , " the group said
" we are also aware that the discussion has been a difficult one for many , and that some will feel a deep sense of pain over this decision
the covenant network is committed to fostering healthy dialogue and working with those who hold a view different from ours , seeking opportunities for us to model an authentic and productive unity
" the amendment will take effect on june 21
