if you want the memory of your loved ones or family pets to live on you can now immortalise them as a tree
a barcelona firm has designed a biodegradable urn that is planted in the ground and can be used to grow ash , oak , beech or gingko trees
the environmentally - friendly vessel contains the seed of a tree in the top half that germinates before the roots grow through the section containing the ashes in the lower half
it said it wanted to create something that changed the way people saw death , instead of it being ' the end of life ' it would become a ' return to life ' the bios urn have been developed by barcelona - based moline and his brother roger at design studio estudimoline

relatives or pet owners begin by choosing what kind of tree they want , and seeds currently available include pine , gingko , maple , oak , ash and beech
the ashes are placed inside the urn and the seed is mixed with soil in the top capsule
the urn is then buried in the ground and starts to biodegrade when the roots are strong enough to come into contact with the ashes
mr moline said it needs the same care as a standard tree , so needs to be planted somewhere with proper soil humidity and at least three hours of sunlight a day

bios urn can be used with any ashes and will keep ' indefinitely ' bios urn can be used with any ashes and will keep ' indefinitely ' meaning people can buy them ahead of their death , for example
equally , it can be used with ash saved from another urn if a person has already been cremated
a bios urn costs $ 145 ( Â£ 98 ) plus shipping costs and the box comes with everything needed to plant it
the company said : ' bios urn offers a smart , sustainable and ecologically friendly way to approach what 's probably one of the most important moments in human life

called the urban death project , it proposes corpses are placed into a giant tower ( illustrated ) by families and left to decompose
the body would be laid in a mixture of woodchips and sawdust a similar project being developed in seattle plans to turn corpses into compost and used as plant food
called the urban death project , it proposes corpses are placed into a giant tower by families and left to decompose
after six weeks , their body will have broken down into compost
the body would be laid in a mixture of woodchips and sawdust in a three - storey tower
it would then decompose and turns into a nutrient - rich compost , which is removed from the bottom of the tower
' the intent is to offer users an alternative for remembering deceased people or pets in a natural , sustainable fashion
it is innovative , useful and discreet
