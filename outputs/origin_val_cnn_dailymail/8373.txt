they say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and that was certainly true of lingerie tycoon michelle following the breakdown of her 22 - year marriage
the mother - of - three revealed in her autobiography how she was furious to discover her husband , michael , was seeing her old friend and colleague samantha bunn following their split
michelle , 43 , was suspicious that the pair had started their relationship before she and michael separated - but this is an allegation he has always denied
and matters were not helped by the fact she continued to share her six - bedroom mansion in an affluent area of scotland with her ex for eight months after they agreed to separate
during this time , michelle waged war against the father of her children , damaging his prized porsche , cutting up his clothes and putting laxatives in his coffee
but now years later and in a much happier place , michelle admits she regrets her acts of childish revenge
' when i found out about my ex employee and ex husband it was my way of getting the hurt out for 18 months , ' she said on today 's this morning
the lingerie tycoon told this morning presenters eamonn holmes and ruth langsford that married couples who work together - like they do - should set ground rules to stop work going home with them michelle split with husband michael , the father of her three children , in 2011 ' i was so bitter , it was so out of character , i am not like that
i really regret it but every day is a school day and every day we learn and get stronger
' i did do things i regret , like smashing up his car
' the ultimo founder told presenters eamonn holmes and ruth langsford on the itv show that she wishes she had thought about the effect her behaviour was having on their children , who were then aged 12 , 15 and 19
she said : ' we lived together for eight months after the break up and i do feel bad for putting the kids through that
i was drinking heavily and just thinking about me
i was n't thinking about how my behaviour effected my kids
' michelle admitted she flew into a rage when she discovered her ex husband had started a new relationship with samantha bunn , left , who had once been her friend and ultimo head of design michelle admitted that she is now off the booze and has n't had a drink since december 31
after fighting for control of ultimo from her former business partner husband ( who went on to set up a rival lingerie company with samantha bunn ) , she has since sold 80 per cent of ultimo and is no longer the chief executive
she said she prefers to do motivational speaking and advises couples to learn from her mistakes when it comes to working with a loved one
she said : ' if you are going to work with your partner , you have to have set of up ground rules , do n't talk about phoning the bank when you 're in bed together on a friday evening
' if you take business home with you , you will get a divorce or the business will go bust
' michelle , who grew up in poverty in the east end of glasgow , married michael when she was 18 after she fell pregnant with their first child
the couple launched ultimo together in 1999 after setting up their company mjm international in 1996
but michelle admits the stress of making their business venture a success took its toll on their relationship
she wrote in her autobiography , my fight to the top , published by blink yesterday : ' going to work became like walking through a minefield , our boardroom meetings constantly interrupted by one or other of us storming out , and the arguments continued at home where our sex life was virtually non-existent
' after calling time on their relationship in 2011 , the couple said in a statement on their separation that ' no other parties had been involved and the split was amicable
' the mother - of - three , pictured modelling for ultimo , is no longer as involved in the brand she founded however , things soon turned sour when michelle discovered her husband had moved on with samantha bunn , who had been the head of design at ultimo and had lived in a guest annex next to their mansion
michelle explains in her book how she discovered michael and samantha bunn were together after hiring a private detective who gave her pictures of them kissing
michelle said it was finding out about their relationship that tipped her over the edge
she writes : ' deep down i knew my marriage had been over for years , but i still felt indescribable pain
my knees buckled and i fell to the ground crying
' my grief turned to anger
after texting michael to tell him that he had been caught red - handed , i grabbed a knife and went to town on his beloved porsche , scratching it to shreds
' then i charged round to the guesthouse where sam was living - thanks to the kindness which she had betrayed - and threw all of her possessions into the garden , the dressing table along with them
i was like a banshee
' michelle , pictured this week , said she feels in good health having not drank alcohol since 31 december she added that she continued to terrorise her ex for the following months they continued to live together
' i put his favourite shirts and cufflinks in the bin
i let down his car tyres
i cut holes in all his boxer shorts
i put laxatives in his coffee on the day that he and sam were going to a wedding - god only knows if that worked , ' she writes
' on the day i moved out to a hotel i crept up to the master bedroom , pulled back the luxurious throw and threw a bucket of cold water over his side of the bed before replacing the covers
' but now she realises that she made a mistake in treating him this way and wishes she had behaved differently
now she 's moved on to live in her own place , stepped back from ultimo and taken on a role as a motivation speaker , she wants to help other people be strong through adversity
' if you do n't love yourself , that 's where the problems begin , ' she advised on this morning .
