watch # one2eleven every friday evening on the fantasy football club , sky sports 1 or catch up on demand
paul ince ( centre ) picks his best 11 he played with and included david beckham ( left ) and paul gascoigne goalkeeper : peter schmeichel has to be ' big pete
' what a fantastic goalkeeper , i played with david seaman and he was a very good goalkeeper but for me peter schmeichel was another level
just the fact that , one on one 's , normally when somebody goes through on the goalkeeper you just pray that they 're going to save it but you just knew peter schmeichel was going to save it , so we 'd always set up a counter-attack because we knew he would
he could also throw the ball as far as he could kick it and the amount of times we would get get corners against us , he 'd pluck it and release it to ryan giggs and kanchelskis and we 'd score goals
best goalkeeper in the world during his time
right back : javier zanetti he is a great player
zanetti joined inter the same time as me and he was just awesome
he was just a young kid but he just slotted into the way we played
the reason i put him in ahead of gary neville is because javier can play in different positions and i always want players who can be flexible and what ever position he played in - he was world class
men - of - men
in our england team we were all men , we were all big characters and big men but he was men - of - men
he was a leader and he inspired people around him
people say he was n't the best passer but he was n't that bad
his volley against everton showed he could play
he was n't the quickest but his timing of tackling
he was a brilliant organiser , he 's top draw
peter schmeichel was labelled as the best goalkeeper in the world by former team - mate paul ince gary pallister ( right ) played with paul ince at united and was picked in his fantasy football club squad central defender : gary pallister very unlucky to not play for england more
laziest man you 'll ever meet in football , if you did running he 'd be at the back , when you finished training he 'd be the first out of the door
i used to go round his house and he 'd be playing on his playstation eating malteasers
but when it came to playing football you would never see anyone go past him , you 'd never see anyone beat him and he had telescopic legs , he was quick and he could play
the only negative is that he should have scored more goals but what a player
left back : roberto carlos when i first met him at inter , i thought wow
firstly , i could n't believe how big his legs were , you can see that in the way he plays and strikes a ball
he had great pace up and down the line , he could tackle , score and he was an incredible player
the only thing that disappointed me was that roy hodgson let him go to real madrid a little bit early
right wing : david beckham an easy decision
david beckham was the true professional , he was probably the best technical player i played with
i used to watch him and watch him
as soon as we 'd finished [ training ] , the mannequins would be out and he 'd be taking free - kicks , corners and he 'd do it for an hour
every training session he 'd give 110 per cent , he would never beat anybody but if you give him a yard , he 'll put in the best balls you 'll ever see
paul ince described david beckham as the best technical player he played with during his footballing career midfielder : roy keane for a complete player , without a doubt keano
apart from the bad side he had , he was the complete midfield player for me
he was an inspiration , a leader , could score you vital goals , he could tackle when he had too , he would be naughty when he had too but playing alongside him for three or four seasons helped him improve my game a lot
midfielder : paul gascoigne probably the best player i played with
what more can i say ? he 's a maverick , he just had everything
he was n't the quickest but he had that little injection of pace to get away from people and i remember seeing gazza play for the first time at upton park and he was telling billy bonds to keep up
he 's brilliant , scores all types of goals and without doubt the best player i played alongside
paul gascoigne was highly praised by paul ince and claims the former newcastle man was the best he played with left wing : ryan giggs he would play 20 games and be unplayable , he was that good
if you 're a full back and think get tight - then he 'll spin inside , he you drop off then he will rip you apart
outstanding player , what he 's done in the game , his mindset when he played in centre midfielder for united for two or three years says it all
the best left winger there will ever be
striker : eric cantona could n't leave him out
when eric cantona did come to united i knew that we 'd win the title because he just had the aura and presence about him
he took the responsibility away from all of us lot
he was unbelievable , he 'd come in at half past nine every morning , do his own warm - up and work on his skills , touch and his x , y and z. he was just brilliant
his goals and importance to the team make him an unbelievable player
striker : alan shearer when i think about a complete striker and what i 'd want as a manager as my striker is alan shearer
it 's not just the goals he scored , he was a handful , he could run the channels , his retention of the ball was fantastic and he was a leader of men
i do n't think we 'll have a striker in that mould again
eric cantona ( left ) and alan shearer are two of the best strikers the premier league has seen paul ince shows how his fantasy football club xi ( with nicknames ) would line up on the pitch
