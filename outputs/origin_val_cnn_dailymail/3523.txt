it is believed that dino maglio had told one alleged victim he closed his profile because he had so many positive reviews he had to open a new one
the irpi ( irpo ) , which carried out a year - long investigation , said that 14 testimonies collected revealed a man who seemed like a fun and fast - living host
some claim he would constantly compliment them and insist they drink while they were out together and on the first or second night say they were served drinks of tea or wine
they did not report feeling unsafe as they were not travelling alone but in separate incidents from march 2013 until march 2014 , the women recalled feeling suddenly ' woozy and intensely tired '
dino maglio has admitted spiking a drink of baileys liqueur belonging to the 16 - year - old with a sedative , and when asked why he told police : ' i am stupid , there was no real reason '
he told investigators the sex was consensual and that he had joined couchsurfing to improve his english , as he believed it would help further his career
