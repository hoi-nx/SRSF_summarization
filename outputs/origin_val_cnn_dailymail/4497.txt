nancie atwell from the center for teaching and learning , maine , received the global teacher prize from former president bill clinton during a presentation ceremony in dubai on sunday
the 63 - year - old mother - of - one , who began teaching in new york in 1973 , was selected over nine other finalists - including three compatriots from the united states
the writing teacher told the daily mail online she plans to celebrate when she returns , but is more interested in getting back to her children at the center for teaching and learning
after accepting the award , she thanked her colleagues and said : ' i love my teaching life - the intellectual , social , and personal challenges of working with young people and the satisfaction of developing methods that transform their lives and give them perspective on the lives of others
i am grateful to the global teacher prize for shining a light on teaching as a powerful profession , one of fulfillment , creativity , and lasting worth
' during an interview last week , nancie atwell said she 's ' convinced that teaching language arts is one of the great careers ' , because it 's ' demanding ' , but also ' meaning - filled ' and ' interesting '
nancie atwell , 63 , began teaching in 1973 she said : ' i get to demonstrate what is possible , teach what is useful , establish conditions that invite engagement , support the hard work of literary reading and writing , and enjoy the kinds of relationships with adolescents that drew me to education in the first place
' because my students select the books they read and the subjects they write about , i 'm able to help them discover what reading and writing are good for , here and now and in their literate lives to come
' there is nothing more important than putting the right book in a child 's hands at the right time
' nancie atwell founded the center for teaching and learning in 1990 , which uses experimental teaching methods on students in kindergarten through eighth grade
she built an ' excellent classroom library ' , in hopes of letting her own students discover what they wanted to read on their own
' i worry that educational bureaucrats have a problem with pleasure , ' she told usa today , ' that if kids are enjoying what they 're doing , it ca n't be rigorous or worthwhile
' the other united states finalists volain and and ritz
volain said when she heard about the $ 1million prize , she told herself , ' forget it
there are all of these teachers who are presenting internationally and doing big , big things '
but her own colleagues were inspired by volain and her desire to have her students take part in lab work and go outside
she has spread her environmental education knowledge into as many classrooms as she can
' i love teaching , and teaching science , because it allows me to learn and work along with my students , ' she said
ritz , 52 , is an elementary school teacher in new york 's south bronx area
he created a low - cost and portable gardening and nutrition program which led him and his students to install more than 100 gardens throughout new york to help families that have limited access to fresh produce ' it 's the shared experience that is so meaningful to me
science is curiosity based - finding out why - with eyes , hands and mind
science is collaborative , science communicates , and science is just so cool
' ritz , who calls himself the ' chief eternal optimist ' of bronx county , was originally a high school special education teacher but moved into urban gardening after the september 11 attacks
he and his students planted 15,000 daffodil bulbs across the city and now his gardening program grows 37 different vegetables , fruits and herbs
with a goal of sending students home with 100 bags of produce every week , he has established a food production business that focuses on maintaining ' food security ' for families in neighborhoods that have limited access for fresh produce
he is currently converting a library at public school 55 into a 2,000 - square - food greenhouse and library
' i love teaching because every day i get to do something great
every day i get to lead children and colleagues on a new quest , we get to do something new , we practice , we dream , we learn and we work together , ' he said about his program
' i 'm also the oldest sixth grader you 'll ever meet ; inherently , i too am very curious and easily excited - it 's a perfect storm , ' he added
the top ten finalists were chosen from 50 shortlisted candidates that came from a pool of more than 5,000 nominations from 127 countries including the united states , uk , italy , kenya , uganda , india , afghanistan , australia , argentina , mexico and jordan

sunny varkey , founder of the global teacher prize and the global teacher prize , said : ' i want to congratulate nancie atwell for being the very first recipient of the global teacher prize
your incredible story will shine a light on the tireless work that teachers do all over the world
' we all need to find ways of collectively celebrating teachers , of saying to a celebrity - obsessed world that teachers are important and worthy of respect
' right now we need teachers more than ever
we need great teachers to grow great minds or we will never tackle the problems facing the world , from global poverty to climate change
' of course , more will be needed than the global teacher prize to raise the status of the profession worldwide
but my hope is that it starts many conversations around the world about the role of teachers - from families around the dinner table and teenagers on social media to education ministries around the world
