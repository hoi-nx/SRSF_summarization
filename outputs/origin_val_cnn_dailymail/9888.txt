hart is not getting carried away with his current form and admits he could be the â worst goalkeeper in the world again â by the next game
the 27 - year - old put in a world class performance when manchester city played barcelona in the champions league and pulled off a string of saves to keep his side in the game
even though he was unable to prevent them being knocked out , the barcelona players queued up to praise hart afterwards
hart is refusing to get caught up in his own hype despite showing excellent form with his club of late manchester city goalkeeper hart makes a save during training at st george 's park with the england squad hart drew praise from messi , andres iniesta and luis enrique despite manchester city 's european exit messi said : â he was phenomenal , he stopped everything
we have to congratulate him on a great game because he 's a fantastic goalkeeper
â andres iniesta added : â hart was key to keeping them in it and was great in one - on - one situations
â barcelona head coach luis enrique also said : â the score could have been a rout but hart was incredible
â it is in stark contrast to the beginning of the season when hart was dropped by city manager manuel pellegrini and replaced by willy caballero , but he has fought his way back
â i have always been aware that for all the good stuff , i could be the worst keeper in the world again in one game âs time , â hart said
â i do nât get too wrapped up in good stuff or bad stuff
i just focus on my game and keep working hard
â the english keeper says that ' for all the good stuff ' that he showed in barcelona , his form could easily dip messi tries to find a way past hart but despite a dominant performance barcelona were restricted to a single goal neymar attempts to nip the ball away from hart 's clutches at the nou camp but again is denied hart will reach a half - century of caps if he plays against lithuania and italy in england âs next two games
to put that into context , peter shilton , england âs record cap holder with 125 , was 31 years old by the time he reached that landmark
hart added : â i am honoured to play every single game i have done for england and for it to be 48 so far is fantastic but i just want to keep playing
there are plenty of other english goalkeepers who want to do the same and i am fully aware of that
i have got a lot of hard work to do to keep my place and i am willing to do that
â will caballero took over the manchester city no 1 spot from hart briefly for a spell earlier this season at the etihad peter shilton was 31 when he won his 50th england cap , while hart could win his against italy next week
