it is a case with chilling similarities to the washington sniper attacks of 2002 when muhammad and malvo killed ten people from a hidden firing spot in the back of their blue chevrolet sedan
but this time county chief timothy altomare said everyone was ' alive and well '
he said : ' most of us here probably , in some way , shape or form , are aware of the events 15 years ago with the washington sniper case
' as soon as we started to hear about the possibility of this stuff being linked , we kicked every effort we had into overdrive
' the back - to - back shootings in maryland on tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 when a sniper , muhammad ( left ) and his 17 - year - old accomplice malvo ( right ) , terrorized the washington area in a series of seemingly random shootings back - to - back shootings in maryland on tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 when a sniper terrorized the washington area in a series of seemingly random shootings
ten people were killed and three injured in the october 14 shootings , which authorities eventually connected to two perpetrators working in tandem
muhammad and his 17 - year - old accomplice malvo started their spree in february 2002 , with murders in alabama , arizona , california , florida , georgia , louisiana , texas and washington state
the cross-country spree resulted in the deaths of seven people and left seven injured
it was only in october that they began to target the virginia and maryland areas immediately surrounding dc - earning the name the beltway sniper attacks
the attacks left washington residents afraid to leave their houses for weeks
people would be shot at random and from a distance , so were never confronted with the attacker
but muhammad apparently grew tired of the anonymity and started leaving behind objects at the crimes scenes including a tarot card inscribed with the phrase ' call me god '
muhammad and malvo 's reign of terror was finally brought to an end on october 24 when they were found sleeping in a car in myersville , maryland and taken into custody
the following september , muhammad went on trial for his crimes and was sentenced to death
his accomplice malvo testified at his trial saying the two planned to shoot six people a day for 30 days - though that plan failed
when malvo went on trial , his attorneys painted him as being under the influence of muhammad and therefore not as equal a partner in their crimes , which is perhaps the reason he received a lesser sentence of life in prison without parole
muhammad was executed by lethal injection on november 10 , 2009 .
