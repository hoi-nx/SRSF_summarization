despite a promising league position and a place in the champions league a real possibility , manchester united appear to have had a solid season - but their misfiring strikers continue to be a hot topic
louis van gaal is coming under increasing scrutiny but the lack of goals being scored by his forwards is a worry - with talk of manchester united deciding not to sign falcao on a permanent transfer due to his less than impressive performances
club legend yorke formed a formidable partnership with andy cole during their years at the red devils and he feels that their current crop of creative players need to start providing the forwards with the same quality and style he had at old trafford
yorke scored an impressive 48 goals in 96 games for manchester united and sir alex ferguson speaking to the sunday mirror he said : ' i 'm sure it 's only a matter of time before things click , but as strikers you also need the players behind you to make it happen
for me and ( andrew ) coley , we were blessed , as we had the likes of david beckham , ryan giggs and paul scholes providing the ammunition
it was dead easy for us , we just had to put the ball in the net
they were magical times and we had many magical moments
' hopefully the same thing can happen again for this manchester united side
' andy cole and yorke were formidable but had david beckham , paul scholes and ryan giggs providing them rooney is the clubs current top - scorer with 11 goals in all competitions , with the england captain also being asked to drop into midfield in the past couple of months
with robin van persie recently suffering an injury , yorke feels that rooney and falcao could be the pairing to set old trafford alight again
he said : ' manchester united have world class strikers in the likes of rooney , robin van persie and falcao , but they do n't seem to have found the ideal combination
rooney is the clubs top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions despite playing recently in midfield falcao has failed to impress at manchester united and was hauled off against preston in the fa cup ' rooney and van persie as a pairing has n't really clicked , so maybe a rooney - falcao combo might provide the answer for manchester united long - term
' the former trinidad and tobago international was also keen to pass on some words of wisdom to van gaal and the manchester united players with a place at wembley just one win away
' go out and express yourselves ! ' robin van persie has found it hard to click with rooney and has struggled since his blistering first season
