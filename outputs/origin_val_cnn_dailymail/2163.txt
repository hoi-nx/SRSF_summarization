a mother - of - one has argued that parents should be doing more to teach their children about sex following the news that pupils as young as 11 will be taught the difference between rape and consensual sex in schools
education secretary nicky morgan said the proposed lessons ( which schools and parents can choose to opt in to ) will better prepare pupils for life in modern britain
the question over whether such lessons are appropriate led to a heated debate on today 's this morning as two women appeared to share their opposing views
rather , she believes parents should be taking much more responsibility
she said : ' i think it 's entirely inappropriate the kind of conversations we are allowing strangers to have with our children
if anybody needs to be having sex education lessons it 's parents
' children are becoming sexualised earlier and there is plenty a parent can do
first of all , start parenting again
parents have handed their children over to computers and smart phones to raise them
they have taken their foot off the pedal and that is the issue
' children are seeing " pop porn " from rihanna and nicki minaj and we need to be telling children in schools - if anything at all about sex education - that 's it 's about relationships and respecting yourself
anna williamson , 33 , a childline counsellor , believes it 's never too early for children to talk about sex ' we are thrusting them into this sexualised world when we do n't need to
' she added on the issue of teaching the difference between rape and consensual sex in schools : ' we should not be normalising this for children
i am an open - minded mum and i sexually educated my daughter because i am the safest person to do it
' however , tv presenter anna williamson , 33 , from london , who is a childline counsellor , said she believes it 's never too early for children to talk about sex education
she said : ' the key word about this is age appropriate
it 's not about storming into a classroom and giving children a barrage of information that as adults we find difficult to take in
' it 's gently starting that conversation and getting schools on board and parents taking responsibility too so it 's a three way conversation
' we know at childline that there is a deficit ( in sex education ) between the ages of six and 11 so these children do n't have the tools and the know how - or where to ask for help - or to know what is wrong
' she said that having a proper syllabus is vital to keep children safe and to stop them being misinformed and then spreading myths about sex in the playground
under nicky morgan 's proposal , pupils are to be taught from the age of 11 about the difference between rape and consensual sex
the two women debated the issue raised by education secretary nicky morgan with tv presenters phillip schofield and amanda holden the lessons , which could come in as soon as after the easter holidays , will be based on a series of resources being developed by the pshe association
writing in the sunday times to mark international women 's day , the conservative mp said : ' we have to face the fact that many pressures girls face today were unimaginable to my generation and it 's our duty to ensure that our daughters leave school able to navigate the challenges and choices they 'll face in adulthood
' our commitment to supporting women should start long before they take home their first wage
we have to ensure that the education girls receive not only allows them to reach their academic potential , but also prepares them for life in modern britain
' the recommended materials , which she has stressed will be age appropriate , are aimed at giving teachers more confidence and better guidance to teach difficult subjects
the sex education lessons will be based on a series of resources being developed by the pshe association nicky morgan has said ' it 's our duty to ensure that our daughters leave school able to navigate the challenges and choices they 'll face in adulthood ' thousands of this morning viewers took to the show 's facebook page to join in the debate
carla pointing said she agreed with anna williamson 's points and welcomes the move to change sex education in schools
she wrote : ' think that 's a great idea
in an ideal world it would n't have to happen at all but it 's good to educate children on the difference and make them aware in an age appropriate way
' i 'd be more than happy for my child to be taught about this at school
' toni greenacre also believes it 's a good idea
she said : ' they should be taught that anything under the age of 16 is wrong too
if they do n't know , then how will they speak out about it ? ' but samantha roythorne thinks 11 is too young for children to be taught about rape
she said : ' 11 - year - olds should not know what sex is
you can protect your children from horrible people without going into detail
' i would be mortified if my daughter found out what sex was at that age ! sex is for adults not children ! ' leanne marie christie agreed saying she thinks the proposal takes away childhood innocence
she said : ' how can an 11 - year - old process the feelings and emotions that go along with this conversation , we moan about the state our country is in yet we give children responsibilities and emotions they ca n't deal with and wonder why they are stressed , self harming and having mental health problems it 's ridiculous ! they are only children for a short time lets let them be innocent !
