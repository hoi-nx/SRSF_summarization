mother nature is nothing if not unpredictable
by this time last year , she had painted the country in an array of spring colours
this year , however , experts reckon she âs running two weeks behind â the evidence of which can be seen in these pictures
the good news is , all that could change this weekend as the sun comes out and temperatures leap into the 60s
riot of colour : chloe palmer and baby jayden enjoying daffodils in bloom in bournemouth , dorset in march 2014 waiting game : jennifer campbell-ross and her son archie are pictured at the same spot yesterday with the daffodils yet to flower bloomin ' lovely : a cherry tree at cambridge in march 2014 is pictured left while the same tree was still waiting to shine yesterday ( right ) twelve months ago flowers were already in full bloom , blossom was on the trees and wildlife was coming out of hibernation
but last month âs bitter cold snap has slowed things down this year
the contrast was noticed at the royal horticultural society âs garden at wisley , surrey
last year the ground was already clothed in bright yellow and purple crocuses after a mild winter
this year only a few flowers poke their heads above the ground
colin crosbie , curator at wisley , said : â we think we are probably about two weeks behind where we were last year
it has been a colder winter , the soil has been cooler and it has slowed everything down
but a few days of sunshine is all it could take for it to catch up

their volunteers have recorded only half the number of ladybirds they saw in march 2014
the average temperature in england for december , january and february this year was 4.4c â well below last year âs 5.8c
but that could all change in the next few days
thermometers could nudge past 17c ( 63f ) on saturday as a tropical mass of air arrives from the caribbean
national trust wildlife specialist matthew oates said the slower spring is positive for many species , which need time to hibernate properly before they emerge
if butterflies , and small mammals awake too early , they tend to suffer later if the weather turns cold again
the spring flowers at the royal horticultural society 's garden at wisley in surrey were already putting on an impressive display by late februay last year in late febraury this year , there were fewer flowers on display on the same patch of land at the royal horticultural society âs garden at wisley , surrey meanwhile , england is set to be hotter than athens , corfu and istanbul this weekend as temperatures are expected to soar as high as 16c in a bumper start to spring
temperatures are set to increase as the week goes on and eventually peak on saturday , where parts of the country are forecast to be warmer than many mediterranean holiday spots
much of the country has today seen a bright and sunny day as spring finally arrived , with tomorrow expected to be a dry , but cloudier day , with temperatures rising to 12c
the fine weather will continue in the south on friday , but scotland will see rain in the west and gale force gusts of up to 60mph in the north west
the weekend is set to be dry , with bright spells in south and south east england , with temperatures rising to 15c and possibly 16c in sheltered spots , but the rain will continue in western scotland
sunday will be slightly cooler , but another dry day with a good amount of sunny spells
there may be light showers in england and welsh later in the afternoon
' the temperatures will get warmer as the week goes on , ' said dan williams , of the met office
the sun rises across the north sea this morning at the start of a bright and mild day in south shields in a sign of things to come , this stunning spring sunset was last night captured over poole harbour in dorset a group punt down the river cam in cambridge in what is forecast to be the start of a run of spring weather ' by saturday we could see temperatures of 14c or 15c and maybe even 16c in a sheltered location in london or the south east

meanwhile , the early bursts of spring sunshine and a mild winter have seen this year 's first crop of strawberries arrive a week early
the first homegrown strawberries of 2015 will arrive in supermarkets tomorrow - days ahead of schedule
experts say fine weather with good levels of sunshine this week on top of a generally mild winter have helped growers produce the early fruit
and with temperatures set to reach 16c this weekend , the arrival of the strawberries at tesco is a clear sign that spring is around the corner
traditionally , the earliest home grown strawberries come from either kent , sussex or hampshire but this year growers in welsh have won the race to produce the first
tesco berry buyer turnbull said : ' this is a real coup for welsh which only began growing strawberries on a commercial scale two years ago
' these berries , grown in the rhymney valley , near cardiff , will put welsh on the uk 's strawberry growing map
' kayleigh cottle , 29 , picks the first strawberries of the year at haygrove nursery in welsh thanks to milder winters in recent years , britain on the whole is enjoying longer fruit growing seasons the variety of the welsh - grown strawberries is called driscoll 's lusa and has been selected because of its consistent , sweet taste
thanks to milder winters recently , britain on the whole is enjoying longer fruit growing seasons
the britain strawberry season can now last for up to nine months - a whole four months longer than last decade years ago when winters were longer and harsher
ms turnbull added : ' the arrival of the first home grown strawberries brings about a real feel good factor - not only does it herald the start of britain summer time but it is also the start of the uk produce growing season
