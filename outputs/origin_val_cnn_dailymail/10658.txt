an 800lb man , whose depression and size once brought him to the brink of suicide , vowed to lose 150lbs in order to qualify for the weight loss surgery needed to save his life after a series of dangerous falls sent him to the hospital 10 times in nine months
when joe , 31 , first joined tlc 's obesity series my 600lbs life , he was using food as an emotional crutch and consuming roughly 10,000 calories a day
and on last night 's episode of the series , a weight loss specialist insisted that , if joe had to get down to 650lbs , he would be unable to undergo the live - saving surgery he so desperately needed
but despite making the life - changing decision to move from johnson city , tennessee , to houston , texas , to be close to dr nowzaradan , joe struggled to shed the necessary weight - and actually managed to gain a further 15lbs in just one month
at nearly 800lbs , he was unable to get up by himself team work : it took multiple emergency technicians to lift joe off of the floor to take him to the hospital ' i 'm mad at myself , ' joe said tearfully
' not only did i not lose , but i gained
' during his appointment , dr nowzaradan attempted to address his patient 's weight gain - however joe continued to make excuses for his failure to follow orders
he blamed being on the road during the move to houston , noting that he was forced to eat fast - food at convenient stores and rest stops
joe alleged that he ate two grilled chicken sandwiches a day , but dr nowzaradan told him that his claims were mathematically impossible
' joe is still in denial about how much he is eating , ' dr nowzaradan explained
' he is still eating just as much , if not more
' he told his patient that he was on ' borrowed time ' and ' spiraling out of control '
' at this rate every day is a question as to whether he is going to make it , ' dr nowzaradan said
' any number of things could [ become ] a deadly situation with him
' daily chore : joe can be seen getting dressed after bathing himself

during their first meeting , joe admitted to her that his ' greatest struggle with food is emotional eating '
' if i feel bad , i go to it , ' he said
one of joe 's biggest emotional hardships was feeling rejected by his father

' if there was some way to fix him myself , i would , ' she said tearfully
joe explained that he had free reign to do whatever he wanted when was younger - and that included eating whatever he wanted
after hitting 777lbs , joe was unable to walk without falling and his mom said his ' spirit had been broken '
at the start of the episode , he was forced to call an ambulance after his legs gave out and he had fallen to the floor
