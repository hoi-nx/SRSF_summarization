food & wine magazine has released its annual list of the best new chefs across american
making the cut in 2015 are a chef with a doctorate in neuroscience , a one - time " top chef " contestant and a culinary artist who plays blues guitar in his free time
the 11 chefs and their restaurants , which will be profiled in the july issue of food & wine magazine , span the country as well as the culinary spectrum , specializing in spanish tapas , rustic italian , modern american , farm - to - table and even the breakfast and lunch rush
what they all have in common is a willingness to take risks while satisfying the palates of many , says food & wine editor in chief cowin
" i was surprised , and delighted , by how personal these restaurants are , " said cowin
" the chefs seem to be cooking to please themselves , and in the process have dazzled diners
" cowin noted a trend : the chefs are nodding toward the past while innovating
" chefs are also looking to their families as touchstones , " she said
" we 've seen a lot of paeans to grandmothers
in fact , olamaie is named for one of the two chefs ' grandmothers

carlos salgado of taco maria was born into a family that had a mexican - american restaurant and now he 's elevated that traditional cooking
" though many of the chefs are looking to a simpler time in their lives for inspiration , picking the top cooks in the country is no simple task
first , food & wine magazine editors reach out to a " trusted group of nominators " around the country , which includes writers for the magazine , past honorees and industry insiders , for their picks
they 're looking for chefs who have been creating dishes and running a professional kitchen for five years or less
editors also comb local magazines and newspapers to find out who is generating buzz regionally
once the group of candidates is whittled down , food & wine magazine visits the restaurants to taste the local fare anonymously
