things got testy on " cnn tonight " when conservative commentator ferguson charged that rappers like james are profiting off the n - word
" i 'll be honest with you , " ferguson told james on monday night
" i think you know that we should probably get rid of the n - word , but in reality , i think many rappers are afraid they will lose out on money and sales and street cred if they do n't stop using the word
" the two were part of a panel discussion about who can say the n - word
the panel also included cnn commentator hill
" i 'm making money off of doing music and being creative , sir , " james responded
" i 'm not making money just because i use the n - word
nobody goes to buy an album because it 's full of the n - word
" to which ferguson responded : " trinidad , you would n't be on this show tonight if it was n't for using the n - word in your rap music
" james is the rapper whose hit song , " all gold everything , " is heard playing in the background as the house mother of the university of oklahoma sigma alpha epsilon house -- known as mom b. -- was caught on a vine video repeating the n - word seven times on camera
the woman , beauton gilbow , was bombarded with claims that she 's just as racist as the fraternity members who were caught singing a racist song on a bus earlier this month
in a previous interview with cnn , james said he was willing to give the house mom a pass -- though he said he did n't condone her use of the word
but when ferguson said monday the rapper was only on the show for his use of the word , the third panelist -- hill -- quickly jumped in
" he would n't be on the show if a white woman had n't said the n - word on a tape , " he said
" white people have been saying the [ n - word ] long before trinidad was born
