hart believes that manchester city captain kompany will benefit from being axed by manager manuel pellegrini
kompany was dropped to the bench for wednesday âs home win over leicester city after some below - par performances
hart knows how the belgium defender is feeling after he was left out for seven league games last season following a loss of form
but the england keeper is confident kompany will come back stronger for the experience
kompany was dropped for manchester city 's 2 - 0 win against leicester city on wednesday manchester city goalkeeper hart said kompany would fight his way back into the team hart said : â vinny appreciates , same as we all do , that sometimes the manager will change the squad
there is no - one destined to play every single game â i âve learned that lesson
vinny is an unbelievable player , one of the best i have ever played with , and that was his night off
i âm sure he will be back in the team again with that captain âs armband , being one of the best defenders in world football
â the 2 - 0 victory over leicester city preserved leicester city âs title hopes as they try to catch chelsea , but it was only the ninth time this season that manuel pellegrini âs side have kept a clean sheet
â it has not been good enough , â said hart
â we âd all accept that , myself included
it âs not just the back four and the goalkeeper , we defend as a team
i do nât set out to be brutally honest but i âd struggle to say things any other way
â city have won both their premier league titles on the last day , but hart added : â i âm not that bothered about topping previous seasons in terms of drama
winning the league is the most important thing , whether we do it dramatically or not
â central defender kompany has been criticised for some of his performances this season hart admitted that manchester city have not been playing well enough recently
