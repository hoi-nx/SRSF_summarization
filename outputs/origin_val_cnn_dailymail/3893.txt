that being said an eight year old boy is in 3rd grade
he should know about breasts
the little guy should have a basic understanding
' christine added : ' cartoonists have been doing this c * * * for ages especially disney
parents still take their kids to disney cartoons
other things to worry about people
' megan mayhew wrote on facebook : ' ok so it 's ok for women to breastfeed in public but a cartoon of boobs is horrible
if an eight year old has never noticed women have boobs than i 'm glad his dad had a talk with him
stop making the naked body so taboo
' selina fraley said : ' wait so the father was concerned about the boobs in the background but not the filth that his kids was watching i mean , the characters were poisoning each other and lit eachother on fire ! but you 're worried about cartoon breasts smh get your priorities straight
