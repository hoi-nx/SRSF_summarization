one of the men expelled from tanzania with jihadi john is a close associate of â the goebbels of islamic state â , responsible for horrific videos of beheadings
mohammed emwazi was with german national schrodl when they were stopped at the airport in dar es salaam in 2009
now the mail on sunday can reveal that german intelligence has linked schrodl to cuspert â the rapper whose role making videos for is has been likened to that of nazi propaganda chief josef goebbels
it is believed he may also have produced the sickening footage of mohammed emwazi murdering british and us prisoners with a knife
german authorities have linked him to schrodl , one of the most dangerous islamists on their radar , who they classify as â prone to violence â
although he claims to have turned his back on fanaticism , schrodl is believed to have forged links with somali terror group al shabaab , an al qaeda affiliate
when a the mail on sunday reporter spoke to schrodl at his home in dusseldorf about his links to jihadism , he said : â i do nât have anything to do with that any more
â some time later , outside the door of his seedy fourth - floor flat , he appeared flanked by two heavies , who made it plain that it was time for our reporter to leave
but his denials conflict with information from german intelligence agencies which regard him as a â person of interest â in the ongoing fight against is
cuspert , who was a rapper under the name deso dogg , has appeared in an is beheading video , holding up the severed head of a victim mohammed emwazi was expelled from tanzania with one of cuspert 's associates in 2009

mohammed emwazi , islamic convert schrodl and adorus were stopped by the tanzania authorities at dar es salaam airport as they arrived for what they had claimed was an innocent safari holiday
mohammed emwazi âs apologists have claimed the men âs detention â â on orders from mi6 â â as the first step on his road to radicalisation
yet the mail on sunday has established that the supposedly strict muslims were held not because of their political affiliations , but due to their drunken and violent behaviour on a dutch klm flight from amsterdam to dar es salaam , according to the tanzania government
schrodl is connected with some of the vilest figures in the radical islamic network , most notably fellow convert cuspert
german intelligence sources say both men were radicalised by mohammed mahmoud , the austrian - born leader of banned islamist group millatu ibrahim
in september 2013 , schrodl was stopped returning to german after a flight from cairo
a search revealed a secret compartment in his jacket containing a false french driving licence and identity card
in october last year , he was sentenced to a five - month suspended jail sentence
adorus , 33 , a father - of - one from east london , is in an ethiopian jail on terrorism offences .
