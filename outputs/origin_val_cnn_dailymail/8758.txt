many couples decide to tie the knot in an intimate setting with just close family on the guest list
and now a retired minister from virginia has built his own travelling wedding chapel measuring just 100 square feet offering wedding services for as little as $ 100 ( Â£ 66 )
bil malbon , 59 , came up with the idea for building the chapel on wheels after he retired in 2013 after stumbling across a website dedicated to building tiny houses
he then began building the chapel in april 2014 , and completed his first ceremony , renewing the vows of thom and stanton , in october
the chapel even features a retractable spire , which can be removed when the building is on the road
wedding packages start from $ 100 with hour - long full wedding services on a weekend costing $ 500 ( Â£ 330 )
mr bil malbon first started working on building the chapel in 2014 after attending several workshops on how to build your own tiny house mr bil malbon , right , says the chapel even features a detractable spire so it can be removed when he is driving it on the road the chapel in the process of being built by mr bil malbon
this weekend the building will host its first full wedding ceremony in richmond , virginia mr bil malbon said : ' a little over ten years ago i started thinking about about what i wanted to do when i retired from state government
' i 'd been officiating weddings since 1992 and decided i would build a grand wedding chapel
' this is just our first year of business and the wedding season has n't really started yet
' we have a few bookings already and out hopes are that as the weather warms up , more couples planning tiny weddings give us a call
' on saturday , the chapel will host its full wedding service in richmond , virginia , when moran and josh farrar tie the knot
after being completed late last year , the first service to be held by mr bil malbon in the chapel was the vow renewal of couple thom and stanton , pictured mr bil malbon , pictured with bil malbon and mrs stanton
the retired minister says that although it is their first year of business , the chapel has already had many bookings for the summer miss moran said : ' we knew from the beginning we wanted a small , intimate wedding with a guest list of only close family members
' our search was coming up empty as i refused to pay over $ 500 to rent an over-sized location
' then we found the tiny chapel and i knew it was perfect
