her blog ' the princess diaries ' , which appeared in finch 's quarterly review , contrasted the difficulties faced by royalty with more ' normal issues '
the family 's wealth originated from their postal system empire which can be traced back to around 1290 when two early ancestors operated courier services in the italian city - states
but the family 's important postal activities began with von thurn und taxis , who served as postmaster to the holy roman emperor maximilian i from 1489 and to philip i of spain from 1504
the prussian empire originally bought out the von thurn und taxis monopoly in 1867 and used it as the basis for a new german national post
a member of the family is believed to have invented the taximeter , which is why taxicabs came to bear his name
the von thurn und taxis held the rank of royalty in the german empire until 1918 .
