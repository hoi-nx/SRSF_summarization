this is the touching moment a doting dad dances with his daughter at home
but the dance party for eliza , 5 , was arranged by her dad , glenn , 42 , at their south carolina home because she has the aav9 virus and the family are under a self - imposed quarantine
the five - year - old suffers from a rare and ultimately fatal genetic condition called sanfilippo syndrome and has to avoid interacting with people 's germs or it could kill her
if she built up immunity to this virus she would likely not qualify for a clinical trial , as aav9 will deliver the medicine in the body
this is her only chance at life
her family have put themselves under a voluntary quarantine for the past nine months in a bid to avoid interacting with other people
the family has chosen to avoid interacting with people and anything people have touched
it means mom cara , dad glenn and brother beckham , 8 , stay at home with her 24 hours a day and seven days a week to protect her
her mom , cara quit her job as a pediatrician while glenn works remotely as a consultant at symantec and beckham can no longer attend his school , instead doing his schoolwork remotely
the family get their groceries delivered and on the rare occasion they do have to interact with people , they wear masks and gloves
they only leave their house once a week to go to an empty beach or field , where the kids can run free
since eliza was diagnosed with the illness in july 2013 , the family have raised $ 2.2 million with a gofundme page and other traditional fundraising efforts in the hope to help her survive
her father glenn told people : ' we heard that there was a clinical trial that might cure eliza of this disease
so of course we knew that we had to raise every dollar that they needed for it
' but since reaching their goal in december 2014 , they have experienced delays with the trials due to difficulties in drug production
and even when the medicine is ready , they do n't know if eliza will be picked for the trial
' this is our only chance , ' glenn says
' not only for eliza , but other children with sanfilippo syndrome

it took a lot of planning because the family needed to make sure that eliza did not catch any incoming diseases
her father writes in a youtube video : ' every little girl deserves to go to a special dance
' the disorder means that the pretty girl with blonde pigtails will slowly lose her ability to speak and by the age of six will most likely not be able to talk at all , according to people
by the time she turns ten - years - old , she is expected to be in a wheelchair and need constant care
the family are choosing to stay under quarantine because other parents who have children with sanfilippo syndrome warn that if children get sick it could accelerate their sanfilippo syndrome symptoms
glenn said : ' this is a personal decision that we made
doctors understand why we 're doing this but they did n't tell us we had to
' ' i ca n't say if looking back one day i would regret anything we have done for eliza and beckham
we constantly make sure we both still agree that this is the right move
