russell crowe has done little to dampen speculation about his possible interest in buying leeds lifelong leeds fan was speaking onsimon mayo 's bbc five live show on thursday speaking ahead of the release of his latest film , the water diviner , russell crowe also said he had learned a lot about owning a top sports club during his nine years as joint - owner of australian rugby league side rabbitohs
' i 've followed leeds since i was a little kid , ' russell crowe said
' i used to come home from sport in the afternoon , me and my brother , and watch match of the day
' i love the club
i want nothing but success for the club
but like many other leeds fans - and probably in fact 99.9 per cent - i 'm getting a little impatient , you know ? ' ' some of your listeners may not know that i own a rugby league team in australia which , again , is my childhood team and they were a champion team when i was younger
' then they 'd fallen in to a state of disarray and they were perennial losers
so , nine years ago , i put my cheque book where my mouth is and bought the club
' the rabbitohs won the nrl championship for the first time in 43 years in october and recently beat league side st helens to become world champions
' step - by - step , by changing the culture , changing the merchandise , changing the player roster , changing the coaching staff , changing the administrative staff and changing our connection to our community - we have risen from being perennial losers to being competitive , to being dominant - and now we 're champions , ' russell crowe added
