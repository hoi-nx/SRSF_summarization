the makka al mukarama hotel , located along a highway leading to the country 's presidential palace , is popular with lawmakers , journalists , business people and somalia returning home from abroad
somalia president hassan sheikh mohamud condemned the attack as a " heinous and inhuman act " in an interview with state - run mogadishu during an official visit to egypt
in a statement , somalia prime minister omar abdirashid ali sharmarke said al-shabaab 's " talk of ' legitimate targets ' and ' justification ' " exposes " the sham logic behind their lust for terror
" " these terrorists contradict islamic and betray somalia , " he said
the injured , along with the bodies of the dead , could not be removed from the hotel until after the hours - long gunfight
more than 10 people , most of them kenyan nationals who worked at the hotel , were rescued , police said
al-shabaab said it targeted the hotel because its guests are spies and government officials
the terror group has been active in somalia for years
initially , its goal was implementing a stricter form of islamic law , or sharia , by warring against the somalia government
it has since shifted its focus to launching terror attacks in somalia and beyond
" we reiterate again that there will be no safe haven for the crusaders and apostates in somalia , and that our attacks on them will continue until the enemy of allah ( is ) defeated and his law is implemented fully in somalia , " the group said in a statement
