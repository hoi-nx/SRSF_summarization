' what do women want ' is such a common question that it inspired a hollywood movie starring mel gibson
and the feminist writer julie burchill reckons that female sexuality has been suppressed and controlled for so long that they no longer have any idea what they want
in an article for the new issue of loaded magazine , the columnist details the hypocrisies and strict demands that modern women demand of their boyfriends and husbands
' it âs women who are thought to be the soppy sex , but they are capable of great hard - headedness in matters of what is laughably known as the heart
' she continued : ' most women want a man who makes them laugh , sadly , they often do nât see this goes two ways and men need to have fun as much as they do
' some women want a man to tick all the boxes â handsome , rich , great job â but would be outraged if men subjected them to a similar shopping list
' julie burchill points out that some women claim to be too tired to have sex , but have enough energy to go out drinking with their friends ( picture posed by models ) ms julie burchill , who is an ardent supporter of the female sex , revealed to the publication that one thing some women most definitely do not want is sex
she said : ' i know from personal experience that women tend to become sexually impervious to their husbands far more often and earlier than husbands do to their wives , ' you âd think if a woman wanted to relax , or have a nice bit of me time , she could easily opt for a good old roll - around
' but a lot of women are nât interested in sex without making it into a huge performance number â they want romance
' in many relationships , women lose interest in sex much quicker than the man ( picture posed by models ) she continued : ' we âve all heard about those broads in relationships who mysteriously stop shagging their significant other , claiming they â have nât got time for sex â and , â i âm too tired â
' how come they âre never too tired to get trashed on rosÃ© wine with their mates on a friday night , go to the garden centre early on a saturday morning and spend every weekday on mumsnet ? ' she continued : ' maybe sex would nât take so long and be so tiring if they did nât demand the ring cycle equivalent of romance first ? ' the new issue of loaded but the writer is n't taking a pop at women , in fact , far from it
she believes that the reason they are so conflicted in their desires is that they have been controlled as a sex for so long that their needs have desires have become muddled
she said : ' the way female sexuality has been corralled and controlled over the centuries would leave any poor s * d confused
' because of the disparity of opportunity and pay in the workplace for so long , women found the easiest way to advance themselves was through a man , and so the trapping and keeping of a husband become something most women put above all else
' it takes a long time to heal from such strange and prolonged distortion of the self â hence the phenomenon of broads insisting they are â strong women â while buying books in which the sole point is the heroine being dominated by the hero
' this historical injury explains why it âs still so hard , often , for men to understand what women want
' i do nât even know
