the family of churchill , pictured , have donated 37 of his paintings to the state following the death of his one remaining child a collection of churchill âs paintings has been given to the public by the late prime minister âs family to settle a multi-million pound tax bill
the politician âs family was left owing Â£ 9.4million in inheritance tax following the death of his last surviving child lady soames last year
but rather than selling off the prized collection of 37 paintings , his family has given the paintings to the nation under a specialist tax scheme for important pieces of art. as part of the deal the vast majority of the paintings will be permanently displayed to the public at chartwell , churchill âs former home that is now run by the national trust
the wartime prime minister took up the hobby at the age of 41 and continued painting in a figurative style into his 80s , producing more than 500 works
although his amateur offerings never received mass critical acclaim , they have attracted huge prices on the private market from avid fans of â churchilliana â buyers
the value of his paintings was highlighted last year when goldfish pool at chartwell â depicting the garden feature which he dug and visited daily - was sold for a record Â£ 1.8m
despite selling many of his prized possessions at auction last year , lady soames âs will included a request that the paintings remain on display at chartwell
she also asked that coast scene near cannes should remain in the houses of parliament and that view from a bathing hut at the miami surf club stays in the churchill war rooms
lady soames , who died last june at the age of 91 , previously described how painting â literally â grabbed â her father in 1915
she credited the hobby for â playing an increasing and abiding role in his life , renewing the source of his great inner strength and enabling him to face storms , ride out depressions and rise above the tough passages in his political life â
the items were donated to the nation under the acceptance in lieu scheme , which allows people to offset inheritance tax against valuable items of cultural significance
churchill 's painting ' the goldfish pool at chartwell ' , pictured , sold recently for a record Â£ 1.8 million some of the collection will remain on permanent display at churchill 's home , chartwell , pictured the scheme sees the government accept the items for the full market value , provided they can be permanently bequeathed to a museum or gallery
it also offers a â good deal â for those offering up historically important items , with works avoiding the taxes associated with a sale on the private market
inheritance tax is paid at 40 per cent when an estate exceeds Â£ 325,000 but the scheme sees the amount of tax incurred by the objects reduced to 25 per cent of its market value
the secretary of state for culture , media and sport is responsible for deciding whether the items offer a good deal for the taxpayer after being advised by a board of experts
the government has accepted items worth Â£ 124.5 million instead of tax between 2009 and 2013
the churchill family has previously courted controversy after benefitting from the sale of prized possession to the state
the war leader âs collection of pre- 1945 speeches and letter was sold to the nation in 1995 for Â£ 12.5million using money from the heritage lottery fund
as well as 37 of churchill âs paintings , the collection also included a painting by sir john lavery and the aly khan gold cup , which was won by churchill âs horse high hat in 1961
culture minister ed vaizey said : â it is fitting that in the 50th year since his death these paintings by the great war - time leader sir churchill will be displayed in three very significant locations that helped shape his life and gives us an opportunity to appreciate the artistic talent of a man who was a colossal figure in world politics
â chairman of the acceptance in lieu panel edward harley said : â fifty years after his death and 70 years after the end of the war , churchill remains one of this nation âs greatest figures
â his paintings let us see the man in the round and not just as a great politician
