a female ceo has apologized to every mother she has ever encountered in the workplace for ' silently slandering ' their commitment to their jobs
powertofly president zaleski admitted , in a first - person piece for fortune , that she did n't realize how awful she had been - until she became a mother herself
the 34 - year - old , who lives with her husband and daughter in brooklyn , new york , recalled one instance where she made a silent presumption about a time managing editor
ms zaleski presumed that she was ' too much of a mother ' to follow through on a partnership idea - based on the pictures of the editor 's children on her desk
she also did n't speak up when another female editor said they should fire a woman who was pregnant
working ' late ' became an obsession , she said , in order to show commitment to her job - even though mothers in the office would typically skew their days much earlier
ms zaleski wrote in fortune : ' for mothers in the workplace , it âs death by a thousand cuts â and sometimes it âs other women holding the knives
' soon after giving birth herself , zaleski said that she believed her career was over and that she could n't imagine going back to the office for ten hours each day
soon afterwards she met milena berry who wanted to start a company that would allow women to work from home in a range of jobs
and that time editor whom she silently wrote off ? ms zaleski explains that cathy sharick , mother - of - three , has now joined the business as executive editor
powertofly allows women to work from anywhere that suits them - from their home office to a coffee shop
workers can take on full - time or part - time contracts , but as the company website states : ' we give you a lot of freedom and we expect a lot in return
' ms zaleski said in several interviews this week that all the tools for moms to work remotely are already in place
conference calls can be made on skype , presentations shared on google docs , team planning completed on jira
women from 65 countries have joined the site to improve their chance at finding work - and have so far taken home a collective $ 1 million in pay , according to ms zaleski
the challenges are many , the co-founder wrote - and sometimes from career - driven , younger women who she described as ' hardliners ' about spending time in the office ' culture '
she wrote : ' they do nât realize how that '' culture '' pushes women out because it âs too often set up around how men bond
' many of these young women are just toeing the company line
i do nât begrudge them
i feel sorry for them
they âre hurting their future selves
