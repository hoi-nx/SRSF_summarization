president obama said saturday that he learned hillary clinton exclusively used a private email account for government business " through news reports " and was glad his former secretary of state asked for those emails to be made public
" the policy of my administration is to encourage transparency , which is why my emails , the blackberry i carry around , all those records are available and archived , " obama said in an interview with cbs
" i 'm glad that hillary clinton 's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed
" clinton used a private email account -- housed in servers at her new york home -- for the four years she served as america 's top diplomat , a practice that skirted legal standards in place and has some republicans calling for investigations
on wednesday night , the former secretary of state tweeted that she " asked state to release " her email , a request accepted by the department
obama backed clinton 's request , telling cbs that he thinks " the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need
" while obama commented on the issue saturday , clinton did n't mention it during an 18 - minute appearance on stage at a clinton global initiative event at the university of miami
clinton took no questions from reporters at the event
instead , clinton 's remarks to about 1,000 students focused on the foundation 's work , including a new report she will roll out monday about the underrepresentation of women and girls
" there 's so much that needs to be done , " clinton said on the issue of equaling the playing field for women and girls
as she regularly does , clinton said there is " a lot of unfinished business " to do on the issue
obama sat down with cbs after the president spoke at the 50th anniversary of the " bloody sunday " marches in selma , alabama
" if selma taught us anything , it 's that our work is never done , " the president said while standing near the edmund pettus bridge , the symbol of the selma marches
" fifty years from bloody sunday , our march is not yet finished , but we 're getting closer
" clinton did not go to selma , instead opting to attend her clinton foundation event in florida
" watched @ repjohnlewis & @ barackobama in # selma , " she tweeted
" let 's answer their call to keep fighting for voting rights , civil rights , & human rights
" clinton mentioned the anniversary on stage , tying the marches and event into her work toward leveling the playing field for women and girls
" you can see how progress is made by looking at what happened this weekend in selma , alabama , where our country is marking a historic anniversary of the long march towards equality and a more perfect union , and also recommitting to carry the cause forward into the 21st century , " clinton said
" so whether it 's women 's rights or human rights , civil rights or lgbt rights , we 're counting on all of you to lead the way , and that 's what the no - ceilings initiative at the clinton foundation is really all about
