mcgregor ( right ) stares out jose aldo also ahead of their ufc world title showdown the irishman is confident of knocking jose aldo out in the opening ' four minutes ' when they meet in las vegas mcgregor and jose aldo faced the media in london on tuesday on the penultimate leg of their world tour which has taken in rio , new york and los angeles among others
and the dubliner said : ' i find the route to victory here
that 's the key to victory here , when i hit people they do not survive
i map out my shot selection and put people away every time
' jose aldo has got the basics down well
he 's got the right hand , he 's got the low kick ; he can catch people but after that it 's wild , it 's sloppy and they escape
' look back at his career , you can see the shots remain the same
then look at my career ; my evolution is undeniable and i will continue to get better
mcgregor did most of the talking during the press conference , insisting he was ' prepared to kill ' defending champion jose aldo has not been defeated in 10 years while defending his title eight times ' he does not want it the way i want it
he does n't want me around , he always wants separation but there will be no separation on july 11
' i will show up prepared to kill
it will be decided in the first four minutes ; he will be out on his feet
the shots i want to land will land and it will be a formality after that
how long he can take that is up to his chin
' he has been through war after war after war , 25 minutes of getting hit
the brain does not recover , it does not get younger
i will hit him and i will hit him hard
it will be wrapped up within the first four minutes
' mcgregor smiles as the pair 's globetrotting tour that has visited three continents nears its end mcgregor takes in the sights from the london eye on the penultimate stage of the world tour mcgregor also revealed he plans to dominate not just his current weight class but , in time , the lightweight division too
' i definitely have my eyes on the lightweight division , ' he added
' i came into this company as a two - weight champion
i am the only irishman , the only european to hold belts consecutively
' most certainly i 'm looking to replicate that achievement on the biggest stage , the ufc
but there are plenty of featherweights who have spoken out of turn and who should have kept their name out of their mouth
' when you speak my name in vain , no matter how many years down the line , i 'm like an elephant , i never forget and i 'll come and get you
' ufc president dana white speaks at the pre-fight press conference in london jose aldo , who is unbeaten in 10 years and has made eight defences of his title , cut a quieter figure alongside his charismatic challenger
' i do n't fight for anyone else , ' he said
' i feel comfortable with this , i do n't have any emotions
he can talk if he wants , he can do anything , the most important thing is to be the champion
' i 'm going to be well prepared and ready to end the fight as quickly as possible
