their bodies were found in a field in fort worth , texas a mother found naked and dead with her 13 - month - old daughter died of hypothermia , a medical examiner ruled
lindsay groce gardner was discovered by fence repairmen lying on top of hailey in a field in fort worth , texas in january
the 27 - year - old 's car was discovered crashed and abandoned 200 yards away
police found her clothes strewn in the field between the car and her body , indicating she undressed as she walked with her baby away from the car
at the time sgt joe loughman said : ' there were no injuries that looked like they would cause a person âs death
' but the death was ruled accidental this week after a tarrant county medical officer said ms gardner undressed in a ' very sad ' and ' unusual ' case
paradoxical undressing can occur in cases of severe hypothermia when the confused victim begins to feel as if they are burning up and therefore removes their clothing
the crashed toyota sedan was first reported around 8:30am on january 13 by resident bentley , who spotted the car after dropping her kids off at school
' there 's always deer in that field , ' ms bentley said
' i was looking for the deer and i saw the car
it was against a tree and the hood was smashed in and the driver 's side door was open
' i was hollering asking if everybody was okay , hoping if somebody was in there that they could at least respond
' since ms bentley had a child in the car at the time , she could n't get out to approach the car , but called police and stayed until they showed up
while the airbags were deployed , police found the vehicle empty
ms gardner and her daughter were found about 200 yards away from a crashed silver car it was n't until a man came to repair a fence at 11am that the bodies were found
