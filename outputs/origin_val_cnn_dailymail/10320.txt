the house where sandy hook killer lanza began his murderous gun rampage has been demolished
councillors in newtown , connecticut , decided to knock down the large , picturesque house on yogananda drive , and tear apart its foundations , to stop it being a ' constant reminder ' of lanza 's brutal 2012 massacre

newtown authorities were given the house by the bank which acquired it , and voted to destroy it killer : lanza , pictured above in two photos from some time before the 2012 killing , spent most of his time inside the house after dropping out of school the killer spent most of his life at the home , which his parents bought in 1998 before they divorced
in the years leading up to the horrific shooting , lanza spent increasing amounts of time inside its walls , where he spent hours playing video games , and would communicate with his mother by email
an exhaustive report into lanza 's life by state officials concluded that he was allowed to slip into a ' padded ' world , in which he rarely had contact with the outside world - which may have contributed to the killings
no more : the home , pictured above four days after the december 2012 killing , had already been completely emptied and everything inside burned in the hope of preventing a trade in looted sandy hook memorabilia gone : plans by the newtown council call for the plot to be left empty and greenery planted there parents : nancy lanza , right , lived with her son in the home

lanza shot himself in the head when police arrived the town was given the 3,100 - square - foot home , and its 2 - acre lot , by a bank which acquired the property from the lanzas
bank officials had already gone inside and incinerated everything they could find , to stop any of the family 's possessions becoming sick memorabilia of the massacre
the decision to rip down the house was made in late january , prompted in part by pleas from haunted neighbors
one , dave ackart , said : ' not only is the property a constant reminder of the evil that resided there - those of us who walk , run , drive , ride or otherwise must pass it multiple times a day , are having a hard time moving on
' the plans call for the landscaped lot to be leveled later in spring , and new greenery planted
