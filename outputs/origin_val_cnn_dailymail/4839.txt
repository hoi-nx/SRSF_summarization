britain 's most dangerous roads are in lincolnshire , a new report has revealed
the county was named as the place where more drivers , passengers and pedestrians were killed than anywhere else in the country
the study also found that residents living in rural communities nationally were more likely to be ' killed or seriously injured ' on the roads
this is because vehicles travel faster and there are fewer traffic calming measures , according to the research carried out by the pacts ( pacts ) and direct line car insurance
grimsby , pictured , had the highest road casualty rate on roads in britain , according to a new study this is compared to more urban areas where casualty rates were well below the national average
the report calculated the casualty rates for residents of each parliamentary constituency
those in the north and east of england had the highest in britain , with both lincolnshire and lancashire having three constituencies each in the top ten
it concluded that great grimsby , lincolnshire , had the highest road casualty rate in britain
the town 's casualty figures were 53 per cent higher her than the national average
banff and buchan in aberdeenshire , scotland , had the highest number of people killed or seriously injured , with figures 111 per cent above the national average
by contrast , south wales had the lowest rates for casualties killed or seriously injured
four cardiff constituencies , along with torfaen and newport west , ranked in the bottom 10
in 2013 a total of 183,670 people were reported injured on britain roads , including 23,370 killed or seriously injured , at a cost to society of Â£ 15 billion
there are three main factors affecting deaths and serious injury on the roads , the report said
the first is the driver 's behaviour , including speeding , drink and drug driving , non-use of seat - belts and use of mobiles behind the wheel
grimsby 's casualty figures were 53 per cent higher than the national average

david davies , executive director of pacts said : ' road collisions remain a major cause of death and serious injury in britain
' traffic danger has a significant negative influence on society , it discourages people from walking or cycling , restricts the freedom of children and means vulnerable road users feel intimidated
' despite great improvements in emergency services and trauma care , thousands of victims of road collisions are left with life - changing injuries while the families of casualties also find their lives changed forever
' mike holliday-williams , managing director personal lines at direct line car insurance added : ' good information is an essential basis for effective road safety action
' now , for the first time , mps have specific road casualty information based on their constituency boundaries and its residents
' we hope the road safety dashboard will provide a catalyst for action aimed at reducing deaths and injury at a local level , as the diversity of results demonstrate there is a no ' one size fits all ' solution
' the dashboard will become a vital tool in helping improve the safety of britain 's roads .
