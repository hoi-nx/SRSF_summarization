apple ceo cook once tried to offer jobs his liver in a desperate bid to prolong his life , but his predecessor refused , a new book reveals
jobs had been suffering serious health problems as a result of his pancreatic cancer and by january 2009 - two years before his death - was in urgent need of a liver transplant
on learning this , cook was so upset he took it upon himself to have his blood tested and found that he happened to have the same rare blood type as his good friend and mentor
here they are pictured together during a product question and answer session in becoming jobs , a new biography by technology reporter brent schlender and fast company executive editor rick tetzeli , it 's revealed that cook discovered it was possible to transplant a portion of someone 's liver to a recipient
because it is a regenerative organ , the transplanted portion will grow to a functioning size , while the donor 's liver would also repair
bouyed by the findings , cook visited jobs at his home in palo alto to relay the good news
' he cut me off at the legs , almost before the words were out of my mouth , ' said cook in the biography , according to fast company
' " no , " he said
" i 'll never let you do that
i 'll never do that "
somebody that 's selfish does nât reply like that
' i mean , here âs a guy , he âs dying , he âs very close to death because of his liver issue and here âs someone healthy offering a way out
' cook insisted that he was ' perfectly healthy ' and stressed that the procedure would not put him at risk
but jobs ' popped up in bed ' and told him : ' no , i 'm not doing that
' cook said jobs had very rarely ever shouted at him during the 13 years they had known each other , but ' this was one of them
' even though he was gravely ill , the tech guru worked on apple on the last very last day of his life , phoning colleagues from the confines of his bed with new ideas
he died at his home on october 5 , 2011 , at the age of 56 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer
the most commonly understood type of liver transplant involves the removal of a diseased liver to be replaced with a healthy liver taken from a deceased donor
however , another type of transplant has emerged in recent decades with developments in technology and medical techniques - the ' living donor liver transplantation
' this involves removing between 50 - 70per cent of the healthy liver from a living donor which is then transplanted into the recipient
because of the liver 's regenerative qualities , both the donor and the recipient can live with minimal complications and can regrow fully functioning livers based on the pieces they share
while there are side effects for donors , such as blood clots , these are relatively easy to deal with
death for donors is extremely low , although it is a risk they must accept prior to surgery
the new biography ( pictured right ) about jobs ( left ) is due to be released later this month
