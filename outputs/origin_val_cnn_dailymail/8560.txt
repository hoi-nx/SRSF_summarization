the total wipeout of english clubs from european competition this week has led to another feverish debate about where our game stands in relation to our continental counterparts
but before we get too down about things , there is still one english standing in europe this season
manchester city may have crashed out to barcelona but their on - loan defender micah richards is still eyeing european glory with italian side fiorentina
manchester city defender micah richards is currently on loan at serie a side fiorentina the 26 - year - old helped fiorentina to knock out tottenham during the europa league round of 32 richards is the only remaining english player in the squads of the 16 teams remaining in the champions league and the europa league
his team produced a stunning performance to beat serie a rivals roma 3 - 0 in the stadio olimpico and complete a 4 - 1 aggregate triumph
although richards was not involved , he has featured in the europa league this season and helped them knock out another premier league club , tottenham , in the round of 32
richards , 26 , had fallen out of favour under manuel pellegrini at manchester city , making just 18 appearances in two seasons and decided to seek greater first - team opportunities in florence
and while he has not been a mainstay of vincenzo montella 's team , he has made 15 appearances across all competitions , almost certainly more than he would have made at manchester city
richards began to find first - team opportunities limited playing for manchester city and was sent on loan england international richards has admitted he is uncertain where he will be playing his football next season richards could feature in the latter stages of the competition as fiorentina bid to win their second european trophy in warsaw on may 27
he has been linked with a move to inter milan at the end of the season , who are managed by his former manchester city boss roberto mancini
but richards told talksport on wednesday : ' it 's difficult to say [ where i will play ] at the moment
every footballer can go to a bigger club on a free contract but for me , i 'm still only 26 and i just want to play every game , that 's what 's important
' for now , however , richards is flying the flag solo for england in european competition
