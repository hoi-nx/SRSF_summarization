farage has said he will stand down as ukip leader if he fails to win the south thanet seat from the conservatives
the 50 - year - old politician admitted it would be â curtains for me â - despite only being elected as ukip leader for a further four - year term in november
polls suggest mr farage is on course for victory in the crucial kent seat - but he will have to overturn a conservative majority of nearly 17 per cent
he said : â the consequences of me failing to secure a seat for myself in the commons would be significant for both myself and the party
â it is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a westminster seat
â mr farage stated he felt it would risk the party âs ' credibility ' if it had other mps elected but its leader did not have a seat in parliament
he said : â what credibility would ukip have in the commons if others had to enunciate party policy in parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest ? ukip mps : mr farage had to delay the start of his campaigning in south thanet after the surprise defections of former tories douglas carswell ( left ) and mark reckless ( right ) , which sparked by - elections â was i supposed to brief ukip policy from the westminster arms ? no - if i fail to win south thanet , it is curtains for me
i will have to step down
â mr farage âs party currently has two mps - the conservative defectors mark reckless and douglas carswell , who both won by elections for ukip in rochester and strood and clacton after resigning as conservative mps
separately last night , it emerged that mr farage had suggested that children of new immigrants coming to britain should not immediately be allowed to attend state schools
he said ukip policy was that immigrants and their dependents would need private education for five years after entering the britain
mr farage told the guardian : â i would nât foresee people coming into britain immediately being allowed to bring children to go through the state system
