dunga has dismissed suggestions his brazil squad is over reliant on barcelona striker neymar after naming a 23 - man squad for upcoming friendlies against france and chile later this month
neymar almost single - handedly carried brazil to last summer 's world cup quarter - finals against colombia before fracturing his vertebra and missing his side 's 7 - 1 semi-final humiliation against germany
dunga has named neymar his new skipper since the world cup and admits to building his newlook brazil side around the barcelona attacker
neymar almost single - handedly carried brazil to last summer 's world cup quarter - finals against colombia but neymar fractured his vertebra and missed his side 's 7 - 1 semi-final humiliation against germany after playing france in paris later this month , the all - south american clash at the emirates stadium against chile on march 29 is particularly mouthwatering and will see brazil star neymar facing arsenal striker alexis sanchez â the pair are former nou camp team - mates
chelsea trio willian , oscar and filipe luis have been named in the squad by dunga alongside manchester city 's fernandinho , real madrid left - back marcelo and liverpool 's philippe coutinho
' our captain is not a surprise , ' said dunga
' the numbers are here to demonstrate that he is in a very good period
neymar celebrates with former brazil coach luiz felipe scolari in belo horizonte last summer ' since he has been designated captain of the team , he has had an upgrade on his level of football
' he likes challenges , the more responsibility he has , the more he will develop and get better
' we are very happy to have him ; he is doing fantastic things in europe
' every time that brazil was world champion , we had a strong collective spirit , from which appeared some outstanding players
dunga says brazil do not rely too much on barcelona star neymar , who he has named his captain ' we do n't want that one only player resolves everything
' our priority is first to have a strong collective , and then as a second step , one outstanding player can naturally differentiate himself and help us to be better
' the creativity of brazilian football is dribbling
players must have a good attitude , they have to take decisions ' what we are trying to do in this new era of brazil is the following : to increase the value of our heroes of the past and use them as references of the principles of brazilian football for helping develop our new young players
neymar scores for spanish giants barcelona against villareal on the copa del rey semi final second leg ' people say brazilian football is improvisation
no , brazilian football is not improvisation , our football is creativity
' brazil 's game at the emirates stadium will take on extra significance as dunga 's men secured a dramatic penalty shootout win against chile to reach the last eight at the 2014 world cup last summer and set up an all - south american quarter - final against colombia
brazil goalkeeper julio cesar was the hero , making two crucial spot - kick saves to thwart chile , who were denied victory themselves by the woodwork with seconds to spare in extra time
as well as key world cup qualifiers , brazil will travel to chile in july for the copa america and dunga is convinced the next 12 months will be a major test for his new look side
neymar celebrates scoring barcelona 's third goal against villareal to send them through to the final ' we first changed all the staff of brazil , ' said dunga , speaking about the rebuilding job after the world cup
' the most important thing is working hard ; working hard is the only solution to overcome this traumatism
then , results will follow
' we are explaining to the players that we must be strong collectively
we are discussing a lot with the players about the things that did not work during world cup
' our principal objective is qualifying and copa america will help us to get to our main objective
hulk , neymar and dani alves sit on the bench prior to the world cup 2014 third place match with holland ' we need to gain a winning mentality
this is a new decision from brazil ; we will try to be more open in terms of giving more opportunity for new players to be called in the squad
' we want to have a new meritocratic philosophy
the ones that will deliver most are the ones who will be called
' we have decided this squad based on what we observed up to now in previous friendly games of brazilian national team
neymar tries to lift the crowd during the group a match of the 2014 world cup between brazil and mexico ' we have had to take into consideration the fact that some players are still in pre-season period in brazil and others are in the middle of their seasons in europe
' we want to mix young players with players of experience
at this point in time nothing is definite , we will have two friendlies , we will have copa america and then we will have our biggest objective , which is qualifying for world cup 2018
' the players that are not on this list do n't have to feel excluded and the one that are on the list do n't have to think that they will be there forever '
' our main objective is the qualifying for world cup and all the players have to be ready for it
