from satellite photography to five million miles of street - level imagery , detailed maps have transformed our view of the world
but while maps such google street view help us better find places , one designer claims our understanding of the wider landscape remains far too basic
now london - based michael pecirno is attempting to change this using minimalist maps of the us that single out specific features such forests , crops and the nation âs urban sprawl
using minimalist maps of the us landscape that single out specific features , london - based designer michael pecirno is hoping to give people a better understanding of the us landscape
this map shows the grasslands of us
much of these prairielands have been converted into some of the richest agricultural regions on earth â with advances in mapping technology we 're still primarily left with two dominate maps â the political and the physical , â mr michael pecirno told dailymail.com
â while internet maps , allow users to zoom in to an incredible level of detail , we 're not necessarily told anything new ; our understanding of the landscape is still the same , just higher in resolution
â mr michael pecirno inspiration came from road trips as a child through the midwest where he would pass through miles of cornfields
cornfields take up 91 million acres of the us landscape or around 4.83 per cent of the continuous us
the urban sprawl map reveals lack of development across stretches of the west , and the emerging southeast chain of metropolitan areas by focusing each map on a single subject , the designer hopes to help people better visualise and understand the landscape in which they live
pictured are the spread of evergreen forest across us all the maps for this project were created using data from the us department of agriculture
â my inspiration for exploring the world through data comes from an understanding and interest in historical cartography , â said mr michael pecirno london - based designer michael pecirno used freely - available data from from the us department of agriculture
this program , known as cropscape , documents a large majority of the us landscape over numerous years
' using this data and digital mapping tools , i 've plotted the most dominate types of the us landscape into their own maps , ' said michael pecirno
' and while they are perhaps still physical maps , where they differ is that they do not attempt to curate numerous features into a collaged map
' while hearing that value is impressive , there is little way right now for us to visualise what 4.83 per cent of the us landscape looks like , mr michael pecirno said
by focusing each map on a single subject , the designer hopes to help people better visualise and understand the landscape in which they live
his maps look at features such as the distribution of grassland , urban sprawl , shrubs , evergreen , deciduous forests , water and corn
the urban sprawl map , for instance , reveals the lack of development across huge stretches of the west , and the emerging southeast chain of adjacent metropolitan areas
the map of deciduous forests - or trees that lose their leaves during the winter - shows how in some places , like new england , the forest has made a comeback as rural populations have moved to cities

â my inspiration for exploring the world through data comes from an understanding and interest in historical cartography , â said mr michael pecirno
â mapping has always been done through the collection of information , which was then plotted into a projected system to create a general understanding of a place
â with a new wealth of data designers have been able to improve maps , but this has primarily been through the increase of resolution , rather than a change in narrative
â the maps i 've worked on attempt to take this wealth of data and ask what story can be told when we have so much available
mr michael pecirno now wants to map these pieces of data digitally over google maps , allowing users to layer different features
