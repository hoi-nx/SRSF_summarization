lerner , pictured in 2011 , is speaking to a consortium over a proposed Â£ 150million sale of aston villa talks over a takeover are understood to be at an advanced stage and lerner âs decision to fly into england is viewed as a key step towards the completion of a deal
the consortium is in the due diligence stage of their proposed takeover , though the eventual price of the sale will depend on which league aston villa are playing in next season
christian benteke is pictured scoring for aston villa in their 4 - 0 thumping of sunderland last month lerner wants to receive his full Â£ 150m asking price lerner âs expected arrival in the midlands comes after it emerged lerner âs midlands property has been made available as part of the takeover
the farmhouse , located in bodymoor heath , is understood to be worth in the region of Â£ 3m
lerner has been keen to sell aston villa for some time , a period that has seen the club go through a difficult period on the pitch
the sacking of paul lambert and subsequent arrival of tim sherwood has helped stimulate the club , as has their pending fa cup semi-final
but aston villa are still in danger of dropping into the second tier of england football for the first time since 1987
lerner is desperate for the team to avoid that scenario as he looks to receive his full Â£ 150m asking price
relegation into the championship would severely lower aston villa âs value , possibly as much as half
the consortium expect to complete their takeover soon after the end of the season .
