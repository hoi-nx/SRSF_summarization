' ' some people ca n't believe it when i tell them i 'm tasting bread on daily basis , sometimes solidly from 9 til 5 , but it 's when the baker in me really comes out and having been in the industry for over 25 years , not much gets past me - only the really great stuff , ' said ms munden
and despite eating bread on a daily basis , ms munden manages to stay fit by eating fruit and vegetables as well as going for an odd run round the block

four years later ms munden was awarded master baker status and now works for asda in leeds
she added : ' i spend every waking minute thinking lighter loaves , bouncy buns and trends in breakfast treats , but bread is still one of my favourite foods
' one of the most important parts of my job is making sure that our customers are getting the best and tastiest loaves and with over 300 lines in the in - store bread category , it 's a full time job
' we look at the life of the products and the density - i ca n't bear a heavy loaf
' to me the smell of toast or bread baking in the oven is the ultimate smell
' ms munden rarely eats a whole slice of toast , but instead usually takes a bite from the crust and centre to get the full texture

' i love being able to use my imagination to develop something the uk shoppers have previously been unable to buy in store
that 's my favourite part of the job - seeing someone in store walk away with one of my products and i know they 're in for a treat
' i enjoy baking as far more than just a job - it 's a way of life
