indiana governor pence pushed back today on claims that his state 's new religious freedom law is a ' license to discriminate
' ' i abhor discrimination , ' he said in a the wall street journal op - ed. ' if i saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple , i would nât eat there anymore
' the gop politician said to be considering a presidential campaign stated that he 'd veto any bill that ' legalized discrimination against any person or group ' - but that 's not what indiana 's law does
with the storm that has gathered over his state since he formally approved the law last thursday showing no signs of dissipating , pence called off public appearances on monday
meanwhile , sports officials planned an ' indy welcomes all ' campaign ahead of this weekend 's ncaa final four in indianapolis as lawmakers scrambled to quiet the national firestorm over the new law that has much of the country portraying indiana as a state of intolerance
the measure prohibits state laws that ' substantially burden ' a person 's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs
the definition of ' person ' includes religious institutions , businesses and associations
' what we had hoped for with the bill was a message of inclusion , inclusion of all religious beliefs , ' brian bosma house speaker brian bosma said
' what instead has come out is a message of exclusion , and that was not the intent
' the efforts fell flat with democratic , who called for a repeal , and even some gop
' they 're scrambling to put a good face on a bad issue
what puzzles me is how this effort came to the top of the legislative agenda when clearly the business community does n't support it , ' said bill oesterle , an aide to gop former governor mitch daniels and ceo of consumer reporting agency angie 's list , which canceled expansion plans in indianapolis because of the law
indianapolis mayor ballard , a gop , said the law threatens to undermine the city 's economic growth and reputation as a convention and tourism destination and called for lawmakers to add protections for sexual orientation and gender identity to indiana civil - rights laws
' i call upon governor pence and the indiana legislature to fix this law
either repeal it or pass a law that protects all who live , work and visit indiana
indianapolis will not be defined by this , ' ballard said
if angie 's list does n't go through with the planned $ 40 million investment into new headquarters in indianapolis , the city stands to lose out on a projected 1,000 new jobs in the next half decade
not good enough : indiana senate democratic leader tim lanane , left , and indiana house democratic leader pelath , right , call for the repeal of the religious freedom restoration act at a monday press conference after a two - hour private meeting of house republicans , brian bosma said monday that repealing the law is n't a realistic goal at this point
" ' i 'm looking for a surgical solution , and i think the least intrusive surgery is to clarify that ( the law ) can not be used to support the denial of goods , facilities or services to any member of the public , ' he said
pence , who defended the law during a television appearance sunday and in the the wall street journal on monday , canceled scheduled appearances monday night and tuesday , in part because of planned protests
in the the wall street journal essay , pence argued that the religious freedom measure ' contains no reference to sexual orientation
' it simply ' mirrors ' federal law , he stated
the federally mandated affordable care act , he said , ' renewed concerns about government infringement on deeply held religious beliefs ' compelling the gop - controlled indiana legislature to introduce enhanced protections for persons of faith
' faith and religion are important values to millions of indiana residents , ' he said
' with the passage of this legislation , indiana will continue to be a place that respects the beliefs of every person in our state
' pence and gop senate president gop long have stressed that the new law is based on the federal religious freedom restoration act of 1993 , which has been upheld by courts
but the hrc and other democrat - aligned groups say it 's disingenuous to compare the two laws
demonstrators gather outside the city county building on monday in indianapolis , indiana
a group of more than 2,000 protesters lined up outside the state capitol on saturday , as the tide of public opinion turned against the hoosier state 's new religious freedom bill hrc 's legal director , warbelow , said the federal law was designed to ensure religious minorities were protected from laws passed by the federal government that might not have been intended to discriminate but had that effect
the indiana law , she said , allows individuals to invoke government action even when the government is not a party to a lawsuit
it also allows all businesses to assert religious beliefs regardless of whether they are actually religious organizations
warbelow said one of the best ways to fix the law would be to add language that explicitly says it can not be used to undermine already existing civil rights protections
democratic house minority leader pelath said gop legislators should admit the law is a mistake
' they 're not facing up to reality â this is a national embarrassment , ' pelath said
' the bush needs to be pulled up by its roots and thrown into the fire
' indiana university law professor deborah widiss said the backlash is being fueled by the legalization of gay marriage and last year 's supreme court ruling in a case that found hobby lobby and other closely held private businesses with religious objections could opt out of providing the free contraceptive coverage required by the affordable care act
indiana 's lack of a law banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is also a contributor , she said
demonstrators react to the city county council passing a resolution calling on the state to repeal or revise it 's controversial religious freedom restoration act long and brian bosma did not appear eager to add such protection into the measure , noting that it is a big policy decision and that only four weeks remain in this year 's legislative session
the fallout continued over the weekend and into monday
the national public - employee union known as afscme announced monday it was canceling a planned women 's conference in indianapolis this year because of the law
the band wilco said it was no longer come to the city for a may performance
virginia gov. terry mcauliffe issued a letter to indiana corporations saying virginia is a business - friendly state that does ' not discriminate against our friends and neighbors , ' while chicago mayor rahm emanuel sent letters to more than a dozen indiana businesses , urging them to relocate to a ' welcoming place to people of all races , faiths and countries of origin
' two states ' democratic governors , connecticut 's dan malloy , and washington 's jay inslee , said they were imposing an administration - wide ban on state - funded travel to indiana
the city of seattle , washington , had already instituted such a travel ban as had san francisco , california
as a similar bill advances in arkansas , hrc 's warbelow said lawmakers need to take notice
' we hope that the state legislature is paying attention ... and taking seriously that the whole world is looking at them , ' she said .
