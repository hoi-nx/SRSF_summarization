as the days countdown to saturday âs nsw state election , politicians are using every way they can to gain votes , and one of these is to advertise on gay hook - up app , grindr
labor âs penny sharpe , who is looking to become a member of the legislative assembly , and sydney state independent mp greenwich are both using the app in a bid to get as many votes as possible
the two gay politicians are following up on the example set by greens candidate hibbins who won a seat in prahran in november âs victorian state election
labor âs penny sharpe ( left ) and sydney state independent mp greenwich ( right ) are using the grindr app to reach out to the electorate hibbins was one of australia âs first politicians to use hook - up apps as a method to reach voters successfully
he used the grindr app to send political messages to members of melbourne âs prahran electorate , living in the suburbs of prahran , windsor , south yarra and st kilda east , as the candidate campaigns ahead of the election
the star observer reports that sharpe was using the app on a trial basis for this election
' it âs not a space i play in regularly , ' said ms penny sharpe , who is standing as labor âs candidate in the inner west seat of newtown
ms penny sharpe and mr greenwich both placed ads on grindr to encourage people to vote for them ' but i âm sure that some of my volunteers have profiles
' for us , it âs a totally new way of talking to people and we know there are lots of people who are nât as engaged
' mr greenwich also said that it was the first time that he had used the app to reach out to the electorate
but if it proved successful he would nât rule out using other apps in the future
ms penny sharpe âs ads were paid for out of her campaign funds while mr greenwich âs is courtesy of campaign group out for

â this election we 're using grindr to reach voters in prahran , ' mr hibbins wrote on his facebook page before the victorian state election last november
' we 'll be using it to promote events , our support for equality and broader policies
