update : hyla said in an phone interview monday that his interview with blanchett was mischaracterized when an edited version went viral around the web last week
" she was n't upset , " he told cnn
" when you watch the entire interview in the full context , you can see she instigates a lot of the ridiculousness that ensues in the interview
" blanchett ended the interview laughing , hyla said , and " she was in on the joke
" this article has been updated and includes the unedited interview
if you 're going to interview blanchett , please have some good questions prepared
blanchett was talking to hyla of the australian tv show " the project " in conjunction with " cinderella , " but hyla 's offbeat questions led to an awkward few minutes
hyla thought he 'd begin the interview on a casual note , saying blanchett would be a good person to have a beer with
blanchett was having none of it
" this date is not going well ; i do not drink beer , " she responded
after some more back - and - forth , with an apparently sometimes testy , sometimes punchy blanchett trying to steer the topic of conversation back to the film , hyla finally tried another angle
" how were you able to get that cat to do what you wanted ( it ) to do on a leash ? " he asked about a cat blanchett 's nasty stepmother has in the film
" i tried to put my girlfriend 's cat on a leash , and it just never works for me
" that was enough for blanchett
" that 's your question ? that 's your f * * * ing question ? " she asked
she stood up and awkwardly presented her hand
he later posted that it was " the best worst interview i 've ever done
" hyla later tweeted the unedited interview after an edited version went viral .
