newcastle head coach carver says the pressure is all on everton and their under - fire boss roberto martinez ahead of sunday âs meeting at goodison park
carver was on merseyside to witness the everton come from behind to win 2 - 1 against dynamo kiev in the last 16 of the europa league on thursday night
but he was taken aback by the level of unrest on the terraces after they fell behind early on
carver sympathised with his opposite number roberto martinez , but insists everton are under pressure carver 's newcastle side are relatively safe in 11th place , but everton are still too close to the relegation zone roberto martinez has come under fire from fans as he tries to balance premier league survival with european football â i 've got to be honest , it was pretty daunting
i was there with steve stone and dave watson , an everton legend , and he 'd never seen that before - he found it quite strange , â said carver
â so i âve said to my players that all the pressure is going to be on everton at goodison park
â they coped with it well in the end and got a good goal and dominated the second half
they deserved credit for coming back to win
â but there âs no pressure on us , the players can go and express themselves
â everton are 16th in the premier league after a campaign disrupted by their participation in europe
carver was shocked by the levels of unrest when oleg gusev put dynamo kiev ahead on thursday night newcastle travel to everton on sunday looking for only their second win in the last six league games and carver has sympathy with roberto martinez given his own experience of a relegation battle in 2013 as newcastle juggled the demands of a europa league schedule
â it âs difficult to balance the demands of the europa league and we can vouch for that when you âve got a squad like we had then and they have now , it âs very difficult , â he said
â they âve played 14 games more than us
only the sides with huge squads will cope
it needs to go back to a knockout competition
