prosecutors in the capital murder trial of an alabama woman charged in the death of her granddaughter compared her to a drill sergeant for forcing the 9 - year - old girl to run nonstop for three hours in opening statements today
joyce garrard is accused of punishing 9 - year - old savannah hardin for lying about eating candy on the school bus by making her run while carrying sticks and firewood at the family 's home in etowah county in 2012
garrard , 49 , could face the death penalty or life without parole if convicted
defense attorney bone tried to raise doubt about medical evidence in the case by showing jurors a version of the indictment , which mentioned severe dehydration and seizures
however , bone said savannah died because of a fatally low sodium level
he said the evidence will show the girl had too much water in her system , not that she was dehydrated
bone told jurors that prosecutors â have oversold their case to the world
â â they 're trying to hoodwink you with junk science , â he said
â make them prove their case
â according to prosecutors , neighbors said garrard yelled at the girl as she ran , forcing her to continue â like some kind of drill sergeant
â at one point , a neighbor saw the girl vomiting on her hands and knees , begging to stop , reid said
when paramedics arrived , they found savannah on the ground , â freezing cold to the touch , â her clothes and shoes soaking wet , reid said
garrard never told the medics that the girl had been running ; she said only that the girl collapsed in the yard
the 9 - year - old was rushed to a birmingham hospital , where she later died from dehydration and low sodium , a condition common in marathon runners
savannah was n't supposed to eat chocolates because she was on medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had a bladder problem , but she had eaten candy on the school bus the day before she died
garrard was angry that savannah ate the candy â â but she was more upset about the lie , â reid said

the former 's trial begins today surveillance video from a school bus shown to a jury showed garrard talking with the bus driver , holmes , about savannah taking candy without paying from another student who was selling it
garrard told holmes : â she 's going to run until i tell her to stop
she 's gon na learn
â the women then talk about a bladder condition the girl had and a procedure she had related to that condition
the driver then asks , â is she ok ? " garrard replies : â she might be when i get about four more bottles of water in her
â garrard said savannah was ' in double trouble ' because she took the candy without paying and because she lied about it
holmes said in court that she saw the girl picking up sticks in the yard but did not see her running
â i feel partly responsible
i should have paid for those candy bars , â holmes said
opening statements followed a jury selection process that lasted nearly three weeks
