dembele does not believe tottenham should alter their attacking mindset , despite crumbling against manchester united
mauricio pochettino 's first season at the white hart lane helm has been fairly successful to date , having led tottenham to the capital one cup final and a shot at champions league qualification
however , their chances of a top - four finish were harmed on sunday as a first - half collapse saw the north londoners fall to a 3 - 0 defeat at old trafford
dembele ( left ) and his team - mates walk off the pitch after defeat by manchester united at old trafford dembele insists tottenham do not need to adjust their attacking style against the premier league 's big boys the display led onlookers to suggest - not for the first time - that mauricio pochettino 's attack - minded philosophy was foolhardy in a such match , yet midfielder dembele defended his manager 's tactics
' we 've played some games against the top teams where we played unbelievable attacking football , ' the belgium international said
' we do n't have to change anything at the moment because we are capable of beating the big teams
harry kane has a shot at goal against manchester united but the in - form striker could n't find the back of the net mauricio pochettino 's side are seventh in the premier league table and six points off fourth place ' we did n't do it at old trafford and that game was different from what we are used to , but we are playing well
we have shown this season what we can do against the big sides
' we want to end the season in a good rhythm
has our chance of a top - four finish gone ? we do n't need to think like that otherwise we could become demotivated
let 's try to win all our remaining games and see where we end
' we have three more full days before the leicester game to concentrate
we have a good group and a good mentality so i hope we bounce back at the right moment
