mark duggan : linked to ten shootings and two murders before he was shot and killed by police while travelling in a minicab violent gangster mark duggan â whose death sparked the 2011 riots â was holding a gun when a police marksman opened fire , a report concluded yesterday
an exhaustive three - and - a - half year investigation by the police watchdog completely exonerated the firearms officer who shot duggan of any wrongdoing
the 500 - page report concluded that the marksman , known only as v53 , used â reasonable and proportionate force â and said that there is no â reliable evidence â to undermine his account
and it backed v53 âs version of events : that he shot duggan because he saw a gun and thought the gangster was about to open fire
last year an inquest ruled that duggan was lawfully killed â but the jury concluded that he had dropped the gun some time before he was shot
however , yesterday âs report by the ipcc said the gangster was holding the gun and was â in the process of throwing it to his right as he was shot â
the ipcc said it based its conclusions on the evidence from the inquest and extra evidence which it obtained later
in the aftermath of duggan âs death , supposed witnesses claimed they saw police marksmen shoot him after he had already given himself up
one claimed she saw police officers plant a gun at the scene minutes after the shooting
all of these accounts were rejected by the ipcc because the accounts were riddled with inconsistencies
the investigation also rejected claims made by duggan âs mother pamela and girlfriend precious douaihy that officers tampered with evidence and lied in their witness statements
before his death , duggan , 29 , was considered to be one of britain âs most violent gangsters who was linked to ten shootings and two murders
aftermath : duggan 's body lies in the street moments after he was killed
a report today ruled that he had run from the minicab holding the gun wrapped in a sock , at which point officers opened fire he was placed under surveillance in august 2011 after officers learnt he was about to pick up a gun from kevin hutchinson-foster , an associate , in leyton , east london
after duggan had collected the weapon , the minicab in which he was travelling was stopped by armed police during the evening rush - hour in tottenham , north london
the ipcc rejected wild conspiracy theories and inaccurate witness statements , which were promoted by mark duggan âs supporters
the father - of - four , who had taken the party drug ecstasy , then ran out of the toyota minicab holding the gun , the report said
duggan was shot twice by v53 after the officer saw him raise a gun wrapped in a sock towards him
one bullet hit the gangster in his right bicep and the other hit him in the chest
when stopped by police he was carrying a bbm bruni starter pistol that had been converted into a â lethal â handgun capable of firing 9mm bullets
the marksman has repeatedly said that it was his â honestly held belief â that duggan was about to shoot him and his colleagues
â the world just stopped in my head , â he told the inquest
â it âs like a freeze frame moment
the only thing i was focusing on is the gun
â duggan âs death triggered four days of rioting and looting across england , leading to five deaths and Â£ 200million of damage
more than 1,400 were later jailed over the riots
the ipcc report found that scotland yard âs decision to place duggan under surveillance was â logical and legitimate â because he was â coming to prominence â as an active member of the notorious tottenham mandem gang
it also said that undercover officers were right to stop duggan when he was in the minicab
after studying more than 1,200 documents , 500 witness statements and 340 exhibits , it found â no indication of misconduct for any armed officer involved â
but it recommended that police forces should use audio and video equipment to record undercover operations so they can provide an â accurate and incontrovertible â record of what happened
ipcc deputy chairman rachel cerfontyne said : â our findings are based on the best available evidence , checked and cross-checked
â last night , the duggan family released a statement in which they claimed the report â confirms their belief that the ipcc are unfit for purpose â
the family described the watchdog âs conduct as â a chronicle of inefficiency and incompetence â .
