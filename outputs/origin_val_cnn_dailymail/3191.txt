archaeologists who visited the cave at the weekend say the coins were minted at the beginning of the hellenistic during the reign of alexander the great

speaking about the latest discovery , a spokesman for the israel antiquities authority said : ' the valuables might have been hidden in the cave by local residents who fled there during the period of governmental unrest stemming from the death of alexander the great , a time when the wars of the diadochi broke out in israeli between alexander the great âs heirs following his death
' presumably the cache was hidden in the hope of better days , but today we know that whoever buried the treasure never returned to collect it
' mr hen had been exploring the cave , the exact location of which is being kept secret , with his father lior halony and their friend lior halony two weeks ago
the group had spent several hours exploring the narrow passages in the cave when hen forced his way into a narrow niche and spotted the coins glinting in the light of his head torch
