a big service is one of the hallmarks of his game â now murray is taking a similar approach to his wedding
the tennis star and fiancÃ©e kim will tie the knot at dunblane cathedral and not , as anticipated , in the tiny chapel at his cromlix house hotel , near the perthshire town where he grew up
for the 27 - year - old âs many fans and friends in the town , it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport , played out on the streets of the community
for many , the decision to hold the service in the cathedral will have added poignancy
now dunblane âs most famous son will marry there â 19 years after he hid under the headteacher âs desk until the shooting stopped
it is understood local residents and businesses urged the former wimbledon champion to hold the april 11 service at the cathedral rather than at cromlix house hotel in nearby kinbuck â so they too could toast his big day
the 300 - seat , 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at cromlix house hotel , which seats only 28
thousands are expected to line high street on the day
murray âs uncle niall erskine said : â i âm sure it will be a popular decision , as he âs had so much support from the people of dunblane in the past
â murray is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to dunblane
i âm sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day
â the cathedral âs minister , the rev colin renwick , said : â i ca nât confirm anything as we have a strict rule that we can not discuss anyone âs wedding
â wherever the wedding will be , there is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for murray in dunblane and a great deal of pride in him
i think people are genuinely very pleased for him
â old and new : murray will get married to kim at dunblane cathedral ( left ) rather than the small chapel attached to cromlix house hotel ( right ) where the reception is still expected to be held the couple announced their engagement in november after nine years together
they had been expected to wed at the 15 - bedroom cromlix house hotel , which he bought for Â£ 1.8million in 2013
but it will still host family and friends before and after the service
murray âs schoolfriend stewart mcclymont , 28 , said : â it âs great
there will be loads of people in the streets
it will be like a scottish version of the royal wedding
