when all these people support you , you want to be able to perform
' he 's probably the most dangerous guy in the division in my opinion
i think he â s a great competitor
he âs got a solid , well - rounded game , he âs a great kickboxer , amazing jujitsu , i just feel like his biggest strength is his heart
he does nât quit , he just keeps coming
. ' his biggest weakness is that he âs never fought a guy like me
i feel like my angles and the things i throw in the octagon are second to none
i need a knockout , it âs been a long time since my last knockout and i âm not going past the first round
' he 's a good fighter , but i 'm a great fighter
' dos anjos has won his last three bouts , including a stunning first - round knockout of benson henderson last august
and he has no fear about being the underdog once again
' i am going to go in there and take my belt , ' he said
' i do not know how the fight is going to go , but i know it will not go to the judges
i will not allow the judges to decide and it will not go five rounds
' i will pressure him like i pressure all my fights
i will be ready for his style and he will not be ready for my power
i am going in there to take my belt
that is all i want from him
' i am very excited to be the first lightweight champion from brazilian
the belt has a date to be mine and that will be saturday
it 's in god 's hands
' it does not bother me to be an underdog
i am an underdog in most of my fights
maybe it is a good thing for me , he has all the pressure

' they [ the fans ] see me as the champion because i 'm going to be on saturday anyway , ' she said
' i think carla is just focused on her wrestling and i 've already shown i can beat that
so , good luck to her
' the ufc saw that i 'm ready and i can handle it [ the title shot ]
i was born for this
i 'm comfortable and i 'm treating it as any other fight
' but esparza plans to upset the pole 's party with an early finish
' i 'm hoping the fight is going to go how everyone thinks it 'll go ; grappler takes striker down and grappler wins
my goal is to do it in under 14 seconds , ' she said
' i feel like i 'm most likely going to have the strength advantage ; i feel like with longer , lankier athletes they 're not as strong as athletes with my build
' i only care about winning fights ; i do nât care about the hype or promotion behind it
if i 'm not the champ the hype and talk does n't matter
' i think female mma is the biggest female sport out there
we 're being put on the same stage as the men and sometimes headlining in ronda [ rousey âs ] case
we 're on top right now
