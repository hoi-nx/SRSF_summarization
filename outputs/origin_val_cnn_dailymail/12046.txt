putin has appeared on television for the first time in a week amid health fears and suggestions that he is being subject to a coup , while rumours persist that his 31 - year - old ' girlfriend ' is about to give birth
putin , 62 , had cancelled several planned meetings during the week leading to speculation over his health and even claims that he was fighting to retain his position
channel ntv showed footage of putin meeting with supreme court president vyacheslav lebedev , which it claims was shot on friday
putin is due to meet with the president of kyrgyzstan in st petersburg on monday according to the kremlin
the russia president was last seen in public on march 5
for the past week , the russia government has been reluctantly answering questions about putin 's health and suggestions that his unofficial girlfriend alina kabayeva had checked into a swiss maternity clinic
rumours about 31 - year - old alina kabayeva surfaced with reports in swiss , italian and russia suggesting the gymnast had either given birth or was about to do so
it comes amid increased speculation over what has happened to putin with the russia leader not having been seen for a week
alluring : many russia consider alina kabayeva the country 's undeclared first lady the claims focused on an elite clinic in lugano , in the italian region of the neutral country , with some accounts saying she had a new daughter
putin 's spokesman - who has never confirmed a relationship between the 62 year old strongman and the olympic gold - medal winner - insisted : ' information about the birth of putin 's child does not correspond to reality
' the russia embassy in kiev refused to comment on a report on the speculation in newspaper blick
russia tatler yesterday repeated gossip that alina kabayeva has two children already by putin but adds there is no official confirmation
alina kabayeva has been largely out of sight since quitting as an mp in putin 's united russia party last september , when she took over as head of a major media conglomerate
meanwhile , the kremlin today issued a new picture showing putin meeting the chairman of the supreme court vyacheslav lebedev at his out - of - moscow residence novo-ogaryovo
the image was meant to scotch suggestions that putin was not at work amid speculation over a coup or illness
however , there were immediate claims the picture and tv footage was old , and that it was further evidence of his mystery absence
current rumours in moscow include putin suffering a stroke , or an unfolding palace coup , following his sudden cancellation of a scheduled trip to kazakhstan
with moscow in febrile mood , a former senior aide to the strongman claimed another ex-kgb spy is being urgently lined up to take over from him
the theory suggests the kremlin 's chief of staff sergei ivanov - a former defence minister - will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre medvedev
after this switch , dubbed a ' conspiracy of generals ' , putin - currently the subject of swirling rumours over his health after not being seen in public for more than a week - would be swiftly ousted
under the russia constitution , in the event of a president leaving office , the prime minister replaces him in an acting role pending elections
this latest forecast of an imminent sea change in russia politics came from illarionov , putin 's former chief economics aide , who last year predicted putin 's land grab against ukraine three weeks before it happened
while the kremlin insists putin is healthy and in full control of his government , illarionov claimed : ' in the next few days we should expect the resignation of prime minister medvedev , and sergei ivanov being appointed in his place
' after this , ' the public is likely to be informed that the national leader ( putin ) needs a well deserved rest '
putin hands flowers to olympic gold medal - winning gymnast alina kabayeva after awarding her with an order of friendship at an award ceremony in the kremlin in 2001 it has been claimed russia 's former defence minister sergei ivanov ( pictured ) will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre medvedev observers note that in recent days , sergei ivanov - who retained the military rank of colonel general and whose eldest son was killed in a mysterious drowning accident in dubai last november - has been little seen in public
and medvedev , who served as president for four years to 2012 , is also out of the limelight
some kremlin - watchers say that western sanctions have created huge tensions inside putin 's fractious entourage in recent weeks , with cash streams closed off
the murder of opposition leader boris nemtsov - branded a ' provocation ' by putin - has only intensified the infighting with blame for his slaying blamed on the president 's close allies in chechnya
illarionov , a senior follow at the cato institute in washington , earlier alleged a cover - up by the russia authorities over boris nemtsov 's shooting yards from the kremlin
putin is said by his spokesman dmitry peskov to be ' exhaustively ' working on documents but has - most unusually - not been seen publicly since 5 march , more than a week

the former gymnast is rumoured to be the president 's girlfriend the kremlin insists he is healthy , but this has done nothing to end speculation from russia who for years were lied to over the health of geriatric soviet leaders , and also putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin
' peskov 's assertion that putin is in good health , however , could also mean recent developments in russia politics required putin 's presence in moscow , ' stated the moscow times today
' a heightening of the conflict in eastern ukraine and the murder of opposition politician boris nemtsov , the investigation into whose death was reportedly accompanied by signs of an increased power struggle within the russia administration , could have kept putin busy behind closed doors
' in december , putin brushed aside claims he could be overthrown
' i can assure you that we do n't have palaces , so a palace coup is n't really possible
the official presidential residence is the kremlin
it is well protected , ' he said
sergei ivanov , at 62 the same age as putin , was a career kgb who studied english in ealing during the cold war
he is wooden in his public appearances and lacks putin 's common touch with ordinary russia .
