it 's the call centre accused of plaguing uk with an incredible six million calls a day
now mail on sunday can reveal the chequered background of the man responsible â involving disputes with famous names and a string of failed businesses
church is the main shareholder in a company that is currently under investigation for bombarding its victims , including the elderly and vulnerable , with unsolicited nuisance calls selling debt management and payment protection insurance ( ppi ) claims services
earlier this month the cold - call ' factory ' based at an anonymous business complex in hove , east sussex , was raided by the information commissioner 's office , which is responsible for the enforcement of the data protection act
church is the main shareholder in a company that is currently under investigation for bombarding its victims , including the elderly and vulnerable , with unsolicited nuisance calls the firm is reported to hold a staggering 90 million phone numbers that it repeatedly calls using sophisticated technology
mr church has a decidedly questionable past that includes : mr church began his career as an entrepreneur in the mid- 1980s in brighton , where he lived until recently with his wife in a Â£ 1.6 million property
the 54 - year - old has been the director of 19 companies , mostly relating to the publishing industry
but official records show that 18 of these firms have been dissolved , owing Â£ 3.4 million to creditors
in 2009 mr church was banned by the department for business for four years from setting up another business after it was discovered that four of his firms had failed to pay taxes and national insurance payments totalling Â£ 120,000
nuisance : anne diamond took legal action against church church was the target of anne diamond 's fury over a comic strip
ms anne diamond , left , and her then husband mike hollingsworth brought legal action against church 's company , humour publications , following a cartoon in zit magazine
it imagined an affair between ms anne diamond and football legend jack charlton that resulted in a baby resembling et â the infant was shown in a cot
the tv star took offence because it came out shortly after the tragic cot death of her four - month - old son sebastian
mr church 's lawyer , matthew higdon , said the cartoon went to press before the death of ms anne diamond 's child , adding : ' the timing was therefore most unfortunate and entirely unintended by the editor
the action was settled on that basis and for the sake of expediency
' a spokesman for church said : ' he was left mortified over the situation
' the complaint was settled , and that decision was the correct course of action
' a representative for ms anne diamond confirmed that action was brought against the magazine
mr church has also been the subject of a number of legal actions involving high - profile names
the first of these lawsuits was brought by ms anne diamond and her then husband , tv executive mike hollingsworth , in 1991 over what they believed to be an offensive cartoon published in a magazine owned by mr church
in 1996 , he landed in hot water again when his company celebrity publications brought out boyzone 's official magazine
the pop band 's management said they planned to sue the firm when the magazine folded after one issue , leaving angry teenage fans who had paid a Â£ 30 subscription fee out of pocket
at the time , the band 's manager , john reynolds , said : ' we are disgusted with celebrity publications and their disregard for boyzone fans
the whole matter is in the hands of our lawyers
celebrity publications were recommended to us because they also handled the official east 17 magazine
' mr church caused more controversy when he launched a monthly ' lads ' mag ' in 2004 called sorted that offered advice on shoplifting and taking ecstasy
but this also proved to be a doomed venture and folded after four editions , owing thousands of pounds and unpaid wages to staff
despite his financial troubles , mr church is now the majority owner of a call centre that the information commissioner 's office says has cornered a sizeable proportion of the cold - call market
clancy , from the information regulator , said
' it is astounding to think that this one small company has the ability to pester millions of people with unwanted calls on a huge scale
' the firm is based at the gemini business centre in hove and shares its address and directors with several other cold - call companies
for legal reasons , the company being investigated can not be named
the information commissioner 's office launched an investigation into the centre after receiving reports that its staff had been phoning people who had asked not to receive unsolicited sales or marketing calls
the watchdog suspects the firm used automatic dialling technology to make up to six million nuisance calls a day
these calls resulted in ' millions upon millions ' of anonymous messages being left on people 's home phones and mobiles with offers about debt management and ppi claims services
the information commissioner 's office said the company invited victims to press 9 to speak to a call handler regarding a ppi claim , or 5 to stop the calls
but investigators for the watchdog said there was evidence that those who pressed 5 continued to be harassed
mr clancy added : ' i have never seen an operation of this size
those targeted will have included the elderly or people vulnerable for other reasons
we received a vast number of complaints from hundreds of people who were frightened by these calls
' the information commissioner 's office confiscated paperwork and computer equipment during its raid on march 12 and is considering what further action to take
church once took thousands of pounds in subscription fees from teenage boyzone ( pictured , file photo ) fans for a magazine that folded after one issue last night , conservative mp jackie doyle-price , who is a member of the all-party parliamentary group on nuisance calls , called for firms to be ' named and shamed
' she said : ' you will then find out who is behind them and the chances are that anyone who 's prepared to make nuisance calls is probably playing fast and loose with the law elsewhere
' we also need to be taking action against those companies using nuisance calls to generate business
' mr church 's lawyer , matthew higdon , insisted there had been ' no formal allegation , charge or complaint ' received by his client or any companies associated with him
he said neither mr church nor his companies had ' received any notification as to any investigation by the information commissioner 's office or any other regulatory authority '
the raid comes ahead of the introduction of new powers on april 6 that will make it easier for the information commissioner 's office to fine rogue cold - call companies up to Â£ 500,000
recent figures show that 30 million uk receive up to a billion nuisance phone calls and text messages every year
the new powers due to come into force follow a sustained campaign by the information commissioner 's office to make it easier to fine companies found to be making nuisance calls
the information commissioner 's office has struggled to punish rogue firms because of the requirement to prove the business had caused ' substantial damage or distress '
but now the regulator simply has to demonstrate a firm has been a significant nuisance to apply fines of up to Â£ 500,000
an information commissioner 's office spokesman said : ' this law change is a game - changer
the mail on sunday has exposed firms using cold calls in the past
in 2013 , our undercover investigation revealed how one company , lead performance limited , had phoned thousands of people to persuade them to release money from their pensions without warning of the risk of large losses
by michael powell nuisance calls are being taken to new levels of absurdity by firms that telephone the public uninvited â to offer services to stop cold calls
but what many people do not realise is that a safeguard against cold calls is already available for free through the government - backed telephone preference service ( tps )
two firms offering to block cold calls have recently been placed on a monitoring list of the information commissioner 's office ( information commissioner 's office )
the list features the 20 ' worst ' culprits based on the number of complaints and information from consumer organisations
cold call elimination 's director is leah masters ( pictured ) , 31 , who is pictured on facebook enjoying holidays in las vegas and marbella , cold call elimination has been warned it is on the regulator 's radar amid allegations that staff gave the impression they were calling from bt to offer a government - backed scheme
the firm offers services priced between Â£ 34.99 and Â£ 129.99 that include fitting a ' call - blocker ' device to landlines to stopping unwanted calls from uk and foreign numbers
however , anyone can register for free with the tps
firms making calls without prior consent to people signed up to the tps are breaking the law

the company denies any wrongdoing and says it follows all trading standards practices
it is not under investigation but is being ' monitored ' by the information commissioner 's office , which could order a full probe if it suspects illegal practices or non-compliance with cold - calling regulations
the firm denies its staff have alluded to being from bt or offering a government service
it says it gets numbers from companies that sell data but intends only to contact people who have ' opted in '
nuisance call prevention service is also on the information commissioner 's office monitoring list
it did not respond to repeated requests for comment
double - glazing firm zenith has also been placed on the information commissioner 's office list
the company is owned by hi sales , whose chief executive is blackhurst , co-owner of sale sharks rugby side sale sharks
a legal spokesman for mr blackhurst denied zenith has had a ' significant number of caller complaints ' or had ' acted in breach of the relevant regulations '
he added that mr blackhurst had no operational involvement in zenith .
