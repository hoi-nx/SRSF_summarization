a woman who was raped by bayley has told of her terrifying encounter with the killer , 11 years before he attacked and murdered bayley
a sex worker who was raped and abandoned naked in a melbourne street by bayley detailed the horrific incident
he called her a ' f * * king slut ' and again threatened to kill her if she reported the attack
bayley reportedly then stripped her naked and dumped her in a lane - way
the woman said she recognised bayley immediately when the haunting cctv footage of bayley flashed across her television screen
a prison psychologist told bayley found pleasure in hurting and dominating his victims ' that 's him ... that 's definitely him , ' she reportedly said
details of the attack emerged after bayley 's horrifying history with sexual assault and violence came to light
on thursday , he was convicted of a further three rapes committed in 2000 and in the months before ms meagher died
the predator - who pleaded guilty to raping and murdering bayley in 2012 - with a gross sexual appetite may have understood his victims ' fear
as a child , bayley was abused physically and possibly sexually
bayley was born edwards on july 14 , 1971
he grew up in melbourne with four younger siblings and an abusive father , who once smashed his son 's head through a wall
bayley told a prison psychologist he was also sexually abused from age nine to 15 by an older female , though this claim has not been verified
but he may have understood what his victims ' pain as he was physically and possibly sexually abused ' there is certainly evidence of physical abuse - in my opinion , some evidence of the possibility of sexual abuse , ' psychologist ogloff later told victoria county court
a composite of bayley released by police professor ogloff believes bayley 's borderline personality disorder contributes to his impulsiveness and unstable self image
bayley fantasises about assuming power and control over his victims , and the psychologist believes he derives pleasure from inflicting pain
his criminal record suggests this is the case
in total , bayley has raped or attempted to rape 12 different women from 1991 to 2012
his first rape was committed just months after he walked down the isle in 1990 , and a string of sexual assaults soon followed
bayley spent almost two years in prison before being released in 1993 when he trained as a pastry chef
bayley had two children with his first wife before they split
he married again , fathering another two children
he changed his last name from edwards to bayley in 2000 , but returned to violent sexual crimes
in the early 2000s there were reports to police that a young , fit man was targeting prostitutes in st kilda
he would drive them to a laneway , park so his victims could not escape , and then brutally rape them
when a judge jailed him in 2002 , he said bayley used threats and violence to satisfy his ' gross sexual appetite '
bayley was released on parole in 2010 , and was working as a labourer in 2012 when he attacked again
this time he killed bayley who was just 500 metres from her house when she was snatched , raped and brutally murdered by bayley
the trigger for the murder of bayley was that she disregarded him
' she flipped me off , ' bayley told police , in an attempt to limit his responsibility , ' and that made me angry , because i was actually trying to do a nice thing ' , according to the age
bayley went missing in 2012 while she was walking home in brunswick when she was attacked bayley pleaded guilty to the rape and murder of bayley who is pictured here with her husband , tom but prof ogloff told the court bayley did appear to be sorry
the psychologist said it was quite common for people to be very remorseful , but to persist in engaging in that behaviour
bayley seems to agree with the professor 's analysis
' they should never have let me out , ' bayley told police after confessing to killing ms meagher
