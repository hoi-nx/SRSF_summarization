i 'm moss and i am professor of new testament and early christianity at the university of notre dame
i was an adviser on the " true cross " episode and served as one of the many on - camera experts in cnn 's " jesus " series , which currently airs on sundays
viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the " finding jesus " facebook page during the show
below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them
my apologies to everyone i did n't get to
feel free to tweet your questions to me directly
herb scribner : can anyone explain to me what the bible 's deal is with 40 days / nights ? moss : it 's more an interest in the number 40
in the bible the people of israel wander in the wilderness for 40 years before they reach the holy land
the flood lasts for 40 days and nights ; moses spends 40 days and nights on the mountain ; goliath spends 40 days encouraging the israelites to challenge him before david steps up ; 40 is a common age for people to be when they get married ; in the book of judges it is always 40 years between judges ; and david and solomon each reigned for 40 years
what we can take away from all of this is that people in the ancient world saw 40 as suggesting a full , complete period of time
it 's sort of like a narrative stock number , in the way that modern jokes follow the rule of three
yalanda m. price : was there any division between the followers of jesus and the followers of john the baptist ? moss : one of the interesting things about the relationship between jesus and john the baptist is that john does n't lay down his tools and follow jesus after he baptizes him
nor , it seems , did john 's disciples
they had separate ministries and , while there may have been contact between the two groups , they were also de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace
there are some hints in the new testament that jesus and his followers had to differentiate themselves from john by stating that jesus ' baptism was better ( acts 11:6 ) and countering the idea that jesus was actually john raised from the dead ( matthew 14 ) some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between followers of jesus and followers of john

jeffery graff : can the dna tests on the bones indicate whether he is a jew or even whether he is of the tribe of levi ? moss : i 'm so glad someone brought up dna
the dna tests on the bulgaria bones yielded only mitochondrial dna ( dna passed down by the mother ) , not the more reliable nuclear dna ( the kind of dna referred to in forensic investigations )
in the original study of the bulgaria relics ( of which i was a part ) the mitochondrial dna revealed that the bulgaria relics were of " probable semitic origin
" thinking back to my time in the laboratory with the copenhagen scientists , i recall that the lead investigator estimated that the probability was about 75 %
the episode last night stated things a little too sharply when it said that the bones were from a middle-eastern man
as for the more specific question about the genetics of jewish and members of the tribe of levi : current scientific technology does not reveal this kind of information even if start - up genetic testing companies promise this kind of information
cyndi rosenthal : are there any other historical references of john the baptist outside of the bible ? daniel josã© camacho : any extra-biblical sources that shed light on historical figure of john the baptist ? moss : ( these questions are on a similar topic , so i 've chosen to answer them together
) actually there is external attestation for the life and importance of john the baptist
this is important because it 's fairly rare to find this kind of evidence for ancient figures outside the writings of their followers
the jewish historian josephus mentions john the baptist in his book , " the jewish antiquities
" josephus describes john as a " good man " who possessed " virtue " and had " great influence " over the people
according to josephus , herod put john the baptist to death because he was afraid that he might raise a rebellion
this gives us another -- arguably more historical -- perspective on why john was executed and provides further evidence about just how important john was in his own day
watch the latest full episode anytime on cnngo daniel josã© camacho : wait , how did jesus get " lord 's prayer " prayer from johnny b ? ? ? did n't catch that
moss : i 'm also really glad someone brought this up , because i wondered about it too
in the luke , one of jesus ' disciples says , " lord , teach us to pray , as john taught his disciples
" it 's an interesting request that tells us something about john the baptist 's ministry and the demanding characters of jesus ' disciples ! in luke , jesus responds to this request by teaching them the lord 's prayer
we do n't know that the lord 's prayer came from john , and personally i do n't think it did ; i think this is just how luke shaped his version of events
but if you were just reading luke you could come to that conclusion .
