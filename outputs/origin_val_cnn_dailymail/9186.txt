seth has made a heartbreaking plea for people to wear yellow to support him as he waits for a bone marrow transplant , confined to his hospital bed five - year - old seth has one wish - for the world to wear his favourite colour , yellow
the brave youngster lives in a ' bubble ' and can only dream of life outside the confines of his hospital room
he is bound to his bed by a rare immune disorder , which has made the outside , germ - infested world his enemy
seth was born without an immune system and has lived in a sterile environment for more than half of his short life
following an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant , his immune system turned on him once again
since january the five - year - old has been forced to live in his hospital room
as he waits for a life - changing second bone marrow transplant seth has made a heartbreaking video , watched by more than two million people , in which he appeals for people to show their support
using speech boards the adorable youngster asks people to wear yellow on march 27 , and post a picture on twitter , facebook or instagram with the hashtag # wearyellowforseth
seth 's parents , leanne and nik lane , from corby in northamptonshire , said they have been astonished when the video went viral , with more than 2.5 million views in a matter of days
hundreds of thousands of strangers have already pledged to wear yellow to show seth they are thinking of him
the video features a smiling seth perched on his bed holding up yellow cards asking for support
he said : ' hello i 'm seth
i 'm five - years - old and i love fireman sam , paw patrol and yellow
' i 'm in hospital , i was born with no immune system , and i need a second bone marrow transplant
' on march 27 lots of people are going to wear yellow to show me how much support i have
are you going to join in ? ' post a picture of you wearing yellow to facebook , twitter or instagram with # wearyellowforseth
' mrs lane , a full - time mother - of - two , said : ' we never meant to start any sort of campaign , and only expected friends and family to join in
' i ca n't believe it has taken off like this
the condition , known as ' bubble disease ' requires sufferers to live in a sterile ' bubble ' ' i do n't think there is a single country in the world that has n't got someone who has got involved
' it all helps show seth that people are thinking of him
i told him about the views and he asked , " is it more than 20 ? ' i said " yes it is " and he said " wowee "
' seth was admitted to hospital at the age of six months with an extreme chest infection
his parents were told he had severe combined immunodeficiency
known as ' bubble boy disease ' it is caused by a mutated gene and means the body 's antibodies can not respond to infections , leaving sufferers extremely vulnerable to germs
he was transferred to great ormond street hospital where he had a bone marrow transplant from donor umbilical cord cells
but he was kept in a ' bubble ' - unable to interact with children , go to nursery or play outside in parks - for two years while his body got stronger
mrs lane , who has a five - month - old son hugo with her husband , nik , 31 , said : ' he had no contact with other children until he was two - and - a - half
' we would go out in the pram and i would have to put the rain cover over him with a little fan inside - people probably thought i was mad
' but after just a couple of years of normality - after seth had started school and made his first best friends - his body turned on him in october
when he had his transplant as a baby he developed graft versus host disease - where his donated cells saw his own body cells as foreign and attacked them
a first bone marrow transplant failed , when his immune system turned on him
it means seth is now confined to his hospital room once more , waiting for a second transplant his father nik lane is set to be seth 's donor , and doctors are waiting until the five - year - old is well enough before performing the operation seth 's parents recorded an adorable video of him holding up screen cards , appealing for people to wear his favourite colour , yellow , to show their support
it has so far been viewed by more than two million people initially , it only affected his skin - leaving him with painful red patches - but in october it turned on his own bone marrow , once again wiping out his entire immune system
seth returned to his ' bubble ' - an ultra-hygienic single room at newcastle 's great north children 's hospital - in a bid to keep him free from potentially lethal infections , in january
' if i 'm a bit run down and have a coldsore i ca n't touch him , ' said mrs lane
' and if we have a cold we ca n't go in at all
' everything has to be sterilised and his room has filtered air
the staff are scrupulous with cleaning
' nothing can leave the room once it has come in and been cleaned , his soft toys are washed at 60 degrees every couple of days and his bed sheets are boil washed every day
' nik is with him all the time so his clothes have to be washed at 60 every day and seth has never been out the room
' his father - who will be a donor for seth once he is well enough - recorded the video of seth last week
in just six days it has attracted 2,483,855 views and hundreds of thousands of people have messaged mrs lane to say they are planning on wearing yellow
it is thought seth will have his transplant in around six weeks , but will probably have to remain in near - isolation for around a year after the operation
' it 's hard for him , and he is getting bored , but he never complains and he understands , ' said mrs lane
after his operation and around a year in a sterile environment , seth 's parents hope he will be able to play with his friends and little brother again
