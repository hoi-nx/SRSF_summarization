' i want everyone to know i 'm not " the sleaze king " , ' charney told abc 's 20/20
' " the sleaze king " is another guy
' i 've had a minute being on the outside to re-strategize how i want to take the company , you know , control the company again
and i intend to , ' the american apparel founder told abc
he has become infamous for his limit - pushing advertisements in which he 's been criticized for using young models in provocative ads. charney claims the models just look younger than they truly are
' i 'm sure we pushed the envelope too far a couple times , ' he said

' the la - based company 's board voted to oust mr charney as ceo in june , citing allegations of a long list of offenses , including violation of sexual harassment and anti-discrimination policies and misuse of company funds
it also claimed mr charney had repeatedly engaged in conduct which had led to former employees making claims of harassment , discrimination and assault
american apparel said in december that it had terminated his position ' for cause ' after an internal investigation
american apparel , which charney founded in 1989 , manufactures clothes and sells them in 245 of its own retail stores in 20 countries and has about 10,000 employees
charney live in a ten - bedroom mansion in la , but claims he 's been broke since being ousted from his company since then , the montreal - born charney has been the subject of lawsuits that allege he had inappropriate sexual conduct with female employees
he has said he had consensual sexual relationships with workers
in 2011 , a former employee accused charney of keeping her as a teenage sex slave , fearing she could lose her job otherwise
she also sued american apparel and its directors for failing to stop him from acting as a ' sexual predator
' charney denied these claims and the lawsuit was dismissed
in 2012 , charney once again came under fire when bumblis , a former store manager in malibu , california , accused the ceo of rubbing dirt in his face and choking him
charney also allegedly called the man ' a wannabe jew ' and used a derogatory term for homosexuals
bumblis was later fired from his job
the former executive denies bumblis âs allegations and the case was settled in 2015 with a confidential filing
some employees , however , believe that charney is a hero within the company
garment workers have held rallies claiming that he could save the company
since the company was founded it made a name for itself by manufacturing clothing within the united states and paying workers about minimum wage
charney said a ' good worker can make $ 13 , $ 14 bucks and hour ' while at american apparel
inside his master bedroom suite , charney has created a ' war room ' , where he has covered the walls with notes and newspaper clippings as a way to strategize his method of taking back american apparel but as profits began to rise at the company , allegations that charney created a sexually charged and hostile work environment were brought to the table
' i 've never engaged in any activities that could be characterized as sexual harassment , ' he said
charney admits that he slept with employees but claims that everything was consensual
' all those accusations against me are crap , ' he said
' there 's allegations ... we resolved them
none of it - none of these allegations - were ever proven
' he said that he 'd been sued ' maybe a dozen , maybe less ' times for sexual harassment , and that some of the lawsuits were settled while others were dropped
charney has said that the accusations that led to his firing in december 2014 ' are completely false ' and that his termination was ' ridiculous '
' i had been working 365 for 10 years solid , ok ? built a massive brand that captured the imagination of the world , ' he told abc
' then to treat me like that , to throw me on the street ... shame on them , shame on them , that 's my message to them
' abc was able to speak to an american apparel employee only named as ' sam ' , who told them that charney was ' cruel and vindictive '
charney was fired after allegations emerged over his course as ceo , including sexual harassment , misuse of company funds and racist comments ' when you work at american apparel closely with charney , you 're pretty much scared all the time , ' she said
' he will yell at you , call you names , humiliate you until you feel down , broken
' though sam 's statements echoed human resources reports from other employees , charney said that it was just ' one person 's point of view '
' i 'm not going to get along with everybody
this is a tough environment , ' he said , adding that he pushes his ' white collar workers harder '
' i was combative , i was a pushy boss
i was a hammer on my white collar staff , that 's for sure , ' he said

there 's no option there , ' she said
