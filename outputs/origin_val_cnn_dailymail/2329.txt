chelsea took to instagram on saturday to back up their manager and attack the pundits who criticised their behaviour during the champions league exit at the hands of psg in midweek
souness and sportsmail columnist jamie carragher branded mourinho 's team ' a disgrace ' after they surrounded the referee to get zlatan ibrahimovic sent off during the 2 - 2 draw
but afterwards , mourinho accused the pair of having short memories , pointing out both men 's own on - field reputations
mourinho spikily replied to comments made by jamie carragher and souness chelsea players surround bjorn kuipers as the dutch referee gives zlatan ibrahimovic his marching orders and the club have put their weight behind his claims , publishing pictures of both jamie carragher and souness confronting officials from years gone by
the post was captioned with the message ' for those with short memories ... ' , and shows jamie carragher with his liverpool team - mates protesting a decision in 2007 , and souness as benfica manager in the late 1990s
earlier this week mourinho had hit out at both souness and jamie carragher after the defeat to psg on away goals
every outfield chelsea player except oscar was involved in the mass protest during the psg game it was this tackle by the swede on oscar that had the chelsea players swarming round the ref â when jamie carragher and souness speak , it âs because they are having a problem for sure , ' mourinho said
' jamie carragher stopped playing a couple of years ago and , in two years , he forgets everything he did on the pitch
mr souness also , but he stopped playing a long time ago
â i coached benfica , i know a lot about him , so much about him
but i âm a certain kind of education , not just in football but in life , and i prefer to laugh
â jamie carragher responded to the post on twitter , writing : ' i 'm contesting a shocking penalty decision against chelsea which the ref apologised for & souey is backing his players like mourinho does ! ! '
