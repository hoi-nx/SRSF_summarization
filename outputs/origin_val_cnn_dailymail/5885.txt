enjoy a dip in the sea and you risk picking up antibiotic - resistant bacteria
swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching the e.coli bug as they are more likely to swallow contaminated water , a study has suggested
scientists at the university of exeter have warned of the danger after analysing data collected from beaches across england and wales in 2012
they focused on a strain of e.coli bacteria resistant to an important class of antibiotics called third - generation cephalosporins , or 3gcs
swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching the e.coli bug as they are more likely to swallow contaminated water , a study has suggested study leader dr william gaze said : ' we know very little about how the natural environment can spread antibiotic - resistant bacteria to humans , or how our exposure to these microbes can affect health
' people are exposed to antibiotic - resistant bacteria in many ways , through person - to - person contact , via food and as a result of international travel
' our research establishes recreational use of coastal waters as an additional route of exposure
' with millions of people visiting beaches in england and wales each year , there is a risk of people ingesting 3gc resistant e.coli and it looks like water - users ' exposure to all resistant bacteria could be even higher
' if you enjoy a dip in the sea and you risk picking up a strain of e.coli bacteria ( pictured ) resistant to an important class of antibiotics salt in sea water is known to kill off some bacteria , but not all
although only 0.12 per cent of the e.coli found in coastal waters and rivers running on to beaches belonged to the strain , researchers said this was enough to present a ' potential risk '
the study , published in the journal environment international , showed risk of exposure was closely related to the water quality at any given beach
researchers said this demonstrated the importance of the eu 's bathing water directive , which aims to ensure good water quality standards , but added that people should not be put off visiting the seaside .
