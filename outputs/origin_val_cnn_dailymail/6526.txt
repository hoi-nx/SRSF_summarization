bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher a-level subjects , a study shows
researchers found those from disadvantaged families were far less likely to study and score highly in english , maths , science , humanities and languages
pupils who do not take these so - called â facilitating â subjects have less chance of obtaining a place at the prestigious russell group universities , which often favour them
bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher a-level subjects , a study shows ( file picture ) researchers commissioned by the department of education at oxford university also found poor children are much less likely to get three a-levels in any courses
the wide - ranging study also showed that going to a decent nursery , reading for pleasure and attending an outstanding school can boost a disadvantaged pupil 's chances of getting good results
taking part in school trips and getting into a daily homework routine can also help them
the research is based on data drawn from more than 3,000 young people who have been tracked from the age of three for the effective pre-school , primary and secondary education ( eppse ) project
researchers found that just a third of bright but disadvantaged students took one of more a-levels facilitating subjects , compared to 58 per cent of their wealthier peers with the same academic ability
less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a b in these subjects , compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates
the findings also show that just over 35 per cent of the sixth - formers identified as clever based on their test results at age 11 got three a-levels in any subjects , compared to 60 per cent of their high - achieving , richer peers
an analysis of the data found that sixth - formers who did two to three hours of homework each night were nine times more likely to gain three a-levels than those who did none
less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a b in these subjects , compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates ( file picture ) the study said : â spending time on homework is likely to reflect both student motivation and engagement , study skills and independence , school policies and the priority teachers attach to encouraging students to study at home ( or provide opportunities after school ) , as well as parental attitudes and support
â the study concludes that encouraging reading for pleasure , educational trips , the chance to go to a good nursery and school , feedback on school work and a supportive home life can help disadvantaged youngsters to get good results
it suggests that bright , poor students should get â enrichment â vouchers , funded through the pupil premium - public funding for disadvantaged children - to help with educational trips , reading for pleasure and studies outside of the classroom
sir peter lampl , chairman of the sutton trust which commissioned the report , said : â the fact that bright disadvantaged students fall so far behind when they reach their a-levels shows that government and schools urgently need to do more to support able students from less advantaged homes
â we must ensure that access to the best schools and opportunities for academic enrichment outside school are available to all students
it is also vital that schools advise their students on the right subject choices at gcse and a-level so as to maximise their potential
â professor pam sammons , co-author of the report , said : â there is no silver bullet that alone can make a difference but a combination of good schools and pre-schools , the right home learning environment and supportive teachers ready to monitor progress and provide good feedback can all ensure that bright but disadvantaged students get the chance of a good university education
there are important lessons here for teachers and policymakers seeking to reduce the equity gap in attainment
