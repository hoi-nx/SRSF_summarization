ozil might have been in good form since returning from injury this season , but he still needs to be better if arsenal are to challenge for the title , according to gunners legend gilberto
the brazilian , a member of the gunners ' invincibles team , labelled the german ' slow ' and says he has to be more decisive
gilberto acknowledged ozil 's quality , but insists that he needs to start paying off the faith arsene wenger showed by spending Â£ 42.5m to bring him to the emirates stadium from real madrid
ozil has not found things easy since moving to arsenal , but has improved recently ozil has a shot deflected over the bar against everton , and gilberto says he must offer more ' you speak about arsenal and how they do n't spend big money on a player often but they did with ( mesut ) ozil and it is always a bit risky , ' he said
' coming from spain it is tough to adapt , it does n't always happen straight away
' i do really like him as a player but sometimes in the game he does look quite slow , although he has that quality to change the game
' he can be more decisive for arsenal for the quality he has , he can be much more decisive for the club
arsenal have not won the premier league in the 11 years since gilberto and his team - mates went unbeaten , and the 38 - year - old believes they still do n't have the financial firepower to challege chelsea and manchester city
gilberto was a key member of the arsenal team that went an entire premier league season unbeaten in 2004 arsenal have not won the title since their invincible season , but gilberto insists it is now time to challenge but gilberto also stressed that the club should be aiming for the title , and given time arsene wenger can lead his current squad to glory
' arsenal has n't been able to compete with chelsea and manchester city for a few years because they spend money on big names and this is not the arsenal culture ' , said gilberto
' they do n't spend a lot of money to sign players but apart from that it is not easy to find a way to get back on track to win titles
ozil is the gunners record signing , but in general the club has not tried to compete with rich clubs financially the german playmaker will need to improve if arsenal are to mount a serious title challenge , says gilberto ' it was important for them last season that they won the fa cup but a team like arsenal need more and i hope they find a way to achieve what they always look for
' if you look at chelsea , they spent a lot of money on a player like diego costa and he has settled really well and is scoring lots of goals , that has worked for them but it is not as easy for arsenal
' if the players concentrate on their job and pull together they can form a strong team and try to feel good in their play
' sometimes people expect quick results but it does n't always work like that
' brazil v chile is on march 29 at 3pm at the emirates stadium in london
