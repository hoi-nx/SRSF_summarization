following their easy 4 - 0 win against lithuania in friday 's euro 2016 qualifier lions will face a much sterner test when they travel to turin for an international friendly against azzurri on tuesday night
here , sportsmail 's sam cunningham reminds you of 10 classic matches between the two sides
azzurri 1 - 1 lions , may 1933 , friendly ( stadio nazionale del pnf , rome ) this was the first ever meeting between the two sides , most famous for azzurri âs fascist leader mussolini cheering from the stands and being played in a stadium which translated into england as the â national stadium of the national fascist party â
lions âs squad had to travel by train , setting off from london , and boat to get to rome for the match
azzurri âs giovanni ferrari put the home side ahead in the fourth minute , but arsenal striker cliff bastin scored his first lions goal to cancel it out

azzurri defender luis monti broke his foot in only the second minute and it was full of ferocious challenges
azzurri were perhaps spurred on by reports at the time that mussolini had offered the players an alpha romeo and Â£ 150 each if they won
that incentive back - fired when lions went three goals ahead in the first 12 minutes ; eric brook scoring three minutes in , adding a second after 10 and ted drake getting a third
they almost managed to throw it away , allowing guiseppe meazza to score twice in the 58th and 62nd minute , but held on for the win
lions beat azzurri 3 - 2 ' the battle of highbury ' during the second meeting between the two teams in 1934 azzurri 0 - 4 lions , may 1948 , friendly ( stadio comunale , turin ) the italia were still world champions , having won the world cup in 1934 and 1938 and it being cancelled on the next two occasions due to world war two
azzurri âs manager was the great double world cup winner vittorio pozzo , but they were rocked by walter winterbottom âs lions
stan mortensen gave lions a fourth - minute lead , tommy lawton added another and tom finney hit two second - half strikes within two minutes of each other
goalkeeper frank swift , in his first match as captain , pulled off some stunning saves to keep azzurri out with the score at 2 - 0
the result reverberated around the football world
tom finney scores lions 's fourth goal as lions beat azzurri 4 - 0 in turin in 1948 azzurri 2 - 3 lions , may 1961 , friendly ( olympic stadium , rome ) goals from omar sivori and hitchens put the scores level at the break , but sergio brighenti struck another shortly after and with only 13 minutes to play lions were still trailing 2 - 1
that was until hitchens netted his second of the match and with only five minutes remaining former tottenham striker jimmy greaves got the winner
the match was 54 years ago , but still the last time lions beat azzurri on their own soil
lions and azzurri line up at the olympic stadium in rome ahead of the lions ' 3 - 2 win in 1961 lions 3 - 2 azzurri , may 1976 , friendly ( yankee stadium , new york ) lions âs greatest comeback against the italia came in the usa bicentennial cup tournament
they were two goals behind by half - time , both strikes coming from forward francesco graziani
but in a devastating eight - minute spell after the restart lions were in front
former southampton striker mick channon netted a minute from kick off , liverpool defender phil thompson levelled the match two minutes later and in the 53rd minute channon got the winner
lions 's joe royle watches on during lions 's 3 - 1 win against azzurri in new york in 1976 azzurri 2 - 0 lions , november 1976 , world cup qualifier ( olympic stadium , rome ) this was the game which effectively stopped lions qualifying for the 1978 world cup
by the end of the qualifiers , even a draw would have been enough to send them through , but giancarlo antognoni scored first and roberto bettega , set up by a stroke of genius from franco causio , sealed the win for the azzurri
lions won all of their remaining matches and both teams finished the group joint on points , azzurri three ahead on goal difference
it ended the reign of lions manager revie
the azzurri players celebrate as giancarlo antognoni gives them the lead against lions in 1976 lions 2 - 0 azzurri , november 1977 , world cup qualifier ( wembley stadium , london ) the return was meaningless in terms of world cup 1978 qualification , but ron greenwood had succeeded revie as caretaker manager and lions responded to their previous defeat with goals from kevin keegan and trevor brooking
it set up greenwood to go on to the 1982 world cup in spain , where they came home undefeated despite being knocked out in the second group stage of the finals
lions 's trevor brooking beats keeper dino zoff to score lions 's second in the 1977 qualifier azzurri 1 - 0 lions , june 1980 , european championship group stage ( stadio comunale , turin ) azzurri were the home nation for the 1980 european championship , and essentially sent lions home in the second group match with this slim victory
lions badly missed the injured trevor francis and lacked firepower up front
his absence proved costly when marco tardelli sent the crowd wild with a 79th - minute strike
lions managed to beat spain 2 - 1 in their final group match , but , at a time when there were only two groups , it was not enough to help them progress
dino zoff makes a great save as lions are beaten 1 - 0 by azzurri in turin in the 1980 european championship azzurri 2 - 1 lions , july 1990 , world cup third - place playoff ( stadio san nicola , bari ) lions had been agonisingly knocked out of italia â 90 in the semi-finals on penalties by germany , while hosts azzurri suffered the same fate against argentina
it meant they met in the third - place playoff
roberto baggio put azzurri ahead in the 71st minute and 10 minutes later david platt levelled
but four minutes from time , paul parker conceded a penalty which toto schillaci slotted in to finish as tournament top - scorer with six

the stadium was thick with tension - as was a nation back home in england - and in the latter stages ian wright hit a post while azzurri âs christian vieri headed narrowly wide
the result meant azzurri would have to qualify for the tournament via a playoff against russia , but lions were through
paul ince was left bloodied after lions 's battling draw against azzurri to secure qualification for 1998 world cup plus two that live in the memory , for very different reasons â¦ andrea pirlo 's panenka lions 0 - 0 azzurri ( azzurri win 4 - 2 on penalties ) , june 2012 , european cup quarter - final ( olympic stadium , kiev ) the first 120 minutes were not the most glamorous
azzurri tortured lions with possession and produced 31 shots on goal , but roy hodgson âs players produced a lesson in defending , john terry particularly heroic , to take the game to penalties
what made this tie was andrea pirlo âs genius panenka penalty
lions were clinging on in the shoot - out until the azzurri midfielder produced a moment of brilliance , sending joe hart plunging to his right as the ball floated down the middle with a whirlwind of backspin
andea pirlo chips the ball straight down the middle during the euro 2012 quarter - final penalty shootout david beckham 's first game as captain - and seth johnson 's solo cap azzurri 1 - 0 lions , november 2000 , friendly ( stadio delle alpi , turin ) the match was david beckham âs first in charge as captain of the national team - a duty he would continue for many years - but it would end in defeat
sven-goran eriksson was set to take over and was watching from the stands as caretaker boss peter taylor played an experimental side , in which seth johnson earned his one and only lions cap
they lost by a single goal when gennaro gattuso hit an incredible strike in off the crossbar from 30 yards
