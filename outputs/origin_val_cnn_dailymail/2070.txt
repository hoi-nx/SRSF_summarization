vitiligo occurs when the cells that produce melanin , the pigment that determines the color of skin , die or stop functioning
this causes slowly enlarging white patches of irregular shapes to appear on the skin over time
vitiligo affects all races , but may be more noticeable in people with darker skin
the exact cause of the condition is unknown , although many experts believe that it is an autoimmune condition in which the body 's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys certain cells
there is no cure and the goal of treatment , which can include ointments and skin grafts , is to stop or slow the progression of pigment loss
