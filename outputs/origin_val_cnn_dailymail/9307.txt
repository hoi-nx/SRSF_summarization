as a famous actor , juliet stevenson may be used to walking past crowds of adoring fans and the paparazzi on the red carpet
but she was unprepared for the adulation she received while filming a biopic about mother teresa in the slums of india
as she passed through the slums , locals dropped to the ground believing the noble peace prize winner had been brought back to life to care for the poor
' people would come up to me , drop and touch my hem ... in india , she 's still revered
she lifted tens of thousands of people off the streets and into her care
' stevenson , who starred in films such as truly , madly , deeply , the politician 's wife and accused , is heading the cast of the forthcoming feature film about mother teresa , the letters
the biopic explores the life of the saint through letters she wrote to her longtime friend and spiritual advisor , father celeste van exem over a nearly 50 - year period
the letters , published in 2007 , revealed her crisis of faith and the torment of feeling jesus had abandoned her
mother teresa , who died in 1997 aged 87 , became one of the 20th century 's most influential religious figures
she founded an international order - the missionaries of charity - in the slums of calcutta dedicated to the poor , disabled and dying
she won the noble peace prize in 1979 for her role in founding the order and by the time of her death , it had grown to more than 4,000 sisters running orphanages , hospices and charity centres in 133 countries
the film partly draws on mother teresa 's secret letters , published in 2007 revealing her crisis of faith the biopic will be released this year in the hope it coincides with mother teresa 's canonisation stevenson , who is not religious , was initially wary of taking on the role but said it had been a ' wonderful challenge '
to perfect the role , stevenson watched and listened ' endlessly ' to historic recordings of mother teresa
she told the observer : ' it was very daunting , because i 'm so wrong for her
i 'm 5ft 8in , quite strongly built
i 'm not in any way miniature ( mother teresa was only 5ft )
' i do n't have a religious faith and she believed so ardently in god
i also could n't differ from her more when it comes to her views on women 's rights , birth control and abortion ... but it was a wonderful challenge
' there was an early screening of the letters at the vatican , at the international catholic film festival last year
its cast also includes 85 - year - old swedish actor max von sydow and rutger hauer , who won a golden globe award for best supporting actor in escape from sobibor
