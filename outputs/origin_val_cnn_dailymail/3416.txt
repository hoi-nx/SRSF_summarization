president obama wasted little time monday night in blasting wisconsin walker gov. walker for a new state law that bans requiring the payment of union dues as a condition of employment , saying it ' will weaken , rather than strengthen workers
' walker signed the bill into law on monday , making the wisconsin the 25th with such a ' right to work ' law
wisconsin gov. walker signed the measure into law monday
walker is expected to run as a republican candidate for president in 2016
' hours later , he leveraged the issue in a fundraising email
' the big government labor bosses will never forgive me for taking away their power but we are doing the right thing , ' he wrote , asking for donations ranging from $ 10 to $ 1,000
by 9:00 at night , the white house was circulating a statement from obama claimign that walker had notched a ' victory over working america
' if the wisconsin governor were interested in protecting workers , the president said , be would be ' taking meaningful action to raise their wages and offer them the security of paid leave
that âs how you give hardworking middle - class families a fair shot in the new economy
' the nod to wages was a subtle jab at wisconsin for not embracing a white house - led push to raise the minimum wage nationwide
the new wisconsin law , obama claimed , is part of ' a sustained , coordinated assault on unions , led by powerful interests and their allies in government
' wisconsin is the first to enact a right - to - work law since michigan and indiana did it in 2012
the president issued this statement shortly after 9:00 p.m. on monday : ' it âs no coincidence that the rise of the middle class in america coincided in large part with the rise of unions â workers who organized together for higher wages , better working conditions , and the benefits and protections that most workers take for granted today
so it âs inexcusable that , over the past several years , just when middle - class families and workers need that kind of security the most , there âs been a sustained , coordinated assault on unions , led by powerful interests and their allies in government
' so i âm deeply disappointed that a new anti-worker law in wisconsin will weaken , rather than strengthen workers in the new economy
wisconsin is a state built by labor , with a proud pro-worker past
so even as its governor claims victory over working america , i âd encourage him to try and score a victory for working america â by taking meaningful action to raise their wages and offer them the security of paid leave
that âs how you give hardworking middle - class families a fair shot in the new economy â not by stripping their rights in the workplace , but by offering them all the tools they need to get ahead
' opponents of the measure complain that the law will give companies the upper hand and drive down wages
proponents say laws that de-fang powerful unions can bring renewed business investment into a state , creating more jobs
mix , president of the national right to work committee , said the wisconsin law could bring a new wave of imitators in the american midwest â historically strong industrialized regions with robust labor unions
' every worker deserves freedom of choice when it comes to union membership and dues payment , mix said in a statement , ' and if states like michigan and wisconsin can pass right to work then illinois , minnesota , missouri and ohio can too
' not all wisconsin residents are behind walker , most notably labor union bosses and much of their rank - and - file
as legislators passed the new bill on feb. 28 , thousands of opponents braved sub-freezing temperatures to rally outside the state capitol in madison , chanting union slogans and listening to speeches
it was a far cry from larger protests that engulfed the capital city in 2011 when he endorsed a plan to cut $ 1.5 billion of state spending by requiring unionized government workers to fund some of their own health benefits
the proposal , which he later signed into law , also gave school districts the power to hire and fire without regard for seniority , something opposed by teachers unions
getting that legislation to walker 's desk proved problematic , however : at one point 14 democratic party legislators fled the state to nearby chicago , illinois , denying republicans the quorum they needed to hold a vote
he later survived a recall campaign led by unions , collecting more votes than he had during his election to office
halfway there ? with wisconsin 's new right - to - work law , it 's now illegal in half of america 's 50 states to require the payment of union dues as a condition of employment about 5,000 union supporters marched against ' right to work ' legislation on feb. 28 in madison , wisconsin , a fraction of the estimated 100,000 who had massed near the state capitol four years earlier in another anti-scott walker protest walker is now fine - tuning campaign messages in advance of what is expected to be a bruising republican presidential primary season â and many of those talking points have obama in their crosshairs
ten days ago at the conservative political action conference , he lambasted obama for what he said was a weak performance fighting the isis terror army overseas
america needs a leader who ' realizes that radical islamists terrorism is a threat to our way of life and to all freedom - loving people , ' he said ' if i can do that with 100,000 protesters , i can do the same across the world , ' walker later claimed , bringing howls for the comparison of his critics to violent islamists
' he is even less qualified to be president than i thought , ' a democratic party spokesman said in response
the super pac supporting walker , called our american revival , defended the right - to - work law on tuesday
' workforce participation is up in wisconsin because walker is a leader who tackled the tough economic problems left by his predecessor , ' the pac 's spokeswoman kirsten kukowski said in a statement
' right to work is happening because wisconsin supports it but also because it 's pro-growth , pro-freedom and pro-work
