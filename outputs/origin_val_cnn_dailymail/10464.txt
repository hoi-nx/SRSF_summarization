fluffy hedgehogs , rabbits , foxes and bears can be seen sitting down for a picnic on a grassy hill in sylvania while evil jihadists lurk in the background
the bad animals are dressed head to toe in black with masks covering their faces , just like in the series of videos released by the terror group
two can be seen clutching guns while a third is brandishing a knife - jihadi john style - while a koala on a scooter holds an isis flag
terror : the sylvanian family terrorists lurk in the background , brandishing their weapons , in this otherwise idyllic picnic scene the artist behind the creations wanted to use the children 's classics to parody the murderous group
she has used the pseudonym ' mimsy ' to protect her identity and ' avoid any possibility of beheading ' - suggesting she does n't take the satire lightly
the second scene shows a classroom full of the furry creatures looking at equations on the blackboard while the menacing figures can be seen creeping into shot through the windows
although a different terror network , the scene is bound to evoke thoughts of the pakistan school massacre by the taliban late last year
lurking : the black - clad animals can be seen creeping up on the unsuspecting young animals during a lesson a skit mocking isis , produced by us comedy tv show saturday night live , caused backlash in the us with many taking to social media to say ' isis is not a joke
