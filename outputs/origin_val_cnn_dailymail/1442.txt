martin guptill became the first man to score a double hundred in a cricket world cup knockout match and propelled co-hosts new zealand into the semi-finals as they claimed a 143 - run win against west indies
the 28 - year - old batsman was dropped in the first over before going on to score 237 from 163 balls - including 24 fours and 11 sixes , one of which found the roof of wellington 's westpac stadium in the final over
the record - breaking innings , which was the second highest one day international score of all time behind indian rohit sharma 's 264 , helped new zealand to 393 for six

kane williamson had put on 33 before falling to russell , whose wide delivery ended up with chris gayle at short cover

his ton had been put together with a steady succession of fours but his first six arrived in the 36th over as he carted sammy to wide long - on
martin guptill was perhaps guilty of ball - watching when ross taylor was run out for 42 but , despite the fact the mistake would likely be overlooked due to his heroics , he made sure to atone for it by reaching his second 150 in odis with a single off sulieman benn
corey anderson was then caught by an off - pace delivery from russell , shuffling across to pull the ball across to chris gayle at midwicket for 15
martin guptill 's double - ton was within reach and he wasted no time gunning for it , achieving his personal best of 192 with a four off russell before partner grant elliott was dismissed on review
martin guptill ignored that disappointment to fire a four that brought him to 199 , going on to drill russell 's first delivery of the 48th over to long - off for a four that made cricket world cup history
