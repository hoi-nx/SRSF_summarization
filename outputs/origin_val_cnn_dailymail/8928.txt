the u.s. will have to negotiate with syrian president assad for a political transition in syrian and is exploring ways to pressure him into agreeing to talks , u.s. secretary of state kerry has admitted
washington has long insisted that assad must be replaced through a negotiated , political transition , but the rise of a common enemy , hardline militant group islamic state , has evidently softened the administration 's stance towards him
in an interview broadcast on sunday , kerry did not repeat the standard u.s. line that assad had lost all legitimacy and had to go
syrian 's civil war is now into its fifth year , with hundreds of thousands killed and millions of syrian displaced
' we 've always been willing to negotiate in the context of the geneva process , ' he added , referring to a 2012 conference which called for a negotiated transition to end the conflict
kerry said the u.s. and other countries , which he did not name , were exploring ways to reignite the diplomatic process to end the conflict in syrian
' what we 're pushing for is to get him ( assad ) to come and do that , and it may require that there be increased pressure on him of various kinds in order to do that , ' the secretary of state said
new problem : the u.s. has been more willing to deal with assad since the rise to power of isis in syrian and iraq opposition : assad 's regime is under attack from rebel soldiers , such as those above , as well as isis 's hordes ' we 've made it very clear to people that we are looking at increased steps that can help bring about that pressure , ' he added
the u.s. led efforts to convene a united nations - backed peace talks in geneva last year between western - backed syrian opposition representatives and a government delegation
the talks collapsed after two rounds and no fresh talks have been scheduled
russia convened some opposition and government figures in january for talks on the crisis but they yielded little progress and the main opposition coalition boycotted them
' to get the assad regime to negotiate , we 're going to have to make it clear to him that there is a determination by everybody to seek that political outcome and change his calculation about negotiating , ' kerry said
' that 's under way right now
and i am convinced that , with the efforts of our allies and others , there will be increased pressure on assad
syrian sank into civil war after a peaceful street uprising against four decades of assad family rule began in march 2011
the revolt spiraled into an armed insurgency , which has deepened with the rise of islamic state and other hardliners
assad seems more likely to survive the syrian crisis than at any point since it began
iran 's support for assad is as solid as ever , with russia showing no sign of abandoning him
before : u.s. - syrian negotiations have n't always been this strained

washington has said the campaign in syrian is not coordinated with the syrian military , which also views the group as its enemy
the war has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced close to half the population , according to the united nations
damascus accuses its western and gulf arab opponents of seeking to destroy the country by providing aid to an insurgency now dominated by jihadists , who also pose a threat to the west
assad appears to be betting that the u.s. - led campaign against islamic state will force washington to engage with him .
