passengers on a packed train were left shocked after an announcer said fat people should not sit down because of a lack of space
the train was full of commuters when a member of staff reportedly said : ' we are going to be like sardines on this train , so can i ask that only slim people sit on the three - seaters
' if you are fat then it is simply not going to work
' an employee on a busy south west trains told ' slim people ' to sit in three seaters but said for ' fat people ' it ' simply is not going to work ' one angry passenger on the service , which was leaving basingstoke , hampshire , said : ' i am not necessarily a big person but most people are larger than those seats anyway
' it 's pretty disgusting
i would get fired if i said that at my work
' south west trains apologised , saying that if the comment had been made it was ' unacceptable ' but that the train guard was also being light - hearted
a statement from south west trains said : ' all passengers are welcome on board our trains
our guard was aware this particular service was very busy and , in a light - hearted way , pointed out that some middle seat spaces might not be comfortable for passengers with a similar build to herself
' this was in no way intended as a slight on any customers and the majority of passengers on the train took the comments in the spirit in which they were intended
' however , like ourselves , she is very sorry if any passengers were offended by her remarks
' we run some of the busiest trains in the country and we appreciate that space on some of our trains is limited
' to provide extra space and seats for our customers , we are in the process of investing Â£ 250m in extra carriages and new trains
' one commuter described the announcement as ' disgusting '
