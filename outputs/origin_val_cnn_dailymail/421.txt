deputy prime minister clegg , pictured in liverpool today , announced an extra Â£ 1.25 billion over the next five years , to help youngsters at risk of self - harming , depression and committing suicide three children in every classroom suffer from mental health problems , clegg warned today as he unveiled a massive new investment in tackling the national crisis
the deputy prime minister announced an extra Â£ 1.25 billion over the next five years , to help youngsters at risk of self - harming , depression and committing suicide
mr clegg said the money would support an extra 110,000 children in england who have suffered ' institutionalised form of cruelty ' by being denied the support they need
among children aged 5 - 16 , one in 10 have a diagnosable mental health disorder , equivalent to three in every class
as many as one in 12 deliberately self - harm and 80,000 children suffer from severe depression , including 8,000 under the age of 10
according to figures released by the liberal democrats , the number of children aged 15 and 16 with depression doubled between the 1980s and 2000s
the extra Â£ 250million - a - year in funding will be confirmed in next week 's budget , and is a fully - funded government policy , not just an ambition to be included in the liberal democrats manifesto
mr clegg made the announcement during a visit to clock view hospital in liverpool , where he took part in a group therapy session
mr clegg said : ' i think it will have a huge impact
you have got , on average , three children in every classroom in our country who have got mental health problems and are not being properly catered for , not being properly identified , not being properly supported
' this huge expansion - Â£ 1.25 billion over the course of the next parliament - will help around 110,000 children , children who at the moment are being let down by the system
' it 's an institutionalised form of cruelty , the way we allow vulnerable children with mental health problems to basically have to fend for themselves at the moment
' this big announcement i 'm making is going to seek to change that
it wo n't happen overnight , it will happen over the coming years
' he added : ' it 's all part of a journey where we start , as a country , lifting the stigma that has surrounded mental health and making sure that we treat mental health in the same way as we do people with physical health problems
' the funding will also help improve support for new mothers , who had previously struggled with a ' second - class mental health service ' , mr clegg said
' it is terrifying to think that in this day and age some new mothers are having to travel miles for treatment and others are even being separated from their newborn child this has to stop , ' he said
' this funding will make sure they get the treatment and support they need so they in turn can give their children the best possible start in life
' mr clegg , who also took part in phone canvassing to boost his party 's support at the election , said mental health would be one of his top five priorities if the liberal democrats are returned to power mr clegg said the money would support an extra 110,000 children in england who have suffered ' institutionalised form of cruelty ' by being denied the support they need mr clegg , who was in liverpool for the liberal democrats ' spring conference , blamed some local nhs commissioners for failing to pass on previous government funding for children 's mental health
' along with this extra money we are also saying , and england is saying , to all local commissioners they have to give the right amount of money to mental health , ' he said
' we need to have central government , that 's providing the money , working hand in glove with local decision - makers so that they do n't short - change local mental health trusts
' it is starting to change now , but i accept it is a big culture change because for far too long people in the nhs have not provided the amount of resources and support to mental health which it deserves
' the funding for children 's mental health will help children with conditions such as self - harming , depression and those at risk of committing suicide
it will help pay for therapy sessions , family support work , better training for clinicians and the development of help via websites and online apps
mr clegg said : ' there would be an outcry if a child with diabetes was left to cope without support or treatment
but that 's exactly what 's been happening with young people 's mental health services
' i have heard , time and again , harrowing stories from young people and their families about how they suffered and their condition deteriorated waiting to get the right treatment for serious mental health problems
' that 's why i am determined to start a seismic shift to revolutionise children 's mental healthcare and end this unacceptable injustice
' by introducing waiting time standards and committing to talking therapies for children in every region , we are helping to build a fairer society where young people can get the right treatment and support they deserve to live a better life
' england chief executive simon stevens said : ' today our campaign for nhs mental health services gets an important boost
this much - needed investment will kick - start a multiyear upgrade in care for younger people and their families
nhs nurses , therapist and doctors will use this funding to benefit families in every part of the country
