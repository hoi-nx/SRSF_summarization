a brave young son saved his mother and risked his own safety as he protected her from three masked attackers
deonte , 12 , was with his mother , whitehead , as they returned from her sister 's house in the early morning hours of tuesday
as they pulled into the driveway of their detroit home , three men suddenly appeared and began cursing at whitehead and demanding she give them money
that is when young deonte stepped in to protect his mother , and one of the men stabbed him in the arm
and he kept talking really rough and in vulgar language , ' whitehead told the detroit free press
' and my son , he did n't like them talking to his mom like that
' that is when deonte stepped in to intervene
' he just told them do n't talk to my mom like that
and then he saw it coming because he threw his arm up , ' whitehead said of the knife
' he was like , " my arm , my arm
" ' the men ran off immediately after , and whitehead , 44 , rushed her son to the hospital where he was treated and released later that morning
' he did n't cry
my son did n't cry , ' said whitehead
' he was like , " is mom ok ? " ' denote placed himself between the men and his mother , at which point one of the men stabbed him in the arm and while the mother is incredibly proud of what her son did to protect her , she does not want him risking his own safety in the future - even if it is to protect her
' when someone asks us for something , just try to give it to them
try to cooperate , ' she said
authorities are still searching for the three men responsible for the attack
meanwhile , assistant detroit police chief steve dolunt has called what deonte did for his mother ' extremely commendable
