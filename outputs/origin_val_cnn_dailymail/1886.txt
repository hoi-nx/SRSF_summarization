a freight train loaded with crude oil derailed in northern illinois on thursday , bursting into flames and prompting officials to suggest that everyone with one mile to evacuate , authorities said
the bnsf train derailed around 1.20pm in a rural area where the galena meets the mississippi , according to company spokesman andy williams
the train had 103 cars loaded with crude oil , along with two buffer cars loaded with sand
a cause for the derailment had n't yet been determined
the derailment occurred three miles south of galena in a wooded and hilly area that is a major tourist attraction and the home of former president ulysses s. grant
the jo daviess county sheriff 's department confirmed the train was transporting oil from the northern plains ' bakken region
earlier in the day , moran said eight tankers had left the track
but andy williams said at the news conference that only six cars derailed , two of which burst into flames and continued to burn into the night
bnsf spokesman andy williams said that six cars derailed from the tracks and two burst into flames firefighters could only reach the train by a bike path and were unable to stop the flames
they had to pull back for safety reasons and let the fire burn out itself firefighters could only access the derailment site by a bike path , said conley fire chief conley
they attempted to fight a small fire at the scene but were unable to stop the flames
firefighters had to pull back for safety reasons and were allowing the fire to burn itself out , conley said
in addition to galena firefighters , emergency and hazardous material responders from iowa and wisconsin were at the scene
the derailment comes amid increased public concern about the safety of shipping crude by train
according to the association of american railroads , oil shipments by rail jumped from 9,500 carloads in 2008 to 500,000 in 2014 , driven by a boom in the bakken oil patch of north dakota and montana , where pipeline limitations force 70 per cent of the crude to move by rail
emergency responders from wisconsin and iowa joined the illinois teams in an attempt to stop the fire , but for safety reasons retreated since 2008 , derailments of oil trains in the united states and canada have seen 70,000 - gallon tank cars break open and ignite on multiple occasions , resulting in huge fires
a train carrying bakken crude crashed in a quebec town in 2013 , killing 47 people
last month , a train carrying 3 million gallons of north dakota crude derailed in a west virginia snowstorm , shooting fireballs into the sky , leaking oil into a river tributary and forcing hundreds of families to evacuate
the ruptures and fires have prompted the administration of president barack obama to consider requiring upgrades such as thicker tanks , shields to prevent tankers from crumpling , rollover protections and electronic brakes that could make cars stop simultaneously , rather than slam into each other
in a statement , the federal railroad administration said it was sending investigators to the illinois derailment site and that the agency will conduct a ' thorough investigation , ' to determine the cause
the derailment comes in the midst of a nationwide discussion about the safety of transporting crude oil by train since 2008 , derailments of oil trains in the united states and canada have seen 70,000 - gallon tank cars break open and ignite on multiple occasions , resulting in huge fires bnsf spokesman michael trevino said railroad employees were on the scene and additional personnel were headed there
illinois gov. bruce rauner also put state personnel and equipment at the ready for deployment
the train 's destination was n't immediately known
chicago , which is 160 miles east , is a major rail hub for shipments from both north dakota and canada 's oil sands
it was unclear if the train 's tank cars were older models widely criticized for being prone to puncture during accidents
about 40 to 50 oil trains come through the area each week , jo daviess county emergency manager charles pedersen said
