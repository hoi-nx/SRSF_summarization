it âs easy to let your speed creep upwards when driving on a quiet motorway , but being caught on speed camera can be expensive
to solve the problem ford has introduced a setting in its latest car model to stop drivers accidentally exceeding speed limits
the built - in device , called the intelligent speed limiter , automatically detects road signs and cameras and slows the car down where necessary
this image shows the system display on the dashboard , where the maximum speed is set at 50mph ( 80km/h ) it does this by using a windscreen - mounted camera to monitor road signs and when the speed limit is lower than that maximum set speed
drivers have to manually set a maximum speed using controls on the steering wheel , so they might choose 70mph ( 113km/h ) for a motorway , for example
as speed limit rises , from small roads to highways , the system allows the driver to accelerate up to the set speed , providing it does not exceed the new speed limit , or the maximum limit set by the driver
the speed limiter is essentially a variation of a cruise control setting and allows the driver to set a maximum speed for the car
the system , in the s-max car ( pictured ) is essentially a variation of a cruise control setting and allows the driver to set a maximum speed for the car if the on board technology detects a lower speed limit is in place , on a motorway for example , then it slows the car down to that speed ( illustrated ) and then increases it if and when the limit goes up again the intelligent speed limiter can be controlled via controls on the steering wheel
drivers manually set a maximum speed
the maximum speed is automatically adjusted from the traffic sign recognition system
this uses cameras to read road signs and restrictions that are taken on - board by the instrument
cars with a built - in gps can also use map data to support the system , particularly on roads where there are few speed signs
the system controls speed using engine torque , electronically adjusting the amount of fuel delivered , rather than applying the brakes
if the vehicle accelerates past its maximum speed limit on a hill , an alarm sounds so the driver can take action
if the on board technology detects a lower speed limit is in place - on a motorway for example - then it slows the car down to that speed and then increases it if and when the limit goes up again
the intelligent speed limiter communicates with an on - board navigation system to glean extra data in order to help it accurately maintain the appropriate maximum speed when distances between speed limit signs are greater , for example on long country roads
ford claims the system could save drivers from picking up speeding tickets or getting pulled over by the police for going too fast
â drivers are not always conscious of speeding and sometimes only becoming aware they were going too fast when they receive a fine in the mail or are pulled over by law enforcement , â said ford europe safety supervisor , stefan kappes
â intelligent speed limiter can remove one of the stresses of driving , helping ensure customers remain within the legal speed limit
â the limiter works between speeds of 20mph and 120mph and the speed is reduced by restricting the amount of fuel supplied to the engine , making deceleration smoother
the intelligent speed limiter communicates with an on - board navigation system to glean extra data in order to help it accurately maintain the appropriate maximum speed when distances between speed limit signs are greater
the system is designed to stop people being caught by speed cameras ( stock image ) if the car goes downhill and picks up speed that can not be restricted this way , then an alarm will sound so that the driver can apply more braking
drivers can override the system by firmly putting their foot down on the accelerator
the intelligent speed limiter combines two current ford technologies â the adjustable speed limiter and traffic sign recognition , which are available on focus , mondeo and kuga models
the s-max model can also detect a person or object in the road ahead and slam the brakes on if the driver does not do so themselves
ford executive technical leader pim van dr jagt said : â we âre not just developing cars at ford , we âre also developing technologies to make driving more convenient , safer , and ultimately help improve mobility around the world
â the s-max with the new technology can now be ordered from Â£ 24,545 .
