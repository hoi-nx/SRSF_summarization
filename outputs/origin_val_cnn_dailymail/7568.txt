a france baker has become embroiled in a racism row after selling dark chocolate cakes depicting an obese man and woman
patissier tavolaro has been selling the cakes , named dieu and desses ( god and goddess ) in his shop in grasse in the south of france for the past 15 years
they are made from chocolate to look like nude human figures , which have over-sized genitalia and breasts
baker yannick tavolaro with the dieu and desses cakes he sells in his patisserie in the south of france , which have been branded racist the council of french black associations say the cakes are racist because they ridicule africans religions but the council of french black associations ( cran ) has branded the pastries racist saying that they ridicule africans religions after they were alerted to them by a member of the public
and now they are calling for mr tavlaro to take the cakes from the shelves of his bakery
in a statement the organisation 's president louis georges tin said : ' these cakes are inspired by colonial fantasies about black people with wide - eyed expressions , over-sized mouths and obligatory nudity
' worse still , considering their name , they ridicule african religions , presenting their divinities in a grotesque way , only good enough to be munched up
' the anti-racism group are calling for the cakes to be pulled from the shelves of mr tavolaro 's bakery but mr tavolaro says that in no way is he racists and that he only uses dark chocolate for the cakes because it is easier to work with but mr travaloro is refusing to stop selling them , saying in no way are they racist and he only uses dark chocolate as it is easier to work with
he told le parisien : ' if they were racist , people would n't order them â the only thing people are offended by is the fact they âre black â if they were white nobody would mind
' but black chocolate is easier to work with
' people do nât know me â i âm being judged on these cakes
i âm not racist and nor are my customers
' mr tavolaro says he has been selling the cakes in his bakery in the town of grasse for the past 15 years mr tavolaro 's supporters have now launched a facebook campaign to show solidarity with the baker
the complaint by cran follows a similar case in france last year , where a chocolate maker changed the name of two of his specialties called ' bamboula ' and ' negro '
the chocolate maker in auxerre agreed to rename the chocolates , despite saying they were a centuries old tradition that actually paid tribute to senegalese soldiers injured during the war and in no way racist .
