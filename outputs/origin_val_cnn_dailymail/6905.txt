jailed : prolific burglar darren williams was ' clobbered ' with a walking stick as he tried to burgle a pensioner a prolific burglar who was caught after a have - a - go - hero pensioner ' clobbered ' him with his walking stick has been jailed
george clewlow , 78 , leapt into action after darren williams broke into his bungalow last july
he used his wooden walking stick to whack williams , 43 , over the head as he tried to clamber through an open living room window at his home in penkhull , staffordshire
williams fled empty - handed but was caught when police used samples of his dna left on the window handle and it provided a match for the career criminal
he was jailed for three years after he admitted burglary at stoke-on-trent crown court on friday
the court heard williams , of stoke-on-trent , had 22 convictions for house burglaries dating back nearly 30 years
judge david fletcher , told him : ' you have an appalling record - 22 house burglaries , all since 1986
' you have nothing of a recent vintage , which is mainly because of a lengthy prison sentence
' robert holt , defending , said : ' this was an opportunistic offence , it was not a targeted property
' yesterday mr george clewlow , a retired bricklayer , said williams should have received a longer sentence
he said : ' he 's not going to stop until someone gives him a really good hiding
' i had no idea what it was
at first i thought it could be just the wind , so i went to the toilet
' when i came back i could see someone coming through , so i clobbered him with my stick , and after i had a poke at him he ran off
' i watched him run all the way down the road - i was n't sure if i 'd be able to recognise him because of the dark , but i remembered he ran like a little monkey
' after he ran off i made myself a cup of tea to steady myself
brave : george clewlow used his wooden walking stick to whack williams , 43 , over the head as he tried to clamber through an open living room window at his home in penkhull , staffordshire
' i was n't sure whether i should go next door to tell the neighbours someone tried to break in , but then i remembered someone had put a card through the door with a police number on it , so i called that
' the more i thought about it the more difficult it was - i keep checking my windows and doors are locked , and every time i get up in the night i look to that window
' luckily my daughter lives near me , which helps a lot , but when my allotment was broken into a few weeks later and someone took all my gardening equipment that shook me a bit
' the police have been great , and our local officer katy thorneycroft checks up on me to make sure i 'm safe , but he should have got a longer sentence
' my mum got broken into and she never spoke again , so it can ruin people 's lives
' if it had been two more minutes he would have been in the house and it would have been a much bigger confrontation , and he knows these bungalows are all for elderly people , so he must have planned it
