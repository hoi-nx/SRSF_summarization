switcheroo : wisconsin governor walker changed his tune in an interview on sunday governor walker once envisioned a world where the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally could embark on a path to citizenship
but now the wisconsin republican calls that position ' amnesty ' and says his view has changed
' i do n't believe in amnesty , ' walker told fox news sunday
' my view has changed
i 'm flat out saying it
' walker , who emerged this past week in the top tier of potential candidates for the republican presidential nomination for 2016 , says the us needs to secure the border and ultimately put in place ' a legal immigration system that works
' that means , in part , putting the onus on employers and getting them the tools to do that , like e-verify , an existing federal program that allows businesses to check the immigration status of new hires , walker said
walker told the wausau , wisconsin , daily herald newspaper in 2013 that ' it makes sense ' when he was asked whether he could see a world where ' those people ' could get citizenship , with the right penalties , waiting periods and requirements in place
at the time , he supported a bipartisan approach to overhauling immigration , with people waiting to get citizenship having priority and others having a legal pathway to live here legally
walker also said sunday that president obama or ' anybody else who is willing to put their name on the ballot certainly has to have the love for country to do that
' walker drew criticism last month after former new york mayor rudy giuliani questioned obama 's patriotism during a speech at a walker fundraiser
when asked about the former mayor 's comments , walker sidestepped the question by saying he had n't asked obama about his love of country .
