a luxury private jet that used to belong to bin laden 's family has been impounded by police in florida amid accusations of theft and fraud
the 22 - seater gulfstream ii plane , valued at $ 4.5million , is stuck on the tarmac at miami executive airport while its new owners do battle in court
goncalves , 49 , a venezuela , has been accused making off with the plane after holding back more than $ 3million of what he agreed to pay a business partner for it
bin grounded : this plane , which used to belong to bin laden 's family , has been grounded in miami amid a legal dispute between subsequent owners suspect : jose goncalves , 45 , is accused of agreeing to buy the plane then not paying up
it was owned by the family of bin laden ( right ) until 1980 officers in miami-dade county have taken custody of the corporate vehicle , the miami herald reported
the gulfstream ii is a staple of international luxury travel , which rich businessmen often kit out with lavish interiors
ownership records show that the plane belonged to the billionaire bin laden clan until 1980
at that point , bin laden is thought to have just graduated from university in saudi arabia , and was still years away from founding al-qaeda
his elder half - brother , salem bin laden , was then head of the family , which made its fortune from oil
it has changed owners more than a dozen times since then - complicated by the fact that foreigners are not allowed to own u.s. planes directly , so often register them under companies
the jet was recently owned by nuã±ez-villanueva , a former business partner of goncalves , who is now suing him over it
state prosecutors , who are also trying goncalves on fraud and theft charges , say he agreed to buy the plane from nuã±ez-villanueva for $ 4.5million
goncalves allegedly agreed to pay $ 1.5million up - front for it , and make monthly payments of $ 500,000 until the balance was covered
but it is claimed he only ever paid $ 829,196
goncalves 's lawyers , however , have characterized the spat as a ' misunderstanding ' and say nuã±ez-villanueva took the $ 829,196 unlawfully to buy himself a helicopter
goncalves is being held in miami on a $ 4.5million bond during the trial , as prosecutors fear he could flee the country is left to go free
he is also wanted in venezuela .
