ronda rousey - it 's difficult to imagine a world where ronda rousey is not undefeated
so long as the champ 's focus remains on mma and not becoming the next audrey hepburn , her octagon success should only continue to flourish
and yes , that includes a potential showdown with cristiane ' cyborg ' justino 's heavy artillery
ronda rousey can keep her unbeaten ufc record going unless her attention is taken by acting 2
chris weidman - at this point in his career , having capped off two victories over anderson silva with an impeccable title defense over machida at ufc , there 's no denying how good ufc middleweight kingpin chris weidman truly is
when healthy , chris weidman is a pound - for - pound force who is arguably the most complete champion in the sport today
vitor belfort , luke rockhold , the winner of ronaldo souza vs. yoel romero and possibly machida stand in chris weidman 's way from securing one of the most impressive octagon runs of all time
chris weidman is arguably the sport 's most complete fighter and could be on his way to making ufc history 3
khabib nurmagomedov-aka the eagle , aka mr. funny hat , aka last guy to beat dos anjos , is mma 's red star
equipped with some of the best wrestling the lightweight division has ever seen , the 26 - year - old combines power and tenacity to pulverize his opponents
with victories over current divisional champ dos anjos , veterans gleison tibau and pat healy and the hard - hitting abel trujillo , the russian 's 26 - 0 record is gaining quite the accolades
khabib nurmagomedov ( right ) , who also goes by many nicknames , is one of best wrestlers ever seen 4
joanna jedrzejczyk - there 's something about the current ufc women 's strawweight champion that suggests she 'll be the division 's titleholder for a very long time
she 's young , lean , athletic and cocky enough to keep even the most casual of fight fans interested in a 115 - pound female
undefeated at 9 - 0 , the polish princess has dissected her opponents with unparalleled striking consisting of perfectly timed combinations , body strikes and suffocating pressure
joanna jedrzejczyk remains undefeated in nine fights and does n't look like being beaten any time soon bleacher report 's mobile app ' team stream ' helps you stay in the know with your favourite teams across a range of sports via hand - picked , curated sports stories from around the web

paul felder â the ufc lightweight paul felder has come out of nowhere
unranked and undefeated , the irish dragon is quietly flying under the radar coming into his fight with jim miller at ufc on fox 15
but with versatile striking , knockout power and budding grappling skills , paul felder will ultimately force his way into the limelight
paul felder has come from nowhere to take the ufc lightweight division by storm 6
bethe correia - it 's unlikely that she has what it takes to defeat champion ronda rousey
even with the best power punching in the women 's bantamweight division , the confident brazilian has struggled to maintain the composure and patience it would take to win the title
her resume certainly commands respect , but it only took ronda rousey 16 seconds in a recent title defense opposite cat zingano to beat a contender with the same 9 - 0 record
brazilian bethe correia ( left ) packs a powerful punch but still might not be strong enough for ronda rousey 7
ryan laflare - even with a record of 11 - 0 ( 4 - 0 in the ufc ) , rising welterweight laflare has yet to earn undivided respect
due in part to his inability to capture a octagon finish thus far , the wrestling - based 31 - year - old needs to show a little ' flair ' to make noise in a talent - rich division
but with an excellent ground game and budding striking skills , the new yorker slightly resembles a less accomplished chris weidman
the jury is still out over laflare , especially since he has not managed an octagon finish so far in his career
