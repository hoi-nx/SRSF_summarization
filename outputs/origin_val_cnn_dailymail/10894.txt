zionist union wound up with just 24 seats
even before the final results were known , netanyahu declared victory and pledged to form a new government quickly
' against all odds , we achieved a great victory for the likud , ' netanyahu told supporters at election night headquarters
' i am proud of the people of israeli , who in the moment of truth knew how to distinguish between what is important and what is peripheral , and to insist on what is important
' he wrote : ' against all odds : a great victory for the likud
a major victory for the people of israeli ! ' hopeful : zionist union supporters chant for victory
in the end their party won just 24 seats support : norris in his youtube video netanyahu received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star norris , who said that his re-election was crucial for the safety of israeli
in a short youtube video called please vote for prime minister netanyahu , norris said : ' i watched prime minister netanyahu 's speech before u.s. congress , and i saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul
i also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the israeli people
' i have done three movies in israeli â ' delta force ' being my favorite â and i formed many friendships while there
you have an incredible country , and we want to keep it that way
' that 's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only israeli but also the u.s.
you see , we the u.s. people need prime minister netanyahu as much as you do
weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on u.s. , too
' so i ask you , please , for the sake of israeli and the whole mideast , vote for prime minister netanyahu on election day
' and as far as those in the u.s. and the rest of the world , in this season of easter , it 's good to remember what the hebrew scriptures say about israeli and those who support her : ' pray for the peace of east jerusalem : may they prosper who love you ' ( psalm 122:1 )
' herzog said on wednesday he had spoken with netanyahu to congratulate him on his election victory
' a few minutes ago i spoke with prime minister netanyahu and congratulated him on his achievement and wished him luck , ' herzog told reporters
he said his leftist zionist union party would continue to be an alternative to netanyahu 's right - wing likud
netanyahu focused his campaign on security issues , while his opponents instead pledged to address the country 's high cost of living and accused the leader of being out of touch with everyday people
netanyahu 's return to power for a fourth term likely spells trouble for mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the u.s.
netanyahu , who already has a testy relationship with president obama , took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign , staking out a series of hard - line positions that will put him at odds with the international community
in a dramatic policy reversal , he said he now opposes the creation of a palestinians state - a key policy goal of the white house and the international community
he also promised to expand construction in jewish areas of east jerusalem , the section of the city claimed by the palestinians as their capital
netanyahu infuriated the white house early this month when he delivered a speech to the u.s. congress criticizing an emerging nuclear deal with iran
the speech was arranged with republican leaders and not coordinated with the white house ahead of time
in washington , white house spokesman josh earnest said obama was confident strong u.s. - israeli ties would endure far beyond the election regardless of the victor
netanyahu will still need the support of moshe kahlon , whose upstart kulanu party captured 10 seats and whose campaign focused almost entirely on bread - and - butter economic issues
he is expected to become the country 's next finance minister .
