in the shelter of a murray park conference room , nicky law cut a relaxed figure on friday
after a leisurely arrival in a pair of shorts and flip - flops , he greeted the assembled media with a smile , a handshake and a joke about his dubious choice of footwear
the atmosphere in the room was relaxed
and at odds with the previous seven months of a season when the atmosphere surrounding rangers has usually been much darker and tense
truth be told , the only guiding light at ibrox this season has been a half - lit torch leading straight to a land where only chaos itself holds jurisdiction
where perpetual farce and vitriol have been interrupted only by the false dawns of hope and sanctuary
nicky law believes that rangers ' promotion destiny is finally in their own hands after months of anguish for law , however , a corner has now been turned
now in his second season at ibrox , the 26 - year - old midfielder has been one of the few rangers players who might - yes , just might - have achieved pass - marks so far this campaign
following last weekend âs 2 - 0 victory against championship promotion rivals hibs - a timely boost for the new regime and caretaker boss mccall believes that the club âs promotion destiny is finally in their own hands after months of anguish
â last weekend gave a huge lift to everyone , going and beating hibs at easter road , â he grinned
â we had been comfortably beaten by them three times previously this season , so there has been a huge difference in and around the place this week
â the manager has relayed the message to us that we are now in charge of our own situation once again â our own destiny
everyone in our changing room came to play with rangers in the premiership and , even as bad as we have been this season , getting promoted is still within our grasp
â when you come into work in the morning , you can see everyone smiling again â not just the players , but also all of the club staff
it âs great to see things like that again because it âs been doom and gloom right from the word go this season
rangers boss mccall has taken over the ibrox side in reach of gaining promotion back to the spl â we lost our first game of the season , then had a little bit of a lift , but things spiralled again from there
it was downhill all the way and it has been difficult
â people are now looking forward to coming into training again and they âre looking forward to games , which is the most important thing â the game against cowdenbeath on saturday actually ca nât come quick enough for us
â there has been such negativity surrounding the place
it got to the stage where you genuinely did nât want to leave the house
if your family wanted to go out you would just say : â no , let âs just leave it and stay in
â the whole thing is so consuming that it affects your personal life â not just your professional one
â then last sunday against hibs was a huge improvement
you could see the energy and desire in the team was fantastic
â but we are under no illusions
we know that dropping points against cowdenbeath would be no good , so it âs up to us now to press on
â for the first time in a while , we âre probably looking forward to our own game - but we should be looking forward to every single game at home
lee wallace ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after giving rangers the lead away to hibs kenny miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for rangers and close the gap on hibs â i go back to my old motherwell days when you had rangers away and you would dread going to ibrox
in the week leading up to it in training , you knew you were in for such a tough game
that âs what it should feel like for teams coming to us now
we want to put fear into visiting teams at ibrox and we will only do that by winning more games
â conventional wisdom might point to the old adage of familiarity breeding contempt â but that âs not the case for nicky law and mccall
law spent two seasons playing under mccall at motherwell , before moving to rangers in the summer of 2013 , and was a key figure in the fir park side the manager led to consecutive second - place finishes in the premiership in 2012 and 2013
â the gaffer has given everyone such a massive lift since he arrived at the club , â said nicky law
â his personality , his character and the way he is so positive â it âs all great
he laughs and jokes with everyone and just lifts our spirits
kenny miller celebrates his goal with the rangers fans during his side 's win in the championship last weekend â people might think i âm biased because i have worked with him before , but i have no doubt whatsoever that all of the lads would say the same thing about him
â it âs not just his energy , but his coaching ability , too
last week we switched to a 3 - 5 - 2 formation at hibs
the gaffer made sure we worked on it all week in training , made sure everyone knew their jobs and made sure no stone was left unturned
â he gets the best out of you and improves you as a player
in that respect , he is actually the perfect man for the job here because the club is not in a position to go out and spend fortunes on new players
â he has a track record of working with a budget , working with what he âs got and doing really well
it âs hard to teach that ability of having an eye for a player and being able to spot talent , but he has it
â he âs been first - class with us since the moment he walked through the door
our confidence was totally shot to pieces
he has played a huge part already in us turning that around and , hopefully , we can now kick on towards promotion
