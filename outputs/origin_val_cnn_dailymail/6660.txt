his character lady rose , played by actress lily james , was torn between her love interest , the son of jewish immigrants and her family who do not approve of him

' i felt it as a catholic when i was young
one of my first girlfriends was from a fairly senior jewish family ' , he said
' they were a very nice family â i âm still friendly , actually , with the girl and her brother
' but her parents wanted a jewish husband
' and it âs a very strange feeling when you realise that people do nât like you because of what you are
â he also told the israeli newspaper haaretz that the rejection was ' sort of my first experience of not being desirable
' he added : ' they certainly did nât want a catholic in the family
â people always think the prejudice is one - way , but it can be two ways
i wanted to use that in the show
â he said the 1920s was a time when : â people did nât mind if you came to their house or you shot their pheasants , you ate their dinners or went to their daughter âs dances
' but , my god , they did nât want you to marry her
