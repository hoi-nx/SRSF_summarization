the makeshift presentation area at the palazzo di venezzia and the standby winners â press conference were all in vain
wales recorded their second biggest six nations victory under warren gatland but - after bolting ahead in the three - horse race thanks to a george north hat - trick - they watched the trophy painfully slip out of their one - handed grasp
it was a scintillating second - half display at the stadio olimpico
italy were chewed up and spat out , while wales feasted like old emperors of rome
warren gatland âs side will take face from the performance and , looking ahead to the world cup , the kiwi rounded off the competition with no anxieties about september âs pool of death
williams celebrates after crossing over to score one of wales ' second half tries during a stunning display at the stadio olimpico wales wing george north crosses over for warren gatland 's side as he managed a sensational second half try hat - trick out in rome jamie roberts opened the try account for wales early in the first - half as samuela vunisa ( centre ) and bergamasco ( right ) watch on italy xv : mclean , leonardo sarto , morisi , masi , giovambattista venditti , haimona , gori ; rizzo , ghiraldini , martin castrogiovanni , george biagi , furno , minto , bergamasco , vunisa replacements : manici , alberto de marchi , chistolini , geldenhuys , barbieri , palazzani , luciano orquera , bacchin tries : giovambattista venditti , leonardo sarto conversions : orquera penalties : haimona , luciano orquera wales xv : halfpenny , north , gareth davies , jamie roberts , williams , dan biggar , webb ; evans , baldwin , jarvis , luke charteris , alun-wyn jones , lydiate , warburton , faletau replacements : owens , gill , andrews , ball , justin tipuric , gareth davies , rhys priestland , williams

â we will improve as we spend time together and there is no fear about playing england at twickenham , or australia
we can go there with some real confidence and belief that we can get out of our group
â you have sides ranked fourth , fifth and sixth in the world , so that shows how tough it is to get out of that group
fiji with preparation will be tough as well and it âs unfortunate that you are going to have one of the big teams not making the quarter - finals
that âs what has happened but we are confident we can get out of that group and progress to the quarter - finals
â italy , meanwhile , will be easy meat at the world cup if they do not improve their flaky blue line of defence
they provided easy pickings in the second half , although that should not detract from wales ' ambition and enterprise shown after the half - time break
it was a stark contrast to the opening 40 minutes , when the visitors â inexperienced front - row were shown up by the italy pack
italy had been slated , written off and identified as whipping boys , yet they came out growling in the national anthems and would have been in front at the break , had it not been for a dan biggar penalty on the stroke of chris pollock âs whistle
â it does nât matter who you âre playing against , it âs difficult to put a team away in the first half , â said warren gatland
â we were under some pressure at the scrum and italy slowed the game down
it was hard for us to get tempo , but i thought we were very , very good when we started playing a bit more positively
â the experienced martin castrogiovanni , back in the italian front - row after being bitten on the nose by a dog , caused problems at the set - piece and carried hard in the early exchanges
all the talk in the roma bars had been about not whether wales would win in rome , but how many points they could put on their second - rate opponents
there was an instant italian retort and â after wales were penalised for using blockers to help luke charteris at the kick - off â haimona kicked the hosts to an unexpected lead
wales had to steady the ship and so they did , with a penalty through the ever - reliable halfpenny
wales full - back halfpenny receives treatement after a nasty collision forced him off the field of play at the stadio olimpico martin castrogiovanni ( centre ) rides the challenge of luke charteris ( left ) as italy hosted wales in the six nations final day parity ; a chance for wales to start again , although that was not the case
italy were supposed to be short on spirit after the withdrawal of skipper sergio parisse , although their was no lack of belief during the early blows
haimona left the pitch with a broken wrist but luciano orquera took over the kicking and edged his side back in front with a 10th minute penalty
there was little on show that would give ireland or england much to fear
jamie roberts and giovambattista venditti exchanged scores and wales went into the break with an unconvincing one - point lead
they had lost halfpenny to concussion and their title ambitions were looking bleak
but then , out of nowhere , the flick switched and the lights started flashing red
italy capitulated and wales turned up the heat
they upped the tempo and â with warburton and alun-wyn jones working tirelessly up front â the backline started to fire
webb turned down a kick at goal for a tap penalty , finding liam williams on a cute inside line to open the floodgates
the banks of the river tiber were imploding and masi was sent to the sin - bin
within 10 second - half minutes , north had completed his hat - trick , drawing on his pace to finish two out wide and his power to finish a third through the middle
it was the sort of rugby that viewers have been craving throughout this year âs competition
it lacked of edge - of - seat intensity of the defensive phases against ireland , but would give the southern hemisphere nations a run for easy - on - the - eye viewing
george biagi followed masi to the sin - bin and , powering over from the back of a maul , webb edged the scoreline towards 50 points
scott williams reaches out to add another try as wales put in a sensational second half performance to crush italy in rome on saturday wales wing george north stampedes through a challenge from giovanbattista venditti to score a third try in the second half wales unleashed their loaded bench , with gareth davies , justin tipuric and rhys priestland all making a late impact ; after scott williams had been introduced early as a replacement for halfpenny
finishing off a break from just outside the welsh 22 , warburton darted under the posts to move his side past the half - century mark , before scott williams finished off another fine move to leave the organisers questioning their decision to send the trophies to twickenham and murrayfield
wales had done what they came to do
they had achieved the mammoth scoreline and the celebratory drinks were on ice
they pushed for one last try but , out of nowhere , leonardo sarto crashed the party
the italian winger broken downfield for a late try , with the score confirmed by the tmo
iâit was probably a 14 - point swing in terms of the points difference , â said warren gatland
with wales missing out on the title by a handful of points , it proved to be a costly mistake
