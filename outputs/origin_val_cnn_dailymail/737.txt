jasem emwazi has been told to publicly distance himself from his son or leave kuwaiti kuwaiti mps yesterday called on jihadi john âs father , jasem emwazi , to publicly distance himself from his son âs actions by apologising â or leave the country
kuwaiti have become increasingly frustrated with the mixed messages coming from 51 - year - old british citizen mr jasem emwazi , whose family are said to have cost the british tax - payer up to Â£ 400,000 in the 20 years they have lived in the british
last week , mr jasem emwazi told former workmates his son was a â dog â and hoped he would die , yet a few days later , his lawyer in kuwaiti suggested there was â no proof â the masked is executioner - in - chief was in fact 26 - year - old mohammed
yesterday , abdullah yousef al-maayouf , a member of the kuwaiti national assembly and chairman of the country âs parliamentary interior and defence committee , called for mr jasem emwazi to apologise or leave
he said : â kuwaiti is a safe , peaceful country and does not want to be associated with mohammed emwazi
what he has done is not his family âs fault , but they should apologise on his behalf and say they do not agree with it
â if they will not say this publicly , they should leave kuwaiti
â mr jasem emwazi is believed to have been living in kuwaiti with his eldest daughter asma , 25 , for the last two years while his wife ghaneya and four other children remained in london â now guarded by armed police in a hotel
westminster council is reportedly still paying the rent on the family âs Â£ 600,000 flat even though the rules say housing benefit should normally be stopped after 13 weeks
as members of the stateless bedoon ethnic group , the emwazis were granted asylum in the british , claiming to have fled kuwaiti in fear of persecution
â from what we read , he has said one thing to his friends at work , then another in public , â she said
â whether an apology from him would be accepted by people is not certain , but he should make one anyway
â i think it would be better if he went back to the british and spoke to the police and security services there about what he knows
â meanwhile , kuwaiti government adviser and security expert dr fahed al-shelaimi , a retired army colonel , said he believed mr jasem emwazi would return to the british within days
killer : mohammed emwazi , left in the most recent photograph known to have been taken of him before he entered syria to join isis militants
he has appeared in a number of the terror group 's films ( right ) mr jasem emwazi has both described his 26 - year - old son ( above ) as a ' dog ' and claimed there is no evidence to prove he is the hooded killer shown in isis films â kuwaiti wants to distance itself from mohammed emwazi and officials here consider it a largely british issue
he was born here but brought up in london
â his father âs presence in kuwaiti is embarrassing for the country
the kuwaiti government does nât want the headache , so will ask him gently to leave the country
â jasem emwazi has already quit his job , and people are cursing his son â i doubt he will be able to stand the heat and i expect he will leave soon
in 90 per cent of cases when people are asked to leave here , they go quietly
â neither jasem emwazi or his lawyer , salem al-hashash , were available for comment yesterday .
