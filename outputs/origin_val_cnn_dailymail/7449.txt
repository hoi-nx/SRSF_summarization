an ex-girlfriend of former u.s. representative grimm who had pleaded guilty to raising illegal campaign money for the new york city politician was sentenced on tuesday to three months in custody
the sentence for diana durand , 48 , was unexpected because prosecutors had not recommended anything more than probation
the punishment could foreshadow a prison term for grimm , who pleaded guilty in december to tax felony evasion
he is scheduled to be sentenced by a separate judge in june
diana durand , who had pleaded guilty to raising illegal campaign money for two congressional candidates , was sentenced on tuesday to three months in custody
the punishment was unexpected because prosecutors had not recommended anything more than probation durand pleaded guilty in september to violating the federal election campaign act by directing more than $ 10,000 in campaign contributions to two candidates for the house of representatives in 2010 through straw donors whom she reimbursed , avoiding federal caps on donations
her attorney stuart kaplan , who is also grimm 's attorney , has confirmed that one of the two candidates was grimm , with whom she at one time had a personal relationship
kaplan claimed last may that durand did not intend to commit a crime and that she was being targeted solely because of her ties to grimm
' my client is not a sophisticated woman , ' he said , explaining that she did know what she was doing was illegal
â she was just trying to help this guy out who she was in a relationship with â nothing more , nothing less , â he said at another point in april
but in september she copped to the charges for which she was sentenced today
it was not immediately clear whether durand would serve the three months in jail or in a halfway house
u.s. district judge sterling johnson of brooklyn also ordered durand to pay a $ 10,000 fine
she faced up to eight years in prison and a maximum $ 600,000 fine
nevertheless , kaplan said after the hearing he was shocked by the sentence and that he would ask the judge to reconsider
' this is clearly , to me , a miscarriage of justice , ' he said
grimm is seen here following his guilty plea at the brooklyn federal court in new york city on december 23 , 2014 to a tax evasion charge related to a manhattan health food restaurant he partly owned , healthalicious
he resigned and formally left office several days later durand lives in houston , where she works as a manager for an oil distributor
she is also a single mother
grimm , who represented new york city 's borough of staten island and part of brooklyn , was elected in 2010
he announced his resignation in december - just a month after winning reelection on the grounds that he was innocent - after first saying he would stay on the job , even after he had pleaded guilty to the tax evasion charge related to a manhattan health food restaurant he partly owned , healthalicious
he then made an about - face and left congress as the new session began on jan. 5
he had been indicted on 20 counts of fraud , perjury and conspiracy after a federal probe of his fundraising
prosecutors in that case suggested that judge pamela k. chen sentence grimm to between 24 to 30 months in prison
kaplan , a former colleague of grimm 's at the federal bureau of investigation , and his associates recommended 12 to 18 months .
