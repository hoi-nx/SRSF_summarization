victims say former rotherham council chiefs who failed to tackle child sex grooming on their watch , such as stone , should be stripped of honours former council chiefs who failed to tackle child sex grooming on their watch should be stripped of their honours , say victims and campaigners
they warn that letting the ex-officials keep their awards will â bring shame â on the system

former south yorkshire chief constable meredydd hughes cbe has also come under fire for claiming not to know about the scale of child grooming in rotherham
campaigning mp simon danczuk , a member of parliament âs communities and local government committee which will grill mr stone today , said : â it brings shame on the honours system if these awards are not removed
â if these people have any decency , they will give back their honours
these people have badly let down vulnerable young girls and turned a blind eye to the most horrendous abuse
â the council and police in rotherham were savaged in two reports by independent expert professor alexis jay and home office official louise casey
at least 1,400 girls in the town were exploited over 16 years by gangs of mainly pakistani men
local labour mp sarah champion said the number may be as high as 2,000 as more young women are coming forward all the time
david greenwood , a solicitor representing 40 of the victims , said : â they [ the officials ] have been shown in evidence - based reports to have been asleep on the job
it undermines the integrity of the system if these people retain their awards

thames valley police also saw victims as â little slags â , said one person interviewed for her report
mrs louise casey highlighted examples including an officer who told one victim : â do nât worry â you are nât the first girl to be raped by xx and you wo nât be the last
â one of the victims in rotherham , known as jessica , said : â it is ridiculous that these people still have their honours

a government spokesman said : â forfeiture action is confidential and we can not comment on whether or not specific cases are being considered
â mr stone , mr hughes and mrs thacker were unavailable for comment
