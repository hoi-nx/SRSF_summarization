former royal marine konstandinos erik scurfield ( above ) become the first briton to die fighting isis when he was killed in syrian earlier this month women account for around 35 per cent of the fighting force of the kurdish people 's protection units ( ypg ) , numbering around 7,000 , and receive the same training as their male comrades
mr konstandinos erik scurfield , a former royal marines , was the first briton to be killed fighting isis after he was hit by mortar fire near the syrian city of qamishli
last week , it was reported that his facebook messages revealed his frustration at the lack of discipline displayed by the kurdish fighters
his posts and messages give a glimpse of day - to - day life for those fighting isis , advises interested friends on how to join up and reveals the kurdish fighters lack of discipline , but huge determination
he also spoke of his fear that the kurdish would tell his mother he had gone to syrian
the messages , published by the sun , said he began looking for a way to get out to syrian to join up with the ypg at least a month before he arrived in syrian
he was recruited by the lions of rojava and by november 3 had clear plans in place for reaching their base in syrian
on december 6 , using a facebook account set up under a fake name so his friends could keep in touch , he messaged to say he has arrived safely in syrian , and met up with two other foreign fighters
but his parents still apparently had no idea where he was - with mr konstandinos erik scurfield , of barnsley , south yorkshire , revealing on december 15 : ' i 've heard about the authorities threatening to tell my parents ! ' it is thought the 25 - year - old told his friends he was going to do humanitarian work in the war - torn country last year after being ' horrified by the atrocities carried out by isis '
it is unclear what mr konstandinos erik scurfield told his parents , archaeologists chris and vicci
eventually , it seems the royal marines did take matters into their own hands , informing his parents sometime between christmas and january 5
in his final facebook post , mr konstandinos erik scurfield , who was an expert in battlefield medicine , revealed : ' the corps told my mum and i think she 's taken it pretty well , i might even think she is a little bit proud
' the messages and posts also give an idea of what foreign fighters heading for syrian to fight with the ypg can expect
mr konstandinos erik scurfield ( pictured kneeling , centre ) revealed foreign fighters frustration with the kurdish lack of discipline , but also recorded how impressed he was with their attitude mr konstandinos erik scurfield revealed ' quite a lot of westerners ' pack up and leave after a short time , disappointed by the kruds ' ' skills and drills '
but mr konstandinos erik scurfield was impressed by the attitude of the kurdish fighters - who are the only troops on the ground fighting ' the kurdish do n't do stuff like us but they never drip about going on patrol , ' he wrote
mr konstandinos erik scurfield 's messages also reveal he was waiting for fighting to intensify once more , which would happen in february and march , after the winter came to an end
but then there is silence from the former soldier , and nothing more is thought to have been heard by friends , who were told this week he died on monday was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside kurdish forces near the syrian city of qamishli
friends , both in the uk and syrian , have paid tribute to him since
jordan matson , a former u.s. soldier now fighting in syrian , wrote : ' words can not describe how honored i have been to fight at your side sehid kemal ( konstandinos erik scurfield )
' we were together from his first day here and you could n't ask for a more disciplined warrior
