the first two - footed challenge went in from mourinho when he claimed psg âs kickers were a refined version of shrewsbury town
it was a razor - sharp comment , designed to rile the french champions and put down a marker for dutch referee kuipers ahead of the second leg
sometimes this stuff bites you on the backside
mourinho will be picking the bones out of this for days because they were beaten at their own petty game by the perseverance of this psg team
zlatan ibrahimovic was dismissed for this tackle on oscar , leaving psg without their talisman chelsea players react as referee kuipers pulls the red card from his pocket the crestfallen swede was shown a straight red to light the touchpaper on a tetchy european tie there was a minor victory for chelsea , with the foul count showing that mourinho âs team had committed 24 to the visitors â 17 at the end of 120 chaotic minutes here at stamford bridge
the reality is that they were beaten at their own game
for psg to do it with 10 men in extra-time , after the ludicrous dismissal of zlatan ibrahimovic in the 32nd minute , is an even mightier achievement
the psg striker pointed at his battle scars as he left the pitch , well aware that the reaction of chelsea âs players to the collision with oscar had helped kuipers with the decision
â i spoke to him and he told me he did nât mean it , â admitted mourinho
the pair are close from his time at inter
after surrounding kuipers , chelsea âs players called for the physio and team doctor to sprint on to tend to the stricken oscar
predictably , within minutes , he was back on his feet
it is to zlatan ibrahimovic âs credit that he left the field with dignity and composure , walking towards the tunnel and ignoring the clamour from the stands for a reaction
â when the red card happened , the worst thing was the chelsea players â i felt there were 11 babies around me , â admitted an understandably aggrieved zlatan ibrahimovic
david luiz engaged in some gamesmanship , attempting to get petr cech in trouble mourinho chats with former charge david luiz after zlatan ibrahimovic 's sending off as blanc looks on it was a brutal but fair assessment of the moment that could easily have turned this tie in chelsea âs favour
there were feuds everywhere : david luiz versus petr cech , chelsea âs substitute keeper petr cech versus psg midfielder marco verratti , marco verratti against the world
at every turn , someone , somewhere on the field at stamford bridge was rowing with somebody
petr cech could start a fight in an empty phone box , never mind an 18 - yard box , gnawing away at everyone and everything during an ill - disciplined performance up top for chelsea
this guy is really stewing at the minute
he has gone a season without scoring in the champions league and will have to wait until september to get going again in this competition
david luiz got inside his head , jabbering away at him in their native brazilian - portuguese tongue in an attempt to destabilise the forward
petr cech , as we know , has only mastered one language
the chelsea striker should have been sent off here â several times , as it happens â for his innumerable transgressions
he really is an angry man
david luiz feels the force of retribution from petr cech after the pair regularly crashed at stamford bridge an outraged petr cech reacts histrionically after kuipers waved away his penalty appeal in the same motion he could have been booked and sent off when he caught maxwell from behind close to the touchline of the east stand and then appeared to accept the challenge from david luiz to graze his forehead
he escaped with a yellow card
there was another escape , this time when he shoved over the excellent marquinhos in a fit of pique
quite how he survived is a story in itself
he lives life on the edge , claiming he had been elbowed by david luiz in a hit - and - run job
it was an off - the - ball incident , retribution by the former chelsea defender after he had collided with the pugnacious forward earlier in the first half
he was throwing punches a few moments later , hitting the ground repeatedly after he was denied a clear penalty when edinson cavani took him out as he made his way into the area
these are the fine lines of european football , with every challenge , skirmish and wrangle potentially punishable with an on - the - spot sanction from these notoriously pernickity officials
john terry battles for the ball with edinson cavani as the duo battle for possession at stamford bridge petr cech falls to the turf after a challenge from thiago silva during a bad - tempered affair in west london mourinho convinced us that blanc had put the french champions on a diet of raw meat ahead of this second leg
this will eat away at him for months to come
â i need to go away and think about how this happened , â admitted mourinho
perhaps next time , he should keep both feet on the floor .
