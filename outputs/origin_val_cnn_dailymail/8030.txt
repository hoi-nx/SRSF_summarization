the 20 - year - old partially paralysed french woman has released a video revealing how she manages to get ready every day with the use of just one arm
ms slaomkowski suffered a horrific motorcycle accident in the tunnel of nanterre near paris in march 2014 and as a result is unable to move her left arm due to brachial plexus palsy and the nerve damage it has caused
in the moving video posted on her facebook page , the footage shows how simple everyday actions have become an ordeal for her
' i am teaching myself every day how to support myself , how to find solutions , ' she told the huffingtonpost
' i live with neuropathic pain ( unbearable ) which also suffer amputees
my suffering is physical as well as moral , my body is heavily damaged and tired faster than normal
' normally , we need five nerves to control one arm ; four nerves from my marrow have already been torn off , so they are not recoverable , and i have already undergone two surgeries , one of which was a nerve graft , ' she wrote in a description accompanying her video
partially paralysed manon slomkowski has released a video revealing how she manages to get ready every day with the use of just one arm the french woman does everything including painting her nails and putting on her watch with her right hand the 22 - year - old suffered a horrific motorcycle accident in the tunnel of nanterre near paris in march 2014 and as a result is unable to move her left arm ' when i first came back from the hospital , i remember going up to my room and bursting into tears
this is when i first realized what had happened to me and that my life would completely change
' it took me a while to recover my life rhythm , to eat again , to sleep , and to slowly reduce the doses of painkillers
' at first , i had a hard time doing things by myself and everything felt painful , every movement or gesture
i could n't find pleasure in doing anything
' she adds that whilst she looks to the bright side , there are moments of uncertainty : ' i am deprived of my passion but also a lot of activities , my family is worried about me and my future
' ' what 's been the most difficult , and still is today - all people who have paralyzed or amputated limbs will back me up on this -- is how to bear the neuropathic pain , also known as " phantom limb pain "
' this kind of pain is very difficult to manage and some people are completely unable to bear it
but there are techniques to help us relieve this pain
most of the times , i can manage it , so i 'm ok
ms slaomkowski , above , lies on the bed and rolls over to do up her bra with her right hand she then shimmies the bra up her body and over her right arm , above she says : ' i am teaching myself every day how to support myself , how to find solutions , ' ' you can see in my video , for instance , the solution for my bra : one of my friends , who is able - bodied , gave it to me , because i was tired of always waiting for somebody to help me hook it up ! ' i have always hated somebody else helping me do something or doing it for me
' there are tons of activities i still can not do by myself
my single real fear about the future is for when i become a mother and i need to take care of my baby as a single - handed mother ... fortunately , i have heard from mothers suffering from plexus palsy that they generally do very well
' ' if i had to give advice to all the people who have suffered from injuries caused by any kind of road accident , i would tell them ' be happy and fight for your lives , ' because you still have the chance to see tomorrow , ' she says
' to all road drivers , remember that you are not untouchable , and the 30 seconds when i thought i was almost killed me
you do n't want that , so drive slowly and carefully
