the ruling by mrs justice patterson at the high court yesterday was welcomed by robert halfon , mp for harlow , who described it as a ' major step forward in ridding the town of this blight
' harlow council leader , jon clempner , said : ' the town has had enough and we needed to resolve this situation with a long term solution to protect land now and in the future
' an injunction , which covers a piece of land here and there was never going to work , so we had to look at a something which has never been done before and is town - wide
' months and months of detailed preparation backed up with a catalogue of community concerns meant we had a very strong case that could be put forward to the judge
' it is not - and never has been - about persecuting any particular group of people or their way of life
' this situation has really tested the patience of the whole community and we need to end this cat - and - mouse game which is being played
' seeking a high court injunction of this size and scale takes time and requires a huge amount of preparation to get it right especially when it has never been done anywhere before
