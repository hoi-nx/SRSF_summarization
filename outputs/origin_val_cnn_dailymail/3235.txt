â on a night when alloa athletic unveiled shock new signing michael chopra , the former sunderland and newcastle striker , stuart mccall ruled out fresh recruits to ibrox
â at this time of the season , the new faces that you can get in are lads that have not done anything since january , â he said
â we have got enough players in the squad that we are trying to get up to speed
there is a under - 20s game on wednesday and i will get a look at some of the boys in that
â i thought ( andrew ) murdoch was terrific tonight , i thought ( tom ) walsh was terrific
and we had decent performances from a couple of others
â we were nât rotten tonight
we were better than we were on saturday
we âve drawn twice with alloa athletic already this season and it was never going to be 3 - 0 or 4 - 0
rangers manager stuart mccall insists he saw some positives on tuesday night against alloa athletic rangers were forced to share the points with alloa athletic as some familiar flaws haunted them at ibrox â the players showed spirit and ability after coming from behind to go ahead but we âve switched off and let them score with their second time up the park
it is easy to knock what is going on here
i respect that and understand that
â but there is a fight to be had and we have got to have enough fighters to believe we can go on and still make this season a success
but tonight is a massive disappointment
ibrox has become a hard place to play and the players know they âve got themselves in this position with their performances in recent months
