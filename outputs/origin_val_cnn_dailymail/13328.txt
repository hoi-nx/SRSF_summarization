admit it , you 've been secretly itching for a new cause since last year 's ice bucket challenge for als left your teeth chattering and raised $ 115 million
this one 's goofier and tastier , and wo n't leave you needing a change of clothes
it 's the # twizzlerchallenge
so what 's this challenge all about ? think of the spaghetti scene from " lady and the tramp , " except substitute a twizzlers for the noodle
chomp and chomp and chomp until your lips meet in the middle , then smooch
you 're supposed to do a video , of course , and challenge others to do the same for a good cause
the ball got rolling almost two weeks ago on comedy central 's " night of too many stars , " a fundraiser for autism programs
a tweet from sportscaster fred katz challenged the " today " show 's geist and uzo aduba , who plays suzanne " crazy eyes " warren on " orange is the new black , " to share a " lady and the tramp " licorice
it took off from there
next thing you knew , geist was repeating the stunt with vieira and the # twizzlerchallenge was on
geist and vieira challenged matt lauer and kathy lee gifford
they were good sports about it , but you may want to close your eyes here
this is n't for the faint of heart
the challenge is starting to invade social media
just search the hashtag # twizzlerchallenge
it sounds like a sweet deal for the folks at twizzlers
their candy is on the lips of america
and to their credit , a couple of twizzlers executives took the challenge and donated $ 10,000
the money goes to new york collaborates for autism
the group funds and creates schools , programs and services for people with autism nationwide
since 2006 , " night of too many stars " has raised over $ 22 million
if this challenge is even half as successful as the ice bucket challenge , that number will triple
see you at the candy counter .
