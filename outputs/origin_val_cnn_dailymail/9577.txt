gold coast woman evita nicole sarmonikas has died in a mexico hospital after undergoing surgery â the autopsy showed eva went into cardiac arrest following surgery
the hospitals ' only response was to cling to their waiver , removing themselves from any liability , â a family member wrote on the facebook group
â there have been no answers and their only offer of â cooperation â was an urgency to return her to us in the form of ashes
the australia the australian embassy has strongly advised we do not allow this to happen
â ms sarmonikas âs family have been advised to travel to mexico as soon as possible to request an independent autopsy â not carried out by the hospital where she died â and to bring her home
they say she ' did not have travel insurance and we were never prepared for a situation of this magnitude '
â evita as we knew her on earth would be devastated at the amount of attention she is receiving at the moment , as she was extremely private and worked very hard to never be a burden on anybody , â her family wrote
â however the abundance of love that we all hold for her is propelling the action that needs to be taken before she be laid to rest , and she deserves that
â a facebook tribute page has been set up for evita to share advice and support and to help fundraise to bring her body home to australia one friend on facebook described eva as a ' shining light in the dark and unforgiving world ' her family are also asking for help in gaining legal and medical representation as advised by the australian embassy
ms sarmonikas âs family have not said what procedure evita was undergoing before she died but they explained : â as beautiful as evita was inside and out
she was still filled with certain inadequacies
as almost every woman on earth does
â â her perfect and whole soul was not strong enough in light of a world that constantly bombarded her with an urgency to demand more from herself and her body , â they explained
â she never demanded anything from anybody , but was always out giving her people
these near perfect graphic comparisons our young women are bombarded with from get go are too much for innocent hearts to battle , and the consequences are fatal when not conducted by adequate professionals
ms sarmonikas âs family have been advised to travel to mexico as soon as possible to request an independent autopsy â these doctors promised her more perfection to fill an emptiness that began developing early in our childhood
this emptiness further expanded with traumatic experiences in her adult life and the constant social boarding of a false beauty illusion , â they facebook post continued
her sister andrea has urged others not too risk their lives in the pursuit of what they perceive as beauty
â this was not the way to go home , no woman should risk death to improve on perfection , â they said
â tomorrow morning when you look in the mirror say to yourself " i am enough , i am worthy , i am perfect just the way i am "
â do n't listen to a world that is hungry to fill your insecurities with poison
stop feeding an industry that hates humans , especially women in the natural state and their perfect birth bodies
do it for eva , do it for you
â tributes have poured in for the 29 - year - old
