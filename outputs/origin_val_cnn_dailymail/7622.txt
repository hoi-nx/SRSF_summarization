we âre conscious of that
but no matter how big percentage is against us , we have to give everything to make the statistics lie and that âs our belief : that we can do it
â we âre here for that
monaco are in very strong position
we have experience , we have the desire and we have the belief that we can do it
you can expect us to show different side to miss. ' we totally missed the first leg , which was pretty surprising as we âve won 12 of our last 14
of course we did nât play well but in life , if you miss a chance , sometimes you do nât have a second chance
but here we have a second chance

â i did nât visit the casino when i was here , â said arsene wenger
â as in england , i stayed a lot on football pitches
i do nât think people saw me there â we need to perform well tomorrow and have a great performance
before the game what we want is to give everything
if we did nât believe , we would nât be here
â ideally you want score early but i believe we have to play with full power but not forget organisation and structure in the team and when the goal comes , the goal will come
no - one can predict when that will be
mesut ozil ( right ) believes it will be ' very important ' that arsenal score an early goal against monaco keeper wojciech szczesny ( centre ) may have to settle for a place on the bench on tuesday night ' football is not predictable but i can predict that desire and belief will be there
we âre in the champions league last 16 and anything can happen on a positive front as long as we believe we can do it
â arsene wenger does have concerns about the pitch at the stade louis ii , with monaco engulfed by rain showers at present
â it is a little bit of a problem if it rains a lot , â said arsene wenger
â there were two problems when i was manager and one was that the pitch quality was not fantastic
' but i just went out on the pitch and it âs good very good
and the second problem was when it rains in south of french , it really rains
they âve had to postpone a match here recently â but that forecast is not for heavy rain
â all of arsenal 's stars will have to shine if they are to reverse the 3 - 1 deficit to reach the quarter - finals ( l-r ) gabriel paulista , tomas rosicky , mertesacker , santi cazorla , sanchez , theo walcott and mesut ozil
