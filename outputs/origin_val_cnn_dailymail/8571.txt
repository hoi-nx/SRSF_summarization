a sydney pastor has spoken about the incredible moment bali nine ringleader chan offered a vital piece of himself in a bid to save the man 's life
feebrey , a men 's mental health ambassador , had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010 , when the death row inmate , with whom he had formed a close friendship , offered his own liver up for transplant
chan , who had been in jail for five years at the time , ' knocked ' the assemblies of god minister about when he heard of his friends plight and immediately said , ' have mine '
here i am waiting for a donor , i 'm dying in front of my wife and kids and here he is going " my liver 's ok , you can have mine " , ' mr feebrey told the sydney morning herald
' he was sort of like , if they want to kill me , then you can have my liver
it was n't a passing - the - time comment , he wanted to make it happen
if he could have pulled it off he would have , ' he said
chan reportedly began making enquiries about whether the organ donation could go ahead , determined to save mr feebrey , who shared his christian faith and had been a regular visitor since his incarceration in 2005
while mr feebrey received a liver from another organ donor , he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his ' incredible ' friend
chan and fellow bali nine member sukumaran are currently being held on nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency
mr feebrey said that when chan heard the news that his appeal for clemency from indonesia president widodo , he was more concerned with the health of a fellow inmate who was in the jail 's clinic than himself
' it was a bit surreal
chan took it on the chin and with courage and then he just walked off to go to the clinic to go and see this guy , ' mr feebrey said while mr feebrey received a liver from another organ donor , he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his ' incredible ' friend the pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two australian chan and fellow bali nine member sukumaran are currently being held on nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency mr feebrey has continued to be in regular contact with chan , and is an outspoken advocate for the ' i stand for mercy campaign '
the pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two australian , and posted on his instagram account after the chan heard of his rejected clemency appeal
' just spent the last half an hour with my friend chan , when the australian consulate staff notified him that his final appeal against [ the ] death sentence was rejected , ' mr feebrey posted
' he took it on the chin with courage , humility and with a contrite heart
' in february , the pastor posted a ' message of hope ' to supporters of chan on his instagram account
' the most beautiful people that i 've known are those that have known defeat , known suffering , known struggle , known loss and yet found a way out of these depths , ' he posted underneath a photograph of himself with chan
in february , the pastor posted a ' message of hope ' to supporters of chan on his instagram account the men 's mental health ambassador said it would be tragic for chan and sukumaran , who have worked tirelessly to mentor other prisoners , to be executed
' chan is the idyllic , dream guy to mentor and rehabilitate and a great seed like him â they want to put to death ? , ' mr feebrey asked
both chan and sukumaran have been involved in running education and drug rehabilitation programs inside kerobokan since 2009
new footage has emerged of sukumaran , shot as a part of a documentary in may last year , of sukumaran discussing his hopes for the future before his bid for clemency was rejected
' i think i can do a lot of good on the outside if i ever got free
it 's not like i 'm just going to go back after all this and just sit and be somewhere , ' reported 9news
' i would want to do stuff like work and make good stuff and help people , ' he told norwegian educator ivar schou , who met the australian while running rehabilitation programs inside the prison
sukumaran , who now faces the death penalty along with fellow inmate chan , said that he believed he had done wrong but that he felt his punishment was too harsh
' i accept what i did was wrong and i think i should be punished for it , ' he said
the pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals sukumaran , left , and chan , right , will be put through an ' assimilation ' process as they prepare to face the firing squad ' but i do think the death penalty is too excessive
' sukumaran was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from bali to australian
he has called kerobokan prison in bali his home for the past ten years , along with chan
sukumaran describes the immense change that he has seen in his life over the past ten years , most notably when he and other inmates were allowed to start education
' in 2009 they finally gave us permission to start working and doing some projects
slowly slowly it helped me with my life
it helped me be productive
i started learning and i was able to help other people learning
' earlier on saturday the indonesia attorney - general muhammad prasetyo said that the pair could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals
president widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores mr sukumaran was a highly respected art teacher while he was detained in kerobokan prison mr praseyto said the execution of the bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row
this could delay the pair 's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out
the australian government , alongside several notable public figures , have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of mr chan and mr sukumaran
foreign minister bishop has written to the indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions
ms bishop is yet to receive a response .
