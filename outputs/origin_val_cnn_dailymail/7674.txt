southampton manager koeman has seen a reaction from goal - shy pelle after dropping him in the league for the first time
the 29 - year - old striker enjoyed a dream start to life at st mary 's after moving from feyenoord in a reported Â£ 9million summer deal
pelle scored nine goals in his first 12 matches for southampton in all competitions and netted the winner on his debut for italy
pelle ( 19 ) has struggled with form recently and was n't happy at being dropped for the first time the goals have dried up of late , though , and he was replaced in the starting line - up by shane long in sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at chelsea
pelle ran straight down the tunnel at the final whistle , having played the final few minutes , and koeman hopes the striker can end his three - month wait for a premier league goal when burnley visit this weekend
' there has been a little bit of a reaction , yes , because nobody is happy to stay on the bench , ' the southampton boss said
koeman ( centre ) says he 's ' seen a reaction ' from pelle after leaving him on the bench against chelsea ' sometimes you need a reaction off the player in that situation
' in that game , in that moment , i think it was good to change the way of playing with more fast players up front
saturday we play at home
' koeman has no fresh injury worries to contend with against burnley , with eljero elia coming back into contention after missing last week 's match through injury
sean dyche 's relegation - threatened side head to st mary 's buoyed by last weekend 's shock win over champions manchester city and having overcome southampton 1 - 0 earlier in the season
' yeah , they beat us but it was n't a very good game that day and we missed a penalty , ' koeman said
the targetman was in superb form at the start of the season and scored nine goals in 12 matches ' it was a stupid goal against us but , of course , we analyse always the opponent and we play 11 against 11 and then one team is playing like burnley
' sometimes it is difficult to prepare a training session for the match , but we expect an aggressive opponent who will press us with direct play
' that is always difficult because they do n't give you time to play and you have to that and you have to prepare for that
' saturday 's match will be their last before a two - week international break , during which time many of southampton 's players will be away with their national teams
martin odegaard ( left ) was linked with a loan move to the southampton next season but koeman denied the claims england duo nathaniel clyne and fraser forster are amongst those players , with some eyebrows raised by the fact left - back ryan bertrand did not join them in roy hodgson 's squad
' i am not surprised , ' koeman said
' he had suspension for three games
after that he came back and is playing well
' i think he played very well against chelsea but i am not surprised because his time will come if he keeps working like this , keeps playing like this
' the 16 - year - old signed for real madrid from norwegian side strã¸msgodset and big things are expected meanwhile , koeman downplayed speculation linking southampton with a loan move for talented real madrid teenager martin odegaard
' it is not my job to do scouting of young players , ' he said of the 16 - year - old norwegian midfielder
' he moved to real madrid - that means that he is a very good player
