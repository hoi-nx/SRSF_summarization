forget vivid shades and garish colours , the latest eyeshadow craze is to go nude â earthy and pink tones that mimic the natural colour of our eyelids
they make eyes look bigger and flatter older skin as they do nât crease or highlight wrinkles
the duchess of cambridge is a fan â last week she revealed her favourite eye make - up is urban decay âs naked palette
here , alice smellie puts the latest nude eyeshadows to the test ... kate âs make-up naked palette , urban decay , Â£ 38 , urbandecay.co.uk shades of nude : twelve rich shades from deep cream to charcoal are presented in a fabric case with a mirror
they are applied with a double - ended , scarily large brush
application : the cream looks startlingly white on my eyelids , but the bronze shades are easy to blend
though thick , both ends of the brush are delicate enough to apply to my lids without dropping product onto my face
the thinner of the two ends draws a thick , dark line above and below my lashes
i look in the mirror and my eyes are smoky enough to hang out in a jazz club , but not overly gothic , and it lasts through a dog walk with a sprinkling of sleet , which is impressive
9/10 metallic magic la palette nude rose , lâoreal , Â£ 14.99 , boots.com shades of nude : a slender compact with ten shades , from beige through rosy tints to a dark purple
six have a subtle metallic sparkle
application : you ca nât go wrong with these ! the shades are sheer so you do nât need a steady hand to apply it and can layer them on confidently
the darker shades look menacingly gloomy in the compact , yet they are so sheer on the skin that i end up using a dark brown rather than a bronze
the final look is age - appropriate for me in my early 40s , and it is light enough to wear in the day
when i catch sight of myself in changing room mirrors while out shopping , i look ten times less tired than usual

application is via a double - ended brush

a lot of powder comes away as i swirl the brush over the eyeshadow
i find the brush too thick to apply a line along my lashes and it gives me a bruised look under the eyes

the powder sinks into my wrinkles
