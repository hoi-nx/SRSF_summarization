it 's an age - old adage , but looking on the bright side of life can be good for your health , scientists said today
adopting a positive mental attitude lowers the risk of suffering a heart attack , requiring surgery and even death
that is according to a new study by a group of scientists at ucl
the research found after suffering a heart attack or angina , the most pessimistic patients were twice as likely to suffer a more serious health condition in the next four years , compared with the most optimistic patients
these conditions include a more severe heart attack , heart surgery or death
a new study by researchers at ucl has found optimists are less likely to suffer a heart attack , heart surgery or die in the years after suffering an initial heart attack or angina in the uk , 2.3 million people are living with coronary heart disease , the major cause of heart attacks and unstable angina ( the type that does n't occur upon exertion but strikes randomly , and persists even at rest )
meanwhile in the us , around 375,000 people die each year from coronary heart disease
scientists surveyed the mental attitudes of 369 patients , who were admitted to hospital with unstable angina and heart attacks
they monitored the patients ' health over the next 46 months
led by bhf professor steptoe , the team noted their findings could be linked to a number of physical and psychological impacts of being optimistic
half of the most pessimistic patients who smoked were still smoking one year after going into hospital
in contrast , 85 per cent of the optimistic smokers had quit their habit entirely , a year on
smoking has long been known to be a major risk factor for heart attack and angina , with an estimated 22,000 deaths each year from cardiovascular disease linked to smoking
the research comes ahead of no smoking day next wednesday , when the bhf will call on smokers to quit for good
the study also showed that optimistic patients are more likely to increase their consumption of fruit and vegetables , a year after their heart attack or angina
the study found pessimists were more likely to smoke and live an unhealthy lifestyle - factors linked to poor heart health forty per cent with a positive outlook were eating the recommended five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day
meanwhile only 20 per cent of the most pessimistic patients were eating the required amounts , 12 months after their hospital admission
lead author of the research , professor steptoe , said : ' our research shows that optimistic people are more likely to take advice about lifestyle changes on board , like quitting smoking and eating more healthily â this results in better outcomes after a patient suffers from unstable angina or a heart attack
' our findings could be used to identify pessimistic patients and encourage them to make the necessary changes to their lifestyle that can ultimately lead to better health
' dr mike knapton , associate medical director at the bhf , said : ' the next steps for this research would be to show psychotherapy like cognitive behavioural therapy to improve optimism can improve the outcomes for pessimistic people
' suffering from a serious condition like angina or heart attack can take a drastic emotional toll , which we know can lead to depression , further lowering the chances of a full recovery after a heart attack
' if you 're living with a heart condition and struggling to cope , we would urge you to contact your gp who can put you in touch with the necessary support
' although noting a more optimistic approach promoted a patient 's recovery by encouraging a healthier lifestyle , researchers did not find optimistic people were more physically active
in the past depression has also been linked to poor outcomes for heart patients
this study found pessimistic patients were twice as likely to have depressive symptoms a year after suffering a heart attack or unstable angina
the scientists hope their findings will help identify the patients most at risk of suffering serious health complications in the years after recovering from heart problems
the study was published in psychosomatic medicine
there are two types of angina , called stable and unstable angina
the symptoms of these two types are similar , but there are some important differences
attacks of stable angina usually occur when the heart is forced to work harder , for example during physical activity or emotional stress
in some cases , the pain can also develop after eating a meal or during cold weather
these are known as angina triggers
the symptoms of stable angina usually improve if you rest for a few minutes
unstable angina is more unpredictable
it can develop without any obvious triggers and can persist even when you are resting
attacks of unstable angina may last longer than a few minutes and do not always respond to treatments used for stable angina
