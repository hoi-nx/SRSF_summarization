andreas lubitz bought two audis in the weeks before tuesday 's crash and was planning to give one to his girlfriend germanwings pilot andreas lubitz bought two brand new cars several weeks ago and was going to give one of them to his girlfriend , it has been claimed
andreas lubitz , 28 , purchased the audis from a dealership on the outskirts of dusseldorf , near the apartment where he lived with his girlfriend
one of the cars had been delivered last weekend , just three days before the tragedy
focus magazine said it was not known whether the car which was delivered last weekend was for andreas lubitz or his girlfriend
however , despite the gift , german media claimed that andreas lubitz 's relationship was in trouble and the couple may have split up
this has been seen as a contributory factor to tuesday 's tragedy
the woman , who has not been named , is understood to be staying with family while german investigators conduct a full forensic search of the property in dusseldorf
the couple lived in a smart top floor apartment on the outskirts of the city
habibalah hassani , 53 , who runs a pizza restaurant close to their flat said he had often seen them together
' they were a very nice , friendly young couple
she was a polite and attractive woman
they would come in once maybe twice a week
' he used to tip well , he was very generous
he had told me about his trip to san francisco
i had n't seen them for a couple of months before this happened
' i think she will be with her family grieving at the moment
' german media claimed that andreas lubitz was receiving treatment for depression and had been certified sick on the day of the disaster
herrenbrueck of the dusseldorf prosecutors ' office said the discovering of sicknotes inside the property ' support the current preliminary assessment that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and colleagues '
mr herrenbrueck said other documents found he was suffering from ' an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment '
prosecutors claim they have not found any evidence linking andreas lubitz to terrorism or any form of religious extremism
the thorough search has failed to find any suicide note among dozens of boxes removed from the apartment and andreas lubitz 's family home in montabaur

he was passionate about the alps and even obsessed
i 'm sure he knew the area of the crash well because he had flown in a glider
' ernst muller , also a member of the club added : ' i am certain that andreas lubitz has participated at least once or two internships with us in sisteron ( alpes-de-haute-provence ) ' .
