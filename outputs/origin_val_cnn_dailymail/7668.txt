a blood test that screens couples for thousands of genetic flaws which they could pass on to a baby is to go on sale
couples will be told if the combination of their genes puts them at risk of having a child with an incurable disease
the compatibility test can flag up more than 600 conditions , including some that kill within the first years of life
if couples are told they are at risk of having a child whose life would be blighted by ill - health , they can decide whether to adopt , have ivf treatment or go ahead and get pregnant naturally
new test : couples will be told if the combination of their genes puts them at risk of having a child with an incurable disease spanish firm igenomix , which developed the test , says pre-pregnancy genetic screening could soon become as commonplace as ultrasound scans
the company âs test is designed to give peace of mind , but at Â£ 1,800 per couple â Â£ 900 per person â it does nât come cheap
plus , there are concerns people will become stigmatised simply because they are carrying the â wrong genes â
critics also say it panders to those who believe the only acceptable child is a perfect one
the nhs does pre-pregnancy testing but focuses on people with a family history of just a few conditions
the new test , which will be available at randox health clinics in london and northern ireland from may , checks for thousands of faulty pieces of dna
conditions include cystic fibrosis , which is carried by one in 25 britons , as well as rarer conditions that cause blindness , blood disorders and life - threatening hormonal problems
conditions such as autism , alzheimer âs disease and diabetes are not included
spanish firm igenomix , which developed the test , says pre-pregnancy genetic screening could soon become as commonplace as ultrasound scans the test is aimed at people who are carriers of disease genes , meaning they will not have symptoms themselves and may even be unaware of the problem lurking in their dna
most people have several disease genes and a recent study by igenomix found that 8 per cent of couples were â clinically incompatible â , meaning both had the same faulty dna
such couples would be told there was a one in four chance of their child being ill and counselled on their options
these include an ivf technique , in which only healthy embryos are implanted in the womb , the use of donor eggs or sperm or adoption
some women may opt to get pregnant naturally and abort later
dr peter fitzgerald , managing director of randox health , said : â our wide - ranging new screen will detect potential problems before pregnancy by obtaining information from both parents
with this test , we can alert prospective parents to the risk of serious genetic conditions
â there is another pre-pregnancy test available privately but it checks for only 100 diseases
philippa taylor , of the christian medical fellowship , said the limited and expensive options available to couples who â fail â the test could push them toward getting pregnant naturally â and aborting if the baby is unhealthy
she added : â this test is going to create further anxiety through the over-medicalisation of pregnancy
â dr david king , of campaign group human genetics alert , warned that if testing became popular , couples could feel pressurised to use it to avoid having children with genetic conditions
he added : â that will lead to a society in which parents with disabled children will be blamed and disability will become less and less acceptable
we need regulation and ethical debate before such tests are introduced
