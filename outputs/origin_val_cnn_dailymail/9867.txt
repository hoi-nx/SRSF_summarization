when morgan spoke at the end of sunday âs thumping defeat he seemed to be suggesting that it would still all somehow be â alright on the night â for england at this world cup
well , i âm afraid it wo nât be unless everyone involved , both players and management , have a good hard look at themselves
there needs to be a lot of hard , honest talking in that england camp over the next few days and a re-evaluation of how they are doing things because if they carry on like this they will not be involved in the world cup for much longer
morgan looks disappointed as he watches on during england 's disastrous defeat by sri lanka the england players , led by their captain morgan , walk from the field in wellington after the match ' even when england put what looks like a challenging score on the board they are still brushed aside with contemptuous ease
not for the first time in this world cup they seemed like boys in the men âs world of modern one - day cricket
' click here to read paul newman 's match report from wellington england now need to win their next five games if they are going to lift their first world cup
when did they last win five one - day internationals on the trot ? it is going to be hard enough to win two in a row , let alone the next five
the whole tone was set with the sight of gary ballance walking out at three after england had got off to a really good start
now , it âs not ballance âs fault
he did not ask to be picked out of position and out of nick
but it just sent a message to england âs players that they were going to prod their way through the middle overs and then have a go in the last 15
and it was a policy that brought england 309 that in the old days would probably be enough
now it is nowhere near
sri lanka fans wave flags and lift banners in celebration after beating england convincingly in wellington morgan ( left ) and james anderson ( right ) react as kumar sangakkara survives a run out chance contrast that with sri lanka
they get off to a good start , lose a wicket like england , but then in walks a world class no 3 in kumar sangakkara who knew exactly how to pace the innings and ensure sri lanka won with ease
and how come jos buttler was left with just 19 deliveries at the end of the innings ? he made one of the best one - day hundreds i have seen from an england player last summer â and it was against sri lanka at lord 's
now he is not being allowed nearly enough time to put england out of sight
then , sitting on the bench , we have alex hales , who hit one of the best world twenty20 hundreds you will see by an england player
and that happened to come against sri lanka too , in last year âs world twenty20 in bangladesh
gary ballance ( bottom right ) loses his wicket , leaving england at 71 - 2 during their innings alex hales ( left ) is sitting on a beach , and jos buttler ( right ) got 19 deliveries - something needs to change sri lanka must have looked at england and laughed to see two such key players being under - used and , worse , not being used at all
then we have bowling that was just too one - dimensional to make any sort of impact on sri lanka
it was all right - arm , all one - paced and most of it too short
we can not just bang the ball in halfway down and expect to bully sub-continental players any more
it just ai nât going to happen these days
moeen ali has been england âs most economical bowler at this world cup
so why not play a second spinner in james tredwell ? or why not try ravi bopara âs cutters with the keeper standing up ? morgan and the men in charge of england need to take a good hard look at themselves after their defeat thirimanne ( left ) and kumar sangakkara helped sri lanka to a comfortable win over england in new zealand anything to get a bit more variety into the attack because the bowlers offered morgan nothing in wellington
they just never looked like getting people out , even if a couple of chances did go down
in the first over of the batting power - play , with fine leg up , stuart broad banged one in short and was hit for four by kumar sangakkara
then from the first ball of the second over steven finn did the same the same thing and was hit for six
it just is nât working and england need a rethink
there is no magic fix
there are nât lots of brilliant players waiting to come in to this one - day side
those who are on the outside are there for a reason and have , in most cases , fallen short to a larger or smaller degree
that âs why i keep on saying the culture has to change as much as the personnel
sangakkar and team - mate thirimanne shake hands with morgan after sri lanka 's nine - wicket win australia coach darren lehmann has shown that a change in coach can change a culture too from what i âve heard over the last year or two that culture has been driven by pre-meditated plans and statistics when it should be gut feeling and instinct the next week needs to be spent thinking how england can start playing a different brand of one - day cricket
the captain , who used to play with that gut feeling and instinct , needs to take the lead but darren lehmann has shown that the coach can change a culture too
england can not go into their remaining matches at this world cup with their fingers crossed
boy , do they need to start plotting a new way forward .
