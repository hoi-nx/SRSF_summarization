bale has been taking more than his fair share of flak from real madrid fans this season but supporters of the club 's basketball team would surely welcome him with open arms
that 's if the wales forward 's performance during the nba halfcourt challenge is anything to go by
bale followed in the footsteps of his former tottenham team - mates by taking on the challenge and scored an incredible three shots out of five from halfway , bettering anyone from the north london club
bale poses in a heat basketball kit as he prepares to take on the nba halfcourt challenge the real madrid forward managed to score three out of five attempts to lead the way the former tottenham forward celebrates after scoring a basket during the challenge bale leads the list of footballers to take part in the challenge ahead of demba ba , petr cech , andre schurrle , geoff cameron and brad , who all managed just one
the 25 - year - old missed with his first attempt but found his range with the second before narrowly missing his third shot after the ball bounced off the rim
but bale hit the target with his final two attempts to round off a hugely impressive display before throwing the gauntlet down to team - mate luka modric and formula one world champion lewis hamilton
bale 's fondness for basketball stemmed from a holiday in heat
' ( heat ) were playing in the finals and just from then i have been really intrigued by it and enjoy watching it , ' bale said
bale revealed his nba dream team including himself , peter crouch , luka modric , yaya toure and brad bale performed much better than any of the footballers to take on the challenge so far bale shoots and scores with his final attempt to make it three out of five bale scored twice for wales on sunday as they beat israel 3 - 0 in a euro 2016 qualifier ' just from there i have supported the heat and obviously lebron james being there before was a big reason in that
' bale also selected his nba dream team , and named himself among the starters
' peter crouch for a nice bit of height in the team , luka modric for the playmaker , yaya toure for the lungs of the team for the back and forth and brad
brad 's got the safe hands , he 's american , knows the game and he can control everything
