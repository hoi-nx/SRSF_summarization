mike zimmer says the vikings have no intention of trading peterson
but the player and his agent have other ideas
' we 're planning on him being back
we have no plans to trade peterson , ' he said
' we 're good to go
i mean , he 's under contract and we expect him to honor it , ' zimmer said at the nfl
' i think when he goes into the hall of fame , he 's going to want to go in with the jersey that everyone remembers him as
that will be as a vikings
' peterson played one game for the vikings last season before being suspended but ben dogra , agent of the superstar running back , has other ideas
' peterson and i feel it is in his best interest , and it would be his desire , to play elsewhere in the nfl
this is not personal in any way , it is business , ' he told the associated press
three years remain on the 30 - year - old 's deal with $ 12.75million due this season
none of the money is guaranteed
peterson remains on the commissioners exempt list until at least april 15 after hitting his four - year - old son with a switch and the 2012 mvp has been less than enthusiastic about returning to minnesota
zimmer also poured scorn on notions that the vikings are set to trade 2013 first round draft pick cordarrelle
mike zimmer spoke to reporters during the nfl 's annual meeting in phoenix the eccentric receiver and returner made the pro bowl after his first year in purple , but found himself sidelined with the emergence of charles johnson and his inability to run routes
' no , no chance whatsoever , ' zimmer told 1500espn.com
' cordarrelle is a young , emerging player who was with his third coordinator in three years
quite frankly , we need to do a good job of figuring out how we can use him better and he needs to understand where he 's supposed to be , the routes and everything
