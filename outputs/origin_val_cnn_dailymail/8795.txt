man who would be president : texas senator cruz will reportedly announce his bid on monday cruz will reportedly announce his intention to run for president of the united states this monday , which would make him the first officially declared hopeful in the 2016 election
the texas gop senator , who is still in his first term of congress , is due to commit himself to a presidential campaign at a speech in virginia next week , according to senior advisers
aides in the cruz camp spoke about his intentions to the chronicle , but insisted on remaining anonymous
cruz will hope to triumph against other gop front - runners such as jeb bush , scott walker and rand paul to win his party 's nomination
the chronicle reported that cruz will announce at a convocation ceremony held at liberty university , virginia , the world 's largest christian university
sketching out his campaign strategy , cruz aides said he will hope to raise more than $ 40million to help him compete in the primary campaign
cruz is said to be skipping the step of forming an ' exploratory committee ' , which jeb bush has already taken , and will directly announce the bid
he will hope that his conservative credentials will play well with the tea party wing of the gop , and also rely on scooping up second and third - preference votes from less convinced voters
though he lacks the clout of other candidates within washington and the political establishment , strategists admit , they hope that with the voters of key states like iowa , new hampshire and south carolina , he will be able to carry the day nonetheless
however , cruz remains an outlier in a busy gop field
a poll earlier this month , from quinnipiac university , gave him 6 per cent of the gop vote
men to beat : jeb bush , left , and scott walker , right , both command more gop support than cruz
jeb bush has formed an ' exploratory committee ' for his bid , while scott walker has yet to announce in comparison , wisconsin governor scott walker took 18 per cent , former florida governor jeb bush won 16 , with three other hopefuls still polling better than cruz
however wins the gop nomination will still have to win out against the democratic contender , most likely hillary clinton , to take the white house next year
nobody else has outright declared an intention to run yet
however , msnbc reported last week that rand paul is planning to announce on april 7
the kentucky senator will reportedly make the direct announcement is louisville , which would give cruz a two - week head start .
