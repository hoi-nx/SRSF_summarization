once again the global community waits to see if the united states and its partners can really halt iran 's quest for nuclear power through a verifiable accord or if tehran is trying to buy more time for a clandestine nuclear weapons program it is suspected of having
true , the government of the iran has consistently denied it seeks anything more than nuclear energy for peaceful purposes
but supreme leader ayatollah khamenei 's repeated claims in public forums that " we do not have nuclear weapons , and we do not intend to produce them , " have failed to convince the united states , european union and israel
suspicion is well - warranted
iran reluctantly disclosed to the iaea , or iaea â only after united states - led detection â its clandestine enrichment of uranium at an underground facility near qum , testing of bridge wires to explode the detonators of atom bombs at the parchin military facility near tehran , and development of an advanced multipoint trigger system for nuclear warheads
even the iaea director noted on march 2 that the agency still could not " provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in iran and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in iran is in peaceful activities
" as a result , the chief ayatollah 's words seem more intended for defusing the international storm rather than changing domestic policy
moreover , khamenei has made it amply clear to iran 's citizens in the text of an infographic on his website , also reproduced by the state - controlled news media , that " iran must not cease or slow down " but should " continue nuclear research , expansion , and progress
" he has threatened as well , repeatedly , that iran will unleash a " crushing response " against any nation with which it clashes , making his stated intent to continue nuclear activities more ominous
however , economically strapped and internationally isolated , iran 's citizens are putting pronounced pressure on president hassan rouhani and khamenei
a november 2014 gallup poll indicates 70 % of iran hope their leaders will accept an agreement
they expect the country 's economy will jump - start through reduction or elimination of sanctions
so iran politicians and clerics , even those on the national security and foreign policy parliamentary committee , have gradually begun acknowledging that sooner or later " some sort of a result [ i.e. , nuclear deal ] " will have to be accepted by tehran
ordinary iran ' desire to reach a pact with the west is understandable
iran 's economy ranks only 32nd in the world , according to data from the world bank , despite its vast energy resources and well - educated public
consequently its people 's prosperity has fallen to a lowly 107th among the world 's societies , according to the legatum institute
plunging oil prices have recently added to domestic woes , with that country facing deeper deficit in revenues much needed for development projects
iran leaders realize their regime remains vulnerable not only to externally imposed sanctions , but more so to internally generated widespread discontent , which erupted and was violently repressed in 2009
regime preservation has multiple facets , however
it 's not just about keeping citizens fiscally happy
nuclear weapons work well in deterring external adversaries
processing such technology generates much pride at home , too
fifty - six percent of iran responded favorably to its continued development when polled in january
consequently there will be countervailing internal pressure on iran 's leaders to withstand fully meeting obligations under the nonproliferation treaty , irrespective of whether a deal is reached , even if the socioeconomic cost to their citizens and fever - pitch global consternation continue to rise
but iran 's leaders also know full well that agreeing to a pact that lifts most or all sanctions will boost the economy and thereby generate additional resources to enhance the regime 's popularity at home and influence abroad
this central goal of iran 's presence at the negotiating table was made crystal clear during the supreme leader 's nav roz , or new year , public address on march 21 : " removal of sanctions is part of the subject of negotiations , not of the results ... removal of sanctions should occur without any deal when an agreement is reached
" " we can see a path forward here to get to an agreement ... [ and ] very much believe we can get this done by [ the deadline of ] march 31 , " stressed a senior state department official traveling with united states secretary of state john kerry to lausanne on march 25
negotiators have even added three more months to resolve the technical details of the overall agreement
diplomacy may , as the obama administration has stressed repeatedly , indeed be the most efficient and least dangerous way to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon
certainly neither the united states nor the european publics want another drawn - out war in the middle eastern
but as the united states and other world powers work fervently toward clinching the long - awaited nuclear agreement with the islamic republic , it is important for western negotiators and politicians to bear two central considerations in mind : ( 1 ) irrespective of mechanisms written into the deal , will verification actually be possible on the ground to ensure iran both limits and becomes fully transparent about its nuclear program ? ( 2 ) would the world collectively or the united states independently be able to enforce punitive actions , such as re-establishing sanctions , if iran fails to comply fully and in a timely manner ? iran 's president continues to suggest that his country seeks a " win - win deal which would serve the interests of all the parties , " as does his negotiating team
but many western and middle eastern leaders fear the united states and its allies will not be able to truly enforce nuclear limits upon iran through any treaty
certainly not only many asian and african nations , but even two of the superpowers , russia and china , see little if any threat from tehran and would much prefer to reopen large - scale trade with iran than argue about atomic fission
last november , russia even entered into an agreement to build at least two nuclear reactors in iran
once sanctions are lifted , multinational corporations will likely invest heavily in iran and resist having to pull out subsequently
not surprisingly , influential hard - line iran leaders including ayatollah sadegh larijani , who heads iran 's judiciary , trumpet : " our country and our negotiating officials ... are the real winners in these talks
" four years ago iran 's revolutionary guards declared : " the day after iran 's first nuclear test is a normal day ... but for some of us there will be a new sparkle in our eyes
" even if a deal is done , will iran gamble that with the exception of the united states and israel , nations can come to live with it eventually reaching the threshold of nuclear breakout or wielding nuclear weapons ?
