' the couple spent a huge amount of time with planners to agree on a concept for the home that everyone was happy with
she said : ' the idea was to keep the original features of the main building , such as the beautiful exposed stonework , but not to mimic what was already there in the extension
' we wanted to create new sections that helped to tell the story of the building through the years and were an expression of the 21st century
' living here has been such fun
