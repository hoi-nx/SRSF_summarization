she is understood to have given a description of the killer , despite partial â memory loss â from â deep shock â , a law enforcement source said
as an â immediate eyewitness â , there were â grounds to conduct additional investigative action regarding her â , the source added
last night it emerged the head of russian âs investigative committee , alexander bastrykin , who will lead inquiries into the murder , is a vladimir putin loyalist with a history of intimidating the press
he once threatened to behead a journalist and investigate the killing himself
ukraine âs consul in moscow , gennady breskalenko , said miss anna duritskaya was questioned until 5am on saturday at the investigative committee building , where he had tried to see her
ostap semerak , a ukraine mp , said the model âs parents were concerned
he said miss anna duritskaya told them by phone that she had â no idea where she is kept â , only that she was â taken to some flat which is guarded , and she is not allowed to leave â
associates of mr nemtsov said she was staying with a friend
the opposition leader had organised the protest against russian âs involvement in ukraine , but it became a mourning rally , with chants of â russian without vladimir putin â
police claimed 16,000 marched , but observers said there were up to 70,000 , with several thousand more in st petersburg
david cameron said he was â shocked and sickened by the callous murder â and that mr nemtsov was â dedicated to speaking up tirelessly for the russian people , demanding their right to democracy and liberty â¦ and to an end to corruption â
mr nemtsov , 55 , a former nuclear scientist , rose to prominence under boris yeltsin , after the cold war , becoming deputy prime minister in 1997

voters in estonia appear to have turned away from a party that supports closer ties with moscow
pollsters say first returns , based on online voting , heavily favour the reform party of prime minister taavi roivas , with 37.5 per cent , more than the 28.6 per cent it won in 2011
the opposition centre party , which supports closer links with moscow , had just 7.7 per cent â compared with the 23.3 per cent it won in 2011
but it is thought these voters have less access to the internet

she was unharmed when he was hit by four of seven bullets fired from a white lada on a bridge near the kremlin
mr nemtsov had warned that mr vladimir putin wanted him dead
but the kremlin strongly denied any official responsibility for the killing
investigators said they were looking at the possibility he was killed by opposition figures , or that islamic extremists targeted the jewish politician
in an interview hours before his murder , mr nemtsov accused a â mad â , â aggressive â mr vladimir putin of lying over the ukraine conflict and called his rule a â catastrophe â
the president wrote to mr nemtsov âs mother , promising to â do everything â to ensure the perpetrators are â properly punished â
