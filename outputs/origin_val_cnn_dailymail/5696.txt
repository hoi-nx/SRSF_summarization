brown was last night accused of having a ' perverted sense of reality ' after claiming uk would be like north korea if it walked out of europe
tory frontbencher matt hancock said the former prime minister was in danger of losing ' heads and hearts ' by likening the uk outside the eu to kim jong un 's pariah state
it came after mr brown made an impassioned plea for uk to stay in the eu in what could be his last house of commons speech yesterday evening
tory frontbencher matt hancock said the former prime minister brown was in danger of losing ' heads and hearts ' by likening the uk outside the eu to kim jong un 's pariah state the former pm had earlier claimed leaving europe would leave the uk ' out in the cold with few friends ' and ' no influence ' like north korea
but replying for the government in the debate , mr matt hancock told the labour giant : ' our country has been turned around and is being turned but our country will prosper whatever the institutional relationship with europe
' we are a brilliant country with the most enterprising and innovative people in the world , and it ill behoves anyone - least of all ( mr brown ) - to compare uk 's future to a brutal dictatorship like north korea
' and comparing uk to north korea shows a perverted sense of reality , and indeed you lose heads and hearts when you make such as comparison
' mr brown had made the claim in a newspaper article published before last night 's debate
in the house of commons mr brown claimed that tory eurosceptics and ukip have instigated a ' culture war ' urging disaffected uk to blame foreigners for economic problems and so turning people against europe
the former prime minister railed against those on the right who have sought to address voters ' concerns about globalisation by creating a ' siege mentality ' that pits uk against the continent , portraying support for europe as unpatriotic
in what is likely to be his house of commons swansong , the labour giant said the only way progressives can win the ' culture war ' to keep uk in the eu is by winning hearts as well as minds
north korea leader kim jong un ( centre ) inspecting the unit 1016 of korean people 's army air and anti-air force at an undisclosed location in north korea brown made an impassioned plea for uk to stay in the eu in what could be his last house of commons speech yesterday evening
it came after he claimed uk would be like kim jong un 's pariah state ( above ) mr brown cautioned against a ' london establishment - led , corporate financed ' statistics - heavy campaign by ' elites ' against leaving the eu as ' technical arguments are not enough to trump cultural grievances '
instead those who want to remain in the eu must passionately affirm that ' uk is not uk ' unless it plays a leading role in shaping europe , as it has for centuries - ' championing toleration , liberty and social responsibility ' before any other country
in a passionate speech which a handful of tories attempted to derail with heckles about the former chancellor 's record in government , mr brown called for uk to lead a progressive movement in europe to give globalisation ' a human face '
he told the house of commons : ' there is no doubt that millions of our fellow citizens feel more insecure than ever because of what is the bewildering pace and destructiveness of what to them often seems an out of control and uncontrollable global economy , and they are looking for someone or something to shelter , insulate , protect and cushion them from these bewildering , often alien forces that have taken their livelihoods on occasion from them
business minister matt hancock attacked mr brown in the house of commons yesterday ' as they look for someone to hold responsible , and now they are being urged to turn what started off as economic protest , rather than a cultural prejudice , into a culture war - the main weapon of which is to blame foreigners , target immigrants and engender a siege mentality against the outsider
' mr brown stressed the need for an emotional argument against europe and a message that is bigger than the business case for staying in the eu
he said : ' i have to say that in this culture war , arid statistics about exports and investment from a well - meaning , london establishment - led , corporate - financed campaign of ' the great and the good ' , who will be accused of being elites who do n't understand uk , will appear to many voters no match for the cultural charge from the right that uk has ceased to be the uk that they know and love
' you can not win in a culture war which asserts uk is no longer a country you recognise just with fact sheets about the percentages of falls and rises in business investment
technical arguments are not enough to trump cultural grievances
' when you are fighting back in a culture war that others have started , you must take on strongly felt sets of beliefs with other strongly felt sets of beliefs
' and if we are to win hearts as well as minds , our core message must be bigger than the business case , and bigger than even making the principled case for engagement
' we must tell the uk people not just about our patriotism and our historic role at the hinges of history but how through putting our enduring uk values to work , we will lead in and shape the future of this continent
' and that uk which has always championed toleration , liberty and social responsibility before any country in europe - and , as far back as the days of adam smith , invented the idea of civic society and mutual obligation , influencing europe massively in the process - this uk is ready once again to lead a progressive movement , mobilising europe in what is the greatest challenge we face
' to make the global economy and global change work for people , by tackling its injustices , its inequities and unfairness and by giving globalisation what it most needs now - a human face
' replying for the government , mr matt hancock paid tribute to mr brown as ' a chancellor who dominated both the treasury and this house of commons and a prime minister who never gave less than his all in service of his nation '
the tory minister said : ' it falls to me to respond for the government on this historic occasion of what may be the last speech in this house of commons by you
' before responding in detail to the case you have made i think it 's only right that the house of commons acknowledge this moment
' since you entered this house of commons in 1983 you have been a warrior for social justice , a master of the despatch box , a chancellor who dominated both the treasury and this house of commons and a prime minister who never gave less than his all in service of his nation
' you have been a brilliant debater , besting nigel lawson in his prime , and humbling a long series of opponents throughout your career
' but mr matt hancock criticised mr brown for standing against an in - out referendum on uk 's eu membership , as promised by the conservatives .
