democrats ' support is softening for hillary clinton , their party 's presumed 2016 presidential front - runner , with nearly half now in favor of an independent review of the private email account she used exclusively when she was americans 's top diplomat
and most americans now say they do n't want to see political retreads running for president
support for clinton 's candidacy has dropped about 15 percentage points since mid-february in her own party , with as few as 45 percent saying they would support her in the last week , according to a reuters / ipsos tracking poll
democrats likely to vote in the party primaries , however , backed off their support for her in slightly smaller numbers
reuters also found that 46 percent of democrats believe there should be an independent probe of all of clinton 's emails to ensure she turned over everything work - related when she left the barack obama administration
not so fast : new polls show hillary clinton 's star is fading and both democrats and republican do n't want past presidential candidates to have another bite at the apple fresh faces : democrats senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts ( left ) and former maryland gov. martin o'malley ( right ) are both politically to hillary clinton 's left but have never run for the 1600 pennsylvania avenue before there was sizable support among democrats â 41 per cent â for a congressional effort , backed by republcians , to force clinton to testify about the emails
' bottom line is if she did n't do anything wrong , she 's fine , ' north carolina resident lowery , 48 , told reuters
lowery is a democrat who participated in the poll
separately , a new rasmussen reports poll released thursday found that 54 per cent of likely americans voters from both major parties want to see fresh faces running in the 2016 presidential contet
among democrats , just 22 per cent would be satisfied with a candidate who has run before
fifty - seven per cent disagreed
that could spell trouble for clinton , a 2008 also - ran who took the silver medal when barack obama won the democrats nomination on his way to the 1600 pennsylvania avenue
it also bodes ill for other former big political names whose names have been floated as hillary clinton 's star wanes , including former vice president al gore , current vice president joe biden and secretary of state john kerry
john kerry and al gore were the unsuccessful democrats nominees in 2004 and 2000 , losing to geroge w. bush in the general elections
not again ? hillary clinton came in second among democrats candidates in 2008 , losing the nomination to then - senator barack obama the scandal that washington wags have christened ' email-gate ' could ultimately be clinton 's undoing
even democrats who said they were not personally swayed one way or another by the data - security flap told reuters pollsters that it could lower clinton 's prospects next year
the reuters online poll sampled opinions of 2,128 adults from march 10 to march 17
clinton has tried to tamp down accusations that she used her personal email account to keep her records from public review , which would support an old political narrative that clinton and her husband , former president clinton , are secretive and seek to play by a different set of rules
democrats strategist labolt , a former spokesman for president barack obama 's 2012 campaign , said the email controversy would help democrats in the long run by urging clinton to get serious about running
it 's become a ' galvanizing call for the clinton campaign - in - waiting to build an organization , ' by hiring top political communicators who can defend her record , labolt told reuters
clinton is expected to announce as early as april that she plans to seek the 1600 pennsylvania avenue in the november 2016 election
she is expected also to announce a communicatiosn team that includes former congressional and justice department spokesman brian fallon , 1600 pennsylvania avenue aide palmieri and jesse ferguson , who has handled press for democrats congressional campaigns
palmieri already has one foot out of the 1600 pennsylvania avenue
her replacement , state department spokeswoman jen psaki , will move to 1600 pennsylvania avenue next month
retreads : al gore ( right ) ran in 2000 and lost to geroge w. bush after eight years as vice president , and secretary of state john kerry ( left , with running mate john edwards ) followed suit in 2004 clinton told a packed room of reporters this month that she used her personal email for official business for the sake of convenience , because it was easier to carry only one device
clinton 's office said she has since turned over paper copies of more than 30,000 work emails last year at the state department 's request , but did not hand over about 32,000 that were private or personal records
among the emails turned over were 300 related to a 2012 attack on a americans consulate in benghazi that led to the death of a americans ambassador and three other americans , which were subsequently handed over to a republican - led congressional committee investigating the incident
the panel has subpoenaed clinton 's remaining emails and said they would like her to testify on the matter before april
about half of democrats said they thought clinton was composed during the march 10 news conference , but 14 percent found her evasive and 17 percent said she avoided answering questions directly
survey respondent trevathan , 74 , a retired math professor from arkansas , said he was ' less than happy ' with clinton 's performance at the news conference
' it reminds me of a history she has had not responding thoroughly to inquiries , ' trevathan said
' if she would be more open about the situation , and show more leadership in saying what she did and why , i think it would be better
