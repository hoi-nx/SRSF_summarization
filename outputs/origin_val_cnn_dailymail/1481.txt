there was a time in 2012 when just about every selfie going was doctored by a grinning picture of terry , super-imposed in his full chelsea kit and lifting the champions league
their captain popped up all over the internet , a subject of ridicule after missing the champions league final against bayern munich in the allianz arena through suspension
this time he wore the chelsea strip for real , lifting the capital one cup high up in the wembley stands and dancing like a dad in front of their celebrating fans behind the goal in the west stand
terry lifts the capital one cup after captaining chelsea to victory over tottenahm hotspur tottenham goalkeeper hugo lloris watches as terry 's shot finds the back of the net during the first half diego costa , terry and cahill celebrate the opening goal of the game in london terry was man of the match here by a distance , driving this team towards their first trophy since jose mourinho returned with a performance that sent shivers down the spine
he scored chelsea âs opener on the stroke of half - time , a finish that settled any anxiety and pretty much any doubt about the destination of this year âs capital one cup
after that , he was peerless
the capital one cup is a level or two down from the champions league , or the three barclays premier league titles he has won at chelsea during a 17 - year career at stamford bridge â but one look at the chelsea captain told you it really mattered
this was further confirmation , as if it were needed , of his class
his last - ditch tackle on tottenham âs talisman kane , sprinting across to cover for his team - mate cahill in the final minutes here , evoked memories of the days when he was rated best in the world in his position
former atletico madrid forward diego costa had a hand in the second goal of the game on sunday afternoon chelsea manager jose mourinho and tottenham boss mauricio pochettino watch on from the sidelines goalscorer terry celebrates with diego costa during their capital one cup final win in london it hurt like hell for terry to miss out on the champions league final , that one night in munich when chelsea finally realised their ambition to win the biggest club cup in european football
at the age of 34 he plays one season at a time now , waiting for the call from chelsea technical director michael emenalo or director marina granovskaia to tell him that he will be staying on for another campaign
that conversation is coming , â a formality â according to jose mourinho recently as terry matured into a new role at the heart of the chelsea defence
incredible as it sounds , opposition managers and their players have yet to suss out that terry has passed on the main responsibility of marking to his usual central defensive partner cahill
that savvy move added another five years to alessandro costacurta âs career with ac milan when it was put to him by carlo ancelotti at the turn of the millennium
here , after lifting the first trophy since jose mourinho returned to stamford bridge , terry played like he could go on for another thousand years
terry slides in to block a shot from tottenham 's top scorer kane during the second half jose mourinho has been instrumental in terry 's return to form , inspiring new motivation in his captain fellow defender cahill has taken over many of the marking duties that terry used to perform himself kane went cold here , frozen out by the discipline of cahill â comfortably his best performance of the season â and the organisational ability of chelsea âs captain alongside him
cahill was terrorised by kane in the 5 - 3 defeat at white hart lane on january 1 , roughed up by the tottenham striker and losing his guaranteed place in chelsea âs team as a result
terry is talking this team through games , just as marcel desailly did when he returned to stamford bridge after winning the world cup with france in 1998
terry has matured these past couple of years and it is at times like this when you begin to wonder what else he could have achieved if he had kept his nose clean
the rehabilitation will never quite be complete , never quite final because he has never spoken about the day in 2011 when he racially insulted anton ferdinand
he really ought to speak about it because even if the words he used at loftus road that day are unacceptable , society will accept an apology , or a least an explanation
football can be a forgiving place
the chelsea squad celebrate their cup success following the final whistle in the capital didier drogba , terry and full back branislav ivanovic celebrate their first trophy since jose mourinho 's return chelsea 's captain and manager embrace after the portuguese coach 's first trophy since 2012 chelsea supporters see him differently , in awe as he added to his collection of trophies by hauling his team towards their first major honour of the new jose mourinho era
this was a reminder of days gone by , taking those familiar with his career back to his goal for england in this stadium when he rose into the night sky to head home a david beckham cross against brazil in 2007
those days are a distant memory and even england manager roy hodgson , admiring this performance from the stands , accepts that terry will never play for the national side again
everybody has moved on , and rightly so
he has played at the highest level and yet he reached new heights here , leading his team up the wembley staircase and leading the celebrations when he collected the trophy
dressed head to toe in chelsea âs blue strip , terry would nât have it any other way .
