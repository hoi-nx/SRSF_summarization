mr danczuk , who represents the town , has asked the police commissioner of greater manchester police , tony lloyd , to investigate whether a crime had been committed after comments made by the outspoken tv star on twitter
katie hopkins sent the tweets after mr danczuk attended the raising of a pakistan flag over the town hall for half an hour on march 23 to mark pakistan 's national day
she wrote : ' raising a pakistan flag in rochdale is not helping community cohesion
@ simondanczuk you & your party disgust me
' outspoken hopkins posted a series of messages to her account after the mp tweeted a picture of himself at the event
in response the controversial columnist sent a picture of eight men convicted of child exploitation offences , asking mr danczuk if they were his friends too
she wrote : ' are these your friends too âª @ simondanczuk ? is this why you are raising the pakistan flag in rochdale ? 77 years inside
' ' your pakistan friends saw young white girls as fair game when they abused them , ' she wrote in a separate post
' do not lecture me on community cohesion fool
' ' raising a pakistan flag in rochdale is not helping community cohesion , ' she added in another
âª @ simondanczuk you & your party disgust me
' explaining his decision to make the complaint , the mp said it was about the businesswoman ' inciting racial hatred '
he said : ' the letter is me asking the police commissioner to investigate whether a crime has been committed in relation to katie hopkins
' katie hopkins is said to have started sending the tweets after mr danczuk attended the raising of a pakistan flag over the town hall for half an hour on march 23 to mark pakistan 's national day he continued : ' it is not right that somebody who has little to do with rochdale incited hatred of this kind
' rochdale is a very cohesive community - people work well together
' of course there are tensions , like there are in other communities , but people rub together really well and we do n't need outsiders like katie hopkins to come in and cause trouble just for the sake of causing trouble and creating sun headlines
' mr danczuk said rochdale has faced up to the ' heinous crime ' of child grooming ' in a way that 's managed to keep our communities together '
he said : ' that 's why katie hopkins ' crass comments are not helpful
they are a clear attempt to divide communities , undo three years of hard work and make an unfair and racist generalisation that anyone of pakistan origin is a child abuser
' to equate the pakistan flag with child abuse , as she has done on social media over the last week , is absurd and it creates a dangerous environment where extreme intolerance becomes acceptable
' we have already seen taxi drivers stabbed in the face in race hate attacks and i 'm not prepared to allow people like katie hopkins , who know nothing about our town , to stir up tensions in such a dangerously provocative way that could lead to innocent people being attacked by extremists
' as a result of her comments last week , i have been threatened by extremists and hard right groups have pledged to march on our town
i am a strong supporter of free speech but it has to be responsible - and that 's why we have laws to prevent people deliberately provoking hatred of a racial group
' ms katie hopkins has been contacted for comment
she also sparked outrage yesterday after being accused of making a holocaust joke aimed at the wife of ed miliband â even though his jewish parents fled from the nazis
' raising a pakistan flag in rochdale is not helping community cohesion , ' she added in another
