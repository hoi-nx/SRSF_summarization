former liverpool winger john barnes has warned sterling about setting his ambitions too high , too soon
the 20 - year - old is currently locked in contract negotiations with the reds after rejecting what manager brendan rodgers described as an ' incredible ' offer , reportedly Â£ 100,000 - a - week
his current deal is not due to expire until 2017 but the current impasse in talks - which will not resume until the end of the season - has led the youngster to be linked with a number of europe 's top clubs
there has been much speculation over the future of liverpool youngster sterling ( centre ) sterling , who is currently on international duty with england , is in the process of negotiating a new contract john barnes believes it would be a mistake , however , for sterling to go looking for a multi-million pound move before he has properly proved himself
' i would advise any young player who has been in the game for one or one and half years to stay and learn his trade , ' he told talksport
' show consistency over a four or five - year period before you make a big move , because then he will be judged as a Â£ 50million player
' i do n't think he is ready for a move to real madrid , barcelona or man city
talks have finished until the end of the season , but there has been speculation over a big - money move abroad former liverpool winger john barnes believes that sterling should stay and learn his trade at anfield ' as a liverpool fan i want him to stay but i think himself he needs to be very careful
' unfortunately the bad advice often sounds the most lucrative and therefore the best advice
' has he been playing consistently well over a long time ? no he has n't , and maybe his form has suffered because of the whole situation about that ( contract )
' john barnes said recent history is littered with examples of poor decisions and failures by young players and he did not want sterling to make the same mistake
' we saw it with scott sinclair and jack rodwell , who both went to man city
where are they now ? ' he added
' i think any young player should show a level of consistency where you are happy and people accept you and then if you want to put yourself under pressure by making a big money move do that - because it can all go wrong
sterling needs to show consistency over a four or five - year period to warrant a big move , according to john barnes john barnes noted that sterling should not make the same mistake as scott sinclair , who moved prematurely ' i think [ he needs ] another two or three years at liverpool and if he then decides he wants to move on then fine
' while sterling is still trying to establish himself as one of liverpool 's top players , one of their very best - steven gerrard - will be leaving in the summer to join los angeles galaxy
there have been suggestions the reds captain 's legacy has been tarnished somewhat by his senseless sending - off against manchester united last sunday , coming a year after his slip against chelsea played a huge part in the club missing out on the title
john barnes , however , dismissed such talk
' steven gerrard and kenny dalglish are the two greatest players for liverpool , ' he said
' nothing has changed because he got sent off against manchester united and nothing will change in the rest for the season
