official records claim a staggering 6.5million ' super-centurions ' have reached the grand age of 112 in the u.s. - but it is all down to missing death certificates
a record - keeping blip means social security records appear to show u.s. has a group of super-centenarians equal to the population of el salvador
but in fact there are only 19 people who say they are over the age of 112 in the u.s. today , and social security admits there are only 13 still getting benefits
mistake : a record - keeping blip means social security records appear to show u.s. has a group of super-centenarians equal to the population of el salvador ( stock picture ) record - holder : just 19 women are over the age of 122 in u.s. , with gertrude weaver , of arkansas , pictured , the oldest among them at 116 years and 255 days old the error has been caused because social security does not have death records for millions of people , the oldest of whom was born in 1869
that would mean , were that person still alive , they would be 146 years old - 24 years older than the oldest living person in history , frenchwoman jeanne calment , who was 122 when she died in 1997
they would also be considerably older than u.s. 's oldest living resident , gertrude weaver of arkansas , who is 116 years and 255 days old
but far from being something to chuckle about , ron johnson senator ron johnson , who represents wisconsin , has raised it as a cause for concern
it means there are millions of social security numbers which are still active , so a number could be used to report wages , open bank accounts , obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds
problem : senator ron johnson , pictured , says the active numbers are an issue as they can be used illegally ' that is a real problem , ' said senator ron johnson
' when you have a fake social security number , that 's what allows you to fraudulently do all kinds things , claim things like the earned income tax credit or other tax benefits
' ron johnson is chairman of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs , which plans a hearing monday on problems with death records maintained by the social security administration
the agency said it is working to improve the accuracy of its death records
however , it would be costly and time - consuming to update 6.5million files created at a time when the agency used paper records , said brune , a senior adviser to the agency 's deputy commissioner for budget , finance , quality and management
president franklin roosevelt signed the social security in 1935 , and the first old - age monthly benefit check was paid in 1940
' the records in this review are extremely old , decades - old , and unreliable , ' brune said
the internal watchdog 's report does not document any fraudulent or improper payments to people using these social security numbers - but it raises red flags that it could be happening
landmark : president franklin roosevelt signs the social security bill in washington in 1935 for example , nearly 67,000 of the social security numbers were used to report more than $ 3billion in wages , tips and self - employment income from 2006 to 2011 , according to the report
one social security number was used 613 different times , while 194 numbers were used at least 50 times each
illegal immigrants often use fake or stolen social security numbers to get jobs and report wages , as do other people who do not want to be found by the government , and thieves are known to use stolen social security numbers to claim fraudulent tax refunds
the irs estimated it paid out $ 5.8billion in fraudulent tax refunds in 2013 because of identity theft
but the social security administration is trying to combat the problem , generating a list of dead people known as the ' death master file ' , so employers can compare the numbers they are given with those which should no longer be in use
but none of the 6.5million people cited by the inspector general 's report was on the list .
