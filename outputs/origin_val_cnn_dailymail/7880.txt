the dream of danish kids hoping to emulate michael laudrup and play for barcelona moved a step closer on thursday with the announcement of the spain club 's plans to set up an academy near copenhagen
simonsen , who became the first dane to represent the catalan club when he joined in 1979 , said the academy would offer young danish prospects a new kind of footballing education
' barcelona comes with a new offer to the young people , who will come to learn an entirely different philosophy , ' simonsen told a news conference as plans for the fcbescola academy , which will be based some 16km north - west of copenhagen in ballerup , were unveiled
young danish players could follow lionel messi ( left ) into the barcelona first - team through a new academy simonsen believes the new academy will give danish players the chance to enjoy a new philosophy ' i sincerely doubt that the philosophy is practised in very many places , so it will be completely new
' but reaction to the news was not all positive and the dbu ( dbu ) poured cold water on the idea
' the dbu has still not received an official request from barcelona about their desire for the establishment of an academy in danish , including specific information on what such a setup would contain , ' the dbu said in a statement
' it is a precondition for the establishment of such an academy in danish that it obtains the approval of the dbu
' the dbu 's head of grassroots soccer steen joergensen expressed concern over the well - being of children and that danish junior football could become a hotbed of competition between elite academies as youngsters chase the dream of turning professional
former danish international michael laudrup played for barcelona between 1989 and 1994 ' for us it is important that barcelona , like all others , manage to take care of both the child and the talent , so that there wo n't be tough competition with focus on the potential economic gain at too early an age , ' he said in a statement
' it is initially about childrens ' well - being , happiness and security , which in our opinion are fundamental prerequisites for the development of children
' fcbescola director xevi merce played down suggestions that the world - famous club 's network of academies were a way of unearthing players who would then be spirited off to the la masia academy in spain , where lionel messi learned his trade
' we are going to give a plus to danish , not to steal talents
we will develop and demonstrate our method , and then we will learn from danish football , ' he said .
