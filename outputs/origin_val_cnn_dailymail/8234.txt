real might be feeling the heat from barcelona in the la liga title race , but it does n't seem to be placing too much pressure on neymar and co. barcelona closed the gap at the top of the table to two points last weekend , and face rayo vallecano this weekend hoping that a real slip - up could send them top
but while the pressure has been heaped on the europe champions , barcelona players neymar , adriano , dani alves and douglas looked relaxed on friday
neymar posted this picture on instagram of him and his team - mates at barcelona 's training ground the brazilian star scored on wednesday in barcelona 's 3 - 1 win over villarreal in the copa del rey neymar - suspended for sunday 's visit of rayo vallecano - posted a picture of the quartet on instagram after finishing off a training session at barcelona 's ciutat esportiva joan gamper base
that came after neymar was called up to brazil 's squad for their upcoming friendlies against france and chile - with manager dunga being questioned over whether his side was too reliant on their star man
' since he has been designated captain of the team , he has had an upgrade on his level of football , ' dunga said of neymar
neymar has been training with barcelona ahead of facing rayo vallecano with the hope of closing a league gap ' he likes challenges , the more responsibility he has , the more he will develop and get better
' we are very happy to have him ; he is doing fantastic things in europe
' our priority is first to have a strong collective , and then as a second step , one outstanding player can naturally differentiate himself and help us to be better
' neymar is not the pure focus of brazil 's national team squad , according to his manager dunga
