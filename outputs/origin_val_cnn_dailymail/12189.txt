after not hearing from hyeon soo lim , pak said they thought he could have been caught up in north korea 's recent ebola policy

pak , the church 's spokeswoman , said she does n't believe hyeon soo lim would have engaged in any type of proselytizing , which is prohibited in north korea

" we do n't believe that 's the way he would have behaved
he 's very wise about that
