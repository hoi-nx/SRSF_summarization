â she added : ' it 's just one of those things
it happened and i tried to really think about it and not do it , but it 's habit

but , in a second statement , the kennel club said it would not be ' fair ' to strip the dog of its best in show title , solely due to the behaviour of its owner

the rspca confirmed it was also investigating allegations that an overseas competitor had mistreated his dog outside the showground , pictured they said : ' we completely understand the concerns about how knopa , the best in show dog , was handled on the judging table
' a decision will be made by committee about what action may be taken within the current rules and guidance
in this specific case an investigation is underway and a decision will be made by committee about the actions that have been taken by the exhibitor at crufts and the next steps
' the judge âs primary focus is on the dogs themselves and we do not believe it would be fair to strip the dog of its best in show title because the dog was awarded this prize based on its own merits in the show ring
' it added : ' prior to this incident the guidance related to handling has been followed by those showing their dogs but in light of this situation we will be reviewing our rules and guidance and how they may need to be amended going forward
jagger , who is co-owned by belgium aleksandra lauwers and leicester - based breeder dee milligan-bott , died in his owner 's arms on friday , after returning home to belgium the owner of this chamption myter , eye to eye , also believes the dog was deliberately poisoned after she was found vomiting and shaking in pain shortly before it was due to be judged on friday meanwhile , the rspca confirmed it was investigating allegations that an overseas competitor had mistreated his dog outside the showground

the scottish terrier was initially bred as a working dog by farmers to eradicate vermin and hunt small animals underground
it has a very long and strong tail which owners traditionally used to pull it out of holes
it is not said to hurt to pick them up in this way
' we received a complaint about this the day after the incident ( 9 march 2015 ) and would urge anyone who witnessed the alleged incident to contact us urgently
' the kennel club added : ' the kennel club has been made aware of an alleged incident outside the nec during crufts , which has led to accusations of cruelty in the way a man was treating his dog
' we understand that a photograph purporting to show the man in question mistreating the dog , is circulating online and the kennel club is looking into this as a matter of priority , as any type of animal cruelty will not be tolerated
' we will be liaising with the nec to gather any evidence of what happened and until that time we are not in a position to comment further
