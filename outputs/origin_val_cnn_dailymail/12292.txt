fall river , massachusetts jenkins , the fiancee of former new england patriots star hernandez , revealed for the first time monday she suspects marijuana was in a box she was instructed to remove from the couple 's home the day after the slaying of lloyd in 2013
hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of lloyd , the boyfriend of jenkins ' sister and semipro football player who was found dead june 17 , 2013
hernandez has also pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge
his co-defendants , ernest wallace and carlos ortiz , have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately
for the first time , jenkins told jurors on monday the box smelled " skunky , " making her think it was marijuana
her new description came during cross-examination
earlier , she told prosecutors during direct examination that she did n't know what was in the box , said hernandez never told her , nor did she look
jenkins testified friday that on the day after lloyd 's slaying , her fiance called her with instructions that it was important to discard the box
on monday , she described his tone as " normal " when he made the request and said she had never been asked by prosecutors what she thought the box smelled like
" were you ever asked what you thought was in the box ? " asked hernandez lawyer charles rankin about her previous testimony to the grand jury
" never , " said jenkins
" were you ever asked if it had any smell to it ? " he asked
" never , " she replied
jenkins ' revelation contradicts the prosecution 's previous suspicion that the weapon used in the slaying was in the box
no weapon in the case has been recovered
home surveillance video played inside the courtroom monday showed jenkins hoisting a black garbage bag from her home and putting it in a trunk of her sister 's car
at the time , shaneah jenkins had been at her home grieving over the death of her boyfriend
shaneah jenkins was present in court on monday and cried while listening to the testimony and watching the video of her sister shayanna carrying the trash bag
the two sisters now barely speak to each other

after concealing the box with her daughter 's clothing , jenkins said she disposed of it at a location she can not remember
" i found a random dumpster , and put it in there , " she told bristol county district attorney william mccauley
when questioned about her inability to remember the dumpster 's location and other details , jenkins said she had been unsettled at the time
i had to comfort my sister
everyone 's emotions were on me , and it was a form of breaking down at that point , " she said
on monday , jenkins was asked about what she called an " on - again , off - again " relationship with hernandez , her high school sweetheart
she recalled spending time apart from hernandez after discovering evidence of infidelity on hernandez 's phone
she told the court that before getting back together with him , she had to make a difficult choice about her future with the football star
" i made a decision that if i was going to move back in with hernandez , i would need to compromise with his behavior , including his infidelity , " she told the courtroom and then started to cry
after hernandez proposed in october 2012 , jenkins said she continued to tolerate his infidelity
jenkins admitted giving some different answers during her grand jury testimony , in part , she said because of confusing questions by prosecutors
she faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges
jenkins has pleaded not guilty
this week , the jury is expected to hear from bradley , hernandez 's former right hand man , who has accused hernandez of shooting him in the face in february of 2013
however , a judge has barred him from discussing that
bradley is jailed in an unrelated shooting
the trial is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. tuesday
