bayern legend beckenbauer has raised concerns over the poor discipline of franck ribery and jerome boateng
winger ribery was criticised recently by bayern head coach guardiola for his tendency to react angrily to on - field provocations , and beckenbauer is worried that a failure to control his temper could end up costing his team
he is also worried that a similar risk exists with midfielder jerome boateng
' franck ribery is often dealt with pretty roughly
but that does not mean he can afford to lose his temper , even if he is often provoked , ' beckenbauer told sky , ' people know that he often reacts
it 's the same thing with jerome boateng
the spaniard 's deal at the allianz arena is set to expire next year and beckenbauer spoke only in glowing terms of the man who delivered four trophies in his debut season in charge of the club , lifting the bundesliga and german cup domestically as well as the uefa super cup and fifa world club cup
beckenbauer said , ' guardiola does not need a contract
he is the type of coach who comes and goes whenever he wants
bayern would like to hold on to him for the remainder of his life and i hope he will stay put for a long time
it is a perfect fit
it does not get any better than this
guardiola has been a major hit
' with all due respect to jupp heynckes ( guardiola 's predecessor ) , but guardiola has brought a new philosophy to the club
he has found the perfect combination between tiki-taka and the traditional bayern style
' guardiola 's impressive cv , which also features three la liga and two champions league titles from his time with barcelona , means that should he opt to leave bayern , he will have no shortage of suitors
