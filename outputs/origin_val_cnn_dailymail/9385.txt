david bland was researching mr weston 's history when he discovered that he had never received his gongs and wrote to the ministry of defence last month
just a few days later shiny defence medal and war medal arrived at the home mr weston shares with his wife margaret
david bland and his son paul are writing a village history book called greetham and the great war
paul bland said : ' weston was a bit surprised , but delighted to get his medals
' i imagine even 10 years after the war he might have thought it was too late
' weston had just got on with his life and had forgotten about it
we thought it was time to put it right
' greetham and the great war will be released in e-book form later this year
