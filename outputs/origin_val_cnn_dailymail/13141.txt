as a well - traveled photographer , pieter ten hoopen is no stranger to refugee camps
but he never experienced any like the mayo camp , which is outside the sudan capital of khartoum
ten hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for emergency , a humanitarian group from italy
he also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there
his hopes were dashed , however , when he was told he could n't photograph outside the hospital compound
" i had very , very hard restrictions from the sudan government
... they are very well - skilled in keeping the media at bay , " ten hoopen said
with no freedom of movement , much like the refugees themselves , ten hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in african
with the help of refugee hospital workers , he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available
the studio quickly became a sensation
once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken , lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken
one by one , these people sat solemnly to be photographed
it was their time to be acknowledged
there was gravity , earnestness to the way they posed
this was the moment their story would be registered
" this was one of the reasons why i built the studio : to get more material and more narratives from the people , " ten hoopen said
the project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees
the photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp , some have been there for decades
women wearing the traditional sudan tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped
from the muslim north , women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the christian south , who we also see represented in these photos
whether from sudan , south sudan or eritrea , the faces become , individually and collectively , a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the horn of africa

the word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict , their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs
hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely
" they got very serious , they sat down upright
... i tried to say as little as possible , " he said
" i do believe in their own expressions , their own narrative ... and their unique perspective
" the studio had a comforting effect
it was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital
it gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye , giving each person their deserved attention
aesthetically , it created an aura around each person , beaming light on his or her personal narrative
it had some uplifting effects as well
" i always try to put some extra thought to ( projects )
so i build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the african continent or in european ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way , " ten hoopen said
he said some patients at the hospital " had being laying there for months in their room
... then you take them out , it 's a little treat to get them out of their own misery
... that 's why you see the line growing , because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio
" ten - month - old buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio
having just had a blood test for malaria , she clearly looked uneasy
gazing to someone who is holding her hand , her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength
hawa haranan , 40 , came from the war - torn darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital
as she wears a simple tobe , one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare
her life and struggle , as with the other individuals photographed , is accounted for with the testimony of a camera
ten hoopen used tilt - shift lenses , which are normally used with the large - format cameras used in classic photography
" i really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded , i think , with respect and it was a very serious moment , " he said
" it 's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you
" how did ten hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees , some severely traumatized and living in fear ? " it was n't hard , " he said
" i just told them to relax and have fun
" kids sometimes got nervous , and i do n't blame them
i am a tall , white , bald european guy
... i am not only funny to look at , but it is hot in that country so i am usually very red when i am photographing
... i have tattoos everywhere
... they thought i was a quite interesting creature
