on a damp day at white hart lane just over 50 years ago we gathered to report on mackay making his comeback from a broken leg
we were about to witness the amazing proof of what many us believed , that mackay was the hardest man of all in an era of footballers who tackled like tanks
the short , stocky , powerful wing - half who is enshrined in spurs folklore as â the heartbeat â of the first team to achieve the league championship and fa cup double after the second world war had sustained a left leg fracture in a collision with manchester united âs noel cantwell at old trafford

typically , mackay went thundering in for the ball
to our horror there was a snapping sound
still he got up but the trainer rushed on , took a quick look and heart - brokenly told him the leg had shattered again
the pain must have been excruciating but mackay insisted on checking the diagnosis personally
he stamped his foot on the ground and only as the cracked bone stuck out through his bloodied sock did he accept that he could not play on
even then he spurned the stretcher and walked off , trying not to limp
â never show you âre hurt , â he growled as they hurried him to hospital
it was nât the first time we heard him say that
as for divers , he despised them
â get up and be a man , â he used to bark at any opponent who made a meal of his tackling , which was an even more fearsome thing of which to be on the receiving end than it was to behold
but always , unfailingly honest
that was why he disliked that iconic photograph of him grabbing a startled billy bremner by his leeds shirt neck at wembley
he thought it portrayed him as a bully
â no - one who goes into a fair challenge with me has anything to fear , â he used to say

a legend which might have ended that day was to grow even greater
yet he regretted that the iron man image tended to obscure his remarkable ability
â i can pass the bloody ball , you know , â he would rasp in that scottish brogue brought down from hearts
that was why we would elect him footballer of the year down here , to follow the same award won north of the border
danny blanchflower , the thinking man âs footballer , was esteemed as the brains of the team but mackay was very much more than the brawn
danny blanchflower was the captain but mackay was the spiritual leader on the pitch , the cement in their bond off it and their bridge to the fans
beneath that fearsome demeanour in action , he was engaging , amusing and charming and those who jostled for the team âs company after matches at the pub near the ground , the bell and hare , enjoyed his generosity

conscious of his role as a spurs figurehead mackay always dressed â properly â and his one sortie into commerce was to join his lifelong friend and tottenham fan jimmy burton in a tie manufacturing business
alzheimer âs was one of the ailments which afflicted his last years and in that sad sense we have been missing this great footballer and nice man for some time already
but none who saw him or knew him will ever forget mackay
and certainly not that day when he had to prove to himself that his leg was broken .
