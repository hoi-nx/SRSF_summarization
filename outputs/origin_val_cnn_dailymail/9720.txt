a uighur man in china has been sentenced to six years in prison for ' provoking trouble ' because he grew a beard
above , a rare photo of two men from the uighur minority who were not involved in the court case the unnamed man started growing facial hair in 2010 before being accused of ' picking quarrels and provoking trouble ' by officials
a campaign dubbed ' project beauty ' similarly encourages women to leave their heads bare and abandon wearing the veil - a relatively widespread practice among the uighur
speaking after the court case officials said : ' since the beginning of the year , a certain number of people breaking the regulation on beards , veils and burqa have been prosecuted and sentenced
' the repression of the uighur has been fanning tensions in the region for more than a year
the 38 - year - old 's wife was also given a two - year sentence for hiding her face
above , a stock image of a woman defying officials by wearing a colourful veil in 2013 china authorities flooded into the region after a wave of unrest caused tension between the uighur and the han chinese , the majority ethnic group violence increased last year and at least 200 people were killed in a series of bombings and deadly clashes with security forces
in april authorities in xinjiang 's shaya county offered cash to informants to report on neighbours with excessive facial hair
and in august authorities in karamay city banned people with large beards or islamic clothing from travelling on public buses
the origins of the uighur tribe lie deep in the altai mountains of mongolia - or in turkmenistan , depending on which version of the story you believe
according to the uighur , their origins are turkic and date back more than 5,000 years
they now reside in the xinjiang
by contrast , the china say the uighur are descendants of the tiele tribes of mongolia , who by 842 , had coalesced into the uighur people and moved to the tarim basin in what is now modern china
either way , the debate around the origins of the uighur is yet another skirmish in the ongoing battle between the majority - muslim tribe and the han chinese , the country 's majority ethnic group
mainly tolerated during the long rule of the china emperors , the real problems for the uighur began in 1949
after a failed bid for independence , the china cracked down on the fledgling state
activists accuse the china government of steadily eroding the minority 's freedoms , as they have curtailed religion , commercial and cultural activities
beijing has also been accused of seeking to dilute uighur influence by arranging the mass immigration of han chinese to xinjiang
according to china , their activities are justified because of the terrorist threat posed by uighur separatists
the uighur themselves vehemently dispute this claim .
