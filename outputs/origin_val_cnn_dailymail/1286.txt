if england 's early world cup exit was not hard enough to stomach then look away now because the australian media has found rich entertainment in poking fun at eoin morgan 's beleaguered men
after the calamitous 5 - 0 ashes whitewash last winter , australian scribes could hardly have expected that just 12 months later they would be handed even more ammunition to shoot down the mother country
the 15 - run defeat to bangladesh that sealed england 's fate in adelaide was their fourth defeat in five games at a forgettable world cup and means they will fly home after their now meaningless final group game against afghanistan on friday
