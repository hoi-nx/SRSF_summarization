the images , given the disturbing title ' harvesting of spies ' , were taken in the iraq province of salahuddin and published on social media
according to the captions , the four men were accused of being spies for the baghdad government and had been condemned to death by an islamic court
depraved : the images of the execution were taken in the iraq province of salahuddin and published on social media unusually for an isis public execution , no residents appear to have been allowed to witness the killings , despite them being carried out in a public place kneeling in matching black jumpsuits , the four alleged spies are shown with their hands tied behind their backs
isis fighters , three with their faces covered with balaclavas and another wearing a baseball cap , are pictured posing behind their victims with sharp knives
an isis official , carrying a machine gun and with his index finger pointing to the sky , is shown coordinating the execution
dressed in a long tunic and wearing a head scarf , the man appears to be a local isis governor or judge
the bearded official steps back and at his command , the four prisoners are beheaded on the tarmac road
alleged spies : the four men were accused of being spies for the baghdad government and had been condemned to death by an islamic court kneeling in matching black jumpsuits , the four alleged spies are shown with their hands tied behind their backs unusually for a public isis execution , no residents seem to have been allowed to witness the killings , despite it being carried out in a public place
the final two photos - too graphic to publish - show the severed heads of the victims
just last week , footage was released of nine men being executed by isis for allegedly being spies
each man was forced to give interview before their murder in which they admit to spying on the terror group 's location , movement and armament
all nine of them - blindfolded with hands bound behind their backs - are then escorted outside by masked terrorists who eventually instruct them to kneel and place handguns to their heads
senseless : last week , isis released footage of nine men being executed for allegedly spying on the terrorists forced confessions ? before their deaths , each man claims responsibility for spying on isis , although it is unknown whether they are speaking under duress they pull the triggers without hesitation , sending their victims jerking forward until their limp bodies hit the dusty ground
the masked isis commander who introduces the senseless propaganda video says the men ' were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of allah '
the graphic footage , filmed in an unknown location in the middle east , ultimately shows the deceased captives resting perfectly still in a shallow pool of blood
it was the second video of an isis execution to surface last week following the brutal mass murder of eight ' informers '
the terror group justified the killings as vengeance for the military operations against them in syria and iraq
murdered : militants claim the eight men were informers , engaged in military operations against isis
