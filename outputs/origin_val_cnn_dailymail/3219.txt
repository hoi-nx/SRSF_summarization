our pillar - box red , open - top chevy would fail its mot abysmally
the suspension has gone ; only the driver 's door opens from the inside and there does n't even seem to be a speedometer
but it 's still going and it 's a lot of fun
a bit like cuba , in fact
everyone says you have to go now before the chicken nugget invasion changes everything following president obama 's decision to lift sanctions after 55 years
a place with a past and a future : havana is an evocative city , rich in spain colonial architecture for sure , change is needed in a country where almost everyone is denied access to the internet , where most people take home around $ 20 a month , where there is still rationing and where not believing in the ' triumph of the revolution ' still makes you an enemy of the state
but turning round this old tanker is going to take decades , not years
the real reason to go now is because for all their travails , the cuba people are remarkably kind , honest and polite - and havana is like nowhere else on earth
everywhere we go , there is a healthy scepticism about the fidel castro years and what might happen if outsiders are ever allowed to buy land and property
we 're in the open - top chevy ( not driving it ) on the way to ernest hemingway 's house , 20 minutes from havana
we 've already downed a daiquiri at floridita , where a statue of the great man occupies the end of the bar , and we 've chased that up with a mojito at la bodeguita del medio , another of his hang - outs near the sublime cathedral square
before the day is done , we 'll sink more at la terraza in the fishing village of cojimar , the inspiration for the old man and the sea , which helped ernest hemingway win the nobel prize for literature in 1954
at the wheel : despite various mechanical troubles , mark managed to take to the road in cuba he bought finca vigia in 1940 and lived there off and on for 20 years
it 's pretty much how he left it
bullfighting scenes and stuffed animals hang from the walls , his typewriter sits on the desk and rum competes for space with his books
ask to see ada and take along a translator
she has looked after the house for more than 20 years
when i ask her what ernest hemingway would make of cuba today , her eyes fill with tears
' i do n't know , ' she says , ' but ernest hemingway loved cuba
' back in havana , our guide takes us to the museum of the revolution , where fidel , naturally , is the star of the show - but george w. bush has a walk - on part in the rogue 's gallery with the caption : ' thank you cretin for helping us make socialism irrevocable
' full of character : trinidad is a touristy - but charming - colonial town three hours south - east of havana what knocks us back is the beauty of the dilapidated grand houses , palaces and squares
it makes you wonder why on earth the british gave cuba back to spain in 1763 in return for florida
miami or havana ? no contest
a joke that still does the rounds is that the revolution failed on three fronts : breakfast , lunch and dinner
and it 's no laughing matter
there 's only so much dry fish with black beans on the side that a man in havana can take
our best dinner is at mama ines , where fidel 's ex-chef has opened his own restaurant
he 's an engaging fellow and the walls are hung with black - and - white photos of him and his former boss
you absolutely have to eat at la guarida , housed on the third floor of a glorious , crumbling building
the food is as dull as anywhere else , but the experience is exquisite : antique wine glasses , nicotine - stained walls , little balconies with room for one table each
there 's music everywhere in havana , of course
what takes us by surprise is the art. we have a tour of two studios where fidel is caricatured as a false jesus christ and a sex maniac
clutter and colour : cuba 's half - century on a limb has preserved havana in a dilapidated but beautiful state there are n't many decent hotels in the capital
we pick the pricey saratoga opposite the vast capitolio building ( a metre higher than capitol hill , of which it is a near - perfect replica ) because it has a pool on the roof
on the way to trinidad , a colonial town three to four hours away , we call in at the bay of pigs and watch a 20 - minute propaganda film about the failed us invasion , then spend a couple of hours in cienfuegos , which , frankly , leaves us cold , despite the 30 degree temperatures
trinidad is charming , but touristy
two nights here ( we stay at the excellent iberostar grand ) are ample
it was once prosperous thanks to sugar mills
today , its cobbled streets house restaurants and gift shops
two courses and a bottle of drinkable wine can be had for Â£ 20 a head
one of cuba 's best beaches , playa ancon , is eight miles away
we hire bikes and pedal off into the sunset , then persuade a local to bring us back in his rusting banger , bikes in the boot
hitting the right notes : you can find - as mark did - music and art in many corners of cuba on the way back to havana we stop briefly in santa clara , where the remains of che guevara , the poster boy of the revolution , are housed in a grand memorial building
we 've done our bit with respect to cuba 's past and return to havana , where the future is on everyone 's lips
our last night is in a private apartment on the top floor of a building in the residential vedado district
after dinner , there 's just time to take a horse and cart back to the old town , now a world heritage site
what is going to happen to cuba ? no one knows
life , hopefully , will be better for long - suffering cuba , but it might not be quite such a potent cocktail for the rest of us
