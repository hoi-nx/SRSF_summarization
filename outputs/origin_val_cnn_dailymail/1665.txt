when it comes to judging players , there are not too many more qualified than kaka
the 2007 ballon d'or winner and fifa world player of the year , beating ronaldo and lionel messi to the accolade that season , has selected the best eleven players he has played alongside or against for sportsmail
it is a diverse mix of astonishing ability and experience from the different eras his career has spanned to date , from his humble beginnings at sao paulo in 2000 to joining mls side orlando city in 2014
playing for ac milan twice and real madrid in between has meant there are few of the planet 's superstars of the past 15 years that he has not played for or against
in a team packed with stars , there is no place for lionel messi in his side
here , in his own words , kaka takes you through his best xi. kaka ( left ) , pictured in action against houston dynamo , has revealed his best xi exclusively to sportsmail kaka has played for european giants ac milan ( left ) and real madrid ( right ) during his distinguished career kaka , pictured celebrating a goal against croatia at the 2006 world cup , has also won 89 caps for brazil exclusive interview : oscar and ozil tell me i should come to the premier league but i 'm so happy in orlando kaka 's top five goals : from a solo strike against man united to a deflected free - kick for new side orlando city goalkeeper dida i played with iker casillas for four years at real madrid , but for me dida is the best goalkeeper
we played together and won together at ac milan and for the brazil national team
he is an unbelievable keeper
goalkeeper dida , pictured making a save at the 2006 world cup , played with kaka for brazil and ac milan defence cafu every time i have to say something about players that i 've learnt a lot from , i talk about cafu
he won the world cup twice and the champions league , but still he worked every day to win
his motivation was always victory in the next game
cafu , pictured kissing the 2002 world cup in japan , played for brazil for 16 years before retiring in 2008 paolo maldini he is similar to cafu
he won five champions leagues , he won serie a seven times , he won so much , but he was always the first to arrive and the last to go home from training
he was the perfect example to a player
ac milan legend paolo maldini ( left ) led the serie a club to both domestic and european glory across 24 years alessandro nesta the italian players , they see the game in a different way to other nations
they grow up learning about tactics so when they play professionally they can see where to position themselves and how to move and what the opponents will do
it made alessandro nesta such a strong defender and he was so quick , too
alessandro nesta ( left ) tussles with liverpool 's dirk kuyt during the 2007 champions league final in athens roberto carlos what an amazing player he was
so exciting at left back
i enjoyed playing with him
he was quick , strong and could hit some unbelievable free kicks and shots at goal
roberto carlos ( left ) became one of the world 's finest full backs with real madrid and brazil midfield andres iniesta he makes the toughest things on a football pitch look easy
that 's the biggest compliment i can pay him
how he plays , everything seems so simple
this is what i like about him
barcelona midfielder andres iniesta brings the ball forward during sunday 's clash with real madrid zinedine zidane i never played with zinedine zidane , just against him
it was wonderful how he played , how he moved around the field
it was like he was gliding
what he could do with a football , it was sometimes impossible to imagine
zinedine zidane ( centre ) , pictured in action in 2005 , is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time andrea pirlo i loved to play with andrea pirlo
i think he 's one of the greats
he sees the action before anyone else does on the pitch
my position was to play behind the lines , and he found me every time he could find me
andrea pirlo , pictured playing for juventus this season , starred alongside kaka at ac milan attack ronaldo i will have the three ronaldo 's up front , starting with ronaldo
i learnt a lot from him , which helped in my career , when we played for real madrid
he is the best player on the planet at the moment , a special player
ronaldo celebrates scoring for real madrid in sunday night 's el clasico at the nou camp ronaldo for me , the brazilian ronaldo is one of the best strikers in the history of the game
he is different to anyone
i would have to say he was the best player i played together with
his speed , his dribbling , his finishing , his movement
kaka counts ronaldo , pictured in action at the 2006 world cup , as the best player he has ever played with ronaldinho i played against lionel messi , but ronaldinho makes my final slot
he can do things with the ball you do n't understand
during training you see a lot of things you do n't see in the game
in training he was free from the emotional part , the responsibility of matches
in training he was free to do what he wanted
kaka has described his former brazil and ac milan team - mate ronaldinho as a ' genius ' with the ball
