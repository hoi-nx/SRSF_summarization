and then there were eight
the line - up for the champions league quarter - finals was completed on wednesday night as barcelona and juventus sealed their passage and though it may be a total wipeout for the english clubs , we certainly have a high pedigree field
now , more than ever , it 's all about scoring goals at crucial moments as the berlin final on june 6 looms on the horizon
but which of the eight survivors is best - equipped for the challenge ? we assess the forward trios of each team
messi was excellent for barcelona in their last 16 defeat of manchester city paris saint-germain vs barcelona atletico madrid vs real madrid porto vs bayern munich juventus vs monaco barcelona messi - absolutely mesmerising against manchester city and we are swiftly moving into territory where messi may be considered the best player of all time
the argentine maestro has 43 goals and 23 assists in 40 outings so far this season and , as ever , is central to barcelona 's hopes of another champions league triumph rating : 9.5/10 neymar - a real joy to watch , the 23 - year - old brazilian just gets better and better with every passing week
may not be able to match messi 's prolific goalscoring but is just as influential when it comes to carving out chances with a moment of magic 9 luis suarez - his troubles of last summer behind him , Â£ 75m man luis suarez is slowly growing into the kind of player barcelona want him to be
looks comfortable working in tandem with messi and neymar , running manchester city ragged in the first leg of the last round tie 7.5 total : 26/30 manchester city goalkeeper joe hart and barcelona 's neymar compete for the ball luis suarez tormented manchester city in the round of 16 tie which barcelona won 3 - 1 on aggregate real madrid cristiano ronaldo - it 's become a season of frustrations for real madrid , but cristiano ronaldo rises serenely above the negativity
with 41 goals and 21 assists in 39 appearances , his return this season has been as good as ever
their guiding light when real madrid ended their long wait of the 10th champions league triumph last season , he is needed again now 9 gareth bale - it 's been a turbulent season for the welshman , who seems to have been made the bernabeu scapegoat for their shaky form post-christmas , leading to suggestions he may return to the premier league in the summer
but he has still scored 16 goals in all competitions this season 7 karim benzema overshadowed by the aforementioned gareth bale and cristiano ronaldo , the france striker just gets on with the business of scoring goals
he has plundered 20 in the season so far and is always capable of getting into dangerous positions 7.5 total : 23.5/30 cristiano ronaldo is , as ever , integral to real madrid 's hopes of winning the trophy gareth bale has endured a difficult season but is sure to have an influence in the latter stages karim benzema celebrates a goal for real madrid against schalke in the second leg juventus carlos tevez - the renaissance of carlos tevez continued this week as his two goals in the westfalenstadion carried juventus through at the expense of borussia dortmund and increased his season 's tally to 23 , including six in eight in europe
his deadly finishing combined with a strong work ethic is one of the reasons juventus can be considered dark horses 8 alvaro morata-a 22 - year - old with plenty of maturity and promise , moving from real madrid to juventus for Â£ 17m last summer has proved the making of alvaro morata
also scored in borussia dortmund on wednesday night and has 11 for the season 7 roberto pereyra - proving an increasingly integral part of massimiliano allegri 's system , argentine pereyra has licence to roam and run at defences
the 24 - year - old has proved he can cut it at the top level this season 7 total : 22/30 carlos tevez helped juventus cruise past borussia dortmund 5 - 1 in the round of 16 alvaro morata continues to get better and better in a juventus shirt since his move from real madrid juventus 's roberto pereyra battles for the ball with henrikh mkhitaryan of borussia dortmund video allegri not surprised by champions league win monaco dimitar berbatov - the most chilled footballer around , dimitar berbatov can still deliver the goods , as shown by his goal in monaco 's shock 3 - 1 win over arsenal in the first leg of the last round
his goal tally may not be what it once was , but the bulgarian is still more than capable of producing a moment of magic 7 anthony martial - while dimitar berbatov is winding down , anthony martial is stepping up to the big time and hoping to live up to expectations
his goal return of five in 23 games this season is n't really good enough to suggest he 'll take the champions league by storm 6 yannick ferreira-carrasco - monaco 's other great young hope , belgian winger yannick ferreira-carrasco came off the bench to score the decisive third at the emirates
can trouble defences with his pace and positivity
7 total : 20/30 dimitar berbatov leaps above the arsenal defence during the second leg of their last 16 tie anthony martial gets clear of arsenal midfielder francis coquelin during the second leg in monaco monaco 's yannick ferreira-carrasco challenges for the ball with arsenal 's laurent koscielny paris saint-germain zlatan ibrahimovic - paris saint-germain 's one - man show just ca n't keep himself out of the headlines , for better or worse
we all know , on his day , the swede can be unplayable but paris saint-germain will have to do without him in the last eight following his sending off against chelsea
get through that and he could help them spring a surprise 8 edinson cavani-long - linked with a move away from the france champions , if edinson cavani is to depart this summer he 'll want to go out with a flourish
an ever - present in the champions league this season , the uruguayan has a great return of 18 goals this season , a third of those coming in europe 7.5 ezequiel lavezzi - it 's been a hit - and - miss season for the argentine , who has also been linked with a move away from the parc des princes
nonetheless , he played a role in helping to guide paris saint-germain past chelsea in the last round and could yet conjure a winning moment 6.5 total : 22/30 zlatan ibrahimovic saw a red card against chelsea but could still feature if paris saint-germain make the latter stages edinson cavani in a test of strength with chelsea 's willian during last week 's second leg in london ezequiel lavezzi sneaks up on chelsea captain john terry during the match at stamford bridge bayern munich robert lewandowski-with so many magnificent creative talents in the team , it 's little wonder bayern munich are dominating domestically and the favourites to win the champions league
but those chances need to be converted and robert lewandowski has been the man this season , with 17 goals in all competitions
there 's also that thomas muller fella too ... 8.5 arjen robben-he may be into his fourth decade but arjen robben is arguably in the form of his life
he has a remarkable 17 goals in 20 in the bundesliga , plus a couple more in europe this season and has been terrorising defences and taking great pleasure from it 8.5 franck ribery - on the other side , bayern munich 's alternative attacking force - franck ribery
with three goals in the champions league campaign , he will inevitably have an impact if bayern munich are to go all the way again 8 total : 25/30 robert lewandowski celebrates scoring for bayern munich in their 7 - 0 rout of shakhtar arjen robben shows his flawless volley technique in the last 16 , second leg tie with shakhtar france star franck ribery celebrates scoring bayern munich 's third goal in the large win over shakhtar porto martinez - if porto are to replicate their feats of 2004 and win the champions league , the goals of colombian martinez will be key
he 's already carrying them along , with five in the group phase
despite his absence with a calf injury , porto prospered against basle in last round but will want him back with tougher tests lying in wait 7.5 cristian tello - it 's been a productive loan spell for tello , with seven goals and 11 assists contributed by the barcelona forward
with a long - term stay at the nou camp pretty unlikely , tello should use these high - profile champions league games as a shop window 7 hector herrera - the mexican midfielder 's form is increasingly sharp , reaching a peak in the second leg with basle where he scored and created another for vincent aboubakar
with nine assists overall this season , he can supply the ammunition for martinez and tello ahead of him 7 total : 21.5/30 cristian tello leaps over the basle goalkeeper tomas vaclik during the second leg atletico madrid mario mandzukic-replacing diego costa is no mean task , but mario mandzukic has made a decent fist of it with 20 goals this season , including five in the champions league
if atletico madrid are to replicate last season 's amazing run to the final , they 'll need a few more from him 7.5 antoine griezmann - the france has been atletico madrid 's driving force and a very classy one at that
he has 17 goals and six assists so far this campaign and plays with flair and confidence 8 fernando torres - a striker who is slowly but surely putting the torrid times endured at chelsea and milan behind him back on familiar turf
yet to fully establish himself as a first - choice pick but may yet deliver that crucial goal 7 total : 22.5/30 mario mandzukic is challenged by leverkusen 's wendell in the last round atletico madrid 's antoine griezmann uses the full width of the pitch to get around leverkusen 's omer toprak fernando torres celebrates after scoring in the penalty shoot - out win over leverkusen in the last 16
