from machine parts and houses to replacement organs , humans look set to be able to create almost anything using 3d printers in years to come
and will.i.am believes we could even be 3d printing entire people in â our lifetime â
the musician and entrepreneur believes the surge in printing technology will shortly make this incredible feat possible and has called for â new morals , new laws and new codes â to govern the technology
musicians and entrepreneur will.i.am believes we could even be 3d printing whole people in â our lifetime â
he called for â new morals , new laws and new codes â to govern the technology , while unveiling an ekocycle pop - up shop in harrods , which uses waste material to 3d print objects ( a bust is shown ) and create new clothes he told dezeen âs dan howarth : â eventually 3d printing will print people
i 'm not saying i agree with it , i 'm just saying what 's fact based on plausible growth in technology
â he believes that humans will be pushed to adhere to new responsibilities so there should be laws to protect people and force us to do the right thing
researchers are making huge strides in printing organs using living cells and are expected to be able to print human tissues such as a heart in less than a decade
â if you can print a liver or a kidney , god dang it , you 're going to be able to print a whole freaking person , â will.i.am said
will.i.am ( pictured ) described 3d printers as â god - like tools â which could be used to create life and even allow teleportation one day
he believes that humans will be pushed to adhere to new responsibilities so there should be laws to protect people and force us to do the right thing from a human ear , to perfectly functioning valves , 3d printers are already being used in medicine
their ultimate goal is to create a new heart for a patient using their own cells that could be transplanted , but experts say it could be years or decades before such operations are regularly performed
the finished product would be called the â bioficial heart â - a blend of the natural and artificial
the heart may be built from cells taken from the patient 's fat
but plenty of difficulties remain , including understanding how to keep manufactured tissue alive after it is printed
patients in the operating theatre would have some fat tissue removed and regenerative cells isolated
the cells would then be mixed with solutions and placed in the bioprinter , which prints the heart
the new organ would then be transplanted in another operation
he described 3d printers as â god - like tools â which could be used to create life and even allow teleportation one day
will.i.am made the remarks at the launch of a range of sustainable lifestyle products , including clothing , bicycles and luggage , which he created with ecocycle â a recycling initiative with coca-cola
on sale at london department store , harrods , the products are made using waste materials such as 3d - printer filament produced from recycled plastic bottles
he told the guardian that 3d printing technology â will revolutionise society â and that in 10 year âs time , everyone will have a 3d printer in their house
â your friend will say : â let âs hurry up â and you âll go , â wait , my shoes have nât finished printing yet
â â will.i.am has already unveiled a smartband called puls , which has its own sim card inside to replace a smartphone
us citizens can apply to buy the wearable for $ 399 ( Â£ 264 )
while will.i.am may be worried about the possibility or printing humans , stephen hawking and elon musk fear we could be wiped out by intelligent robots
a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including the two revered men , have signed an open letter promising to ensure that ai research benefits humanity
the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future
the document , drafted by the future of life institute , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind while developing technology such as speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion which could benefit people
will.i.am launched his smartwatch , that can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone , in october last year
the puls smartwatch boasts an array of apps , gps and a voice - controlled personal assistant like siri
crucially , it includes a sim card reader next to the battery , which is fitted into the wide wristband , to make phone calls possible
a curved touchscreen is also built into the cuff design
will.i.am unveiled his smartwatch , which can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone , in october last year
called the puls , it can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone
it has a curved touch screen and a sim card reader built into its distinctive cuff design it has 16gb of memory , 1gb of ram , speakers , 3g and wi-fi connectivity as well as gps for maps and a pedometer and accelerometer for fitness apps
the watch runs on an android - based operating system using a qualcomm snapdragon processor , according to engadget
like apple âs siri , windows â cortana and google now , the device includes a voice - controlled assistant
called andeeda , it is described as the â virtual personality and the soul of puls â which can be used with popular apps such as facebook and twitter
will.i.am said : â puls represents my passion for , and my mission to marry design and advanced technology â to create a new breed of wearable device that leapfrogs what is currently on the market
â â¦ we designed aneeda from the ground up , taking her from an innovative concept to a reality
you speak , she listens
you ask , she delivers
you need something , aneeda âs ready
â with you at all times and incredibly capable â aneeda is the perfect virtual personal assistant
â while the smartwatch does n't have a heartbeat sensor like some of its rivals , it apparently detects emotions and can share these â vibes â with others using an app called vibe
a built - in music app will allow users to store music locally , as well as use a digital music service from a uk company called 7digital
because the puls is a stand - alone gadget , it requires its own data plan
this will be available from at&t in the us and from o2 in the uk
the cuff will come in black , white , pink and blue
while there is no news about the device in the uk yet , us citizens can now apply to purchase the puls for $ 399 ( Â£ 264 ) by joining the ' make it great ' programme .
