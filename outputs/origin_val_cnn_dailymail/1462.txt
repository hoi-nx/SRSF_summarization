a crime lab scientist testified today that his dna matched dna found on a cigarette butt at the crime scene biagiotti of the state police crime lab told jurors that she received rolling paper from a 2 - inch - long cigarette butt to test for dna
she said she found it had the dna of at least two people on it
she said she first compared it with odin lloyd 's dna and discovered he could have been one of the people whose dna appeared on the butt
she said she then was able to use odin lloyd 's dna to deduce the second dna contributor
' i did a comparison between the profile i deduced and the profile of hernandez , ' she said
' i found that the profile from hernandez matched the deduced dna profile
' she then ran a statistical analysis and determined the likelihood it was someone else is one in more than a quadrillion
' how many zeros does a quadrillion have ? ' prosecutor william mccauley asked her ? ' one with 15 zeros after it , ' she replied
he then asked her the world 's population : 7 billion - and pointed out a quadrillion is one million times a quadrillion
but hernandez lawyer sultan went after other dna evidence in the case , including some collected from a spent shell casing found inside a car hernandez rented
all smiles : shayanna jenkins , fiancee of former new england patriots football player hernandez , leaves the courthouse during his murder trial on friday police found the casing in a trash bin at an enterprise rental car , stuck to some blue bubble gum
an enterprise employee said she found both items under the driver 's seat of the car and threw them away
biagiotti testified she found dna on the shell casing , but she also acknowledged she did not know the gum had been stuck to the shell before she did her test
' would you agree with me , ms. biagiotti , that there is a high likelihood that the dna contained in the saliva on a chewed blue chewing gum would be transferred to that shell casing ? ' sultan asked
' yes , i would agree with that , ' she said
she also acknowledged that it is uncommon to find a testable amount of dna on a spent cartridge casing and that the lab had never tested the chewing gum for dna
sultan also asked her if she had received a dna profile for hernandez co-defendant ernest wallace to compare it with evidence in the case
she said she had not
