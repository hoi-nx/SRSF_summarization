it also revealed that a dramatic surge by the snp looks set to claim gordon brown âs seat and rob labour of a commons majority
it suggests the scottish nationalists are on course for a landslide in may , winning as many as 56 of scottish âs 59 seats â up from just six at present
the snp surge would claim seats held by a string of household names , including gordon brown , alistair darling and former nick clegg leader nick clegg
