george coetzee of south african in action during the third round of the trophee hassan ii golf at golf du palais royal ' i 've got a bit of mental game plan going at the moment and when you make mistakes you focus on doing the mental stuff correct and it kind of takes care of itself
' the big change came yesterday on the fifth
i hit it left and was going to hack it when my caddie said there 's three par fives on the back nine , let 's take our punishment , take a drop and work from there
that kept reminding me about the back nine so it always keeps you in a good frame of mind

romain wattel waves to the crowd on the 18th hole as his caddie darren reynolds looks on ' it felt pretty good , it just sort of crept up on me , ' said mcarthur , who is making just his third european tour start of the season
' i have accepted i am not striking it as i want to but i have found something to get it in play and try and get it pin high , hole a few putts and you never know
' i played well in joburg ( finishing joint 18th ) , moved myself up a lot on the last day
i putted well so hopefully that continues on sunday
