penn is adamant that he has no reason to apologize for making a green card jibe at the expense of mexican director alejandro iã±ã¡rritu while handing him his academy awards for birdman
when the time came to reveal to the academy awards that alejandro iã±ã¡rritu had triumphed , penn asked ' who gave this son of a bitch his green card ? ' before announcing his film as the winner
the joke prompted a storm of outrage from critics who branded the comments xenophobic - but penn has today said he has ' absolutely no apologies ' and that the only reason anyone could be offended is their own ' flagrant stupidity '
he called the reaction ' flagrant stupidity ' according to penn , the jibe was part of his friendship with iã±ã¡rritu , with whom he has worked in the past - and even a way to let him know of his victory seconds before everyone else
speaking at a promo event in beverly hills for one of his own movies , penn said of the reaction to the joke : ' i 'm always surprised by flagrant stupidity
i keep having more hope
' he later added : ' i have absolutely no apologies '
' in fact , i have a big [ expletive ] you for every ... anybody who is so stupid not to have gotten the irony when you 've got a country that is so xenophobic
' if they had their way , you would n't have great filmmakers like alejandro iã±ã¡rritu working in this country
' controversial moment : penn is pictured above seconds before opening the envelope and making the jibe ' i found it hilarious
penn and i have that kind of brutal [ relationship ] where only true friendship can survive
' alejandro iã±ã¡rritu directed penn in the 2003 film 21 grams and the two remain close
' i make on him a lot of very tough jokes that i will not tell you , ' alejandro iã±ã¡rritu added
while alejandro iã±ã¡rritu 's casual dismissal of any perceived offense helped to temper the public response to the comment , penn has remained largely silent on the topic
penn also clarified that the order of his comments were intentional
' there 's a little inside humor with he and i where i know , and wanted to know , that he would be the first person in that room to know that his film won , ' he said
winner : alejandro iã±ã¡rritu directed birdman , starring michael keaton , above
