mckay , 35 , had been living with bidgood for around six months in sheppey , kent , when he savagely attacked his friend while chopping ingredients for their dinner
both men had been drinking vodka and mckay was also taking sedatives when he struck his friend of four years with the meat cleaver , causing injuries to his head and neck and leaving him ' lucky to be alive '
maidstone crown court ( pictured ) heard mckay had been living with bidgood for around six months in sheppey , kent , when he attacked his friend while chopping ingredients for their dinner mr bidgood , who was watching television when the attack took place on september 18 last year , managed to run from the flat covered in blood
but he was pursued by mckay , who held him up against a fence and shouted : ' what 's my name ? ' before punching him in the head
mckay also threatened witnesses who tried to help the victim
the men had previously downed several vodka red bulls each and mckay was also taking sedative tablets
maidstone crown court heard mckay emerged from the kitchen ' growling ' before attacking mr bidgood
mullins , prosecuting , said : ' he went up to mr bidgood and started hitting him around the neck and head
' mr bidgood saw blood on his hands
he felt it dripping down from his face
' ' he tried to push him away
he said : " we are mates
we are both on the same side "
mr mckay did n't stop
' mckay had been preparing a spaghetti bolognese for their dinner when he turned on his flatmate ' the victim could not remember anything else until he woke up in hospital with cuts to his neck , behind his left ear and above his left eye , which needed stitches
' mr mullins told the jury the ' very nasty attack ' could have had much more serious consequences
mckay claimed he was intoxicated due to the consumption of the tablets and alcohol which led to a state of ' automatism '
but mr mullins said : ' the prosecution say it was a voluntary act on his part
' this is not a case of someone who suddenly lost their inhibitions and did n't know what he was doing
' when he stabbed him he intended to cause him grievous bodily harm
someone who stabs someone multiple times with a meat cleaver intends to do someone really serious harm
' giving evidence mr bidgood told the court he got on well with mckay , there were no issues between the pair and they would often enjoy watching television and playing video games together
he said : ' even on medication , he was always happy
' we were together all day
we went to the shop to get some drink and some mince for spaghetti bolognese
' i do n't remember how much we had to drink before we went
i think i had a couple of vodkas and red bull
when we got back i went onto my tablet and played a game
' he did the same
we had a chat and a laugh
i do n't know how much we had to drink
i would say a fair bit
i am not really a drinker
' he was in the kitchen preparing dinner
i could hear him cutting up onion
he was popping in and out and chatting
there was nothing to indicate all was not well with his mind
' i remember him coming in and saying " it 's all your fault "
' i tried to calm him down and told him we are mates
he was holding a meat cleaver
' i got up and said : " what 's going on "
i just do n't remember much
i do n't remember being attacked , but i know i was
' all i know is i wanted to get out of the flat
i do n't remember going downstairs
i know i felt it
i do n't remember him hitting me
i just came round at the hospital
' mr bidford needed three stitches by his adam 's apple , seven on the side of his head and butterfly stitches on his eye
' they have all healed up , ' he added
' there is a little scar
' mckay denied causing grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury at maidstone crown court and will be sentenced on april 27
detective constable mark silk from kent police said : ' there is no doubt a substantial amount of alcohol , combined with a number of sedative pills proved to be a potent cocktail and played a part in mckay 's state of mind that night
' however , that should in no way be used as an excuse
he was fully conscious and had in his possession a lethal weapon and using it meant he fully intended to cause harm
' it must have been a terrifying shock and ordeal to have seen someone change in that way and see them attacking you
' in fact , the victim was incredibly lucky the attack was not fatal
' i am pleased the jury were able to see the seriousness of the offence and convict him on the comprehensive evidence put before them
