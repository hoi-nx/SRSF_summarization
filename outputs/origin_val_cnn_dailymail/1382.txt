do nât keep your passport , credit cards and other valuables in the same place ; use the inside compartments in bags where possible
carry your bag across your body rather than on your shoulder
do nât be distracted around tourist attractions and cash points

by the time you 've got rid of her you 'll notice your pockets have been pilfered by her accomplice
