button firmly believes he made the right call in re-signing for mclaren despite the woes currently being endured by the team
button and team - mate kevin magnussen - standing in for the absent fernando alonso - will start sunday 's australian grand prix from the back row of the grid in 17th and 18th positions respectively
whilst not mclaren 's lowest grid slots , in terms of performance and how far they are off the pace compared with the leading cars , it is the team 's worst qualifying performance in their 49 - year history
button is pictured with his model wife jessica ahead of saturday 's qualifying session the briton endured a miserable day at the office and was eliminated from qualifying in q1 button was the best part of six seconds slower than reigning champion lewis hamilton , who went on to clinch the 39th pole position of his formula one career
button , who signed a new two - year deal with mclaren in december after he was kept waiting months on a decision as to whether he would be retained , has every faith mclaren and new power - unit supplier honda will get it right
the 35 - year - old , however , has warned it will take time as he said : ' when i re-signed i was thinking long term
we 're all thinking long term
' it 's unfair for us to sit here now and be harsh on anyone because this is a massive learning curve for us
' this could be something great in the future , and that 's what we need in the sport , someone to challenge mercedes out front , and i really do think this is the team that can do that
button insists mclaren have the tools to challenge lewis hamilton 's mercedes in the future button and team - mate kevin magnussen will start from the final row of the grid in melbourne tomorrow ' i know we 're a long way off right now , but it was always going to be very difficult
' it 's tough times and it 's going to be for many weeks , but that is what is going to make us stronger in the future and hopefully build us into a winning team
' just do n't expect us to gain two seconds at the next race , and then another two seconds
it 's not going to be like that , but you will see progress
' racing director boullier has confirmed mclaren and honda know where the issues lie , and are working as fast as possible to rectify them
' actually we have fewer issues this weekend than we had in testing , which is the good news , we have made some progress , ' said boullier
' yes , there is a fix in place and we are working on a recovery plan , but as to time we do n't know
' we just want to do our best to recover as quickly as possible
' button signed a two - year deal with mclaren which takes him through until the end of next season lewis hamilton will start the australian grand prix from pole ahead of nico rosberg and felipe massa ( right )
