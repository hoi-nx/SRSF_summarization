as labour leader ed miliband has railed against the owners of large homes and vowed they must pay more through his controversial ' mansion tax '
but now it has emerged that he is the only party leader who would be liable to pay the levy on their property
the labour leader 's house in north london is said to be worth more than the Â£ 2million threshold he has set for the tax , while cameron , clegg and nigel farage all live in cheaper properties
by contrast mr cameron 's house in london home would narrowly escape the mansion tax , being valued at Â£ 1.971million
mr clegg , who lives in putney in south west london , would also escape with his home valued at Â£ 1.89million
ukip leader mr nigel farage is said to have a house in kent worth a more modest Â£ 550,000
lawrence hall of zoopla said : ' soulless second kitchen or not , ed miliband 's home is in a desirable part of london and is now worth a lot more than he paid for it before the last election
' he may , however , have to put any plans for upgrading his kitchens on hold if labour comes to power as his tax bill is likely to rise by at least Â£ 3,000 per year

shadow chancellor ed balls has promised to hike the levy for homes with over Â£ 10million , to ensure they make a â significantly bigger contribution â
the Â£ 2million limit will rise in line with property prices , instead of inflation â to ensure that more modest properties are not brought into the scope of the tax â
labour has joined the lib dems in promising an extra charge on expensive properties , to target rich homeowners â especially wealthy foreigners who buy up properties in london
there will also be protection for people who do not have large savings or higher earnings , but who live in an expensive home
the lib dems used to argue in favour of a 1 per cent charge on the value of any home worth more than Â£ 2million , but there are concerns it would be difficult to implement .
