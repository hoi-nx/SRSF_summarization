he 's better known for his fancy footwork on the pitch but liverpool and england striker daniel took time out of scoring goals to get some kitchen action
the 25 - year - old birmingham lad was taken through his culinary paces by his mother grace , who taught him how to make her favourite dish ahead of mother 's day
and like her reds son , mum grace is a fan of healthy eating and requested the kop ace to create a high protein meal of spicy grilled chicken with seasoned quinoa and vegetables
daniel and kisses his mother grace after he successfully cooks spicy chicken with quinoa and vegetables as part of his mother 's day challenge the 25 - year - old birmingham lad in action on the pitch , competing with alex baptise of blackburn rovers during the fa cup quarter final match on sunday 8 march the duo joined forces in the kitchen as part of a sainsbury 's active kids event at a school in st paul 's rc junior school , liverpool
daniel , who cooks his own meals every day , told femail : my mum is amazing , she has provided me with so much support and continues to do so always
' to spoil my mum i would probably cook her something healthy with a bit of spice to it , fish based maybe
' mum loves nice salads and especially avocado , so would definitely include that
' for the challenge the sainsbury 's active kids ambassador had to prepare quinoa - which is a superfood favourite of the family - and marinate the chicken with grace 's home - made spicy ' sturrcrazy ' sauce , made to a secret family recipe
the pair cook together when they can although these days it 's becoming rarer
grace said to femail : ' when we can we like to cook together , but it does n't happen so often these days , as daniel lives away from home
mother and son work together and start off by seasoning the chicken with a mixture of spices as the chicken marinades the pair chop the vegetables and prepare the rest of the meal what was daniel like as a child ? daniel has always been really active , he played football in and out of school
at home he would play out whatever the weather ! because of his naturally active lifestyle , he always loved meal times and eating afro - caribbean food
as our family were all sporty and active , it was natural for us to promote healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle
does he still have the same tastes ? yes still loves it , amongst other things ! but daniel loves anything with spice to it
what is his favourite food ? i would say he has two favourite dishes , fish and chicken
the white meat is full of protein so is really good for him and he loves to be able to make both chicken and fish in to spicy dishes , which is why he loves our family 's sturr crazy sauce
if he was cooking for you , what would he cook ? probably salmon with sweet potatoes and garlic thyme chopped up and cooked in the oven
it 's quite an easy dish to make and it 's really tasty
he would probably make a side salad with rocket , tomatoes and lots of avocado , he knows i love avocado ! what does daniel mean to you ? all of the family are so proud of what daniel has achieved so far , he gave up so much as a child and we are just so happy that he is achieving his dream , as parents you could n't wish for more than that for your children ! but she still tries to get her family together at weekends
' every sunday we still try and get together as a family and have a typical afro-caribbean lunch of spicy meat , rice and peas
' we love getting together and think it 's important to spend that time together , ' she continued
famous for being a proponent of superfoods after his 2014 calf injury saw him miss 13 matches , daniel now incorporates as much nutrient - packed foods into his diet as he can
' it 's important for me to make sure that i eat a healthy balanced diet as obviously i 'm training every day , ' he said
' i do enjoy cooking and i look forward to my dinner each night
' his favourite meal to cook is ' salmon , kale , sweet potato , broccoli and quinoa ' which he covers in sturr crazy sauce
' i have it on everything , ' he said
' it adds that perfect amount of spice to a dish ; i even took some out to the world cup with me
' a typical day will see him pack away three scrambled eggs with berries for breakfast whilst lunch and dinner are heavy on protein - rich foods ' lunch and dinner could be quite similar to each other with something like quinoa , with perhaps chicken or fish [ as ] they are both great for recovery and full of protein , ' he said
' on the side i would have broccoli , spinach , lots of steamed veg
i also drink a lot of white tea and moringa tea throughout the day , ' he continued
so far so healthy , but does n't he have any guilty food secrets ? ' i 'm pretty good with my diet to be honest , i love healthy food which helps and it is something i have worked on for years
but every now and then you need something sweet , which is fine , but all in moderation , ' he said
and does he dance in the kitchen when he 's successfully cooked a meal ? ' haha i leave the dancing for on the pitch , ' he laughed
tara hewitt , head of sponsorship for sainsbury 's active kids 's said : ' it was great to see daniel and grace cooking together at the event ; they clearly have a passion for great tasting , healthy food
