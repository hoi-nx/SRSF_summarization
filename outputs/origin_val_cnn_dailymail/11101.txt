a billboard advertising a kitchen along with the words , ' your wife wants me , ' has new york college students urging the building and renovation company who posted the message to throw in the towel
infuriated students from siena college claim that the teakwood builders billboard is ' sexist ' and protested the sign last tuesday afternoon
' so it could say , ' you know you want me , ' and that could include men and women
because in today 's world , men and women are the ones in the kitchen doing the cooking - not just women , ' a protester standing in front of the billboard told news 10 10
' ' women left the kitchen decades ago , ' and ' i can buy my own kitchen , ' were also written on decorated signs
siena college student delaney rivers wrote an email that said , ' [ the billboard ] implies that men are the primary financial supporters of women and that women are materialistic and portrayed as having no other value outside of the kitchen
this is especially egregious towards students at our institution as many of us are working towards financial independence in hopes to have successful careers and equality in our relationships
' teakwood builders did their best to assure students at the school that their advertisement was just a joke that was never meant to offend anyone
protesters : students from siena college claiming the sign was ' sexist , ' protested the billboard last tuesday just a joke ? : teakwood builders claimed that the sign was a joke aimed ' at women with a sense of humor ' but these students who stood outside the sign to protest last tuesday were not laughing ' thank you for the message regarding the report on our billboard in newtonville
a vast majority of teakwood builders âs clients are women
frequently they are the decision makers about major expenditures
this billboard â and the entire â your wife wants me â campaign is good - natured , tongue in cheek fun meant to appeal to women who have a sense of humor , a sense of history and healthy self - esteem , ' said a response from the company sent to news 10
teakwood builders went as far as thanking the students for their ' excitement about their cause ' and also for ' drawing attention to the gorgeous teakwood builders kitchen ' on the billboard
some supporters of the kitchen renovation and construction company took to twitter to express their positive opinion about the sign 's humor
' cancelled my wife 's new kitchen and showed her this article
thank you , iou1 # goingfishing , ' joked byte_stryke
' anyone protesting this needs to get a life
personally i as a wife would love to have my hubby buy this , ' wrote dawn appelberg
