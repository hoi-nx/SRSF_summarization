maybe it is a formality , after all
brendan rodgers said recently no decision had been made on who would be liverpool âs next captain but is there really a decision to make ? for all that liverpool âs manager will not be rushed into anointing gerrard âs successor , jordan henderson is compiling a case that is becoming impossible to overlook
he did exactly what a liverpool skipper should do , making the difference in a game of great significance
fresh from unleashing a thunderbolt that unhinged city , jordan henderson delivered once again , with a goal , an assist â his 11th of the season â for daniel sturridge and 90 - minutes of relentless running in a 2 - 0 win that enhanced his side âs champions league ambitions

this may not have been as eye - catching as sunday âs tour de force but it was no less impressive
they were ruthless , efficient and energetic with excellent performers all over the pitch and in jordan henderson , brendan rodgers had someone to set the necessary example
â we were talking before the game about how well he ( jordan henderson ) is doing , â noted daniel sturridge
â he is improving in every game and he has taken the responsibility with the armband
he has taken it to the next level
â these are the types of games that gerrard , watching in the directors box , has grabbed by the scruff of the neck and he would have nodded approvingly at the way jordan henderson led liverpool in his absence
so , too , would brendan rodgers
games that come so soon after significant victories can often become tests of endurance rather than opportunities to make statements and there was a reason to believe , having expended so much energy against city , that burnley could make things difficult
liverpool started , however , with intent
quick , aggressive , energetic , they burst out of the blocks and could have had the lead within 24 seconds when move full of deft flicks and subtle touches , that brought anfield to its feet , ended with tom heaton flinging himself to thwart daniel sturridge

gerrard noted in his programme notes that â nobody has it easy â against sean dyche âs side and they were intent of making this a contest , just as they had done at the etihad stadium and stamford bridge
at one point , when martin skrtel scuffed a clearance that nearly allowed burnley to profit , brendan rodgers span on his heels and shook his head , anxious liverpool might not capitalise on that big effort three days prior to topple the champions
his anxieties , though , were soon quelled
jordan henderson had served notice of his intent in the 24th minute , when forcing a plunging save from tom heaton , but there was nothing burnley âs keeper could do when the ball fell to him on the half - hour and he rifled in a swerving half - volley into the kop net
jordan henderson might not commands big headlines but his importance to this liverpool team should not be taken for granted and this was a vital contribution , his goal releasing the tension
with 16 months left on his current deal , liverpool must surely endeavour to finalise a new contract for him
â his strike was terrific and so was the ball for the second goal , â said liverpool âs manager
â he has wonderful athleticism and is improving all the time
with him learning tactically he will become even better
it was a wonderful performance by him
â had daniel sturridge taken a glorious chance in the 42nd minute , when coutinho ushered him through , the game would have been wrapped up but , as it was , liverpool were given a reminder in injury time that they still had work to do when barnes tested mignolet with a header
burnley came out fighting at the re-start and mignolet needed to take dramatic action in the 48th minute when he surged out of his goal to head away a ball that was barnes was chasing , clattering into the forward in the process
danny ings ( centre ) presses forward for burnley but is challenged by liverpool winger raheem sterling ( right ) reds striker daniel sturridge ( right ) again battles burnley 's michael keane ( left ) with liverpool firmly in control of the game jordan henderson rises highest send a headed effort towards tom heaton in the burnley goal at anfield on wednesday night jordan henderson âs strike meant liverpool scored three premier league goals in a row from outside the penalty area for the first time since 2007
yet any hope they had of a comeback was soon extinguished
liverpool pushed forward , with lallana bobbing and weaving on the edge of the area , trying to find a way through ; jordan henderson arrived to provide support and his precise cross demanded daniel sturridge apply the finish touch
from that point on , there was never any suggestion liverpool , who have collected 30 point from the last 36 available , would falter , particularly with emre can â the hugely impressive german whom brendan rodgers labelled as being on the verge of â world - class â â helping jordan henderson set the tone
with good reason , liverpool will be looking at their fixtures in the spring and sensing an opportunity to attack but so , too , do burnley
this might have been an eighth game without winning but he is not in the mood to thrown in the towel
â liverpool were a different side to the one we ( lost to ) on boxing day , â said sean dyche
â i would have taken being in this position with 10 games to go
there are teams under more pressure than we are
