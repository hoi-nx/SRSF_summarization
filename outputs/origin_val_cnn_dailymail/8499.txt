less than an hour 's drive from one of earth 's great fresh water sources , some people in flint are searching for a drop worth drinking
since the financially struggling city broke away from the detroit water system last year , residents have been unhappy with the smell , taste and appearance of water from the city 's river as they await the completion of a pipe to lake huron
they also have raised health concerns , reporting rashes , hair loss and other problems
a general motors plant stopped using the water , saying it was rusting its parts
officials say recent state tests show the water meets federal safety guidelines , and the city will be better off free of the leviathan detroit system once the pipeline is complete by 2016
and while many detroit suburbs have long dreamed of breaking their dependence on the city 's water , further - away flint is the first to risk it â and test whether the potential savings are worth going it alone
' ' the potential to leave ( detroit ) was well - supported by a business case , and in the long - term will benefit this region as well as the city of flint , ' jerry ambrose said
while there wo n't be ' magical reductions ' in rates , he said , cost increases should be much less
flint had long chafed at the detroit water & sewerage department 's rising prices
flint officials estimated the cost of buying water from detroit this year at $ 16 million , and the overall annual cost of switching to the new karegnondi water authority would be $ 12.5 million
still , the long - discussed divorce has brought real and figurative headaches
tests released last week show the water is safe , but complaints from residents persist
they say the water looks brown or rusty , and tastes and smells of chlorine
people have protested at council meetings , held community hearings , hosted water giveaways and marched through downtown
facebook pages have been forums for complaints and concerns
last month , the county started distributing bottled water to about 1,300 preschool students and a children 's museum recently blocked access to water fountains , citing safe drinking water act violations because of high levels of a disinfectant byproduct
high bacteria levels forced boil - water advisories last year
resident palladeno , 53 , said he gets bottled water from a grocery store or spring water from his cabin further north , but uses city water for showers
' no matter what , if i go in , one time it 's going to be my eyes , or i 'll get headaches or my lungs , ' he said , adding that he 's lost hair and produces a bottle of it to illustrate
' people say , " oh , it 's paranoia
" no. ... i 'm living this

rick holtstander boiled his tap water at first , but says he rubbed his finger around the inside of the pan and picked up ' something that looked just like cigarette ash
' ' i do n't even let my dogs drink this water , ' he said as he collected four gallons at a recent water giveaway
activists have urged flint to return to detroit 's system , which has offered to reconnect the city at last year 's rates
other detroit water customers are watching how the situation unfolds
between flint and detroit sits oakland county , where county executive patterson has often spoken about mismanagement in detroit 's system
he has in the past has explored building a separate water and sewer structure , and has celebrated efforts to create a regional great lakes water authority to take over operations of detroit 's water system
before a judge mediating the negotiations imposed a gag order , patterson expressed concerns about raising enough revenue
patterson also has said he did n't see a sound business case for flint 's solo plans , and cited an analysis that losing flint - area customers would leave those remaining in detroit 's system with higher bills
flint 's troubles underscore the challenges any major water customer with similar designs could encounter , said nick schroeck , executive director of the great lakes environmental law center at wayne state university
the main obstacle is the cost , he said , and water and sewer projects are n't attractive to investors
' maybe , economically and long - term , this will make sense for flint and genesee county , but that remains to be seen , ' he said
' as a region , i think we 're better when we 're working together and sharing resources
... we 're tied together for better or worse through our natural resources
