it takes a lot to steal the show from the notoriously flamboyant eurovision entries , but this sweden sign language interpreter 's energetic moves and expressive gestures have managed to do just that
krã¥ngh has become an overnight sensation in sweden after putting on the performance of his life , interpreting pop singer carlsson 's attempt to enter eurovision
but while carlsson 's upbeat tune may have failed to impress audiences in the scandinavian country , being voted ninth out of 12 entries vying to represent at the annual competition , many are now calling for 48 - year - old krã¥ngh to take the stage for sweden in vienna this may
star : krã¥ngh has become an overnight sensation in sweden after he appeared on national television hit : krã¥ngh interpreted pop singer carlsson 's bid for eurovision glory clicks : but while carlsson 's song only came ninth out of 12 entries , it has been shared thousands of times shared : and it is all down to krã¥ngh 's exuberant interpretation - complete with hip wiggles the video of krã¥ngh 's exuberant interpretation has been shared thousands of times in sweden , and across the world
the delighted interpreter has told sweden newspapers he was ' thrilled ' with the reaction - and has been ' love - bombed ' on twitter by people who enjoyed his energetic performance , even getting the odd marriage proposal
' it Â´ s been absolutely amazing , ' he told mailonline
' i Â´ ve been love - bombed from a thousands of people
people are even proposing to marry me
this is something i could never imagine
' it 's a once in lifetime experience after being a signer for so many years
i love that sign language gets so much attention at the moment
' hilarious : krã¥ngh says he has been ' love - bombed ' on social media since the show went out interpretation : he hopes his translation enables deaf people to get the ' feel ' of the song water cooler : he wants deaf people to be able to discuss the song at work just like their hearing colleages krã¥ngh told sweden newspaper aftonbladet he ' just get funky and let go ' when he got up on stage
speaking to mailonline , he added : ' the music is a part of your entire body
' that is the charming thing with sign language it is so expressive and when you hear the music you basically freak out and loose yourself
' meanwhile , he revealed that his aim is to ensure deaf people could grasp the message the singer was trying to convey
' we get the songs a few weeks before the contest and then its up to you to analyze the song , ' he explained
' what is the message , if there is a message for that matter , what does the artist want with the song
how do you get into the rhythm and so forth
' the important thing is that people who can Â´ t hear is suppose to get the same experience as people who can
' they should be able to have an opinion about the song , just like everyone else
' future : it is not clear whether krã¥ngh is going to be the interpreter for this year 's sweden entry yet entry : sweden is going to be represented by mã¥ns zelmerlã¶w , who won the public vote top marks : however , it seems the sweden public would give ' dix points ' if krã¥ngh is the interpreter it is not yet clear whether krã¥ngh will be heading to vienna as the official sign language interpreter
sweden is going to be represented by mã¥ns zelmerlã¶w this year , and he will no doubt be hoping to take home the trophy
but it seems the sweden might be a little sad if krã¥ngh does n't make an appearance
' i know that mã¥ns will make us proud in vienna , but i would not say no if i was asked , ' he told mailonline
' perhaps we could both be on stage , ' added krã¥ngh , who also revealed his ' dream artist ' to work with would be celine dion
krã¥ngh is not the first sweden interpreter to capture the imagination of the nation
the last time sweden won eurovision three years ago with euphoria , by loreen , an interpreter managed to steal a bit of the limelight from the main act
precedent : this sign language interpretation was also a hit three years ago trophy : that year 's winner , euphoria , by loreen , came complete with an emotive interpretation
