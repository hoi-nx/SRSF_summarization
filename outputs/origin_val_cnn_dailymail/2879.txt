heavy rains can be drastic for rural farmers , damaging produce and in some cases even threatening their survival
but one west west australian farmer decided to see the lighter side of a torrent of rainwater that fell on his property on sunday
lynch , who owns a grain farm four kilometres east of merredin , readied a surfboard , skiis and camera in an opportunistic bid to go ' skurfing ' - a hybrid of surfing and water skiing - on the freshly formed lake , reports abc
lynch took a surfboard , skiis and camera down to the freshly formed lake after heavy rains on sunday the farm had received 60mm of rain , causing the creek to overflow , a highly infrequent occurrence
' i 've only seen it flow twice before in my life , in 16 years , so i thought you ca n't miss an opportunity like that , so i grabbed my surfboard an my ski and gave it a go behind the four wheeler ' he said
mr lynch said skurfing typically involves the rider being towed by a quad bike , a role he was hoping some friends would fill
but he had some trouble roping his friends in for the dangerous pursuit , and he was left to ask his neighbours to tow him on a four wheel drive
' we were probably going for a kilometre then it got a bit boggy , ' he said
mr lynch said he has been skurfing for over a decade , swooping in whenever neighbouring lakes are filled up
' baandee lake is pretty close to here , you ca n't get to the surf very often in merredin , so i started skurfing behind the boat , ' he said
' skurfing ' typically involves the surfboard rider being towed by a quad bike , but this time mr lynch used a neighbours four wheel drive the west australian grain farmer said he has been skurfing for over a decade , swooping in whenever neighbouring lakes are filled up another unorthodox water sport making a splash with rural farmers is barefoot water skiing
last month , the first ever forbes barefoot water ski tournament was held in central new south wales
forty competitors took part in the contest , some of them travelling from up to 100km away
the tournament is now poised to become an annual event .
