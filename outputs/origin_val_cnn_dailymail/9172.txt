bbc 1 drama the ark will not include the iconic scene of animals entering the ark two - by - two
it stars shameless actor david threlfall as noah it is one of the strongest biblical images learned in childhood â the animals entering ark two - by - two
but bbc 1 drama the ark , to be shown over easter , will not include the iconic scene â because writer tony jordan does nât want it to feel â like peppa pig â
tony jordan , best known for his work on eastenders , said : â what we have done with noah in the past is to change it into a children âs story
it âs like a version of peppa pig
â every time someone makes a film , they have the ramp and then the two crocodiles followed by two ducks
â the ark , which stars shameless actor david threlfall as noah , also ignores the scene where a dove carries an olive leaf to noah to let him know the flood is receding
but the changes do not please traditionalists
theologian bishop michael nazir-ali said : â the animals are an integral part of the story because it is about the whole of creation , not just human beings
' then the dove coming back with the olive leaf , that is about calmness and the return to order
â the gritty depiction of noah may also surprise traditionalists
in one scene he headbutts a thief and in another his sons talk about the impossibility of making love to their wives in such cramped conditions
tony jordan said his irreverent approach to the original material was about revealing the wider truth in the story , adding : â the characters are supposed to be human beings
â the writer said he chose not to include the scene because he does nât want it to feel â like peppa pig â ( pictured )
