a man who murdered a sheriff 's deputy years after doctors removed part of his brain will be put to death in missouri next week - but his lawyers are fighting for him to be saved
cecil clayton , from purdy , will be executed at the state prison in bonne terre at 6pm on march 17 for the november 1996 shooting of barry county sheriff 's deputy christopher castetter
but his attorneys are making a last - ditch attempt to save him by calling for a competency trial - saying a traumatic brain injury makes it impossible for him to understand his death sentence
in 1972 , 24 years before he killed the officer , cecil clayton was using a sawmill when a board splintered and a shard went into his head above his right eye , the st louis post-dispatch reported
facing death : cecil clayton is scheduled to die in missouri next week but his lawyers are calling for a competency hearing
twenty years before he murdered a cop , he had part of his brain removed , they say doctors were forced to remove 20 per cent of his frontal lobe , the area of the brain that controls decision making and emotions , the newspaper reported as it called for cecil clayton to be spared
following the accident and before the arrest , cecil clayton frequently went to mental health facilities , spending up to 15 months at a time under psychiatric care
then the evening before thanksgiving in 1996 , deputy castetter responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle parked outside cecil clayton 's girlfriend 's mother 's home
earlier that night , cecil clayton and his girlfriend had been arguing , and prosecutors said he then took a loaded gun to her mother 's house
cecil clayton walked up to the deputy 's patrol car window and shot him in the head at point - blank range
christopher castetter , a 29 - year - old married father - of - three , died in the hospital later that day
he was convicted of the murder in october 1997 and sentenced to death later that year
his attorneys argued that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial but despite their appeals , state and federal appeals courts have upheld the conviction and the death penalty
his lawyers are now seeking a competency hearing to determine whether he understands his death penalty
mental health professionals who have examined him agree that he is mentally impaired and has mental health issues , including dementia

' he is not simply incompetent legally ; he would be unable to care for himself or manage basic self - care , were he not in a structured environment that takes care of him , ' according to a doctor who examined him , the kansas city star reported
' he can shower , groom , eat , walk ; it is his comprehension , judgment , memory , limited intelligence and social deficits that plague him
' but there is no agreement on how much he understands his death penalty or his other options
' if you can prove mental retardation , you can get exempted , but mental illness alone is not an exemption to the death penalty , ' richard dieter , executive director of the death penalty information center , told the new york times
in missouri , the director of the department of corrections is the only one with the authority to order a competency hearing , and last year , he called on a doctor to examine jena clayton
dr. james reynolds of the missouri department of mental health concluded that cecil clayton is mentally ill , but could not be certain that he does n't understand his death sentence

they are calling for his execution at bonne terre ( pictured ) to be stopped but cecil clayton 's lawyers say , while he may have conversations in which he understands he is about to be executed , he will later forget that conversation ever happened
his family have also called for a fair hearing on the issue
' he is brain - damaged , and talking with him is like talking to a child , ' cecil clayton 's daughter , jena clayton , said during his clemency petition , the kansas city star reported
' i do not believe we are the kind of country that executes the disabled
