armed with a sharp sense of smell , dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers , and soon there could be sniffer elephants too
researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell , stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives
elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones
researchers have found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell , stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives
a stock image is shown the research was conducted in south africa and involved the us military
on a game reserve co-owned by hensman , three elephants passed the smell tests
sniffing at buckets , they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of tnt by raising a front leg
â they work it out very , very quickly , â he said
lee , head scientist at the us army research office , which backed the study financially , said that elephants remember their training longer than dogs
elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones
this image shows an a warning sign in an area littered with explosives last summer , researchers confirmed that south africa elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom
scientists from the university of tokyo said elephants have the largest number of genes dedicated to smell of any mammal
they have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent - twice as many as dogs and five times as many as humans
previous studies have shown that the animals have well - developed olfactory systems that include large olfactory bulbs and areas in the brain
they seem to be able to distinguish between two kenyan ethnic groups â the maasai , who spear elephants to demonstrate strength , and the kamba , who pose little threat to the animals
the ability of elephants to detect explosives was first noticed in angola - a country that many elephants had returned to after a 2002 peace deal ended a protracted war
while there was peace , the land remained sown with mine fields
some elephants seemed to intentionally avoid them , though it might not have been a scent that kept them away - they could instead have associated those areas with danger because elephants had died there in the past
researchers decided to investigate and in bela-bela , a town north of the south africa capital of pretoria , elephants named shan , mussina and chishuru were administered smelling tests
the elephants detected tnt samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets , according to ashadee kay miller , a zoology student at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg
they only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive , which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper
in an experiment conducted at a game reserve , elephants ( stock image ) sniffed at buckets some of which contained tnt
they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of tnt by raising a front leg
the creatures have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom all other buckets were filled with acetone and filter paper only
in a second set of tests , the elephants scored 100 percent , detecting tnt in 23 out of 23 buckets when â distractor odours â such as tea , bleach , soap and gasoline were placed in the other buckets , she said
however , in the real world , making an elephant walk around a mine field would not only put the animal in danger , but would be impractical too
to overcome this problem , unmanned drones could collect scent samples from mined areas and bring them to a trained elephant , which would smell them and alert handlers to any sign of explosives , mr hensman said
the elephants detected tnt samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered its odour in a line of buckets , and could be used to sniff out landmines from a distance
here , a member of thailand 's first humanitarian mine action unit uses a mine detecting dog to search for land mines another possibility would be to replicate an elephant âs sense of smell and incorporate it into electronic sensors that detect dangerous materials , building on research with dogs and rats , mr lee said
he revealed that researchers are thinking of designing a sensor based on an elephant trunk , which puffs out air to stir up an area , and then sucks in air to smell
florida international university participated in the initial research , and it was done on a â shoestring â budget with volunteers
the findings of the experiment did not surprise wittemyer , an assistant professor at colorado state university , who was not involved in the study
research last year revealed that elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom , partially because they have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent
â their world is primarily olfactory , â he professor wittemyer said
â the sensitivity is recognised as being unparalleled
â the experiment comes as elephant populations across south africa are threatened
poachers across the continent have annually killed tens of thousands of elephants for their tusks in recent years because of a surge in demand for ivory in asia , primarily china
mine - detecting rats : giant african pouched rats are being used in south africa to locate landmines and help diagnose tuberculosis thanks to their acute sense of smell
some of the creatures are trained by the charity apopo and are used to detect explosives in tanzania and mozambique , which has many unexploded mines after decades of civil war
giant south africa pouched rats are being used in south africa to locate landmines and help diagnose tuberculosis thanks to their acute sense of smell ( pictured ) bomble bees : in 2013 , a team of scientists trained bees to sniff out explosives
the idea at the time was to house them in a hand detector , which could be used to sense a chemical in airports , for example
the bees were trained by exposing them to the scent that was detected while dangling a sugary drink in front of them
the insects , which stick out their tongues to get the sweet treat , quickly learned to associate the smell of the explosive or chemical with food
a trial was run at heathrow airport
' sniffer bees ' have also been reared to detect landmines in the balkans
the bees , which french and croatian biologists say have an olfactory sense as good as dogs , will search out mines left by soldiers in the 1990s
nearly 120,000 of the unexploded devices remain in more than 9,400 carefully marked minefields .
