singh from little aston , west midlands - who earlier paid Â£ 400 to secure a vip table at the bar - left the club with mullings-fairweather and alongside ansah and nathan pringle
but as they walked into a nearby street the group saw a 31 - year - old man with his shirt ripped

addressing singh , judge simon drew qc said : ' the assault occasioning actual bodily harm took place after the violent assault and should be considered entirely separate and was a gratuitous attack
' it involved you kicking a man on the ground to the head
these courts regard that conduct as very serious
' michael wolkind , defending , said singh had not been drinking that night and said he led a ' cautious ' lifestyle
he added the 28 - year - old had dedicated his life to the boparan charitable trust , which helps sick children
after the hearing , detective constable allan jones , who led the inquiry , said : ' this was a violent attack which devastated the lives of two young men
' both needed extensive medical treatment and the 22 - year - old has suffered permanent sight loss as a result of this group 's actions
singh had previously been jailed for 21 months for hitting the car cerys edwards was in while overtaking at 70mph in a 30mph area in november 2006
the youngster , now nine - years - old , was left unable to talk and walk and still requires a ventilator just to keep her alive
speaking after the sentencing , the father of cerys 's father , gareth , 50 , from sutton coldfield said : ' i think his sentence is very lenient considering his previous conviction
toddler cerys edwards , who was left unable to talk and walk and requires a ventilator to breathe , after the car she was travelling in was hit by singh the impact of the crash was so severe that cerys , pictured before the incident , was ripped from her baby seat and her spine was fractured ' he wo n't learn anything from this and he will just do it again and again
i think it would take someone actually dying for him to stop and think
' it 's just absolutely ridiculous what he has done
he is the son of a millionaire , he could n't want for anything
i just ca n't get my head round that mentality
he 's out of control
' singh , was just 19 when he caused cerys ' life threatening injuries while speeding in his powerful range rover
the impact of the crash in sutton coldfield was so severe the 11 - month - old was ripped from her baby seat and her spine fractured
the car was bought by his wealthy parents , ranjit and baljinder boparan , who run the 2 sisters food group , the third largest food company in the uk by turnover with an annual revenue of Â£ 3.4billion
the outrage over singh 's sentence at the time sparked a campaign demanding government action
singh crashed the range rover his parents bought him when he was overtaking the cerys edwards family car at 70mph in a 30mph area more than 13,000 campaigners supported tougher sentences and a petition was also delivered to westminster by cerys 's parents in july 2009
labour 's former justice minister jack straw called the cerys edwards family himself to give them the news about what became known as ' cerys 's law '
as a result of the changes anyone convicted of causing serious injury by dangerous driving now faces up to five years in prison instead of the previous maximum of two
cerys was awarded Â£ 5 million compensation in 2012 along with a guaranteed annual payout of Â£ 450,000 for the rest of her life
at the time judge martin mckenna , sitting at birmingham county court , described it as the ' saddest and most tragic case ' he had ever come across .
