the white house excluded former president george bush from the official photo of last saturday 's march through selma to commemorate bloody sunday
the original photo is a wide shot of crowds walking on edmund pettus bridge led by barack , michelle , obamas and sasha obama , as well as georgia rep. john lewis , al sharpton , george bush and his wife , former first lady laura
however , in a move that incensed republicans , the administration 's blog post documenting the historic occasion omitted the former president , with a sharper , close up picture that showed only the obamas and the crowds behind
the nyt also ran the cropped image
' this is a stunning example of media bias , ' raged deneen borelli , director of freedomworks and a regular fox news contributor
analysts suggest it could have been a case of poor planning that saw the presidents separated here the first couple and former first couple are pictured sitting together at the ceremony one twitter user said : ' nyt creates propaganda to fit the narrative , and white house follows suit
both pretend george bush was n't at selma
' another said : ' letting him be seen would destroy the liberal narrative
' however , a public relations analyst who worked with the clinton administration , basil smikle jr , told fox news poor planning could have been to blame
he said : ' both presidents should have been close together
