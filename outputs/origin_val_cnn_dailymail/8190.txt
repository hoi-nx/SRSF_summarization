as the 21st anniversary of the slaying of a 21 - year - old florida girl approaches , detectives from the brevard county sheriff 's office are still searching for leads in the cold case
amy was stabbed to death on march 20 , 1994 , after she surprised an intruder in her parents ' home in cocoa beach
the masked man , who had a gun as well as a dagger , also stabbed her stepfather robert lehton once in the head and her mother , charlotte , ' bunny ' lehton , seven times in the neck
before she stumbled upon the masked assailant , he had forced her parents to lay on the floor and taken money and credit cards from bunny 's wallet , cbs reported
the man was behaving calmly until he saw the lights from amy 's car and began stabbing her parents
after he was stabbed , bob ran outside and the intruder followed him
police say amy was the ' catalyst ' for the 1994 killing the killer arrived at amy 's car and began stabbing her
she fled the vehicle , but only made it as far as a nearby parking lot before collapsing
amy 's parents survived their wounds , but amy did not
she had two older brothers , mark and ryan
police have never arrested any suspects in connection with the murder and do not have a concrete motive for the deadly attack
major tod goodyear was one of the investigators called to the crime scene in 1994
he said : ' i have a hard time thinking this is a random act
' the consensus tends to be that amy 's the catalyst
' there 's something there with amy that probably caused this to happen
' the unsolved cold case was featured on an episode of 48 hours that aired on saturday
during the episode , images of the weapons were aired and potential suspects were identified
based on a magazine police found at the scene , they were able to determine the suspect had a prop gun
the dagger was never found
although it seemed real during the attack , the intruder was actually armed with a prop gun ( pictured ) the dagger the intruder used to stab amy , bunny and bob was never recovered by the police ( sketch shown ) three suspects - jeffrey anderson , hugh poppell and dominic kanuika - were identified during the show
jeffrey anderson was involved in a police chase the day after amy was killed and is currently in prison
however , police could never connect him to the murder
hugh poppell had a romantic relationship with amy and police received a tip he may have been involved in the murder after he died in a hit - and - run accident in 2013
dominic kanuika became a suspect after someone reportedly overheard his high school girlfriend saying he was ' possibly involved with that homicide '
even though he had a shaky alibi and failed a polygraph , police could never get enough evidence to suggest dominic kanuika was at the house
three suspects - jeffrey anderson ( left ) , hugh poppell ( center ) and dominic kanuika ( right ) - were identified major tod goodyear ( left ) and the rest of his cold case team are still hoping to catch amy 's killer 21 years later show producers and the lehtons are hoping the episode will turn up some new leads for police
during the broadcast , staff members from the program monitored facebook , twitter and other social media outlets for tips , according to florida today
show correspondent erin moriarty said : ' it 's not only unsolved but it 's really difficult to - even to this day after speaking with all the detectives who worked on this case - determine the motive
' and that really is the reason why they have not been able to completely tie up all the strings and arrest someone
' one person 's life was taken but so many other lives along the way were destroyed
' during the broadcast , 48 hours staffers monitored facebook , twitter and other social media outlets for tips bob and bunny , who still live in cocoa beach , hope that an arrest will help bring them ' closure '
bunny said : ' our sole purpose is to give people an opportunity to give us information that will lead to the capture of the person who did this
' this is not vengeance
' he just needs to be off the streets for doing something so terrible
' the sheriff 's office worked in tandem with 48 hours on the episode
according to the department 's facebook page : ' the cbs 48 hours crew has followed the investigation for several months and has offered to help the investigation by seeking the help of the community
' anyone with information regarding the investigation should call the brevard county sheriff âs office major crimes unit at 321 - 633 - 8413 or email at majorcrimes@bcso.us .
