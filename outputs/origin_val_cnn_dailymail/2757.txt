i have told the school her blood sugar levels need checking every hour as she is just sitting down all day in isolation and not moving around , which causes her blood sugar levels to go up

' she wo nât learn much in isolation , but i have to send her to school or i will be fined
we are at a stalemate as we ca nât change the colour of the hair
' on monday there was a girl there with purple hair , but she is not in isolation - and the head of year i spoke to on the phone has bleach blond hair
