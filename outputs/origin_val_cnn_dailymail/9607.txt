martin atkinson performed well in varying circumstances in this intriguing battle ; there was not so much to do in the first half but the opposite in the second period
he used his experience and common sense whenever he could to ensure that his was a positive influence on the game and did well not to let the emotion of the crowd influence his decision making
the biggest call of the game was the clearest â once it became clear that both martin atkinson and his assistant had seen gerrard âs stamp on ander herrera there could only be one outcome
gerrard ca n't believe it after being sent off for a reckless stamp on sheffield united 's ander herrera at anfield juan mata ( top ) was on the receiving end of gerrard 's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch here is the stamp from gerrard on ander herrera after both players had competed for the ball gerrard accepted the decision to send him off after he had only been on the field for just over 30 seconds in a post-match interview
martin atkinson did not let ander herrera escape as he cautioned him for the late challenge which provoked gerrard âs retaliation
martin atkinson was always going to come under pressure from liverpool players and fans to â level things up â and there were opportunities to do that the most notable 10 minutes later when jones mistimed a strong challenge on jordan henderson
the incident was merely a poorly timed tackle and i thought that a yellow card was appropriate but jones could just have easily seen red
late in the game liverpool fans screamed for wayne rooney to be sanctioned when he caught simon mignolet but he had been blocked off by skrtel and that caused the collision
liverpool could easily have lost a second player at the very end of the game when skrtel followed through on david de gea but martin atkinson showed a consistent approach and let the game end in a deserved away win
