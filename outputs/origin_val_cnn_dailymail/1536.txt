' beneath his image , forrest 's rallying cry urging men to frighten their enemies is printed : ' keep the skeer [ scare ] on ' em ! ' forrest was the first grand wizard of the kkk soon after the anti-black group formed in tennessee in 1866
according to ward , author of the civil war account river run red , forrest was part of an off - shoot of the clan that opted for violence when they found black people would not voluntarily return to a state of slavery
' in the spring of 1867 , ' ward writes , ' forrest and his dragoons launched a campaign of midnight parades ; " ghost " masquerades ; and " whipping " and even " killing negro voters and white republicans , to scare blacks off voting and running for office

' during a speech at at south carolina 's benedict college on friday , the president also hinted at what he will speak about on edmund pettus bridge tomorrow , which is the 50th anniversary of the 1965 selma - to - montgomery march
he said the commemoration is as much about stirring young people to change as it is about honoring past legends - and about ' the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things '
' selma is not just about commemorating the past , it 's about honoring the legends who helped change this country through your actions today , in the here and now , ' obama said
' selma is about the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things because they believe they can change the country , they can shape our nation 's destiny

this was happening , ' obama said , making reference to the justice department 's damning report on blacks - targeted racial bias in the st louis suburb ' selma 's about each of us asking ourselves what we can do to make america better
and historically , it 's been young people like you who help lead that march
' he added : ' it was young people who stubbornly insisted on justice ' , noting that one of the most famous leaders of the selma march - now georgia rep. john lewis - was just 23 at the time
' [ they ] stubbornly refused to accept the world as it is that transformed not just the country but transformed the world , ' he concluded
the visit was obama 's first to south carolina as president
south dakota and utah are now the only states he has not traveled to while in office
in a radio interview broadcast earlier today , obama said improving civil rights and liberties with police is an area that ' requires collective action and mobilization ' .
