scientists at svalbard have successfully used instruments to observe the total solar eclipse - in the hope of solving one of the sun âs biggest mysteries
for some reason , the corona of the sun - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - is a lot hotter than the surface , and no one is sure why
but by observing the atmosphere of the sun around the eclipse , astronomers will be hoping to solve this mystery once and for all
using an array of instruments they studied the sun 's corona , plasma around the sun that can only be seen during a total eclipse
they hope to work out why the corona is 300 times hotter than the surface in a blog post , research student nathalia alzate from aberystwyth university , who is part of the team conducting the research , said that everything had gone as planned
â what a show ! observatory doors open , special glasses ready , cameras , all of us standing in the cold , waiting for the moment of truth , â she said
â those two minutes of eclipse time brought us all here and connected us
time to look at our data ! â a total solar eclipse is the only time that the entire atmosphere of the sun can be observed
why is the sun âs corona - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - so much hotter than its surface ? that is one of greatest solar mysteries , but astronomers will be hoping to find an answer today - by observing the total solar eclipse from the north pole
the plasma of the sun is only visible during a total eclipse , so the scientists will use this unique opportunity to try and solve the puzzling phenomena
some nasa spacecraft have a â coronograph â on board , which lets them block part of the sun and create an artificial eclipse , but the effect pales in comparison to viewing the atmosphere of the sun around the moon
at svalbard , including fellow research student joe hutton from the university , measured radiation before , during and after the eclipse
they used a high - tech particle camera developed by the cern@school programme to measure changes in radiation
cern@school also provided similar detectors at schools across the uk , to measure changes in radiation from the eclipse at varying degrees of totality
in svalbard , 100 per cent of the sun was covered by the moon , but much further south in london , only about 85 per cent was obscured
and in an amazing coincidence , the eclipse occurred over svalbard in the north pole on the same day the sun came into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years
the team at svalbard ( shown ) , led by professor shadia habbal , professor of solar physics at the university of hawaii , included scientists from aberystwyth university in wales
they joined scientists from the us , czech republic and germany as part of the ' solar wind sherpas ' in svalbard , 100 per cent of the sun was covered by the moon ( start of the eclipse shown ) , but much further south in london , only about 85 per cent was obscured the scientists measured radiation before , during ( shown ) and after the eclipse
they used a high - tech particle camera developed by the cern@school programme to measure changes in radiation shown is an image of 1999 's solar elcipse from france , with the corona visible around the edges the team of scientists worked at an old observatory on svalbard , midway between continental norway and the north pole
they travelled to this region to ensure they saw totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse
for observers in other regions , such as the uk , less than 90 per cent of the sun was covered

up to 14 specially adapted cameras were used to photograph the sun in different frequencies during the eclipse , capturing images of the plasma from the corona
in so doing , they will hope to solve the sun âs greatest mystery
the temperature of the sun is known to be around 6,000 Â° c ( 10,800 Â° f ) , but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000 Â° c ( 1,800,000 â° f ) , and even reaches 2,000,000 â° c ( 3,600,000 Â° f ) in some areas
this factor of 300 difference would be akin to the flame of a fire being 300 times colder than the air around it - but why this is occurring is unknown
one potential reason could be magnetic forces on the sun , with superheated gas creating a strong magnetic field and funnelling energy into the corona , but this has not yet been confirmed
the team of scientists worked at an old observatory on svalbard , midway between continental norway and the north pole ( shown with the red marker )
they travelled to this region to ensure they saw totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse observations took place from the kjell henriksen observatory longyearbyen in svalbard , pictured
in a coincidence , the eclipse occurred over the north pole on the same day the sun came into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years data and images taken during the eclipse will be used to try and develop a mathematical model to understand this difference in temperature
' the difference between the temperature of the sun and that of the sun âs corona is one of the great mysteries of astronomy , â said dr huw morgan , a reader at the solar system physics group at aberystwyth university , who is overseeing the team âs work from the uk
â a total eclipse gives us an unique opportunity to measure the corona of the sun is so much detail and collect data that will enable us to better understand this difference
' he also added that studying the corona could help protect satellite - based communication systems from solar storms , which can be affected by coronal mass ejections - huge eruptions of material - from the sun. the temperature of the sun 's surface ( shown ion this nasa image ) is known to be around 6,000 Â° c ( 10,800 â° f ) , but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000 â° c ( 1,800,000 Â° f ) , and even reaches 2,000,000 â° c ( 3,600,000 Â° f ) in some areas , a factor of about 300
