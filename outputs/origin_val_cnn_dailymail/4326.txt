a colorado woman accused of luring an expectant mother to a basement and cutting the baby from her belly will not be charged with murder
catherine olguin , a spokeswoman for the boulder county district attorney 's office , said prosecutors wo n't bring the charge in the baby 's death , but she declined to say why or what charges dynel lane , 34 , will face
investigators say lane lured wilkins , 26 , to her longmont home march 18 with an ad on craigslist offering baby clothes
inside , police say , lane attacked wilkins and extracted her unborn baby girl
wilkins survived the attack and was discharged from the hospital on wednesday
district attorney stan garnett is expected to release more information friday about the decision not to charge lane with murder , and the coroner 's office is expected to release the findings of an autopsy performed on the baby
the gruesome attack revived the highly - charged debate over when a fetus can legally be considered a human being
even though the baby girl died , legal experts say the situation is complicated by the fact that colorado is one of 12 states that do not have laws making the violent death of an unborn child a homicide
state legislators in 2013 voted down such a measure over fears it would interfere with abortion rights , and voters overwhelmingly agreed when they rejected a similar ballot measure in 2014
advocates say the attack shows the need for a fetal homicide law
naomi garcia , 11 , holds a sign in the direction of passing cars during a protest against dynel lane legal experts say a person can still be charged with homicide for an unborn child 's death under existing colorado law if the baby was alive outside the mother 's body and the act that led to its death also occurred there
after rejecting a fetal homicide law in 2013 , colorado legislators did pass a measure that makes it a felony to violently cause the death of a mother 's fetus
the maximum punishment under that provision is 32 years in prison
the maximum punishment for homicide in colorado is the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole
lane is expected to be formally charged on friday .
