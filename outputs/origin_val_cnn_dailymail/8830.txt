scores of protesters gathered around the courthouse in support of a mother after a judge issued an arrest order on tuesday for her after she fled with her son to prevent his circumcision and ignored a demand to appear in court
circuit judge jeffrey gillen signed the order in a seven - minute hearing , three days after finding hironimus in contempt and warning that she would face imprisonment unless she reported to court with the child
her attorney , hunker , said his client is staying with her 4 - year - old son in a shelter for domestic violence victims because the boy was ' scared to death ' of undergoing the surgery
dennis nebus of boca raton , right , sits in court on tuesday , with his lawyers may l. cain and william snihur , jr. , in a continuing legal battle with hironimus , the mother of his four - year - old son over circumcision warrant for arrest : circuit judge jeffrey gillen signed the order in a seven - minute hearing , three days after finding hironimus in contempt and warning that she would face imprisonment hironimus and the boy 's father , dennis nebus , were never married but share custody of their child
' i was hoping the mother was going to be here , ' dennis nebus ' attorney may l. cain said on tuesday
' i was , too , ' jeffrey gillen replied
the the sun sentinel reports that the the judge last week called it ' reprehensible ' for the mom to have kept the boy 's location hidden from the father since february 20
' i will allow her to avoid incarceration or get out of jail if she signs the consent to the procedure , ' jeffrey gillen said friday
in a parenting agreement filed in court , the two agreed to the boy 's circumcision , but the mother later changed her mind , leading to a long court battle
the father said he decided to pursue the circumcision in december 2013 when the boy was 3 , after noticing his son was urinating on his leg , reports the sun sentinel
the father on friday said the boy 's pediatrician had diagnosed a condition called phimosis , which prevents retraction of the foreskin and that can be cured with circumcision
circuit and appellate judges have sided with the father , but potential surgeons have backed out after refusing to get the mother 's consent or becoming the target of anti-circumcision protesters who side with her
supporters of hironiumus gather out side of the south county courthouse in delray beach , florida where the mother was to face off in court with the father of her child , dennis nebus ' she did this for one reason and one reason only : because the child is scared to death of this procedure , ' hunker told jeffrey gillen , launching into a defense that was cut off by the judge
' so mr. hunker , i take it then that the mother is not going to appear today ? ' the judge said
' correct , your honor , ' hunker replied
' ok , that 's all i needed to know , ' jeffrey gillen said
' your honor , if i may , ' the lawyer pleaded
' no , you may not , ' the judge shot back
although circumcision rates have fallen in the u.s. , a majority of boys still undergo the procedure to remove their foreskin
meantime , a movement opposing circumcision has developed , and the case has become a rallying cry for so - called ' intactivists ' who deride the surgery as barbaric
a small group of those anti-circumcision advocates gathered outside the court to demonstrate in support of hironimus , and expressed outrage over the judge 's order
' it 's just ridiculous , ' said one of the protesters , jennifer cote of pembroke pines
' she 's protecting her son
' supporters of hironiumus , anthony mollical and zeresh altork , gather outside of the south county courthouse in delray beach where hironiumus was meant to appear with her child on tuesday
