the us announced wednesday that it is sending small unarmed drones , armored humvees and other assistance to ukraine in its fight against russia - backed separatists â but for the first time the white house said arming ukraine has n't been ruled out
some lawmakers are upset that lethal weapons have n't already been included as part of $ 75 million in new aid announced wednesday
asked during a white house press briefing to confirm that the us wo n't send weapons to the former soviet nation , press secretary earnest said , ' that 's not necessarily accurate
' ' i ca n't , ' he said
' the president , i think , in his own mind , is continuing to evaluate the situation in eastern ukraine , ' earnest told reporters , ' and continuing to assess the risk that 's associated with providing additional lethal assistance to the ukraine military
' that bloodshed is something that we 're trying to avoid and de-escalate , ' earnest said
' so the president is very mindful of the potential risk that 's associated with providing additional lethal military assistance to the ukraine
' members of congress from both parties have repeatedly urged obama to provide ukraine soldiers with lethal weapons to defend themselves
fritz , spokesman for john boehner house speaker john boehner , told the associated press that the new aid ' will be completely ineffective
' ' the ukraine are begging for help , and the congress is begging the administration to provide the defensive lethal assistance we authorized in december
our allies deserve better , ' fritz said
chewing it over : obama , seen tuesday in atlanta , georgia , is said to be mulling the geopolitical pros and cons of standing up to putin by sending new defensive weapons to kiev devastation : pro-russian rebels last week inspected the rubble of a destroyed coal mine that was used as a ukraine army outpost in the senate , a bipartisan group of 13 lawmakers wrote on tuesday to mississippi thad cochran sen. thad cochran and maryland democratic sen. barbara mikulski , the top dogs on the appropriations committee , asking them to set aside funds specifically for ' defensive weapons ' earmarked for ukraine
' while these weapons would not allow ukraine to outmatch the russia military , they would enable ukraine to better defend itself and increase the costs of president putin âs aggression in ukraine , ' they wrote
' by increasing costs for president putin âs aggression , it would discourage future aggression in eastern europe that could even more directly threaten us national security interests
' another pair of senators , tennessee republican corker and new jersey democrat menendez , reached across the aisle to jointly demand that the white house green - light new weapons allocations
' now is the time for the us to provide ukraine with the means to defend itself from continued russia aggression , ' the wrote in a letter to the president
' we should not be misled by vladimir putin 's repeated efforts to exploit nominal ceasefire agreements
' putin , the president of russia , has consistently denied arming rebels in the war in eastern ukraine , which began in april after moscow annexed the mostly russia - speaking crimean peninsula
corker and menendez said in their letter that providing defensive weapons to ukraine could ' impose a greater military cost on russia ' for its aggressive movements
' after countless broken promises by the kremlin , it is clear that moscow 's aggression in ukraine can only be stopped if putin realizes that the us and europe are unequivocally committed to helping kiev impose this military cost on russia , ' they insisted
hanging on by a prayer : father alexandr matveev led his congregation in servcies held in his office on march 8 ; their russian orthodox church 's main hall was destroyed by russia shelling in 2014 appropriations needed : us senators from both sides of the political aisle want the white house to send weapons to ukraine soldiers , and they 're willing to spend taxpayer dollars to do it word of wednesday 's new aid package came in a telephone call wednesday from vice president biden to ukraine president petro poroshenko
the white house said biden also expressed concern that russia - backed separatists are violating cease - fire agreements in eastern ukraine and keeping out international monitors
earnest said the new aid includes unmanned drones to help defend ukraine forces and enhance their communication ; radios and other secure communications equipment ; radars to warn and protect against mortar and artillery fire ; and medical equipment , including military ambulances
us officials , speaking on a condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to discuss the aid on the record , said it includes small raven drones systems , which can be launched by hand
the us also will send 30 heavily armored humvees and 200 other regular humvees
it 's not clear how many drones will be sent
nuland , assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , told the senate foreign relations committee on tuesday that administration officials are discussing lethal assistance and are watching whether the agreements that led to last month 's cease - fire are implemented
nuland said that in the past few days , there have been new transfers of russia tanks , armored vehicles , heavy artillery and rocket equipment over the border to the separatists in eastern ukraine .
