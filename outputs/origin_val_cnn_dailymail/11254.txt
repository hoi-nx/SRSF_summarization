a woman who negotiated a year - long ' open marriage ' with the husband she 'd been with for 17 years and took the chance to sleep with 12 strangers has opened up about her wild year
rinaldi , 50 , had always considered herself a ' good girl ' , but ended up being so transformed by what she referred to as her ' wild oats project ' that she left her husband after the 12 months ended
rinaldi , who lives in san francisco , had previous slept with only four men including husband scott mansfield
' wild oats ' : robin wright , 50 , negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years , which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship but during her year of abandon , she bedded ten men and two women , whom she picked up online , in bars and at sex classes
she made the life - changing decision to pursue sex with other people in 2008 - and has written a book about her exploits called the wild oats project
rinaldi described her relationship with mansfield , a brewer and wine - maker , as ' stuck in a rut ' , adding that ' our once - a - week sex life was loving , but lacked spontaneity and passion '
but she decided to make the change after begging him for years to have a child with her , and finally realizing that he would n't after he got a vasectomy
struggle : wright said her husband , scott mansfield , right , was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children , driving her to want lovers instead reliving the fraught decision in her book , she wrote : ' i refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers ... if i ca nât have one , i must have the other '
under the terms of her new deal , rinaldi took out an apartment , where she lived from monday to friday and would bed her conquests
but over the weekend she would go back to mansfield , and the two would live as a married couple , without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart
initially , the two agreed not to sleep with mutual friends , get into any ' serious ' relationships or have unprotected sex - but ultimately failed to stick to them
rinaldi wrote how she started out by posting an online ad , entitled good girl seeks experience
in the post , she wrote : ' i 'm a 44 - year - old professional , educated , attractive woman in an open marriage , seeking single men age 35 - 50 to help me explore my sexuality
' account : rinaldi describes every step of the ' project ' in intimate detail in her newly - released book , the wild oats project the next day , she had 23 offers , she recounted to the new york post
her first encounter was a 40 - year - old lawyer , whom she bedded in her apartment on the second date
describing the night , she wrote : ' we stumbled to the bed , where he turned me onto my hands and knees and took me from behind
' we had intercourse twice and , after he left , i felt satiated
' she later moved on to much younger men , and described texting her husband goodnight from a las vegas hotel room moments after a 23 - year - old paramour left the room
two of her 12 encounters were with women , one of which was a threesome
describing another encounter , she writes explicitly about taking a new - found pleasure in fellatio
in the extract , quoted by the daily beast , she wrote : ' [ penises are ] beautiful â¦ i took pleasure in mastering them from up close , watching them expand and harden , tracing the ridges of their warm architecture against the roof of my mouth
' however , after the raucous year , rinaldi admitted , she could not turn back
attempts to rekindle their marriage after the year failed - and rinaldi began sleeping with one of the men from the past year , whom she refers to by a pseudonym
she wrote : ' the turning point was hearing from alden
he sent me an e-mail , out of the blue , several months after the project had come to an end
' before long , we were having sex again
being with him was exquisite
after reconnecting with alden and falling deeply in love with him , there was no going back
' irretrievable : after rinaldi 's year of uninhibited encounters , she was unable to rekindle her loving marriage with mansfield , and the two now have different partners rinaldi has now lived with ' alden ' for five years in a monogamous relationship , while mansfield has also moved on
the former couple now consider themselves at peace - and mansfield was even happy with her writing the book , detailing every aspect of their sex lives and her previously secret exploits with other men
speaking to the daily beast about how he responded to the book , she said : ' his response was , " you have to write it
if you write it well , it wo nât really be about us , it will be about lots of marriages
