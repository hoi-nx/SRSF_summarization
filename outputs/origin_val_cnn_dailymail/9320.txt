but look at quality of squad
they know we âve underperformed
there is enough quality in there to do better
â football can change so quickly
there is no magic pill for confidence , which has severely lacking
but sometimes a new voice can provide a spark
â their main aim should be turning things around
there are 12 boys out of contract , go win yourself a contract
mcdowall was a reluctant leader at rangers and was boss for 10 games , winning just three of those â be there at end of season , going around a full ibrox to cheers , rather than hurrying down tunnel being booed off

we had meeting , set a few things out , went out and trained in lovely rain
â to cap it off , the under - 20s beat ross county 6 - 1 , so we âre off to a good start ! it was a great to get back on the coaching field and i look forward to progressing
â people say they do nât look fit
if you are playing with confidence , you look a yard quicker
rangers interim chairman paul murray said in a statement that mcdowall will ' always be welcome ' at the club â off the park , things look to be going great
i âve always said it âs important to have rangers people on the board
â you do nât need someone ranger - minded as manager
but somebody who knows the league , knows players , knows scottish football was probably right choice
â in an ideal world , you would want to come in to a club in pre-season
we âve got to hit the ground running
â the supporters do nât want to boo and criticise , they want to get behind the team
this club has been kicked for too long
