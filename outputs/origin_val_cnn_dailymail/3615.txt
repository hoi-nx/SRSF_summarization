the woman , her two children and their pet dog escaped the fire , that destroyed their home , unharmed
today their charred possessions , including a cabinet and wicker basket , could be seen scattered outside the home
' the cause is possibly a hairdryer that was left on in a bedroom , ' said fire brigade watch manager paul meadows
' the woman was using the hairdryer - we think she put it down and went downstairs
' she then heard a bang and thought something had fallen
she heard another louder bang and came upstairs to discover the fire
' she had no smoke alarms so she 's been really lucky
' the bedroom is totally gutted - part of the ceiling is damaged and the floorboards , as well as the hallway
' there 's smoke damage to the rest of the house and downstairs is damaged by water we used
' next door neighbour daniel douglas , 26 , woke up around 8am yesterday with smoke coming through his window
' someone was knocking on my door telling me there was a fire so i got out straight away , ' he said
' i could just see a lot of smoke but could n't really see the flames
' it 's pretty shocking - i 'm gutted for the family
they have n't long moved in
' bangs : two loud bangs were heard moments before the blaze started , tearing through the nottingham house safe : the homeowner , her two children and the pet dog escaped - but their possessions were left charred another said : ' i was having breakfast when i heard a large explosion
at first i thought car had crashed outside but when i saw smoke pouring out of the house down the road
' it 's a freak accident really
who would have thought a hairdryer could cause that ? ' the family has now been forced to seek alternative accommodation while their home is accessed
remains : the burnt items could be seen in the street the next day , along with the blackened window
