i do n't know how it happened , but suddenly my daughter valentina is about to turn 18
i wanted to spend some time together - just the two of us - before she flies the nest
we 've always lived in london , but valentina has a keen interest in the animal world and longed to know more about the mysterious orca whale
we decided we would see these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat
skimming the internet , i found a site called sea kayak adventures , offering a five - day sea kayaking trip in the middle of august in northern british colombia , canada
fins could n't be better for julietta in her kayak in the johnstone strait in canada we would kayak to base camp on the johnstone strait and from there take daily excursions , paddling among the pods of orcas that come back year after year during the months of july and august
the website said there would be a 97 per cent chance of seeing an orca during these two months
the weekend before our departure , a kit list arrived by email
it was also clear from our itinerary that we would be without any showers , hot water , electrical power or wi - fi during our time in the wilderness
we were told to bring fast - drying synthetic clothes and whittle our possessions down to the essentials
valentina insisted on bringing her camera equipment , which turned out to be a wise choice
we flew to vancouver , took a small aircraft to port hardy , and then drove to telegraph cove
even the experience of preparing for the expedition was exciting
valentina , who normally expresses all the usual teenage behaviour and reactions , could not have been a more delightful and relaxed travel companion
we laughed out loud when we were given our two tiny watertight kitbags , which would contain our only belongings for the next five days and which we would carry in our kayak
when they ' breach ' , they jump fully out of the water ; a ' spy hop ' involves them having a quick look around to see what 's going on ; and at night they ' fin slap ' , which sounds like a gun going off our group also included a couple , a single man , joe , and two excellent guides , julia and qui
we set off from telegraph cove after a briefing on safety , security and weather conditions
on that first day , we kayaked down the strait to a beautiful stony beach where we ate lunch - salad , eggs , ham , cheese and fruit - prepared by julia and qui
afterwards , as we headed back towards camp , we found ourselves right in the path of a pod
they were moving quickly towards us , occasionally with their fins above the water and ' blowing ' through their noses
watching these animals glide majestically through the water was breathtaking
the guide had asked us to ' raft ' our kayaks together so that we could make a larger body in the water above them
they submerged about 300ft in front of us , and i hardly dared breathe as they swam beneath us
i could have reached out and touched them
from that moment on we realised that humans really do not belong in a place like the johnstone strait
the animal kingdom was around us at all times : sea lions , humpback whales , bald eagles , jellyfish , dolphins , porpoises
kayakers raft their vessels together as a killer whale approaches in the johnstone strait this was their world , not ours
our base camp was beautiful , our tent pitched just a few yards from the beach
our bathroom , meanwhile , was a makeshift wooden cubicle some distance away in the woods
we quickly fell asleep on our first night , but i awoke with a start to what sounded like a bear cracking through the undergrowth
a few minutes later i realised it was squirrels high up in the trees above throwing nuts and cones down on to our tent
julia and qui laughed at me , and assured me that bears and cougars are a very rare sight in telegraph cover
valentina and i spent five extraordinary days in the johnstone strait
the water was calm and the sun shone brightly
we tracked pods every day
at times they would come and scratch their backs just yards from the beach at our base camp
in the morning the whales would gun down the johnstone strait as if they were on the school run , then at dusk they would drift back slowly , as if they were heading home at the end of a busy day
we soon learned something of their habits
when they ' breach ' , they jump fully out of the water ; a ' spy hop ' involves them having a quick look around to see what 's going on ; and at night they ' fin slap ' , which sounds like a gun going off
julietta and her group at the water 's edge at telegraph cove near port hardy our guides told us not to be frightened as no one has ever been hurt , let alone killed , by a whale in the johnstone strait
julia had a microphone that goes underwater and when the whales were close we could listen to them communicating with each other as any family would do
it was a deeply emotional experience to hear them conversing , especially knowing the terrible isolation they experience in confinement and captivity
the local whale - watching boats know the pods well
each pod has a name and can be distinguished by the sound of their communication under the water - each family makes different sounds
every day was more beautiful than the last
we became calm and relaxed among the whales , waiting for them to reappear , then easing back in our kayaks to take photographs
we grew accustomed to the quiet , and it was a relief to be far away from home , with no access to emails or phones
on our final night after dinner we added to the collected sculpture of pebbles left by previous kayakers - stones rendered heart - shaped by the lap of the waves
i asked valentina if she had ever been in a situation where there was no wi-fi , no connectivity , and no communication with her friends - a time when she was simply a human being in the stillness of our planet
she said that while she missed talking to her friends and sharing her experiences , she actually found it deeply relaxing not to have to listen to the constant chatter
on the final night i was desperate for a shower
without one , i opted for the next best thing - a dip in the freezing sea
it crossed my mind that i was swimming in mother nature 's pool
julietta and valentina came face to face with a black bear during their trip the next morning i walked alone down to the creek to take in the unbelievable beauty of our surroundings one last time
that 's when i spotted a big black bear right in front of me , grunting through his huge nostrils
as soon as he saw me he started to lollop away into the undergrowth
i stood still , then shouted to valentina that she should come outside with her camera
the bear hung around just long enough for her to take an out - offocus photograph
an adventure like this was made much more special for me because i shared it with my daughter
travelling can be stressful , but we were almost always in good spirits , and in harmony with one another
we have memories that will never leave us
to have an experience like that with my daughter who will soon embark on adult life was something i shall treasure for ever
i know she enjoyed every second of it too
