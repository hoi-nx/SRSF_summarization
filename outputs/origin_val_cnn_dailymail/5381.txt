self - styled revolutionary brand believes british 's ' corrupt ' society is to blame for turning jihadi john into a terrorist executioner
in an extraordinary ten - minute rant on youtube , the outspoken millionaire comedian young muslims in the british are so disenfranchised they â turn to mad jihadism â
the millionaire comedian - turned - anarchist spoke out in a video blog he called : ' could i have been jihadi john ? ' he said : â the kernel of truth in the sprawling , bewildering , bramble of isis madness is society is n't working , the system is n't working , it âs totally corrupt
â and he went on to muse : â the developing news narrative in most of its permutations does n't address the core problems
' if muslims have been here in significant numbers since the fifties , why is this only happening now ? â and he heaped blame on society at large for failing to incorporate and understand the isis atrocities
brand explained that while society can ' incorporate ' problems like drugs , drink and homelessness , it has so far failed to understand jihadism in the same way
' the beheadings ca nât be incorporated into the main narrative of apathy , alienation , isolation , â he said
in the outburst , brand also accused the media of failing to address the ' core problem ' behind the isis atrocities brand also explained that while society can ' incorporate ' problems like drugs , drink and homelessness , it has so far failed to understand jihadism in the same way â it âs merely an extreme example of something that is commonly understood
that our cultural story at the moment makes no sense
â in the outburst he also accused the media of failing to address the ' core problem ' behind the isis atrocities
however , it is not the first time that brand has spoken out about isis
in another youtube rant in september , he argued that attitudes in british towards muslims youth are to blame for men and women leaving the british to join extremists abroad
meanwhile in december , he took aim at the australian government and prime minister tony abbot following a siege at a cafe in sydney where two people died
mohammed emwazi , left , who was revealed to be isis executioner jihadi john
brand suggested that not incorporating muslims into british society is the reason they turn to isis brand previously criticised australian media for calling the sydney siege gunman haron monis , pictured , a terrorist , saying he was simply a ' mentally ill criminal ' brand criticised the way gunman man haron monis was branded a terrorist by some media outlets , saying instead he was simply a mentally ill criminal
' this man is clearly a mentally ill criminal with a long history of mental illness and criminal behaviour and lots of evidence of instability , ' brand said in a video
the comedian also blamed the media for fitting the story into their own frame , amid worldwide fears about isis
he added : ' it 's convenient for people to enhance and increase fear around isis because currently there 's an appetite to increase security measures domestically , to engage in foreign military activity in that region of the world for economic and corporate ends
