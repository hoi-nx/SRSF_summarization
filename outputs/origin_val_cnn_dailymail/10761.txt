a woman who ate live frogs as a child had to have an 8cm - long parasite removed from her brain
yin , 29 , had been complaining of headaches for six years when she keeled over at work
she was rushed into hospital in zhaoyang county in south - western china 's yunnan province
there , doctors discovered something growing inside her brain
yin then took medications to try and control the increasing number of headaches and seizures she was experiencing - before collapsing again
her boyfriend shan tu , 30 , said : ' i was getting increasingly worried about her as her fits and seizures were getting worse - and so too were her headaches
' so when she collapsed again that was the last straw
' yin was admitted to hospital and this time surgeons agreed to operate - despite the risk
during surgery , they removed the thin , 10cm - long white parasite
a hospital spokesman said : ' the woman was found to be suffering from a parasitic infection called sparaganosis which had been growing inside her for years
' it was attacking her nervous system
' sparaganosis can be contracted by drinking contaminated water , or eating a carrier of the infection such as a frog or a snake
danger : during surgery , doctors removed the thin , 8cm - long white parasite ( pictured )
a hospital spokesman said : ' the woman was found to be suffering from a parasitic infection called sparaganosis ' harm : the parasite ( pictured ) was attacking yin 's nervous system , triggering seizures and headaches it can also be transmitted through coming into contact with an open wound from the host
it most commonly affects the brain or the eye
upon waking and being told about her condition , the patient immediately realised what had happened
' she said that when she was a child , around five - years - old , she used to catch and eat live frogs with her grandmother , which must be how she contracted the parasitic infection , ' the spokeswoman said
' she said she could remember the feeling of the frog ' jumping ' as it went down her throat
she added : ' the damage to her nervous system is quite extensive but we hope we can prevent it from being permanent as the brain has an amazing capacity to heal itself
