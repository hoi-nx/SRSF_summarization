want to take a self - portrait using your snazzy new selfie stick in front of london 's national gallery ? that 's fine
but do n't try to use it inside the museum
the national gallery has become the latest museum to ban the handy ( or irritating , depending on your point of view ) device
selfies turn museums into playgrounds for a day the british museum joins the smithsonian , new york 's museum of modern art and a host of institutions around the world banning what the new york museum calls " camera extension poles
" before you pout that the ban is going to ruin your selfie for # museumselfie day next year , know that dixon , the day 's creator , supports the ban
" i 'm all for photos in museums as that is a memory -- a personal memory -- of your visit , " dixon wrote in an email
but not selfie sticks , which she says allow you to invade other people 's personal space
" they 're just as bad imo as tripods or opening an umbrella
" there is also a risk , while lining up your shot with a selfie stuck inside a museum or gallery , of knocking other people around you or worse , the art , " dixon wrote
" selfie sticks are brilliant , do n't get me wrong , but not inside museums and galleries
outside and for other attractions they are perfect ! "
