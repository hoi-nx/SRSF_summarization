on and off for over 40 years , i have had the privilege of roaming around the west wing of the white house , usually as a member of the staff , sometimes as a journalist or visitor
for all that time , almost everything has been pretty much the same -- from the configuration of furniture in the oval to the four norman rockwell sketches hanging in the hallways
but this past weekend , making a visit , there was something that was brand new and entirely welcome : there among the stream of visitors touring the west wing were many families of every color , especially americans
you may not think that is so different , but it is
for as long as i have known , the west wing has essentially been the preserve of whites , especially white men
my wife anne and i , along with 10 - year - old grandkids gabriel barnett and gergen , were there for a superb , two - hour tour by a young man , clay , once a college intern working with me and now an aide to the president
( he also happens to be white
) like most staff members over the years , clay spoke with near reverence about his president as he pointed out many photos of barack obama on the walls
what seemed so natural to him was what was what also struck me as new : photo after photo showed people of color working and meeting their president alongside and of equal standing with whites
of course , it did n't take a visit to the white house to know that barack obama has promoted diversity
still , before seeing up close , i had not appreciated how deeply his approach has permeated day - to - day life
this white house appears to be a model of racial , ethnic and gender integration
to be sure , earlier presidents had already taken steps down this path
president bill clinton was the first to name a cabinet in which women and people of color outnumbered white males
president george w. bush surprised some when he continued that tradition
but in the west wing itself , white men continued to dominate the inner circles
president barack obama 's efforts to allocate power in new ways have sometimes raised hackles
that three of the most influential people around him are americans - american women is n't the issue , insist critics sotto voce ; rather it is whether two of them , valerie jarrett and susan rice , are the right people for their jobs
both have come under periodic barrages
but to be fair , it is n't as if there has n't been a string of white males in the past who have been even less suited for powerful white house jobs
as i left the white house this past saturday , i knew that i would continue to grind my teeth over many of president barack obama 's policies along with his leadership style
but as a white southerner inspired by the civil rights movement , i must say that i was also impressed and grateful that he has made the west wing such a welcome home for americans of every color and background
i will write my young friend clay and tell him that one day , accompanied by his grandchildren , he will return to the west wing and be proud that he served under the first president to turn diversity into a living reality at the white house
that is one of the positive legacies of this president that deserves greater recognition .
