havana , cuban photos published in cuban 's state - run press on monday show fidel castro meeting with five cuban intelligence agents who served lengthy prison sentences in the united states
fidel castro reportedly met the agents saturday at his home in havana , ending speculation over why the former cuban president had not yet seen the men , who are referred to as " the five heroes " by cuban 's government
the last of the agents returned to cuban in december following a prisoner swap that also freed u.s. state department contractor alan gross , who was jailed in cuban
the swap coincided with an announcement of a change in united states policy toward cuban
fidel castro 's wife , dalia soto del valle , is also shown , as is his nephew alejandro castro espã­n , the son of cuban president raul castro and a colonel in cuban 's interior ministry
these " anti-terrorist heroes never did any harm to the united states , " fidel castro wrote in an article published in the daily communist party newspaper granma on monday , which said he met with them for five hours
" they tried to prevent and impede terrorist acts against our people
" united states officials have said the men were part of a spy ring that monitored the anti-castro cuban exile community and military installations in florida
fidel castro on monday though said the men were not spying on united states military capabilities , stating that a now - shuttered russia spy station allowed the cuban to be aware of any impending united states attack on the island
" that center allowed us to be aware of any object that moved thousands of miles from our country , " fidel castro wrote , referring the lourdes spy base in cuban , which russia closed in 2001
the men were arrested in 1998 and charged with carrying out a slew of intelligence gathering activities
seven other agents agreed to cooperate with united states prosecutors , but five of the agents refused to switch sides
the men were lauded as heroes by the cuban government , which held large demonstrations demanding their release in front of the u.s. interests section in havana
agents rene gonzalez , 58 , and fernandez gonzalez , 51 , returned to cuban in 2014 after serving their prison sentences
the remaining three agents -- ramon labaã±ino , 49 ; ramon labaã±ino , 56 ; and ramon labaã±ino , 51 -- were transferred to cuban a part of a prisoner swap after serving 16 years in united states prisons
last month , all five were presented with the hero of the republic award , the highest honor presented by the cuban government
many cuban though wondered why the men had not yet met with fidel castro , who had championed their cause during his final years as president
in the article published on monday , fidel castro said he had not seen the men previously to allow them time with their families and to undergo extensive medical checkups .
