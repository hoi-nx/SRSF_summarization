trendsetter : natalie massenet made net-a-porter a global phenomenon when natalie massenet set up a website selling luxury fashions 15 years ago , her critics said it would never work
but that company , net-a-porter.com , proved to be a huge hit â with women saving up more than Â£ 2,000 for dresses by top designers such as valentino
now the online firm she founded from a london flat in 2000 is about to go through a mega-merger with an italian fashion group â netting the mother of two about Â£ 70million
the deal with yoox , expected to be announced this week after both sides confirmed talks yesterday , will make the business worth Â£ 1billion
it is a remarkable success story for british - based miss massenet , who is credited with changing the way women shop for high - end fashion
her website has become a global phenomenon , reaching sales of more than Â£ 500million and spawning copycat sites across the world
the daughter of a british chanel model , the 49 - year - old former fashion magazine journalist set up her online business just as the dotcom crash hit in 2000
aged just 33 and struggling to get any funding , she eventually managed to raise just over a million in start - up capital from her chelsea flat
she launched the business with her then husband arnaud while pregnant with her first child , despite warnings from sceptics who thought women would refuse to buy expensive clothes without trying them on
but the site has been a huge hit with the wealthy as well as those who simply live a long way from london âs designer shops and save for months for an item
top - end products on the site include a jw anderson leather panelled mini dress for Â£ 1,350 and a black silk satin jacket by givenchy for Â£ 2,675
miss natalie massenet , who split from her husband in 2011 after 15 years of marriage , has since expanded the company into menswear with a site called mr porter and a discount site called the outnet.com
she is due to receive the fruits of the mega-merger , which analysts say will bring a range of benefits , once the deal is finalised
she is expected to receive more than Â£ 70million on top of the Â£ 50million she made from selling the business to current owner , swiss luxury giant richemont , in 2010
that deal valued the business at Â£ 280million
the merger with yoox , which sells overstocked or unsold designer goods from previous seasons , values it at a staggering Â£ 1billion

net-a-porter is famous for its plush back and cream ribbon - wrapped delivery boxes , with designer items lovingly wrapped in crisp tissue paper
during the financial crisis women who were unable to give up their net-a-porter habit asked for their purchases to be delivered in plain wrapping , to hide their extravagance from colleagues .
