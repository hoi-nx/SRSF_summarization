do i welcome the news that next is about to overtake m&s ? sales at next grew 7.2 per cent last year , to Â£ 4 billion , while it âs predicted that clothing sales at m&s will have drooped like so many m&s gypsy skirts when figures are announced later this week
they will also be about Â£ 4 billion
i loved next , the brainchild of george davies , when it launched in 1982
it was the first brand to give us affordable luxury , with its very first campaign giving us chunky 100 per cent wool knits , soft chambray , and very british tweed
it gave us the revolutionary next in 1988 , a classy precursor to online shopping , and of course in 1998 pioneered selling fashion online , becoming the largest â etailer â in europe
a real leather weekend tote in the very first next cost Â£ 99 ; today a similar version is Â£ 72
in 1988 a wool blazer was Â£ 60 ; today a synthetic version is Â£ 34
and it flourishes , of course , by offering young women instant credit : i must point out its interest fees are ferocious â as is its hounding of late payers
to achieve these startling new figures , next has abandoned what it once did really well â classy tailored minimalism for the office â and now chases catwalk trends
but it has always thought on its flatform - shod feet , while m&s seems to lumber , and is offering quality , yes , but at prices women now habituated to cheap fashion baulk at
( remember the recent Â£ 345 all - wool winter coat ? ) after comparing the two giants â ranges here , i think it âs time belinda earl âs style director belinda earl went five days a week from her current three , do nât you ? the smart outfit for a wedding ... or for work next : foil pleated skirt ; Â£ 45 blush formal jacket , Â£ 34 this accordion pleated midi skirt is a couple of years too late , but i love it , and i love , too , the soft pink jacket
it âs very rick owens : long , lean and slim fitting
the outfit only works on the slim â pleats are never good on the wide of berth
m&s : m&s collection double breasted crãªpe drape coat , Â£ 65 ; cut - out rear panelled skater dress , Â£ 45 a trench may seem strange for a smart wedding , but it could work with a hot coloured dress poking out below
sling it over your shoulders for work
and the winner is ... next wins for being truly conventional , which is what women want for work or a formal occasion â but do beware the midi length , which can be frumpy : you will need to make sure the rest of you is sleek , with killer heels , not flats
the ' casual gypsy ' look casual gypsy : next steals the win by a whisker with an ochre crochet trim top ( left ) over m&s 's fringed kimono next : ochre crochet trim top , Â£ 28 ; flared jeans , Â£ 20 the jeans are almost identical to m&s âs , but crucially cheaper
the top will have people asking when the baby âs due , but at least shows some flesh
m&s : limited edition fringed kimono jacket , Â£ 39.50 ; flared jeans , Â£ 29.50 ; vest , Â£ 9.50 the jeans are nice and inky , but quite narrow for flares , while the gypsy top is just awful : it swamps the wearer
and the winner is ... next by a whisker
the summer dresses summer dresses : m&s 's per una lace shift dress ( right ) wins hands down over next 's sack - like printed folk dress ( left ) next : paisley print folk dress , Â£ 30 a little bit sack - like , but i can see this with a tan and gladiator sandals being worn on holiday by the young and leggy
m&s : per una lace shift dress , Â£ 75 this dress is lovely : a very current , sub-erdem print , a scalloped hem that softens the knee area , and a bit of a sleeve , which is what women told m&s âs style director belinda earl they want â plus it âs easily smart enough for a wedding
and the winner is ... m&s wins hands down : it has a sexy shape , but is forgiving , too
the suede persuasion suede persuasion : m&s win by a country mile with the autograph suede skirt ( right ) while next 's effort ( left ) completely missed the boat on the trend next : suedette tassel jacket , Â£ 55 dark denim flared jeans , Â£ 20 next completely missed the boat on this trend : all they have in suede is this jacket with tassels , just Â£ 55 as it âs faux
m&s : autograph suede skirt , Â£ 199 ; autograph knitted jumper , Â£ 35 when alexa chung was photographed in this very now autograph suede skirt last week , the m&s website started smoking , even though it wo nât hit stores until april 10
suede and leather always do well for m&s and this will shoot off the rails : it âs not mumsy , and feels luxurious
younger women will opt for the shorter , Â£ 75 version at topshop
and the winner is ... m&s , by a country mile : real skin at next would be prohibitively expensive , so in a way it âs great they do nât even try
the funkiest of the accessories funky accessories : next takes the win by a nose with accessories including a fringe rucksack and flatforms ( left ) over m&s 's faux leather cross body bag and sling backs ( right ) next : denim flatforms , Â£ 35 ; suede fringed rucksack , Â£ 62 ( flared jeans , Â£ 28 ; blush utility jacket , Â£ 55 ) much funkier than m&s , next has done lots of small , neat saddle bags , too , which were all over the catwalk
m&s : limited edition faux leather cross body bag , Â£ 35 ; autograph sling backs , Â£ 45 ( m&s white jeans , Â£ 39.50 , autograph knitted jumper , Â£ 35 ) a huge improvement on last summer
the cross body bag is a good size , and faux is infinitely better than cheap nasty leather
the sling backs are very kate middleton
and the winner is ... next by a nose .
