just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as ' truly frightening ' piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of game of thrones just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as ' truly frightening ' , as its revealed they could expose australian internet users to unlimited damages payout to hollywood studios
under the new copyright notice scheme industry code , anyone with an internet connection could potentially face legal threats from hollywood studios for illegally downloading movies , tv shows , and music
consumer group choice labelled the plan , which was compiled by australian 's largest internet service providers ( isp 's ) at the request of the federal government , as ' medieval ' and said it ' reads like a horror movie script '
the scheme could come into affect as soon as september this year
under the proposed code , a three - strikes system would be introduced for illegal downloads
customers suspected of illegally downloading content will be sent a series of notices from their isp 's - a warning , an ' education ' notice , and a final notice
' the code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action
often consumers share with flatmates , partners , or family , which means that even those who do n't download illegally could be taken to court , ' ms turner told daily mail australia
foxtel has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups 55 % of australian who downloaded content illegally , including breaking bad spin - off better call saul ( above ) said it was because of a lack of access the communications alliance , the industry body backing the proposed code , released a statement last week emphasising the ' public education ' elements of the code , but noted that the scheme did provide a process of ' facilitated preliminary discovery '
in australian , piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of game of thrones
unlike in new zealand , australian has no limit to fines under the copyright act , and it is up to the judge 's discretion as to what the consumer is fined
choice has been vocal about providing consumers with a greater range of legal options to download the content they are seeking so that they do n't resort to illegal content
' we did a survey last year which found that a third of australian download illegally , and more watch the illegal content , ' said ms turner
' when we asked people the reason they downloaded , 55 % said it was because of a lack of access , and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources , ' she said
ms turner said that 55 % of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources ' consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online , but that they are blocked from accessing it
it makes very little sense to them
' the code indicates that rights holders need to be working towards initiatives which ' include continuing efforts of rights holders to ensure timely and ready availability to australian consumers of lawful content alternatives
' however , ms turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as stan available in australian , the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed
choice is calling on communications minister malcolm turnbull to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code , and have launched a campaign urging him to take responsibility for the internet policy .
