leicester star youngs said : â it was a crucial win and puts us in with a great chance of the title but we have to do the business against france here at twickenham next saturday
â we beat ourselves up a little bit and you ca nât do that in test rugby
we are disappointed we left a few tries and points out there
â to have so much of the ball , put them under so much pressure and go in at half - time losing was a real blow
we had a few words in the changing room and made sure we put things right
â scotland are a very good team but we should have been more clinical in the first half

â but the win has given us a real chance of getting our hands on the title
now we have to get up for france â an even harder match
they âll come to twickenham with nothing to lose
â i was delighted to get that try at the end
i âd had a few openings during the game but for one reason or another the try did not come
so it was something of a relief at the end there
â scotland captain greig laidlaw admitted : â we had our chance when we led at half - time
after that we did not defend so well and england began to make us pay
â it âs another disappointing defeat but the lads will try to finish the tournament with a win over ireland
