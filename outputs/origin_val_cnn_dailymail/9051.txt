host commentator that 's it from sportsmail 's live el clasico q&a
thanks for following and thank you for some brilliant questions
until next time ! pete jenson : a lot depends on who makes a move and on how much they are willing to pay
if a club bid Â£ 90million for gareth bale or Â£ 65m for cristiano ronaldo ( bearing in mind he is 30 ) , i think real madrid would consider it
ronaldo because it would make economic sense and gareth bale because it would not be unpopular with real madrid supporters
they definitely wo nât sell both ! and quite possible both will stay but it will be an interesting summer , especially if they win nothing and supporters are demanding an overhaul of the squad
pete jenson : the better players were in playing the el clasico and yet the best goal of the six that were scored came at anfield from juan mata
there were away fans in the liverpool vs manchester united game â that is something that is always missing from a el clasico
pete jenson : fair assessment , yes
cristiano ronaldo was as motivated as i âve seen him recently
perhaps a week of talk about messi being the greatest ever had contributed to that
he also helped set the tone of the first half with the at run at alves as soon as he got the ball
he took his goal well and was one of those real madrid players who did nât deserve to be on the losing side
messi had a strange night
he seemed to be staying out on marcelo âs wing because that is where there is usually plenty of space
but real madrid pressed so well he did nât see a great deal of the ball
he certainly did nât run the game as he did against manchester city
but i agree once modric and kroos had faded in the second half he began to impose himself
pete jenson : it was the 42nd el clasico he âd played some part in â no barcelona player has played in more
what he always contributed was calm
by spanish football standards barcelona vs real madrid games are usually very frenetic and yet he always seemed to have an extra second of time and a extra yard of space
he âll come back to this fixture as barcelona manager one day , you can count on it
pete jenson : the most shameful thing about it is that we have seen incidents in recent years of players collapsing on the pitch and sometimes even dying
so to feign serious injury is pretty unforgivable
i do nât mind the roll - over - ten - times merchants so much because it has a certain comic value , but the hand over the face when actually you âve just been hit in the shoulder is very tiresome
pete jenson : he was poor in the first half and it was his miss just before cristiano ronaldo equalised that made the game such a contest
he improved in the second half but i think sometimes the more frenetic and physical the game the more he tends to just get bumped around the pitch
you have to give him some credit for that double - breasted red leather blazer he was wearing after the game though
i do nât think he âs very happy for several reasons
firstly he is not really sure why scoring the winning goals in the copa del rey final and the champions league final last season does not seem to have earned him any respect from the club âs supporters â he gets whistled in at the bernabeu if he puts one pass out of place and so - called â fans â have tried to kick out at his car when he drives away from the training ground ( it happened again in the early hours of this morning )
he is also not too sure why when he was such a success as an out - and - out forward last season he is being asked to do a more defensive job this year

arsenal would give him all the job security he has missed out on at first chelsea and now real madrid
paul clement would i âm sure go with him back to his home city and arsenal â who seem terrified that if they move wenger on they will stop qualifying for the champions league â would have a coach who has won the competition three times
it all sounds perfect , i do nât know why the wheels have not already been set in motion ! pete jenson : in one sense he does nât have to adapt that much because this barcelona does not play like the old pep guardiola , barcelona
we saw that last night with their goals coming from a long ball and a set play
he has also come through the ajax school , and brendan rodgers â liverpool do nât exactly play like harry basset âs wimbledon so a fast passing game is not exactly alien to him
it âs more about striking that fine balance between being selfish when the goal is gaping , and not ignoring his pal messi when he is in a better position than him
pique has developed a reputation over the last couple of years for being more focussed on his poker hand or his online games business than his football but he has blown away those theories this season
the greatest compliment paid to him last night was that he played like carles puyol
he will always be very different from his old central defensive partner but in terms of concentration and throwing himself in front of the ball when he had too it was a real leader âs performance
pete jenson : no one stays in the job very long
they had 25 managers in the 25 years that sir alex ferguson was at old trafford and old habits die hard
it âs incredible to think that carlo ancelotti has nât been immortalised by adoring supporters after winning â la decima â but he has nât and unless they win the league or the champions league this season there will be a change
zidane will almost definitely manage real madrid one day
it could happen this summer but that will be down to him deciding if he is ready as much as anyone else putting him in charge
pete jenson : gareth bale is at his best when he is given free reign going forward
last night in the first half he was asked to play wide right in a four - man midfield as opposed to up - top in the three of a 4 - 3 - 3
he put a decent shift in but if he âs working back he ca nât also be on jordi alba âs shoulder waiting to pull away
this is why i still think from a purely football perspective he could still be tempted by a move to a club where he would be the star striker with fewer defensive responsibilities
he also faded last night because the team did â modric and kroos both ran out of juice in the second half and the team suffered
pete jenson : it âs been a long time since i can remember seeing him dive
i think the premier league cured him of that
and he is also alongside messi now , and messi very rarely dives
but he does lay it on a bit thick sometimes when he goes down i agree
look at it from his perspective though , he is up against ramos and pepe , both are clattering him at every opportunity for 90 minutes ; and pepe enjoys the dramatics too
so if a little exaggeration gets him one extra favourable decision from the referee then he sees it as fair game
pete jenson : it was tough for him at first because he could no longer be as single - minded as he was at liverpool
in the premier league he knew that when the ball came to him his responsibility was to just to take the quickest route to goal
at barcelona he âs got neymar on one side , messi on the other and he tried too hard at first to be unselfish
but barcelona need him to be selfish sometimes and last night when alves played the ball forward there was only one thing on his mind
i âm not sure he âll score as many goals as he did at liverpool in one season â but he will score more important ones
