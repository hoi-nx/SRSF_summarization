when the ireland team sheet for oâneill âs first competitive game against georgia was released an hour or so before kick - off , one name stood out : stephen quinn
this was last september and the beginning of the euro 2016 qualifying campaign
it was the start of a new , bright , vibrant era under the inspirational derry man
hull âs midfield dynamo felt like a peculiar addition
he had been around the block since his debut against the same opponents in 2013 but never started a match with points at stake
midfielder stephen quinn is in the reckoning to line up against poland on sunday this was oâneill making his point and giving a player previously overlooked a chance to make his own point , too
stephen quinn provided energy and forward thinking alongside glenn whelan and james mccarthy in a three - man midfield
being left - footed , he also brought balance to the centre of the park
he was given the ultimate compliment by the manager when he was rested for the 7 - 0 stroll at home to gibraltar in october so he would be ready to help stifle germany a few days later
when he failed to start any of the four hull games between the 1 - 1 draw in gelsenkirchen and the november date with scotland , it was no surprise stephen quinn was left on the bench at celtic park before being introduced in the second half
and while his last start in the premier league came on january 18 , circumstances may dictate that he is in the reckoning to line out against poland on sunday
jeff hendrick has been unable to join up with the squad at all through injury while darron gibson returned to everton on wednesday because of his groin complaint
stephen quinn , though , is nât feeling as if he âs a shoo - in to step back into the starting xi. â i do nât think you can ever [ think like that ] , there are lads who have been here a long time and you can never rest on your laurels
you have to come back and show the manager you âre willing and able , and are still working hard for a place , â he insisted
stephen quinn made his last start in the premier league on january 18 â no one is guaranteed a starting spot , the squad is stronger than ever with some great additions and the manager will have some headaches
â poland may be the group leaders having set the cat amongst the pigeons by beating germany , but the dubliner maintains ireland must be the ones to set the tempo and impose themselves on the visitors
â every game is a must - win game , you want to win all these games and try to get as good a lead as possible
but it does nât work like that with such a tough and strong group , â said stephen quinn
â it is a big game , we know how big it is , there âs no point in beating around the bush
but we âll go out and do our best
â we âll leave no stone unturned and do all our tactics , and then we âll go out and do our job
there âs no point in just talking about it and looking at the videos , we âve got to get on the ball and bring the game to them , â the 28 - year - old continued
â i think everyone is a little bit surprised with germany , they âve had a sluggish start and it âs a bit of a hangover from last summer
in european football at the minute , any team can beat anyone but you âve just got to be the best team on the day and hopefully that will come good for us on sunday
â scotland and germany are both highly likely to win this weekend against gibraltar and georgia respectively , so there is little room for error with ireland level on seven points with them both
â i think we can see that , it does nât take a scientist to work that out , â stephen quinn added
â but maybe it âs the team that just limits the mistakes and capitalise on their home form that will progress
