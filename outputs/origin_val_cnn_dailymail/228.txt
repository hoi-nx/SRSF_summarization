stars generate sounds on their surface in an unexpected way , according to new experimental evidence
of course , as space is a vacuum it is impossible to hear sound in space , but the discovery reveals a new way that fluids can interact to produce a sound - one with an extremely high frequency
the discovery was made by a team of scientists including dr pasley of the york plasma institute in the department of physics
a team of scientists that included york university made the discovery
they fired an ultra-intense laser on fluids in a laboratory
when they did this , the plasma in the fluid produced a sound wave
this process is thought to also be taking place in stars ( sun pictured ) they found that , when material - dust or gas from nearby - falls onto a star , it can produce an extremely high pitched sound in the plasma
dr pasley told mailonline that the phenomenon is ' more common in younger stars ' that are still accumulating material from their surroundings
it would be less common in more mature stars , like our sun. to make the finding , the team studied fluids in motion in a laboratory and found that , when plasma is hit with an ultra-intense laser , it produces some strange effects
using a method not too dissimilar to how a speed camera works , they were able to observe how the fluid moves at the point it is struck
often called the fourth state of matter , plasma is a state of matter where heat or another energy has been added to a gas
this makes many of its atoms release some , or all , of their electrons
the resultant electrically charged gas is said to be â ionised â , and when enough atoms are ionised , the gas is said to be a plasma
interestingly , plasma is thought to make up more than 99 per cent of all matter in the universe
a trillionth of a second after the laser hits , plasma was found to flow quickly from areas of high density to low density
in so doing , the plasma between the regions of different density produces pressure pulses , or a sound wave
however , with a frequency of nearly a trillion hertz , the sound wave produced is six million times higher in frequency than anything that can be heard by a mammal
it is also almost the highest frequency possible in such a material
according to the scientists , a prime location for this rare event occurring is on the surface of stars
the process is thought to be taking place on stars like the sun , pictured , where plasma is in abundance
in fact , plasma is thought to make up 99 per cent of matter in the universe â when they are accumulating new material , stars could generate sound in a very similar manner to that which we observed in the laboratory - so the stars might be singing - but , since sound can not propagate through the vacuum of space , no - one can hear them , â said dr pasley
however , he noted that it would be difficult to directly observe this effect in stars , as the sound waves do not propagate into the space around the star
â it was initially hard to determine the origin of the acoustic signals , but our model produced results that compared favourably with the wavelength shifts observed in the experiment , â added dr alex robinson , from the plasma physics group at the science and technology facilities council âs central laser facility in oxfordshire
â this showed that we had discovered a new way of generating sound from fluid flows
similar situations could occur in plasma flowing around stars
