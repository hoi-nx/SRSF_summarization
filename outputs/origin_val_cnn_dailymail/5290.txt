miliband has dismissed the media storm around the ' two kitchens ' debate by saying there is more important things in politics than their home
in an interview with the guardian , the labour leader 's wife , known professionally as miliband , said that the media storm surrounding which kitchen she and her husband , ed , used in their north london home was not what mattered in politics
' ed 's grandad died because of politics
he met people who were assassinated because of politics , ' she said
small : ed miliband 's ' functional kitchenette ' was the smaller of his two kitchens , leading to claims they were trying to appear to live modestly spacious : the prime minister was pictured in his large kitchen chopping tomatoes , while chatting to bbc deputy political editor james landale ' there is a really , really serious side to politics and there is this other side
i just do n't see the point in getting worried about it
' or you just have a sense of humour about it
at the end of the day , none of that is that important
there are really serious issues and it is down to people to make a choice about what they see as serious
' the great kitchen debate started after it emerged ed miliband , posing for a cup of tea with miliband , had plumped for the photograph in the smaller of his two kitchens
hands - on : miliband , pictured here with ed , say she is looking forward to talking to voters he insisted he preferred his ' functional kitchenette ' - complete with a hob , two ovens and a sink - while a family friend revealed it was mainly used for ' tea and quick snacks '
the bland room , painted white with a grey floor , looked cold and rather dingy compared to the kitchens at the prime minister 's two homes
at home : equipped with a hob , two ovens and a sink , the miliband 's second kitchen is said to be where they make ' tea and quick snacks ' david cameron 's kitchen at his oxfordshire home was seen as far more bright and airy , with plenty of room to prepare meals but the environmental law barrister said the shade of the kitchen was not important , while pledging to take a more vocal position than than most leaders ' wives
she said : ' i 'm looking forward to getting out and talking to voters , and to first - time voters in particular
