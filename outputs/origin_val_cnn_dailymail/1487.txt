the first leg of the champions league tie ended 1 - 1 , meaning a goalless draw would be enough to send mourinho 's side through to the next round
but luiz feels it would be foolish of his old club to invite pressure on themselves , considering the strength of the ligue 1 champions ' attacking options
' i know how mourinho ( mourinho ) will prepare for this , he will be telling the boys to be patient and hit us on the counter attack , ' luiz told the mirror
' he knows that we need to score and that they do n't , i know that is his way
we must be careful because i know that chelsea have the ability to hurt on the counter attack , but they must be careful as well
' to sit back and just defend against ibrahimovic ( ibrahimovic ) , ( edinson ) cavani and ( ezequiel ) lavezzi can also be very dangerous , so it is not just us who have to be careful
' luiz spent three years in west london before his Â£ 50m summer transfer to the french champions
