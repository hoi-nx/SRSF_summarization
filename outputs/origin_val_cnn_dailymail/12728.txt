with a little bit of help from donald trump , rory mcilroy was re-united with the golf club he famously threw into the lake at doral -- but probably wished the golf - loving tycoon had not bothered
never one to miss a media opportunity , donald trump , the owner of the blue monster course in florida , got a scuba diver to retrieve the 3 - iron club which world no. 1 rory mcilroy had thought he had seen the last of during friday 's second round at the wgc-cadillac championship
the 68 - year - old american entrepreneur presented it to rory mcilroy before his final round sunday , telling him that it was unlucky to continue playing with 13 clubs as against the usual 14 allowed under golf 's rules
" he 's never one to miss an opportunity , " rory mcilroy told the official pga tour website after his round
" not that opportunity knocked for rory mcilroy when he chose the 3 - iron to play his third shot to the 18th and final hole of the tournament and promptly found the water again
the northern irishman feigned to repeat his earlier antics , before placing it back in the bag
his mistake led to a double bogey six and left him tied for ninth at one - under - par , eight shots behind winner dustin johnson
rory mcilroy had promised to return the club to donald trump after the round and was as good as his word
" we 're thinking about auctioning it for charity or doing a trophy case for doral , putting it on a beautiful mount , " donald trump said
dustin johnson is looking set to be one of rory mcilroy 's main rivals in the first major of the season , the masters at augusta , next month and his victory completed a triumphant comeback to the pga tour
the 30 - year - old american took a six - month break from the tour last july to cope with " personal problems " and returned earlier this year
dustin johnson finished with a three - under 69 in testing conditions to leave him one ahead of long - time leader jb holmes and two clear of bubba watson , the reigning masters champion
dustin johnson celebrated on the 18th with his fiancee paulina gretzky , the daughter of ice hockey legend wayne , and their newly - born son .
