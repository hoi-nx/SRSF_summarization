armandariz said he was doing it because of her partying ways while possibly pretending to be his new girlfriend
in one of the messages armandariz sent to his ex , just hours before the boys are believe to have died , he wrote : ' i commend the spirits of these two boys to the lord
i would much rather be with them than to be out partying with friends
' this was quickly followed by another in which he wrote : ' look , i âm trying to offer you another opportunity to see our children
but as usual you would much rather be with your friends
' according to the fort worth star-telegram , prosecutors in the case argued that smith was not even aware the texts were coming from armandariz , and actually believed they were coming from the woman he was dating at the time
this seems to be backed up by the her responses to these texts , as she wrote in one : ' if i were you i âd get the hell away from him
' on the day the boys died , armandariz sent a photo to smith that appeared to show luke dead
this was followed by the final text , which also showed both boys alive and lying next to him , and read : ' we love u , goodbye
