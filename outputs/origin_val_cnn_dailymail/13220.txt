a lot of people have ventured to paraguay over the years in search of some sort of a dream
my great - great - grandfather , bourdain , was one of them
i 've looked for this mysterious ancestor before -- in uruguay , with my younger brother chris
we were disappointed when our trail ran cold
we were left with a cryptic reference to the news that bourdain had died in asuncion , paraguay
which raised the questions : " what the hell was he doing in paraguay ? " and " where is paraguay , anyway ? " roots : our journeys home it 's certainly a country few of us know much about
landlocked by its better - known neighbors , paraguay is probably best known for being a hideout for escaped nazis and for a succession of truly spectacularly lurid , out - of - a - comic - book dictatorships -- the last being the administration of gen. alfredo stroessner

when i first looked at the possibility of making a television show there , many years ago , descriptions of the country by visitors were not promising : crime , corruption , counterfeiters , failed institutions , looted banks -- in short , a backwater
i thought i 'd use the dubious quest for " the missing bourdain " as the spine of a show , a framework to investigate one of the least - known nations in the americas
my crew , looking at various storytelling structures , settled on the terrific film " the limey " as a rough template
in that film , terence stamp , playing a just - out - of - prison career criminal , voyages to los angeles in search of answers after the death of his daughter
in this week 's " parts unknown " episode , i explore paraguay ( and my family 's past ) in similar nonlinear fashion
it 's an amazing - looking show
everybody who worked on it , handcrafted it , is convinced it 's some of their best work
what i found out -- about paraguay , about my family -- surprised me
i hope it entertains you .
