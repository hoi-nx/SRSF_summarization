despite more than 600 uk jihadists having fled for syria and iraq , only 25 terror suspects are currently subject to asset - freezing orders
in total , just Â£ 61,000 in 59 bank accounts belonging to suspected terrorists has been blocked by the treasury , a report has found
the report , by the independent reviewer of terror legislation david anderson qc , showed another 28 people have had their bank accounts in the country frozen under european orders
mr anderson concluded the figures for assets frozen were ' remarkably low
he said they indicate asset - freezing has played only a ' marginal role ' in combating ' the most serious terrorist threat of the present time '
sharmeena begum was revealed as the 15 - year - old uk schoolgirl who led three others to join isis ' travel to and from such conflict zones , together with the preparation of terrorist acts , often requires funding and facilitation , ' he said
' there has been an attempt to use asset - freezing legislation to respond to the threat posed by uk residents who travel to and from syria and iraq for the purposes of terrorism
' but bearing in mind that over 600 uk have travelled out there , the small number of designations indicates that asset - freezing has played only a marginal role in combating the most serious terrorist threat of the present time
' the report will raise serious concerns as increasingly numbers of young homegrown jihadists continue to abandon their homes in favour of islamic state
it comes as the identity of a 15 - year - old london schoolgirl who led her three best friends to syria after becoming radicalised was revealed
sharmeena begum fled uk to join islamic state in december - and was the first of four gcse pupils at the same school to become jihadi brides
