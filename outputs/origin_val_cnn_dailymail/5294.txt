rolls-royce said the serenity â introduces a completely new level of individualised luxury â applied to a phantom whose base price starts at around Â£ 350,000
designers were inspired by co-founder sir henry royce âs maxim : â when it does not exist , design it
â after more than a century of cars having leather interiors , designers decided to revert to the luxury material of a bygone age â silk
a rolls-royce spokesman said : â our bespoke design team took inspiration from the opulent interiors of rolls-royces that have conveyed kings , emperors and empresses and world leaders
â added into the mix are contemporary interpretations of furniture design and japanese royal robe motifs
rolls-royce said : â serenity reintroduces the finest of textiles â silk â to create the most opulent interior of any luxury car
this unique design demonstrates the levels of craftsmanship , creativity and attention to detail only rolls-royce can offer
â giles taylor , director of design at rolls-royce said : â having revisited the history of the amazing interiors of the elite rolls-royce âs of the early 1900 â s , we felt inspired to share this heritage with our new customers in a very contemporary way
laser - cut mother of pearl petals have been hand - applied â petal by petal - onto the wooden marquetry on the rear doors the luxury britain car - maker has looked back for inspiration to the era of royal , silk - lined horse - drawn carriages which carried kings , emperors and other assorted potentates â the choice of phantom for this project was obvious , but creating the motif that would define this most opulent and modern of automotive interiors would require considerable new expertise
this added expertise came from cherica haye and michelle lusby , both textile arts graduates from the royal and plymouth university respectively , who worked on the project
michelle lusby said : â some of the most opulent silk motifs come to us from the orient , where imperial families â and rich merchants â robes were made from the finest silk materials
â this includes a highly complex handmade â twelve - layer robe â of silk worn only by female japanese courtiers
from the 17th to 19th century japanese merchants commissioned beautiful clothes â to demonstrate their wealth and good taste â she said
they demonstrated â elegant chic â focussed on subtle details : â those with style and money found ways to circumvent rules that forbade the use of certain colours , such as red , by applying them to undergarments and linings
â added into the mix are contemporary interpretations of furniture design and japanese royal robe motifs each car has ten yard - long panels of specially woven and painted silk , each of which is the product of 600 man - hours of painstaking craftsmanship cherica haye said : â the rear compartment of a phantom is the most tranquil , beautiful place to be , a place where time and the outside world simply slip past
â this tranquillity made us think of the oriental tradition where emperors would take to their private gardens to reflect in solitude under the blossom trees
the blossom motif is one that is cherished in far eastern culture and has been beautifully applied to royal robe design over the centuries
â silk for the serenity came from the town of suzhou in china , renowned for its creation of imperial embroidery
it was then sent to one of britain âs oldest mills , vanners in in essex , to be hand - woven into just 10 metres of the fabric â enough to clothe the interior of serenity â in a process that took two days or two hours per meter of fabric
some 140 silk threads per centimetre were blended into the lustrous smoke green colour which was then hand - painted and embroidered by craftsmen from britain and china
the mother of pearl petals are also hand - applied on the clock - face and instrument panel each car has ten yard - long panels of specially woven and painted silk , each of which is the product of 600 man - hours of painstaking craftsmanship
each individual petal of the crimson blossom motif is hand - painted directly onto the silk

and the bespoke exterior mother of pearl paint is â the most expensive one - off paint ever developed by rolls-royce
â it is added in a three - stage pearl effect and hand - polished for 12 hours at goodwood
even the two - colour coachline â an upmarket â go - faster stripe â â was applied in a sweep by the ultra-steady hand and squirrel - hair brush of expert mark court

some 85 per cent of all rolls-royce global sales in 2014 had some level of bespoke content â up by a third ( 31 per cent ) in the year
rolls-royce design director giles taylor said : â from renaissance times to the modern day , eminent people have surrounded themselves with rare fabrics such as silk to signify their power and position in society , whether at home or on the move
â in the early 20th century , as closed rolls-royce âs replaced luxurious carriages , these opulent fabrics began travelling with their owners in the rear compartments of the world âs finest motor cars
â only when automotive leather became more refined was it accepted by the super-rich of the day , and then becoming the norm
bamboo and smoked cherrywood are also used in the interior , along with arctic white leather and carpet in the luggage compartment
but he added : â the thought that fabrics such as silk have been discounted from use because of their delicacy only spurred us on to go further than any other car maker is capable of doing
â rolls-royce chief executive torsten mã¼ller-ãtvã¶s said : â celebrating the historical role played by silk as a symbol of ultimate elegance , the rolls-royce motor cars bespoke design team has created a magnificent one - off phantom which will set a new benchmark for luxury individualisation in the motor industry
