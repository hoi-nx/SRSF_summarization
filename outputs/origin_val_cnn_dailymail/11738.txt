thought the black and blue dress was an optical illusion ? it 's nothing compared to these mind - boggling pictures by a swedish photographer , artist , and photoshop genius
erik , 30 , who is based in berlin , germany , says he does nât capture moments , but instead captures ideas
he takes mundane scenarios , including houses , cars and streets and transforms them into optical illusions , which he describes as , ' surreal ideas realised in a realistic way with a touch of humour '
in this image called the architect the subject seems to be both inside and outside the house erik , born in gotene , swedish , who aims to challenge and perplex the viewer , uses his artistry to confuse people who look at his work
from cars seemingly driving upside - down on bridges to spaces that , at a glance , appear to be a bedroom and then suddenly look like a field , his work is challenging , clever and full of subtle detail
erik explains that he wants his work to evoke a problem - solving approach
although one photo can consist of hundreds of different images merged into one , he always wants it to look like it could have snapped by a camera
he said : ' it âs the challenge : can i put this very weird idea in a photograph and make it look like it was just captured ? ' in a series of behind - the - scenes videos he gives an insight into his painstaking method
to make landfall , a work of visual trickery that looks as though green fields - rather than water - are pouring over a cliff edge , he layered 235 separate images
he photographed the fields to provide the backdrop , then built a scale model of a house and landscape out of cardboard , which he covered in gloopy green paint and shot
he takes mundane scenarios and gives them a more interesting edge by flipping them on their head , like in landfall in brain games , a man is seen pulling aside the night sky as he would a curtain to reveal the dawn and green landscape before him using photoshop , he turned the running paint into rolling fields and superimposed a photograph of a house on to the cardboard model , adding a photo of a water wheel to complete the fantastical and dramatic shot of a dreamy , bucolic landscape that seems to be falling over a cliff
on his website he writes : ' i get inspiration from all things around me
anything from things i see in my daily life to other artist âs work and photography
i think it âs a lot about looking at the world from a different perspective
' i think i get more inspiration from paintings rather than photos
but there are tons of inspiration online
here are some websites and blogs i visit for inspiration
' he cites rene magritte , salvador dali and mc escher as artistic influences
each image can anything from a few weeks to years to create
erik says each idea starts with a sketch and if he thinks it 's good enough he will start planning how to do it
this image , entitled do n't look back , shows a woman walking down a winding road that 's crumbling behind her every step is it a bedroom or a field ? in closing out , interiors and exterior meld as one in this seemingly simple tableau in the optical illusion cover up , a man is hiding his real view with a better , more idealised image on wallpaper which he hangs on a line he said : ' once i âve come up with an idea that i think is good enough to realise i need to find the places i need to shoot to put the photo together
this can take anywhere between a few days to several months , sometimes years
' this is the most important step as it defines the look and feel of the photo , it âs my raw material
this step also includes problem solving , how to make the reflections , materials etc realistic
' he then sets about collecting or creating all the aspects he needs to bring his vision to life
' the final part is putting the photos together
this takes anything from a few days to several weeks
this is actually the easiest step , if i did a good job in the first and second step
' this part is like a puzzle , i have all the pieces , i just need to put them together
reverse opposite is mind - bendig as , with an mc escher drawing , the car seems both on and under the bridge at the same time in erik 's description of this picture , called cutting light , he describes it as ' the strongest light bulb there is
cutting through wood , concrete and stone in just moments ' this image is called dreamwalking and captures the state between dream world and reality although one photo can consist of lots of different images merged into one , he always wants it to look like it could have been captured as a whole picture
