ever thought about switching your tampons for something a little more ... sustainable ? since the menstrual cup - a reusable silicone cup that collects menstrual fluid - is rarely advertised , most women find themselves reluctant to try it
writing for healthista.com , i gave the mooncup ( or mcuk , as it is known in the u.s. ) a try - to work out what it is , how to use it , and what it actually feels like
warning : this is one graphic blog
if you are of the male persuasion , it âs best you move on , because i âm going to be talking about ( gasp ) menstruation
specifically , menstrual cups which collect menstrual fluid , unlike tampons and sanitary pads that absorb it
â i just feel better about having a mooncup in my body than i do a tampon , â one menstrual cup devotee told me
menstrual cups are nât new - they were patented in 1932 by a group of u.s. midwives
but not many women use them or even know about them - perhaps due to the fact that menstrual cups are nât widely promoted â or sold
conglomerates such as procter & gamble are unlikely to throw big money into a product that only sells once every five years , when they can sell multiple products to one woman every month
mother - of - four genny wilkinson-priest says she was initially sceptical about menstrual cups - but was surprised at how effective hers was with the global tampon market projected to top $ 2.6 billion in 2015 , according to market research firm global industry analysts , why would they put their money anywhere else ? there are many menstrual cup brands on the market - the mooncup , the mooncup , the intimina and more
i tried the Â£ 18 ( $ 27.50 ) mooncup , which like most menstrual cups comes in two sizes : one for women who have given birth before , and one for women who have nât or are under 30 years of age
this struck one friend as slightly odd : â i was 29 when i tried the mooncup , which made me rather concerned as to what the hell was going to happen to my vagina on my 30th birthday ? ' was it going to expand that much ? â when i first opened the package and saw the mooncup , i thought no freaking way am i putting that up my hoo - ha
and then i remembered i âve given birth multiple times
if i can push a 7lb baby out four times in a five year period , surely i can handle a squishy piece of latex that 's two inches in diameter when i first opened the package , i thought no freaking way am i putting that up my hoo - ha
whether or not you âve had a baby , it âs dead easy - you fold the latex cup in half , then in half again
at that point it âs only slightly bigger than a tampon and a whole lot more malleable
inserting the mooncup was a lot easier than i thought
it should sit low in the vagina , with the tip of it sitting just outside your body
this took some getting used to as a tampon is inserted higher up in the vagina toward the cervix
getting it out however , was another matter
i âve heard some women reject the menstrual cup on the grounds that it âs the new toy of vintage - shopping , tree - hugging , flat - white drinking , vegan hipster , ' says ginny
this is nât a political statement ' the mooncup has a tendency to migrate upwards - especially if you inserted it too far up to begin with
if this happens , you have to do a fair bit of rooting around to pull the darn thing out
using what is essentially a suction cup is a much more hands - on experience than using a tampon or pad
a handful of women i spoke to said they found menstrual cups uncomfortable with the edges of the cup digging into their vaginal wall
â i spent the day walking like a duck
my friends knew when i was on as i would sit in a slightly odd manner , â said one
this , however , was nât my experience
you can leave a menstrual cup in for up to eight hours - that âs handy for overnight use
when it âs time to change , you just tip the fluid into a sink and wash it out before re-inserting
many women i spoke to said this was one of the most fascinating aspects of a menstrual cup â you can actually see how much you bleed ( the mooncup is marked with measurements ! ) while some women might be put off from witnessing their period up close and personal like this , i found it connected me closer to my body
i felt as if i was more fully experiencing an aspect of my womanhood that i had in the past treated as a nuisance
for some women , it âs a matter of safeguarding their sense of what makes them a woman
' what draws most women to re-usable menstrual cups is that they are economical , eco-friendly and more comfortable as they do nât cause dryness or irritation - a common bugbear of tampon users , ' says ginny as one friend said , â after having a baby , something makes me want to protect my vagina more vigilantly , so i do nât want to put anything up there that could be potentially hazardous to my feminine health
â as a life - long user of tampons i was distrustful of the mooncup
but there was never a problem
so , does it actually work ? i was a bit fearful of leaks at first ; as a life - long user of tampons i was distrustful of the mooncup
but there was never a problem
i went swimming with it , i did dynamic yoga with it ( think splits and handstands ) , and i went to the movies with it
i am a convert , even as the mooncup took a fair bit of getting used to
i âll probably supplement the mooncup with tampons when i âm traveling , or on a night out when i know there will be no private sink to sort out your business
some women i spoke to said they bring a bottle of water into a public toilet in order to clean out their menstrual cup but this strikes me as more trouble than it âs worth
i âve heard some women reject the menstrual cup on the grounds that it âs the new toy of vintage - shopping , tree - hugging , flat - white drinking , vegan hipsters
this is nât a political statement
it âs just a feminine hygiene product
one that works , too
