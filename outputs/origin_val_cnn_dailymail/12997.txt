london archaeologists have started excavating about 3,000 skeletons from the bedlam burial ground in london , used from 1569 to at least 1738
also known as bedlam and the new churchyard , more than 20,000 londoners are believed to have been buried there
the ground was used by " a varied cross-section of society throughout the years since the burial ground was open , " elsden , project manager from mola ( museum of london archaeology ) told cnn
and they include those who could not afford a church burial or chose to perish there for religious or political reasons
the ground also contained the overflow of bodies when other cemeteries became full
bedlam , now a synonym for chaos , took its name from the hospital of st mary of bedlam in london which nursed the mentally ill. among the deceased are victims of the english civil war , the great plague of 1665 and the great fire of london in the following year
the site was found at an entrance of the city 's new crossrail station -- part of a Â£ 14.8 billion ( $ 22 billion ) project that will expand london 's railway network
a team of 60 archaeologists will work six days a week on the project , expected to finish in september this year
hundreds of skeletons found under paris supermarket elsden said the excavation reveals a great deal about how londoners lived from the 16th to the 18th century
" a large sample of the population from that period will enable us to look at the lifestyle , looking at london and what the romans were doing in the suburb area , outside the city walls
" he said the skeletons will be cleaned and closely examined by experts who will assess their remains to determine their diseases , ages and sexes
" specialists will look at the dna of the disease that killed the person rather than their own dna , " he added
roman skulls unearthed deep beneath london the findings are timely as well -- this year marks the 350th anniversary of the great plague in london
" 1665 was the very last recorded episode of plague
there were 400 years of regular plague , and suddenly it stops , " carver , crossrail 's lead archaeologist , said
" and what we want to be able to find out , from sampling the graves of that date , is why that is
and what it is about the bacteria that causes bubonic plague that suddenly changed at that point
" londoners also assisted in the research by helping to search parish records to identify people who were buried in bedlam
" and that was a huge exercise which could n't have possibly been done by our own team , " carver said
skeletons found holding hands after 700 years the result is a database of more than 5,300 names and backgrounds of those buried at bedlam , including political activists john lilburne and robert lockyer -- part of a movement known as the levellers -- as well as ambrose nicholas , the lord mayor of london in 1575
a roman road that runs underneath the site has already produced artefacts such as horseshoes and cremation urns
carver describes the bedlam dig as a personal career highlight
" [ it 's a ] great use of an engineering scheme , but at the same time addresses the historical importance of each these sites
