johnson will return to cincinnati after an injury - hit year with tampa bay
the defensive end , 28 , put pen to paper on a four - year deal , $ 20million deal
with $ 6m guaranteed this year , johnson will also receive $ 7m from his $ 43.8m deal with the buccaneers , espn report
a third round pick in 2009 , johnson spent his first five years with the bengals but joined the buccaneers on a big - money deal last year
marvin lewis made it a priority to bring johnson back to cincinnati to bolster their pass rush but his productivity was hindered by injuries , with just four sacks in 14 games
consequently , he joined josh mccown and anthony collis on general manager jason licht 's unwanted list
the move frees up $ 2m cap space
' i 'm thankful for the buccaneers giving me an opportunity to come down there and learn , ' johnson said on a conference call
' i 'm going to always cherish all of the memories - the highs and the lows
you ca n't appreciate the highs without the lows
' ' this last year was a character - building year
i do n't count it as a bad year
so i come back to cincinnati with a different mindset and a different outlook on things
' johnson was also coveted by the minnesota vikings , but chose not to be reunited with the bengals ' former defensive co-ordinator mike zimmer .
