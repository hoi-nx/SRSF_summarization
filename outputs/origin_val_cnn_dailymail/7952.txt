the lib dems are to unveil a rival budget tomorrow in an unprecedented statement to parliament which will signal the end of the coalition
alexander , the chief secretary to the treasury , will hold up a yellow budget box - mimicking the red leather case used by the chancellor - before setting out what his party 's tax and spending priorities after the election
he will promise to make tax dodging as unacceptable as drink - driving , increase the personal tax allowance to Â£ 12,500 and targeting the wealthy instead of cutting spending
alexander will hold his yellow budget box aloft tomorrow before delivering an unprecedented statement to the commons it is understood the unique statement from the despatch box had to be agreed with commons speaker john bercow , and is likely to infuriate labour for using government time to make a highly political speech
nick clegg has described the budget as the ' last act of significant decision - making by this coalition government '
chancellor george osborne is using his budget statement today to set out the official coalition government position for the last time before the election
but he has made clear that in a conservative government he would eradicate the deficit through spending cuts alone , without tax rises
this would include Â£ 12billion of cuts from the welfare budget , including a ban on under - 25s claiming housing benefit , restricting child benefit to three children and cutting the amount families can claim in handouts from Â£ 26,000 to Â£ 23,000
but all the changes to benefits have been blocked by the lib dems , and are instead expected to be included in the tory election manifesto when it is unveiled next month
on saturday mr alexander unveiled his bizarre yellow leather briefcase which he held aloft in an echo of the chancellor on the steps of number 11
it was later auctioned off to a lib dems activist for Â£ 1,500
it is expected to make another appearance tomorrow , before mr alexander gives his statement to the commons
the yellow box is designed to echo the red leather case used by george osborne before travelling to the commons to deliver his budget today mr alexander will rule out any extra increases to vat , income tax or national insurance , but demand tax rises on the wealthy
he will use official treasury figures to back up his call for the deficit to be eradicated through 70 per cent spending cuts and 30 per cent tax rises
a senior lib dems source said : we are going to set out what our spending plans will be for the next parliament
' there are big chunks that the chancellor will say today which will be very much what the tory ' plans will be
' in a speech at the lib dems conference , mr alexander set out some of the measures which would be in a lib dems budget
he promised a crackdown on tax dodgers , saying it should become as socially unacceptable as drink - driving
in the wake of the hsbc scandal he said : ' as recent weeks have shown yet again , nothing upsets law - abiding taxpayers more than people who think they can evade paying the tax they owe
' paying the tax you owe is n't an optional extra - it 's a legal requirement
quite rightly , benefit fiddling is a crime and a social taboo
for too long , tax evasion has been seen by the rich and privileged more like a sport than the crime it is
' so in our future vision , there 'll be even more measures to crack down hard on the tax dodgers
' he continued : ' i want to see those who aid , abet , facilitate or encourage tax evasion hit as hard with criminal and financial penalties as the tax evaders themselves
that will be in our manifesto too
' mr alexander joined mr george osborne and other tory treasury ministers outside number 11 this morning a lib dems budget would include the party 's flagship policy of raising the income tax personal allowance to Â£ 12,500 and would involve ' balancing the books fairly , not on the backs of the working people on low pay '
he accused the tory of wanting to ' cut for cut 's sake even after the books are balanced '
' a conservative with no heart , but two minds
one to stay in europe , the other to leave , ' he said
' a conservative that wants to balance the books solely on the backs of the most vulnerable in our society
' the prospect of a britain under a majority conservative government is grim indeed
and have n't we all groaned when they use their soulless mantra - long - term economic plan
the truth is their long - term economic plan means long - term economic pain for millions of families
