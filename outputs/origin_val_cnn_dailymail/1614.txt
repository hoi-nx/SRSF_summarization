the beckhams will also be installing underfloor heating at the home
photos submitted to the royal borough of kensington and chelsea council in october 2014 show it needs redecorating
but estate agent becky fatemi , who runs rokstone , believes when the project is finished it will be a brilliant family home
she said : ' the beckhams ' home has got very grand proportions , it is a trophy home
you do n't get that many coming up for sale as many of these homes have been turned into flats
' with planning on a home like this it is perfectly normal to take this long
' the work will probably cost around Â£ 500 - Â£ 600 per sq / ft so it will cost around Â£ 5 million to do
' when the work is done , it will be a brilliant home for a family
' there are good schools in the area , there is the park and the westfield is nearby
' i am sure when the work it is complete , it will be in good taste and they 'd look to get Â£ 4,000 per sq / ft for it
' old pad : the beckhams reportedly sold beckingham palace , pictured , for Â£ 11.5million - a tidy Â£ 9million profit this would value the property at Â£ 42 million

during the 1960s it was awarded grade ii status
in 1989 , it was returned to a single family home and renovated before being sold for Â£ 3.45 million in 1992
during the 1990 renovation , a lift was built , a full - length swimming pool was installed in the basement and the first floor was re-ordered to accommodate a billiards room
