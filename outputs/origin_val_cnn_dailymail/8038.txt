british army tanks could soon be allowed to drive at 40mph again on public roads in england and wales , it has been revealed
they had been driving at this speed since 1977 , until it was realised 18 months ago that defence chiefs had wrongly assumed they were exempt from laws restricting tracked vehicles to 20mph
the top speed was therefore halved to 20mph in october 2013 to comply with the 1984 road traffic regulation act , but the dft is now proposing to put it back to 40mph
new limit ? armoured tracked vehicles had been driving at 40mph since 1977 , until it was realised 18 months ago that defence chiefs had wrongly assumed they were exempt from road traffic laws ( file picture ) ministers are worried that the 20mph limit is causing more congestion and raising possible safety concerns , as well as preventing proper training of tank crews to operate safely on public roads
they also believe travelling at slow speeds increases the vibrations of some tanks which can harm the health of crews over long periods , as well as causing wear and tear on roads and the vehicles
the dft , which is now consulting on plans to raise the limit , added that actual operating speeds would still depend on careful risk assessments by the military and specific vehicle capabilities
tracked vehicles such as the as90 self - propelled gun and stormer missile carrier can often be seen on rural roads close to army firing ranges in wiltshire , dorset and pembrokeshire
a dft spokesman said : â the plans under consultation will help address congestion that can be created by slow - moving vehicles on faster roads
â increasing the maximum speed limit to 40mph will also reduce costs of higher fuel consumption and the time taken for training and testing when vehicles are limited to 20mph

rac foundation director professor stephen glaister said : â it seems our armed forces need more practice at , literally , rapid deployment
â with troops now out of afghanistan it makes you wonder what target military chiefs are eyeing up next ? â he added : â but tank commanders should beware
while they will theoretically be allowed to go faster , congestion might mean they never get near the limit as they are stuck in the same jams as the rest of britain 's 38 million drivers
â but at least they 'll be in the right vehicles to tackle the potholes that blight the road network
â the consultation was published last friday by transport minister robert goodwill and philip dunne , the defence equipment minister
last week london mayor boris johnson outlined eight locations in the capital where 20mph speed limits could be introduced , with more possibly following .
