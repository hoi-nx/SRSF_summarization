in a new twist in the continuing saga of missing mh370 , a towelette that was washed up on a western australia beach is now being examined to try and find out if it could have come from the disappeared plane
the small pre-moistened paper towel that was in a malaysia airlines sealed packet has been sent to canberra for testing and verification after being found by a couple walking along a beach in cervantes in july last year , nine news reported
the news comes just days after the one year anniversary of the plane 's disappearance , with 239 people on board
kingsley and vicki miller discovered the unopened packet at cervantes , 200 kilometres north of perth , and said it was â unopened , which was very unusual â
the daily telegraph reported that experts believe it 's possible for a small package such as the towelette to travel long distances without sustaining damage
however , experts believe that the package may not provide any helpful information as to the disappearance of the plane
' a 6cm x 8cm moist towelette in wrapping branded with the malaysia airlines logo was found at thirsty point on 2 july 2014
it was handed in to the western australia police , ' said a spokesperson for the australian transport safety bureau
' it is unlikely , however , that such a common item with no unique identifier could be conclusively linked with mh370 , ' reported the sydney morning herald
the plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from kuala lumpur
it was then tracked by malaysia âs military radar heading towards the indian ocean
kingsley and vicki miller discovered the unopened packet at cervantes , 200 kilometres north of perth the mh370 flight disappeared on the may 8 with 239 people on board the anniversary of the plane 's disappearance was matched by a report which revealed that the battery of an underwater locator beacon on the flight had expired more than a year before the incident
the update on the progress of the probe surrounding the malaysia airlines plane indicates those looking for the aircraft would have had less chance of finding it
apart from the anomaly of the beacon , the report devoted many of its 584 pages to describe the complete normality of the flight - shedding little light on one of aviation 's biggest mysteries
the significance of the expired battery was not immediately apparent , except indicating that searchers would have had lesser chance of locating the plane , even if they were in its vicinity
the report said : â the sole objective of the investigation is the prevention of future accidents or incidents , and not for the purpose to apportion blame or liability
â the big question : artist sudarsan pattnaik creates a sand sculpture of mh370 on puri beach in odisha , india standing together : relatives of mh370 passengers attend an event today marking the one - year anniversary of its disappearance in kuala lumpur , malaysia whilst the battery had expired on the beacon of the flight data recorder , the report said that the battery on the locator beacon of the cockpit voice recorder was working
however , in a statement on monday , malaysia airlines said that a similar beacon was also installed with the solid state cockpit voice recorder and its battery life was still good
relatives of passengers and crew marked the anniversary of the day the plane went missing , under a heavy police presence
china relatives had planned to commemorate the disappearance of the boeing 777 at a number of sites in beijing , including the malaysia embassy , the airport and the lama temple , a popular tibetan buddhist place of worship and tourist site

the remainder waited outside the temple in a group , wearing t - shirts saying â pray for mh370 â , and waving placards to photographers reading â keep searching for mh370 â
meanwhile , voice 370 - a support group for the relatives - hosted a â day of remembrance â at a shopping centre in kuala lumpur with songs , poems and prayers
grace subathirai nathan , whose mother anne daisy was on the plane , said : â it is important to highlight to the public that we still do n't have any answers and that we must pursue the search
â the malaysia prime minister said he still is hopeful the plane will be found

â together with our international partners , we have followed the little evidence that exists
malaysia remains committed to the search , and hopeful that mh370 will be found
â while the country 's government has already formally declared the disappearance of the plane as an accident , and said all those on board are presumed dead , relatives of those on the flight have said they are frustrated by the lack of answers
ministers from western australia , china and malaysia are expected to meet next month to decide on the next course of action for the wide - ranging search
china foreign minister wang said his government would provide â all needed service to every next of kin â and help uphold their â legitimate and lawful rights and interests â
most of the plane 's passengers were china
â a year has passed , the plane has not been located , but the search effort will continue , â mr wang told a news conference in beijing
â today must be a difficult day for the next of kin
our hearts are with you
â as his country said prayers on sunday for those who were on board the missing flight , malaysia 's prime minister said no words could describe their pain
' the lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear , ' said mr najib
' no words can describe the pain the families of those on board are going through
' search and rescue missions were conducted for the flight off the coast of perth the department of defence launched an underwater vehicle to locate the plane off the western australia coast china 's foreign minister , wang , said in beijing that the search for the malaysia airlines flight which vanished one year ago today will not stop

in kuala lumpur , mr najib spoke of the joint effort , adding in his official statement that ' together with our international partners , we have followed the little evidence that exists
' malaysia remains committed to the search and hopeful that mh370 will be found
' although mr abbott said he was confident the aircraft would be found as 40 per cent of 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of western australia had been scrutinised and another 60,000sq km to be covered if necessary , he added that the search had to end at some stage
' it is one of the great mysteries of the 21st century and i know that there will be a nagging doubt in the minds of billions of people until such time as we can find that plane , ' he told reporters in sydney on sunday
' it ca n't go on forever but , as long as there are reasonable leads , the search will go on
