battery life is consistently listed as a major flaw of smartphones , smartwatches and other wearables
but this problem could soon be solved thanks to technology that promises to extend battery life for ' decades
' atmel has released its latest microcontrollers ( mcu ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body
atmel has released its latest microcontrollers ( mcu ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body
atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' the ultra-low power sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32 - bit arm - based mcu range
these are all powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0 + 32 - bit processors
a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology
during a demonstration of the microcontrollers to armdevices.net at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel
this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge
mr andreas eieland said this is based on piezoelectric materials
the material is able to produce an electric charge when it stretches and is subjected to mechanical stress
pfc is a type of piezoelectric material made up of integrated electrodes , and an adhesive polymer matrix
the material is able to produce an electric charge when it stretches and is subjected to mechanical stress
atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas
' they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made
the microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks
by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery
it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible
plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature

as ars technica 's sean gallagher explained , the processor is n't powerful enough to run a computer desktop , for example , but does come with enough power and memory to stream media from a usb stick , send alerts from smart alarms and lights and run multiple apps
the firm said that the microcontroller itself can run for years on a single charge , but the battery life of the devices it is added to will depend on how much they are used
atmel 's current model is designed for smart household devices and other gadgets that use relatively low power , but the technology has the potential to one day run on more power - hungry gadgets such as phones and tablets .
