arsenal target virgil van dijk should be aiming to secure a move to a top six premier league side if he leaves celtic this summer , according to hartson
van dijk has been linked with a number of clubs in england 's top flight this season with sunderland and everton both being priced out of a deal to sign the 23 - year - old in the january transfer window
last month southampton also watched the dutch centre back during celtic 's 3 - 3 draw with inter milan in the europa league

and hartson , who played for both the gunners and celtic , believes van dijk is as good as current arsenal first - team centre back laurent koscielny
' i like big virgil van dijk
i think he 's the full package
he 's quick , he can leap and defensively he is sound , ' the former wales international said
' celtic did fantastically to keep hold of him in the summer
it was a fantastic bit of business by [ manager ] ronny deila , who no doubt has had a word in his ear and told him : " if you give me another year to 18 months , then you can have your move
" ' he will keep improving with celtic and in time , he will become a top - class centre - half that a lot of clubs will be interested in
' is he top notch ? is he as good as the laurent koscielny 's of this world ? ' i think he is
i think he is a top - six premier league player
