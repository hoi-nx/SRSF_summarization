police announced wednesday they had closed an investigation into sexual assault claims by a former university of missouri swimmer who committed suicide without charging anyone for her alleged rape
investigators in columbia , university of missouri , ' encountered several obstacles ' while looking into claims menu courey made to health professionals that she 'd been sexually assaulted by up to three football players as a sophomore
without dna evidence , video recordings or a detailed recounting of the alleged assault , police could only rely on witnesses , who would not cooperate with the investigation , spokeswoman bryana maupin said
while some of the people menu courey told she had been raped were medical personnel bound by confidentiality rules , espn reported that the former university of missouri student wrote in a diary that she had spoken about it with an athletic department administrator
a story in the columbia daily tribune in 2012 also noted that menu courey mentioned the sexual assault in her journal
under title ix rules , an education institute is required to begin an appropriate investigation as soon as a possible sexual assault is known
menu courey 's parents told espn that instead of the university following up on the report of sexual assault , head swimming coach rhodenbaugh stop speaking with them
raised in toronto and once considered a prospect for the canadian national swim team , menu courey had struggled with undiagnosed borderline personality disorder that had led her to attempt suicide when she was 16
stellar student : while she could n't swim her freshman year over eligibility concerns relating to her canadian education , menu courey was a straight - a student at university of missouri university of missouri : rolandis woodland , a friend of menu courey and a football player , said she sent him a video of the assault , which showed three men involved , though he claims the video has disappeared in february 2010 , when she was in her second sophomore semester , menu courey claims she was sexually assaulted after a consensual encounter with a male friend
we ' were falling asleep & then i heard the [ door ] open & some other guy walked in & locked the door & i couldnt really see who it was & i never saw a face the whole time , ' menu courey wrote in an online chat with a rape crisis counselor later uncovered in a records request
' i remember just sitting upright in bed at the sound of someone walking in
& i just remember feeling really scared thinking that the two guys had planned this or something
' ' so my first thought was figure out who this other person was in case so that if i needed the informaton i would have it later ... the guy told me his name & then he pulled down his pants & put on a condom & just knew i was screwed ... ' ' the guy just lift up my dress & next thing i knew he inserts from behind
by that point tears were falling more but i wasnt loud & didnt anything
and then i just snapped and kind pushed him away & yelled no ! and then he just left
' abandoned : lynn courey and mike menu said that even after a story about their daughter 's alleged rape was published , the university did not take action , and swim coach greg rodenbaugh ( right ) cut off contact seeking answers : rolandis woodland ( right ) , a university of missouri football player and friend of menu courey 's , said she started talking about suicide the morning after the alleged assault by fellow players a friend , rolandis woodland , who played football at university of missouri , said menu courey began speaking about taking her own life the morning after the assault allegedly occurred
two months later , she entered treatment at the campus hospital to deal with her suicidal thoughts , after which she started seeing counselors and taking anti-depressants
after a back injury , coach rhodenbaugh asked her not to take part in training and competitions , which he told espn was to motivate her to focus on counseling , in spite of records that showed menu courey had not stopped going
in march 2011 , as she experienced mood swings and anxiety that her scholarship and place on the university of missouri swim team were in jeopardy , she entered the school 's psychiatric center
after being released to her parents , she went to a hotel where she slashed her wrists before a police officer was able to wrest the razor blade out of her hands
it was during a 96 - hour hospitalization following this incident that a member of the university of missouri athletic department , meghan anderson , visited menu courey and had her sign a university withdrawal form , which coach rhodenbaugh characterized as a way to prevent her grades from falling
in the aftermath , menu courey began worrying more about school
she moved to boston and was admitted to mclean hospital for borderline personality disorder , which one doctor there told espn had been worsened by the alleged attack
in may , she called anderson and spoke to her about the rape , according to a journal that she kept , though anderson claims the conversation was about menu courey returning to school
later that month , she received a letter from the university informing her she was no longer eligible for financial aid , though the university described it as a form letter sent to student who had withdrawn from the school and said it did not apply to menu courey 's athletic scholarship
in june , the former university of missouri swimmer ingested 100 tablets of tylenol while still hospitalized , dying two days later from organ failure .
