manor team principal booth has assured critics the marque will be on track and competing in the next formula one world championship race in malaysia later this month
resurrected from marussia 's ashes and wrested from the clutches of administration by energy entrepreneur stephen fitzpatrick , a reborn manor headed to australia for the season - opening race at the weekend with every intention of taking to melbourne 's albert park circuit
although the cars passed crash tests and wider scrutiny , manor failed to emerge from the garage even once as they ran out of time in a bid to rebuild their it infrastructure , lost after all hardware was wiped days before a planned auction of the team 's assets
manor team principal booth is confident his team will race in malaysia later this month although the fia cleared manor of a potential breach of the rules as they were investigated for failing to fulfil obligations to compete , formula one world championship supremo ecclestone was left far from impressed
ecclestone claims manor had ' zero ' intention of taking part and has threatened to charge them for all freight costs which are borne by formula one management for all teams for every race
despite that , when asked by press association sport on saturday after the team had failed to take part in qualifying whether ecclestone was being kept in the loop about their issues , booth confirmed that was the case
manor drivers will stevens and roberto merhi are expected to compete in malaysia ' ecclestone just misses nothing , does he ? he has been kept aware at every stage of the process , ' replied booth
as to whether ecclestone was supportive , booth nodded and said : ' yep
' the suggestion from sceptics was manor were in australia simply to lay claim to the Â£ 28million owed to them by ecclestone in prize money after back - to - back top - 10 finishes in the constructors ' championship
booth , however , dismissed the notion as he said : ' we 're entered in the formula one world championship and we felt it important to be present in australia and try and compete
the manor team work on their car in the garage in australia ' i can understand people being cynical , but if that was the case we would n't have brought 30 tonnes of equipment , 40 people , fulfilled our contracts with all suppliers - pirelli , ferrari , whoever - with our best endeavours to go round and round a circuit
' booth claims another day of behind - the - scenes graft would likely have been enough for the team to turn a wheel , underlining his confidence that malaysia will hold difficulties
asked whether will stevens and roberto merhi will be on track in sepang on march 27 for practice , booth replied : ' absolutely
' we 're in a massively different place now than where we were at the start of last week
' the progress was colossal , just not quite enough , but now we 'll get to malaysia on monday , start setting up at the circuit on tuesday , and for sure we 'll be ready to run on friday
