brooks , of sedgley , west midlands , pleaded guilty to one count of theft at dudley magistrates court on february 19
she wept in the dock as she was sentenced to 26 weeks in a young offenders ' institute at wolverhampton crown court
judge martin walsh told her : ' you 're 20 - years - old and fall to be sentenced for what was a mean and despicable offence of theft arriving out of a gross breach of trust
' you , whilst inside her home address , stole Â£ 30 from her purse
' the aggravating feature here is not the value of property , it 's the nature of the relationship between you and the elderly person whom you were responsible for providing care for

' it is a deterrent to others
' the court heard the pensioner 's family became suspicious when money began going missing in december last year
prosecutor dann said brooks admitted the offence to officers and said she had stolen the money in order to buy christmas presents
mr dann added : ' mrs evelyn nicholson is 85 - years - old
she lives alone and she is under the care of gateway health and social care
' the defendant was one of the carers who visited mrs evelyn nicholson 's home on a regular basis
' mrs evelyn nicholson 's family ensured that she had cash and she had some money in a purse which was kept in a drawer in the kitchen
' they noticed that money seemed to go missing
they asked mrs evelyn nicholson if she had given it to anyone and she had n't
' on january 6 the company installed a camera with the family 's permission
' the defendant attended the address on that day and she can be seen to go to the drawer , to open the drawer and take out the purse
' the defendant was spoken to by the deputy manager and she admitted she had stolen the money
' she was interviewed by the police on january 15 and said she she needed the money for christmas gifts
' she showed remorse for her actions and wanted to pay the money back
the court heard the retired farm worker , who has 11 children , 16 grandchildren , 13 great - grandchildren and 11 great - great - grandchildren , fell ill as a result of the theft ' mrs evelyn nicholson 's son says in his statement this offence has made his mother very ill. ' the doctor has attended her twice since the theft , it has left her feeling very vulnerable
' jason aris , defending , said brooks had faced ' embarrassment and shame ' as a result of the cctv footage of her theft being placed online
he added : ' she has shown considerable insight into her offending behaviour
' she identified that her actions would have left the victim feeling vulnerable in her own house
' the cctv footage that captures her taken the money has ended up online
this has given her a certain sense of notoriety that she did n't seek to achieve
' this has compounded her embarrassment and shame and family and friends across the other side of the country have learned about her escapades
' by engaging in this stupid and thoughtless behaviour , she has pretty much ensured that any possibility of work in the future is going to be difficult for her
brooks , of sedgley , west midlands , pleaded guilty to one count of theft at dudley magistrates court on february 19 she is filmed opening the drawer after looking around the room to see if anyone is watching her ' she certainly wo n't be working in the care industry in the near future
' the remorse that has been expressed by her is genuine
she has described the shame as all consuming
' speaking outside court after the hearing , mrs evelyn nicholson 's eldest son smith , 65 said around Â£ 200 had gone missing from his mother 's purse in total
he said the retired farm worker , who has 11 children , 16 grandchildren , 13 great - grandchildren and 11 great - great - grandchildren , fell ill as a result of the theft
mr smith , who works as a courier , added : ' i 'm pleased with the sentence , i was hoping she was going to go down
' she was one of the primary carers and had been going in to my mother for six months
' i knew it was a carer , they were the only people who could have taken the money out of the drawer , but i did n't know who it was
' my mother was devastated and it has affected her health
' she knows one of the carers has stolen from her but she would n't be able to tell you which one , we have tried to keep it away from her
' she had to go into respite for a couple of weeks because it really upset her but she is back home now and she is settling back down
' she ca n't walk , she ca n't stand without the assistance of the carers
' she loves the carers and with their assistance that allows her to stop at home which is what she wants
' a spokesman for gateway health and social care dudley confirmed brooks had been dismissed .
