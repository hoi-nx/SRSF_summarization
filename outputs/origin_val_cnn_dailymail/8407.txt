hopkins has been reported to police by labour mp danczuk over claims she incited racial hatred in tweets linking pakistani men to the rochdale child sex abuse scandal outspoken former reality tv star hopkins has accused the labour mp danczuk of reporting her to the police to deflect attention from being ' caught watching porn '
mr danczuk said he had received death threats after asking manchester police commissioner tony lloyd to investigate whether ms hopkins had incited racial hatred in a series of tweets linking pakistani men to the rochdale child sex abuse scandal
ms hopkins sent the tweets after mr danczuk attended the raising of a pakistani flag over the town hall for half an hour on march 23 to mark pakistani 's national day
ms hopkins posted a series of messages to her account after the mp tweeted a picture of himself at the event
in response the controversial columnist sent a picture of eight men convicted of child exploitation offences , asking mr danczuk if they were his friends too
mr danczuk said the messages were ' inciting racial hatred '
he told lbc radio tonight that he had seen the police today and will do so again tomorrow and revealed he had received death threats as a result
ms hopkins sounded unconcerned and said she laughed when she heard mr danczuk had reported her to the police
she said she will stand up herself and ' defend the right of british people to have the union flag flying '
she added that mr danczuk is ' wasting police time '
the businesswoman said mr danczuk was just covering up the fact that he had been ' caught watching porn ' and because he has a wafer thin majority and ' needs the pakistani vote '
it came after mr danczuk this weekend confessed to watching pornography but insisted voters want politicians who ' live in the real world '
the husband of selfie - loving karen danczuk was spotted favouriting hard - core porn on twitter - but blamed it on a fault with his iphone
however , the 48 - year - old was unembarrassed about the gaffe
he stressed he does not use porn regularly , but insisted : ' i am a man of the world and it is part of life , many people do
' mr danczuk tonight dismissed ms hopkins ' claim that he had only reported her to cover up his embarrassment
but ms hopkins said she stood by her comments saying : ' for me , in somewhere like rochdale , you ca n't raise a pakistani flag and talk about community cohesion in the same sentence
' ' if we look at why someone did n't call the police earlier when our white girls were being attacked by these gentlemen , if someone had called the police earlier then that would have been a good thing would n't it ? ' hopkins is said to have started sending the tweets after mr danczuk attended the raising of a pakistani flag over the town hall for half an hour on march 23 to mark pakistani 's national day mr danczuk said rochdale has faced up to the ' heinous crime ' of child grooming ' in a way that 's managed to keep our communities together '
he said : ' that 's why hopkins ' crass comments are not helpful
they are a clear attempt to divide communities , undo three years of hard work and make an unfair and racist generalisation that anyone of pakistani origin is a child abuser
' to equate the pakistani flag with child abuse , as she has done on social media over the last week , is absurd and it creates a dangerous environment where extreme intolerance becomes acceptable
' we have already seen taxi drivers stabbed in the face in race hate attacks and i 'm not prepared to allow people like hopkins , who know nothing about our town , to stir up tensions in such a dangerously provocative way that could lead to innocent people being attacked by extremists
' as a result of her comments last week , i have been threatened by extremists and hard right groups have pledged to march on our town
i am a strong supporter of free speech but it has to be responsible - and that 's why we have laws to prevent people deliberately provoking hatred of a racial group
' earlier this week ms hopkins sparked outrage after being accused of making a holocaust joke aimed at the wife of ed miliband â even though his jewish parents fled from the nazis
' raising a pakistani flag in rochdale is not helping community cohesion , ' she added in another
âª @ simondanczuk you & your party disgust me ' she wrote : ' are these your friends too âª @ simondanczuk ? is this why you are raising the pakistani flag in rochdale ? 77 years inside ' the controversial tv pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the labour leader could ' gas ' his wife justine in a message on friday
she tweeted : ' pollsters say justine is the least popular of party wives
he might stick her head in the oven and turn on the gas
' the outspoken star was then bombarded with hundreds of furious messages condemning her ' vile ' tweet , with one saying : ' you really are a deplorable and scummy piece of excrement
' she has also courted controversy this week for her comments about the germanwings disaster
the tv pundit tweeted saying : ' sympathy for the co-pilot is making me angry
if you are suicidal , for goodness sake top yourself in private
attention seeking b * * * * * * s. ' the controversial tv pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the labour leader could ' gas ' his wife justine ( pictured together ) she followed this up with a number of tweets about depression , including : ' most depression is just genuine sadness at a social situation
like being caught in torrential rain with a bag from primark
