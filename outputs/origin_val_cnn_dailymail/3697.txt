the host of hbo 's last week tonight , a satirical news and current affairs program , called mr tony abbott a ' car crash of a human being ' but said that his behaviour was still entertaining to watch
' it 's like watching a truck jack - knife on a road
it 's like , " it did n't crash this time
let 's give it five minutes , then it 's going into a ditch " , ' oliver said
' the fact he 's the leader of a country is in itself appealing as a comic
what 's nice is being able to present someone who people have not seen here [ in the u.s. ] and just to give them a glimpse into other people 's pain , as well as their own , ' he said
oliver has previously lampooned tony abbott on last week tonight , featuring the australian prime minister for his ' other presidents of the u.s. ' segment in june last year

oliver is also no stranger to australian politics , having interviewed former prime minister john howard for his story on gun control while reporting for the daily show

the comedian has also previously labelled australian one of ' the most comfortably racist places ' he had ever visited
' you can say what you like about australian racism , it is undeniably specific
i had a couple of australian â more than one â complain to me about all the â lebbos â in the country , referring apparently to the lebanon
who the f * * k is annoyed by lebanon people ? , ' he asked in his bugle podcast

' despite his stance on australian politics and racist proclivities , the 37 - year - old said has previously praised the governments fight to introduce plain packaging to cigarettes
in an 18 - minute video , oliver described tobacco as : ' an aging product that 's decreasing in popularity and yet somehow , it just ca n't stop making money
it 's basically the agricultural equivalent of u2
' ' australian 's plain packaging laws banned tobacco company branding from packaging and replaced it with upsetting photos such as the toe tag on a corpse , the cancerous mouth , the nightmarish eyeball or the diseased lung , ' he said
' perhaps unsurprisingly , since this law was implemented total consumption of tobacco and cigarettes in australian fell to record lows â¦ and nightmares about eyeballs have risen to record highs
' u.s. talk show host oliver has put australian 's plain packaging cigarette laws in the spotlight the talk show host then went on to suggest a ' compromise ' with tobacco companies , allowing them to market their products using ' jeff the diseased lung ' as their mascot he then pointed to a picture of a health warning on a cigarette package and joked : ' take it down , take down the demon eye ! ' oliver made reference to australian department of health statistics which show that consumption of cigarettes and tobacco fell to their lowest recorded levels ( $ 3.405 billion ) in the march quarter of 2014 , down from $ 3.508 billion in the december quarter of 2012
