both have since been terminated fisticuffs : police were called to this hooters restaurant in springfield , illinois , after getting a report of an altercation between two people details of the ugly breakup were revealed after dementri claimed in court papers that he was unfairly fired over the tryst while his former paramour , then - 28 - year - old lori delgado , was allowed to keep her job
dementri then moved on to wpix in new york , which also let him go in 2010 after he was accused of slapping the driver of the bahamian ambassador to the un in a spat over a parking spot
the quick - tempered reporter was slapped with an assault charge but was later acquitted
checkered past : dementri was sacked from nbc10 in 2008 over an affair with his married colleague lori delgado ( pictured ) dementri , a temple university graduate , got his start in tv journalism working as a sports producer for wpvi-tv

a charge of trespassing against the intrepid news gatherer was later thrown out
speaking to the daily news after his 2010 arrest , dementri said that he was being unfairly portrayed in the media as ' one of the bad boys , ' even though he 's never been convicted of any crime
the station manager of wics-tv in illinois told the state journal register in 2012 that they had looked into the incidents involving dementri , which turned out to be a ' non-issue ' for them
â i do nât think you can judge anybody âs character by an incident or two in life , â dementri said at the time
