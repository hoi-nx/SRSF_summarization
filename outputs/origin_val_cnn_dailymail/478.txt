cameron has vowed to build 200,000 homes for first - time buyers more than 30,000 people have registered for cheap ' starter homes ' - less than 48 hours after a new scheme was officially launched
cameron today announced plans to build 200,000 new homes which will be sold 20 per cent cheaper than the going rate for under 40s who have n't yet bought their own home
since a website promoting the scheme was officially launched on saturday there has been a ' stampede ' of first - time buyers showing an interest , downing street said
the revelation comes after mr cameron promised to make cheap new homes for first time buyers the centre - piece of the tory party 's house - building strategy after the election
he announced that a conservative government would build double the number of subsidised starter homes to give ' more young people the security of owning a home '
the homes will be sold below market rate and wo n't be ' snapped up by buy - to - let landlords ' , mr cameron said
he promised the homes will be ' decent , well - built , homes â places to start and raise a family '
the house builder 's federation , which runs the starter homes website , confirmed that almost 31,000 people have registered to receive information on starter homes being built in their area
the federation 's steve turner said the stampede of interest in the last 48 hours revealed the pent - up demand for first homes
he said : ' the volume of registrations clearly demonstrates the need for schemes to assist people to buy their own homes
' he added : ' in recent years it 's been very difficult , particularly for first - time buyers , to realise their ambitions of home ownership
government schemes to help them do so are clearly welcome
' cameron today promised to make cheap new homes for first time buyers the centre - piece of the tory party 's house - building strategy after the election the prime minister 's pledge to build 200,000 new properties for first - time was one of five election promises to help home owners
he said the tories would keep mortgage rates low , build more homes , extend the controversial help - to - buy scheme and encourage more people to buy their own council house
local councils will also be given more power to stop unpopular developments , mr cameron said
the pm said : ' there is a particular kind of security that comes with owning your own home [ but ] too many people have been denied that security
' the young people in their 20s and 30s still living with their parents , desperately saving for their own place
' the couple who want a child but ca n't afford to upsize â even though they both have full - on , full - time jobs
it should n't be this way
' our goal is a britain where everyone who works hard can have a home of their own
' ed miliband has promised to build 200,000 homes a year by 2020 - up from around 140,000 this year but labour leader ed miliband , speaking at a people 's question time in hove today , said : ' cameron 's plan on housing has failed britain and failed families
' under this government we are building fewer homes than at any time since the 1920s and record high numbers of families are being forced to rent
' for far too many people the dream of home ownership is disappearing into the distance
' labour has a better plan to build hundreds of thousands of new homes , ensure that local first time buyers are given priority and get a fairer deal for millions of families that rent
