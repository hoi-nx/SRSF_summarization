he might be retiring from the army but it appears that prince harry wo n't be ending all of his military commitments
today , the 30 - year - old royal revealed that he will be taking part in an epic 1,000 mile trek through the british as part of a fundraising drive for walking with the wounded
speaking during the launch of walk of britain at london 's mandarin oriental , the prince said he was ' delighted ' to be taking part in the trek and is ' looking forward to it '
' the public âs support for our armed forces continues to be extraordinary , ' he said
' however , as the memory of our military commitments in iraq and afghanistan fade , we must encourage people to continue supporting our servicemen and women ; particularly those who are seeking to transition into civilian life
' this process can be challenging , as it is for anyone seeking a new career
as i make this transition myself , i 'm determined to do all i can to help others
' today 's visit to the mandarin oriental comes just 48 hours after kensington palace announced that he is to retire from the army after a 10 - year career that included two tours of duty in afghanistan
cheerful : despite announcing his retirement from the army , harry was on typically cheeky form difficult : harry spoke of his own plans and said making the transition to civilian life would be ' challenging ' expedition : harry will join wounded servicemen for part of a 1,000 mile trek through the british announcement : harry 's plans were revealed less than 48 hours after it was announced he is leaving the army before he hangs up his boots , harry will spend four weeks with the australian defence force , splitting his time between sydney , darwin and perth , and will continue on to new zealanders for an official tour
much of the summer will be spend in africa , where the harry will occupy himself with charity work , much of it conservation focused , according to kensington palace
returning to the british in the autumn , harry will then join the core team of five wounded veterans taking part in the walk of british which gets underway on the 22nd august in scotland
the epic trek , which , it is hoped , will result in wider public awareness of veterans ' needs , will end in london on the 31st october
unfazed : harry smiled and clutched his speech as he listened to veterans talk about their experiences long association : harry has accompanied injured servicemen on two previous expeditions one of the boys : harry was on typically cheeky form and enjoyed chatting to soldiers at the reception harry is no stranger to the charity 's lengthy expeditions , having previously taken part in walks to the north pole in 2011 and another to the south pole in 2013
for the latter , the harry was joined by a star - studded crew that included swedish actor alexander skarsgã¥rd , as well of wounded veterans - some of whom were at the mandarin oriental for the launch
watched by an audience that included walking with the wounded co-founder ed perkins , harry made an impassioned speech about the need to help veterans and outlined his hopes for the trek
' walk of britain will cover all parts of the country , ' he explained
' walking through the communities in which our service personnel and veterans grew up and now live
' in doing so , walk of britain will give everyone the opportunity to meet these remarkable men and women
achievement : the five - strong team will walk 1,000 miles through the british , starting at the end of august helping out : harry 's last trek with walking with the wounded took him to antarctica race : the 2013 expedition saw the prince join wounded servicemen as they walked to the south pole ' people up and down the country will get to see first - hand the determination and resolve of those who have served , and in particular those who have been injured or suffer hidden wounds
' they will see that whatever their circumstances these men and women are looking to the future
they are looking to employers to give them the chance to keep making a contribution to our communities
' these men and women want to continue to serve their country in whatever way possible
ptsd and mental injury can make life a daily struggle , but we should not assume that everyone leaving the military faces these challenges
' it 's also important to keep mental health issues in perspective
we should remind people that nearly all cases end well , whether it be total cure , adjustment of life , or the ability for the individual to accept and admit the issues that face them , amongst a tricky culture of stigma
involved : harry , pictured arriving at the mandarin oriental , has long championed wounded soldiers projects : as well as walking with the wounded , he also spearheaded the invictus games retirement : harry will be seconded to the australia defence force for a month before he leaves the army ' it is a delicate balance between being ready to support those who need it and recognising the valuable role those who have served in the military can play in civilian life
' harry 's work with walking with the wounded echoes his previous efforts , most notably last year 's hugely successful invictus games
although the event will not take place this year , aides are keen to emphasise that prince harry 's championing of wounded servicemen will continue post-retirement
he will also continue to take part in military events , beginning with a trip to turkey next month to mark the centenary of the gallipoli campaign next month
the battle was one of the bloodiest of world war i and resulted in the deaths of approximately 43,000 british soldiers , 8,709 australia and 2,721 new zealanders
harry , who will be based in australia when the event takes place , will fly to turkey and will be joined by prince charles for a memorial service .
