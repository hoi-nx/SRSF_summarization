a supermarket worker who battered a charity worker to death with a brick while taking a legal high is facing a life sentence
lindo , 27 , repeatedly bludgeoned 51 year - old phillip steels in the street after taking the ecstasy clone ethylone

ethylone is one of dozens of synthetic narcotics that have flooded the britain over the last decade
the most famous , mephedrone or meow meow , was implicated in a series of deaths across the britain which led to the law being changed in 2010 to categorise the drugs as class b. lindo said he could not remember the attack but told psychiatrists he believed he could pass through other dimensions
he admitted manslaughter , but an old bailey jury took 11 hours and 31 minutes to find lindo guilty of murder by a majority of ten to one
lindo showed no emotion as the verdict was read out , but paused briefly to look up at family members in the public gallery as he was taken down
judge paul worsley qc told him : â as you know the sentence must be one of life imprisonment
â the judge remanded lindo in custody to be sentenced on monday

over the past five years there has been an unprecedented increase in the number , type and availability of new psychoactive substances in europe , with 101 new substances reported in 2014 alone
yesterday , the government banned two groups of dangerous â legal highs â
the stimulant compound drug 4,4 â - dmar , which is linked to the deaths of more than 20 people in the britain , mainly northern ireland , and the synthetic opioid mt-45 , have both been outlawed as class a substances
the move is part of a crackdown on new psychoactive substances ( nps ) â known as â legal highs â - and minister have already banned more than 500 new drugs
crime prevention minister lynne featherstone said the action included the creation of the forensic early warning system to identify substances previously unseen in the britain
tomorrow a britain - led proposal to internationally control the drug mephedrone is expected to be passed by the un in vienna
if it goes ahead , this would be the first time a nps is controlled by all un members
experts have warned that deaths linked to â legal highs â could overtake those linked to heroin by 2016 drugs experts have warned that deaths linked to â legal highs â could overtake those linked to heroin by 2016
deaths increased eightfold rising from 12 in 2009 to 97 in 2012 , according to figures from centre for social justice who claim the britain has the highest rate of legal highs use among young people in europe
a survey of more than 13 000 young adults aged 15 â 24 in the eu member states , found that 8 per cent had tried a new psychoactive substance at least once , with 3 per cent using them in the last year
only last august , father - of - three michael mckay , 33 , from arbroath , angus , passed away at ninewells hospital in dundee following a five - month addiction to new psychoactive substances ( nps ) , which caused him severe heart problems
in 2013 , adam hunt , 18 , died four days after taking the psychoactive substance amt at his home in southampton , hampshire , after purchasing it from a website
in february last year lewis dale , 17 , was jailed for stabbing his grandmother to death while high on the former legal high mephedrone after he hallucinated that a swat team was after him and he needed to ' go to war '
he stabbed his grandfather allan dale , 80 , twice with a kitchen knife before attacking his grandmother irene dale as she lay in her bed in the same year , keen sportsman jimmy guichard , 20 , suffered a heart attack and severe brain damage within hours of taking one of the herbal substances
the soaring death toll led to ministers calling the rise in the use of legal highs a ' national emergency '
currently drug laws in europe and north america only ban the use and sale of specific substances
loss : 18 - year - old adam hunt who died after taking a so - called ' legal high ' he bought off the internet this means new compounds developed by chemists can be sold without fear of prosecution until they are added to the list of controlled substances
mephedrone , created by dr z and sold over the internet as plant food , caused at least one death and has been implicated in at least 13 others
the drug became popular among clubbers in 2007 as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for ecstasy
mephedrone 's popularity gave rise to a whole new market for legal highs sold over the internet
when the substance was finally banned in 2010 , a range of other novel synthesised drugs had sprung up to take its place
they include psychoactive substances ( nps ) and 6 - apb , known commonly as benzo fury
those attempts have now turned into a cat and mouse game with legislators , with chemists synthesising new substances faster them parliament can ban them , spawning a whole industry to feed britain 's hunger for mind - altering substances
however , unlike drugs which have been around for years and for which risks are generally well known , the long term - and indeed short term - risks many of these new substances are still a mystery .
