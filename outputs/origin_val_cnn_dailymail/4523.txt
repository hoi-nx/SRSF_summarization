in each case , she delays reporting the crime ... in each case she claims a loss of memory as a defense
' she was acquitted in her 1986 trial after claiming she had acted in self defense when her husband , whom she was divorcing , held a pistol to her head , threatened to kill her and sexually abused her
she said she could n't remember killing him and a psychiatrist testified during the trial that she suffered from limited amnesia
the prosecution told a very different tale

but when colleen harris was house - bound following hip - replacement surgery , he returned to the placerville home to help her
' my dad , bless his heart , was there taking care of colleen ann harris despite whatever circumstances were going on between them , ' his son andy harris told the sacramento bee
then on january 5 , 2013 , she overheard her husband making a call to his love interest overseas and later that night or the following morning , she shot him as he slept , prosecutors claim
she then allegedly drove to san francisco and stashed her husband 's cellphone , a handgun - not the same one used in the murder - and his coin collection , in her son 's garage
after returning home , she called the lawyer who won her previous case and told him that she had shot her husband , prosecutors say

mr harris ' family said they remain devastated by the loss
' the death of your father is devastating enough , ' andy harris said
' and then there is the person who is brought into your family and loved as a family member
