real madrid 's 4 - 3 loss to schalke has prompted further calls for change in the spanish capital
they progressed to the quarter - finals of the champions league thanks to a 2 - 0 win in the first leg , but tuesday night was supposed to be easy
on sunday , their place at the top of la liga was swiped from underneath them , and 92 % of fans have demanded a change in tactical approach , according to a recent poll in as
most players have been criticised - cristiano ronaldo included - but perhaps most under - fire is casillas
mr real madrid , with over 500 appearances
real madrid goalkeeper casillas has come under heavy scrutiny after a series of poor performances united goalkeeper david de gea has been touted as the perfect replacement at real madrid three of schalke 's four goals could have been saved , they said
casillas needs to leave , they said
at 33 years of age , he may well be past his best , with three european cups , five league titles and one world cup tucked safely under his belt
united 's david de gea has been touted as his possible replacement , and even sportsmail 's jamie carragher waded into the debate on tuesday night
' real madrid need a new keeper
david de gea wants to win trophies
no brainer , ' he wrote on twitter
david de gea was labelled the best goalkeeper in the world by roy keane this week , and may leave united keylor navas is also waiting for his chance at the bernabeu after joining in the summer and perhaps he has a point
united have fallen short of expectations once more , and david de gea will be keen to taste success ... where better than the city he was born ? he is a spain international , and certainly talented enough to take the reins from his countryman
but you get the feeling that real madrid would not be the same without casillas
since 1999 , he has been a main - stay at the bernabeu
at the end of the game on tuesday night , there was an endearing moment in which he refused to let his team - mates leave the pitch before thanking the real madrid fans
casillas would not let his team - mates leave the pitch on tuesday night before they thanked the supporters cristiano ronaldo was unhappy at his side 's performance , but was made to applaud the fans by casillas pointing and pulling , ushering his team - mates to the corners of the pitch to applaud the supporters
but still they want rid
for the first goal , he palmed the ball into his bottom corner
for the second , he pushed it into the path of klaas-jan huntelaar
for the third , he was rooted to the spot
success is in real madrid 's nature , and their fans are n't happy with the amount of goals they are conceding
that starts at the back ... with casillas
aside from david de gea 's potential arrival , you ca n't forget the presence of keylor navas
signed from levante in the summer , he is waiting , willing , wishing for his chance
david de gea is a spain international and grew up in real madrid , playing for atletico before moving to united casillas has had a remarkable career , winning numerous trophies including the 2010 world cup but david de gea makes sense
he is 24 years old , and getting better with every game he plays
signed by sir alex ferguson for just shy of Â£ 19million in 2011 , united would make a tidy profit on him if he were to leave
' i think david de gea is the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment , ' roy keane told itv after monday night 's fa cup clash with arsenal
the best goalkeeper in the world to one of the best football clubs in the world
maybe jamie carragher has called it right again .
