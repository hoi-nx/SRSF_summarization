he has been embroiled in a well - documented feud with italian designers d&g and d&g after the former called babies born through in - vitro fertilization ' synthetic '
but sir elton - whose two sons zachary , four , and elton david zachary elijah , two , were conceived with the help of a surrogate and artificial insemination - appeared to offer an olive branch when he declared his love for the fashion duo in las vegas on wednesday night
speaking on stage at his concert at the colosseum , elton included the pair in a list of inspirational people who have changed the world , such as nelson mandela and lady diana , according to tmz
' sir elton announced last week that he would boycott the brand after designer d&g criticised ivf , saying : ' you are born and you have a father and mother
at least it should be like that
that 's why i 'm not convinced by what i call chemical children , synthetic babies
' elton , who is married to david furnish , responded furiously , writing on sunday : ' how dare you refer to my beautiful children as " synthetic "
controversy : designer d&g ( right ) has defended his controversial remarks and said he ' respects all the world '
he is pictured with business partner d&g ( left ) ' and shame on you for wagging your judgmental little fingers at ivf â a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people , both straight and gay , to fulfil their dream of having children
' your archaic thinking is out of step with the times , just like your fashions
i shall never wear d&g ever again
' his outburst prompted a mass social media campaign , as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand
boycott : sir elton ( pictured with his husband david furnish and their children ) , spoke out against d&g and claimed that he will never wear any of their clothes ever again after their comments equality campaigners and celebrities also weighed in on the dispute - gay rights activist peter tatchell has organised a protest outside d&g 's london store on thurday to show the public 's opposition to the inflammatory comments
victoria beckham , a former d&g ambassador who is close friends with sir elton , offered her support with the message : ' sending love to elton david zachary elijah & all the beautiful ivf babies x vb
' omd&g ! elton was seen carrying a d&g bag only days after launching a feud against the brand but the designers hit back - d&g told an italian newspaper : ' it 's useless , this is just an authoritarian way of seeing things : if you agree with me , good , otherwise i 'll attack
and i wrote to him , in the comments on instagram : fascist
' things took a twist when elton was seen carrying a d&g - branded bag only 24 hours after he entered into a high - profile row with the designers over their criticism of fertility treatments
caught red handed : the star clearly did n't seem too oposed to the fashion house even though he encouraged others to boycott photographers said sir elton was seen carrying the d&g bag on march 16 , after being dropped off in his chauffeur - driven suv
a spokesman for the singer confirmed : â yes he was carrying the bag but he had nât been shopping
and it should not detract from their original message or the boycott
â elton 's comments on - stage in las vegas came after d&g insisted his views were private , personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional sicilian family
in an interview with cnn , d&g insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure , and said : ' i believe in the traditional family
' it is impossible to change my culture for something different
it 's me ... i respect all the world , all the culture
' d&g said he would not be not boycotting the artist and added : ' i love the music of elton
' he said he believed they could end the dispute and added : ' every people resolve everything by talk ... we start to talk , the problem is resolved
' every people [ has ] freedom for choosing what they want
this for me is democracy
i respect you because you choose what you want
' i respect me because i choose what i want
this just my point of private view
' interview : d&g made his inflammatory remarks in an interview with italian magazine panorama earlier this month furious : sir elton posted a photo of design duo d&g on his instagram page and responded to their comments in a strongly - worded attack
