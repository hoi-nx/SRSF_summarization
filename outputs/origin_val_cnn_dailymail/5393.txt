three major airlines are facing legal action over allegations of poor handling of passengers hit by disruption to flights
jet2 and wizz air were said to have breached airline policies when it came to consistently offering their customers compensation for disrupted flights and had imposed false deadlines for claims
the caa ( caa ) added that aer lingus and jet2 had also failed to tell passengers about their right for compensation
aer lingus , jet2 and wizz air have not made changes to their policies requested by regulators despite extensive discussions , it is claimed all three airlines had also failed to make the changes to their policies requested by regulators despite extensive discussions , it is claimed
the caa has announced it has launched enforcement action against the carriers and will seek a court order unless they comply
but a spokeswoman for jet2 hit back at the claims , calling them ' materially inaccurate '
she said the airline was already paying Â£ 289 compensation per person for disruption caused by technical faults - in line with the huzar ruling - even though their average fare is Â£ 80
' airlines are entitled to limit to two years the period in which claims can be made by contractual limitations and these have been upheld by the court on a number of occasions , ' she added
' jet2 strictly abides by court decisions and is acting in accordance with the law , not contrary to it
the caa alleged that jet2 and wizz air have failed to satisfy the regulator that they are consistently paying compensation for disruption caused by technical faults , despite a court of appeal ruling clarifying that airlines must do so ' no enforcement action has been taken
the caa is obligated to consult with jet2 before considering enforcement action
given the misapprehensions of the caa , jet2 expects that following the mandatory consultation process the caa will not wish to take the matter any further
' a spokesman for aer lingus added : ' aer lingus ' procedures , relating to the provision of information to customers affected by operational disruption , are fully compliant with all the relevant regulations
- jet2 and wizz air have failed to satisfy the regulator that they are consistently paying compensation for disruption caused by technical faults , despite a court of appeal ruling clarifying that airlines must do so
- jet2 and wizz air are imposing two - year time limits for passengers to take compensation claims to court , despite a court of appeal ruling that passengers should have up to six years to take a claim to court
- jet2 and aer lingus have failed to give satisfactory evidence that they proactively provide passengers with information about their rights during disruption in line with the requirements set out in european regulation
' we have provided a number of documents to the caa in recent months to substantiate this point and we continue to engage with the caa to address their concerns
' the move by the caa comes after the authority carried out a six - month review of airline policies in relation to supporting passengers during disruption , including their approaches to paying flight delay compensation and providing information to fliers about their rights
wizz air 's spokesman daniel de carvalho said : ' an application for stay had been made regarding a case in the english courts while the european court of justice is considering a relevant case relating to the extent of airlines ' liability to pay compensation claims in certain cases involving technical faults and defects
' after this lawful application for stay was denied by english courts , wizz air decided not to appeal this decision and to re-assess the tens of cases where customers claimed compensation after flight disruptions caused by unforeseeable technical faults
' the uk caa is well aware that wizz air is re-assessing these cases and has confirmed to the caa itself , some time ago , that it will apply the uk caa 's own list of extraordinary circumstances in the relevant cases
' wizz air further confirms that claims can be raised within two years after the flight disruption , in line with its general conditions of carriage agreed to by customers at the time of booking , an approach which has been upheld by the english courts
' aer lingus denied claims and said their provision of information to customers affected by operational disruption , were ' fully compliant with all the relevant regulations ' andrew haines , chief executive of the caa , said : ' airlines are well aware of the support they must provide when there is disruption and passengers have every right to be disappointed that a small number of airlines are not complying with the court of appeal rulings and continue to let people down in this way
' since the law was clarified last year , we have been active to ensure airlines are applying consumer law appropriately and i warmly welcome the response of those airlines that have changed their policies as a result of this work
' our job is not done until all airlines can demonstrate they are providing care , assistance and compensation as required by law
' while we have no power to secure redress for individual consumers , we are determined to stand up for passengers and are taking this action to safeguard their rights , making sure all airlines consistently provide their passengers with the support and compensation they are legally entitled to
