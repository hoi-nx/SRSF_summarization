four years later , the couple married in a beatles - themed ceremony and are preparing to jet off on their honeymoon to a beatles festival in kentucky , louisiana , in may
anne owens says that for her it had been love at first sight
' i 'd worked at the hospital for 20 years when i first met luke , and i knew he was the one as soon as i met him , ' she said
' he 'd just started at the medical centre , and when i first saw him i thought he was dead cute
' i initially thought he was about 30 , but he actually turned out to be 22 - i was 44
' anne owens said she is often mistaken as much younger than her years , whereas luke looks older for his age
and so despite a 22 - year age gap , anne owens decided to pursue luke
she said : ' i was n't sure whether he was interested or not at the start because he seemed a little shy , but i always used to make a beeline for him
' i used to go out of my way to get shifts swapped with friends so that we could work together
' one day , i hinted at a little date and gave him my number
we started texting and it went from friends to flirty , and then one night i decided to just give him a kiss and see what happened
' luke says that he was glad that anne owens had made the first move as he would never have had the confidence to
' it was anne owens that asked me out
i would n't have done it myself because of the age gap , ' he said
' i knew she was a bit older than me , but i was a bit worried at the start because i did n't know how old she was - you get told not to ask women her age so i waited a couple of months to find out

' i got a few high fives off my mates - i think it earned me a few brownie points
' anne owens said that although luke was ' slow on the uptake ' age gap relationships have benefits
' luke is quite romantic for his age
he 's caring , thoughtful and funny
he does n't take life too seriously , which is just so much more fun and makes me feel younger
