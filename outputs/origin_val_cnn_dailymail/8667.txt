these dramatic photographs capture the moment seven unexploded shells were detonated out at sea
the 40lb shells , which are believed to date from the 1860s , were sniffed out by a black labrador named after sir barnes wallis - the inventor of the bouncing bomb
his owner , john brewin , phoned the emergency services after his dog dug up one of the shells during a walk in sandwich bay , kent , on sunday
they were taken out into the sea where they were safely detonated
mr john brewin said it was not the first time his dog had found explosives
he said : ' these are not the first he has found
' ' the seven shells date from the 1860s and are 40lb black powder shells
' the first one was found by my black labrador barnes wallis and the others were then located by the local coastguard team , assisted by barnes wallis again
' mr john brewin named his dog after sir barnes wallis , a british aviation engineer who invented the ' bouncing bomb ' used in the dambusters raid of 1943
adrian hendry , 43 , who lives nearby , said : ' the explosion out at sea was incredible - a real blast
' it 's amazing that the dog that sniffed the bombs out is named after barnes wallis - an amazing coincidence really
' uncovered : bomb disposal experts arrived and , with barnes wallis ' help , found another six shells on the beach curious : owner john brewin said the shells , pictured , are not the first to be dug up by his pet sir barnes wallis : inventor of the ' bouncing bomb ' barnes wallis was a british aviation engineer who is famous for designing the ' bouncing bomb ' that was used in the dambusters raid of 1943
born in derbyshire , barnes wallis worked first as for a marine engineering firm before transferring to working on aircraft
when the second world war began , barnes wallis was assistant chief designer of aviation at vickers ' engineering
he came up with the concept behind the bouncing bomb while skipping his daughter 's marbles across a tub of water by catapault
but it took more than a year to convince raf chiefs that such a bomb might work and should be attempted
once he was given the go - ahead , he had only eight weeks to complete and test the design
the final solution , called upkeep , was a cylindrical bomb , weighing four tons , spinning backwards at 500 rpm
it had to be dropped from precisely 60ft above the water at not more than 240mph
in the middle of hilly , forested west german territory
dambusters raid , dubbed the ' dambusters raid ' was carried out overnight on the 16 may 1943 by the 617 squadron of the raf - specially - created for the job - that was led by guy gibson
two of the dams were breached , leading to serious flooding of the surrounding area
however , it did not make a significant dent in the country 's industrial production , as hoped
the most significant outcome of the raid was the positive effect it had on morale - giving allied troops , and those left at home , a much - needed boost
