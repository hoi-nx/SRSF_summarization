the nephew of john travolta has come forward in a new interview to describe his decision to leave the church of scientology , and what his life has been like since
sam says he decided to leave scientology in 2007 after almost taking his own life , and has now been forced to live on the run
' it 's psychological warfare and after a while it gets to you , ' he said of being a member of the polarizing religion
' things got so bad that i tried to jump off a bridge in los angeles in 2007 , trying to kill myself
' he spent 28 days in a mental institution following this incident , and that is when he finally left the church
' planting drugs on me ' and ' spreading rumors around town that i was psychotic , and even worse - a pedophile , ' are just two of the ways sam claims members of the church tried to bring him down after his decision to leave scientology
'' my uncle told me , " sorry , sam , i ca n't help you
they do n't care who i am
" ' his uncle does however supply sam with a monthly allowance , which is greatly appreciated by the struggling screenwriter
sam also says in the interview that sam has never pressured members of his family into joining scientology , though he does say he would be ' friendlier ' to those individuals who were members of the church
the other claim sam makes against the church , and one that has been brought up frequently by former members , is the amount of work required of members for little to no pay
sam claims he worked as a file clerk , ' making $ 36 for a 60 - hour week
' then , there was the treatment he received from other members shortly before he left the church
sam , claims they ' would mouth to me , " you are dead , " over and over again
it was all about mental control for them
' the 47 - year - old says he has moved on now that the attacks have stopped , and he is finally trying to get his life back on track
sam 's interview meanwhile could not come at a worse time for the church , with the hbo documentary going clear set to premiere later this month
the film takes a look at the religion , and how its treatment of a-list members like tom cruise and sam , differs from others in the church
it is based on the book of the same name , which was released to widespread critical acclaim in 2013 , and is based on interviews conducted with over 200 members of the religion who decided to leave the church
john travolta 's lawyer has denied the claims made by his nephew in this interview .
