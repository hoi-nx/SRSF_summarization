' i had no reason to hurt anyone , ' she said
gupta , his 23 - year - old girlfriend , waugh and one other had spent the night celebrating gupta 's birthday
taylor gould consumed at least six drinks , including red wine , a whiskey - and - cranberry , an irish coffee , and a margarita
dark turn : the group spent a saturday night out celebrating gupta 's birthday
the first three later returned to the girlfriend 's apartment where they continued to drink shots after drinking , gupta and waugh returned to gupta 's girlfriend 's apartment in silver springs at 1:30am where the three continued drinking shots of alcohol
taylor gould says she was too drunk the night of the murder to remember anything clearly neighbors later reported hearing loud noises coming from the apartment , like people were moving furniture
shortly before 3:30am sunday morning , police responded to a 911 call made by the girlfriend
when they arrived on the scene , police reported hearing movements and yelling inside but no one answered the door when they knocked
police opened the locked door and taylor gould approached the officers with blood on her and said : ' i do n't know what happened
can you tell me ? ' officers noted seeing blood on the walls of the kitchen and living area and gupta lying on the floor , covered in blood
they asked gupta if he was hurt but he said : ' i do n't think so '
prosecutor mays told the court that when asked what had happened , gupta told them : ' my girlfriend and my buddy were cheating
i walked in on my girlfriend and my buddy cheating
' officers found waugh lying on the floor unresponsive and he was pronounced dead - he had been stabbed six times and slashed five times
his lung was punctured and his jugular vein cut
the prosecutor said : ' mr. waugh did not die immediately
' ' he could have lived for several minutes before dying from loss of blood
' mays told jurors that a palm print and fingerprint â in waugh âs blood â also implicate gupta
at police headquarters , gupta admitted that he made a mistake , but added : ' he tried to kill me , though '
who to believe ? while gupta says he was woken up by his girlfriend yelling , the girlfriend told police she was woken up by gupta 's yelling
she says she found him kneeling next to a bleeding waugh and he told her to call police
above , a picture of waugh defense ? while being questioned by police , gupta admitted that he made a mistake but also said that waugh tried to kill him gupta 's attorneys argue the reason he was covered in blood was because he had been performing cpr on his friend
defense attorney philip armstrong told the court that taylor gould , who is now a biomedical engineer in washington , had got blood on the red dress she was wearing and then changed her clothes before the police arrived
he asked taylor gould why one of her contact lenses was found stuck to the back of waugh âs pants
waugh had graduated magna cum laude from james madison university in may 2012 , and went on to spend the following year in daegu , south korea teaching debate
waugh had started his first year of law school at georgetown , and was inducted into the phi beta kappa honors society
gupta had a similarly bright future
he earned his undergraduate degree from george washington university and was back at the school studying to become a doctor
he also earned a master 's degree in physiology from georgetown
fellow langley high school - alumnus barton spoke about both men in the breeze - james madison university 's student newspaper
he remembers both men for being extremely intelligent in their respective fields , waugh in liberal arts and gupta with science and math. ' it 's very shocking when something like this happens when you know each person involved , ' barton told the breeze
' you think that - how can people you think to be rational have something like this take place
you just hope that the situation could have de-escalated ' .
