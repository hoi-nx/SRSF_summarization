ireland narrowly missed out on reaching the quarter - finals of the icc as they fell to a seven - wicket loss against pakistan
porterfield had earlier struck his maiden icc century and ireland were indebted to their captain as his 107 helped them post a modest 237 all out
however , the 30 - year - old was outshone by sarfraz ahmed , whose unbeaten 101 led pakistan through to the next stage of competition on net run - rate

pakistan however , were on the end of heavy defeats against bitter rivals india and the west indies and were facing increasing scrutiny over whether they were going to be able to seriously contend at this icc
but with the competition geared towards ensuring the â top - eight â teams make it through to the knockout stages of the competition , all the sides knew even as little three wins could see a team advance
in hindsight the turning point in the tournament for ireland came against south africa , against whom they suffered a mammoth 201 - run loss
the match obliterated their net run - rate

a shock 29 - run ( d / l ) victory over south africa ensured the match against ireland would be a straight knockout , after the west indies guaranteed their safe passage to the quarter - finals with an easy victory against the uae earlier in the day
porterfield decided having runs on the board would be his side âs best chance of victory against the 1992 icc champions , having won the toss

but ireland âs innings centered around their captain who , in what may well be ireland âs final icc match , played some of his best cricket of the tournament as he made his hundred
as many batsmen do , poterfield rode his luck â including being dropped on 99 by keeper sarfraz ahmed and he scurried through for his century
it took an impressive catch from afridi to finally dismiss the irish captain for 107 off the economical sohail khan
the equation for pakistan was simple , win or tie against ireland and they would be through and sarfraz ahmed and shehzad âs 120 - run first wicket partnership took them a large way towards their target
though shehzad ( 63 ) and haris sohail ( 3 ) fell in quick succession , misbah steadied the ship and while the pakistan captain ended up being dismissed in the most peculiar way - as he stood so far back to an alex cusack delivery that he tread on his stumps , pakistan never looked in trouble

had ireland amassed a few more runs that dangerous strategy could have led a more serious issue for pakistan
ireland may be returning home earlier then they has hoped at the beginning of the day but they will at least be able to do so in the knowledge that they defeated more test playing nations than england
it âs unlikely to be of much comfort to the associate side with their future in the competition unknown but ireland along with the other associate sides â scotland , afghanistan and the uae â showed in the past four weeks that the icc will truly miss them if the icc has its way
