saudi arabia blogger raif badawi has spoken for the first time since being jailed and sentenced to 1,000 lashes to say it was ' miraculous ' that he had survived the first 50
raif badawi was arrested in 2012 for offences including insulting islam , cyber crime and disobeying his father ( a crime in saudi arabia )
last year , the father - of - three was sentenced to 10 years in jail , a fine of 1 million riyals ( $ 266,000 )
his punishment also meant he would be flogged 50 times every friday for 20 weeks - but after the first beating in january this year , these have been postponed each week on medical grounds
raif badawi recalled how he received the first round of lashes in jeddah on january while surrounded by a cheering crowd that chanted ' allahu akbar ' ( god is the greatest ) , der spiegel reported
in a letter which the magazine said was his first since being jailed , raif badawi said : ' all this cruel suffering happened to me only because i expressed my opinion
' his wife ensaf haidar said her husband is in ' a poor condition ' , adding he had suffered from high blood pressure and was mentally very stressed
raif badawi said a cheering crowd chanted ' allahu akbar ' during his first flogging session
pictured : leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone showed the beating in january raif badawi 's remarks form the preface of a book entitled ' 1,000 lashes : why i say what i think ' , which is due to be published in germany on april 1
der spiegel said the germany government had warned against the book 's publication because it could put the blogger 's life at risk , though berlin and the publisher have denied this
a germany diplomat told reuters that raif badawi was free to publish in germany whatever he liked , but added : ' the ministry can not predict the consequences of such a publication for him
' publisher siv bublitz from ullstein buchverlage said that the company had ' confidential contacts ' with the germany government on the badawi book project
' at no time have we felt that the exchange was an attempt by the foreign ministry to prevent our publication or to complicate it , ' he said on friday
in another statement issued today , the publisher added raif badawi had dictated his remarks to his wife on the phone and that the preface therefore should not be called a letter , as described in earlier statements
the father - of - three ( pictured with his children ) was sentenced to 10 years in jail and weekly floggings last year human rights groups and several western governments have called on riyadh to cancel the sentence of 1,000 lashes
germany 's economy minister and vice chancellor sigmar gabriel said during a visit to riyadh this month that he had discussed human rights issues in saudi arabia and had suggested a pardon for raif badawi
raif badawi 's floggings were paused after doctors ruled his scars had not healed sufficiently after his first beating for him to face another round , but the government has so far failed to come up with a long term solution
but earlier this month , it was revealed that he may now face the death penalty after his wife revealed the country 's criminal courts want him to face a retrial for apostasy .
