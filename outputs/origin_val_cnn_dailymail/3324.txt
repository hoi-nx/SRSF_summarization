sportsmail tells you everything you need to know about the hoffenheim forward
roberto firmino celebrates scoring a late winner for his hoffenheim side against eintracht frankfurt roberto firmino scored the winning goal for brazil in just his second international game against austria last year a skillful dribbler - in the past two seasons only lionel messi and eden hazard have embarked on more succesful dribbles in europe 's top leagues - and with all the tricks and flicks you might expect from a brazilian international forward , firmino is an attacking midfielder with an eye for goal
he is not an out and out goalscorer , as his record of 6 goals in 25 bundesliga games this season shows , but firmino is a capable finisher when the chance arises
last season 's tally of 16 goals for hoffenheim earned him his first brazil call - up early this term , and he announced himself in the international stage with a stunning 25 yard strike into the top corner to earn the selecao a win against austria in just his second game
the brazilian 's shot from 25 yards flew into the top corner to earn him a first international goal the brazilian shows off his excellent first touch as he keeps the ball away from two stuttgart defenders however , it is not for his goalscoring exploits that louis van gaal will want the 23 - year - old , but his playmaking
roberto firmino loves to pick a pass , sliding through balls into the strikers from his position in behind , and has racked up 18 league assists since the start of last season
to put that number in context , that 's as many as manchester united 's entire midfield against tottenham - juan mata , ander herrera , marouane fellaini , daley blind and michael carrick - have managed in the premier league over the past two seasons
the brazilian is usually deployed behind the central striker , but can operate out wide on the left , where his pace and quick feet allow him to beat a man before picking out team - mates
with neymar , coutinho , oscar and willian in his position , firmino has done well to earn a brazil call - up the playmaker holds off a tackle as he embarks on one of his trademark runs in a recent game as well as running past defenders with the ball he has a knack for making attacking runs from deep without it , posing a threat in behind whether coming from central areas on the wing
and , when stationed wide on the left , firmino has the ability to cut inside and unleash a strike at goal with his favoured right foot , or trouble the full back down the outside with his trickery , causing defenders plenty of problems
it remains to be seen if he is quick enough to be a dynamic no 10 in the premier league , but the performances in germany have earned praise from the likes of bayern sporting director sammer
firmino 's dribbling , goals and assists have made him one of the hottest properties in the bundesliga ' firmino is a great player , ' said sammer this week , although he ruled out the player moving to bayern
but the player , his agent , and hoffenheim have all admitted he could well leave this season , alerting premier league clubs to the possibility of nabbing a star who is undoubtedly one of the bundesliga 's hottest prospects .
