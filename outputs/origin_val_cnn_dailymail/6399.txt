lisa , 42 , was shocked to be told her wheezing and chest pains were due to a bronchial carcinoid tumour for four years , mother - of - three lisa went back and forth to her gp , complaining of wheeziness and occasional sharp pains in her shoulder and chest
sometimes , she felt as though she was struggling to breathe , or that she was coming down with the flu
yet she was ' just pooh - poohed ' by doctors , says lisa , 42 , who lives in essex with her husband and has three children , aged 22 , 13 and eight
she was not sent for tests , and one doctor even insinuated that it was all in her mind and she was just ' a bit sensitive '
it was after she coughed up blood on holiday in 2004 - and still the doctor told her to wait and see if it got worse - that she decided to use her private medical insurance
lisa , a teaching assistant , saw a specialist , who inserted a tube with a camera into her lungs and found a growth in her airways
she had a grape - sized bronchial carcinoid tumour - the same condition that the bbc 's political editor robinson announced he had this weekend
the news came as a shock
like robinson , lisa , 42 , had never smoked - and no one could explain why she had developed it
she was told the tumour was essentially ' benign ' and that if they removed it surgically , that would be the end of it
so , in may 2005 , she had a section of her top lung cut out
robinson , 51 , followed up the announcement of his cancer with typical good humour : ' timing lousy
prognosis good , ' he quipped
indeed , the prognosis for most people with his form of cancer is very good if the tumour is caught early and surgically removed
bronchial carcinoid tumours are a form of cancer known as neuroendocrine tumours
these form on the endocrine system , a network of glands and cells throughout the body that produces hormones
they can be found elsewhere in the body , mainly the intestines , the pancreas and the appendix - 10 to 20 per cent occur in the lungs
every year , 3,000 people in the uk are diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour
' it is far less aggressive than many other cancers and even people with an advanced form can live for decades - jobs had a pancreatic form and lived for a long time with it , ' says pearce , a surgeon who leads the team treating neuroendocrine tumours at university hospital , southampton
jobs , the apple boss , was diagnosed in 2003 and died in 2011
the news came as a shock for both bbc journalist robinson ( pictured ) and lisa - as neither of them had ever smoked the difference between typical lung cancer and bronchial carcinoid is that the former occurs within the main cells of the lung ; bronchoid carcinoids occur in the neuroendocrine cells dotted around the lining of the main airways
wherever a neuro - endocrine tumour develops , it can begin to produce hormones - and 30 per cent do so , resulting in a range of symptoms
the type of hormone produced varies significantly , but tumours in the lungs tend to produce either acth , which regulates production of the stress hormone cortisol , or serotonin , which can affect gut function , mood and the dilation of blood vessels
if tumours produce serotonin , this causes flushing , diarrhoea and wheezing
but these vague symptoms can make a neuroendocrine tumour more difficult to diagnose and , often , they are only picked up by chance , says catherine bouvier of the net patient foundation
' in around 20 per cent of cases , they are detected either at a&e , as the patient has become very ill , or by chance when they go for a routine health check , ' she says
diagnosis is made more difficult by the fact that non-smokers often do n't think that they can get lung cancer
' we do n't actually know what causes it - it is a total mystery , but it does not seem to be associated with smoking , ' says mr pearce
in fact , while smoking is by far the most common cause of the 43,000 cases of lung cancer each year , 14 per cent of people who develop it will not be smokers
lisa says her future is now uncertain and she is worried about her children the type of lung cancer most heavily linked to smoking is squamous cell , yet even this can affect non-smokers
' what we think happens with lung cancer is that smoking irritates the airways and this causes the cells there to change , ' says professor keith prowse , honorary medical director of the british lung foundation
' in cases where people have not even had this connection with cigarette smoke , there is a suggestion that it may be linked to atmospheric pollution
' some may also be genetically more prone to lung cancer
almost all lung cancers cause similar symptoms
' patients get infection - type symptoms , such as a cough , coughing up blood or wheezing
the difficulty is , some of these symptoms also occur with other conditions , such as asthma , ' says professor prowse
the lung is also a large organ - lay it out flat and it is as big as a tennis court
getting a diagnosis relies on taking a biopsy from the right part
the good news is that for 70 per cent of those who are diagnosed with a bronchial carcinoid , the condition can be ' cured ' simply by removing it surgically , says professor prowse
and here in the uk , we have more centres of excellence for treating this than anywhere in europe , says mr pearce
' however , not every patient with a neuroendocrine tumour gets seen by a specialist in one of these centres , ' he adds
lisa is one of the unlucky ones
after her surgery in 2005 , she was discharged without any follow - up scans or investigations
she thought the experience was behind her and , the next year , went on to have another baby
then , in 2010 , she began to feel unwell
she could n't quite put her finger on it - she had a bit of an upset stomach from time to time , daily acid indigestion , the odd palpitation and flushing
she also had pains in her chest
lisa now knows this was caused by another tumour on her lung , pumping out hormones
when she initially went to her gp , she was told to cut out alcohol and given omeprazole , a drug to reduce her stomach acid
but eventually , in july 2012 , she was sent for a scan
it revealed that the cancer had returned to the same lung
' suddenly , doctors started using the word cancer for the first time - i had no idea that was what i had , which came as a major shock to say the least , ' says lisa
the tumour is between two major blood vessels , and she has been told it is inoperable
the problem is that , aside from surgery , there is no cure for this cancer - as it is a slow - growing form of the disease , it does not respond to conventional chemotherapy , which targets cells with a rapid turnover
proportion of lung cancer cases linked to inadequate intake of fruit and veg but there are drugs that can stop the tumour getting bigger , and nuclear medicine treatments , using radioactivity to target receptors on the tumour cells
initially , lisa was given hormone injections , called lanreotide , which she had to self - administer once a month
' at first , it was great as it stopped my other symptoms such as an upset stomach
i was told that the cancer was stable , but i felt as if i had a ticking time - bomb inside me and dreaded going to my scans
' a recent scan showed her tumour had started to increase , and she now needs further follow - up scans to look at it in more detail
people often wrongly refer to this cancer as benign , says mr pearce
' they say : " good news , it 's a benign tumour " , then a few years later : " bad news , it 's spread "
' the cells can look benign down a microscope and that 's why you need to see a specialist , because they will know how these really do behave - and they do spread , in 30 to 40 per cent of cases
' lisa is very angry that neuroendocrine cancer is portrayed as almost ' harmless ' and that while specialists say anyone with an endocrine tumour should be followed up , she was not - she has also been in touch with others like her who have not been followed up , either
lisa says : ' it 's unfair
i brought another child into the world after my operation , thinking that i would be fine
' no one can tell me what the future holds , but i know this - if you have a neuroendocrine cancer , make sure you get followed up
' it might be a slow growing , easy - to - treat cancer for most people - but not for all
