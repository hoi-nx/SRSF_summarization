heart disease kills one in every six men and one in every 10 women in the uk do nât put it off because you ca nât see it
take a moment to consider your heart - the most precious of muscles
cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people in 2012 - that 's 30 per cent of all deaths
that âs enough to send your heart rate rocketing to a dangerous level â but the good news is there 's a lot you can do to keep healthy
when it comes to keeping your heart in tip - top condition , there are some factors such as genetics that you ca nât change
if you have a family history of heart disease , then you are at increased risk yourself
however , there is plenty you can do to decrease your risk whether you have a family tendency or not
here are some simple changes you can start making today to reduce your risk of heart problems in the future ... ditch the fat - free diet you have probably been advised to cut out saturated fats and replace butter with unsaturated fat spreads
this is because a diet high in saturated fats is thought to be one factor that leads to high levels of bad cholesterol in the blood ... which in turn may cause narrowing of the arteries and heart attacks
however , there is now some controversy as to whether these dietary changes make much difference to your risk of heart disease
a recent overview of multiple studies found no evidence that restricting saturated fat and increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption lowered the risk of developing heart disease
the jury is still out on this one , and it should nât be used as an excuse to eat high fat doughnuts , pastries , chips and other sources of processed , saturated fat
however , butter , cheese and cream in small quantities may not be the complete villains they were thought to be
much - maligned butter may not be the dietary villain we once thought , says dr sally norton know your waist - to - hip ratio the association between heart disease and being overweight is extremely strong
not least because obesity puts you at risk of type 2 diabetes which , in itself , increases the risk of heart disease and multiple other conditions
if you carry more weight around your waist than your hips you are even more at risk
to calculate your waist to hip ratio , divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement
a high ratio ( over 0.85 for women or one for men ) means increased risk of health problems such as heart attacks , high blood pressure or diabetes â¦ even if you are nât that overweight
dr sally norton reveals her top tips to help people keep their hearts healthy
she notes the association between heart disease and being overweight is ' extremely strong ' , urging people to watch their waistlines realise it 's never too late to get active do nât despair if you are a couch potato â it âs never too late to start
as well as helping with that weight loss , a recent study showed that you could get the same heart health benefits if starting exercise such as running or cycling after 40 , as you would have done if you had started before the age of 30
there are numerous other benefits from exercise too â¦ what are you waiting for ? say bye bye to the bacon and processed meat , to boost your heart health , dr norton advisesbut but say bye-bye to bacon ... reducing the amount of red meat is recommended as studies have shown that eating a large amount can increase heart failure by up to 24 per cent
however , recent evidence suggests that this is linked more to red meat that is processed ( we âre talking ham , salami , sausages , bacon etc ) â with no definite association shown with the consumption of unprocessed red meat
the researchers calculated that for each 50g of processed meat eaten per day ( about one or two extra slices of ham ) the risk of heart failure increased by eight per cent and the risk of death by 38 per cent
these results require confirmation with further studies but as processing can increase the risk of stomach disease too , it seems sensible to limit processed red meat wherever possible
... and cut back on salt the british heart foundation is clear that too much salt can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease later in life
adults should have less than 6 grams ( 1 teaspoon ) a day
cutting back on salt does nât just mean keeping your hands away from the salt cellar when you are eating â¦ there is also a lot of hidden salt in processed food
check the labels and cook from scratch wherever possible â then you are in control
say no to sugar a large population study in the us showed that people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease
that was compared with those people who consumed less than 10 per cent of their calories each day through sugar , independent of other risk factors including weight
more and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic too , and as it offers no nutrients whatsoever
it is time to cut back
gradually reduce the sugar you add to your food or drinks , avoid fizzy drinks and look carefully at labels â you will be amazed at how much sugar is added to all sorts of food , both sweet and savoury
a large study in the us revealed people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease stress less while you should be aware of keeping your heart healthy , do nât let it stress you out - as stress does nât help your heart either
the stress hormone â cortisol â can increase unhealthy fat around the middle , raising your risk of heart problems , as well as leading to cravings for high fat and sugar foods , which only make things worse
bin the fags the obvious one is to stop smoking
smokers die 10 years earlier than non-smokers as shown in a study of one million uk women published last year
if you can stop smoking before you are 40 , you are 10 times less likely to have health problems than if you continue
as well as benefiting your heart , you will see rapid improvements in your breathing , mood and reduce your risk of stroke , diabetes , cancer , circulation problems and numerous other problems
so , for a healthy and happy heart , start making a few small changes today â your heart will love you forever
