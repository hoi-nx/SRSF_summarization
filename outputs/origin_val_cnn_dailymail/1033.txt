apple has finally been accepted to join america âs oldest and most prestigious stock index , the dow jones industrial average
the company - worth more than $ 700 billion - will replace telecom giant at&t on the list with the switch taking effect after trading closes on wednesday , march 18
there are only 30 companies listed on the dow jones - a price - weighted average of the biggest stocks - but for a long time apple was excluded from the pile because its stock price was too high and there was worry it would distort the balance
apple has finally been accepted to join america âs oldest and most prestigious stock index , the dow jones industrial average however , following apple 's big stock split last summer , this is no longer a problem
the company increased the number of shares it had to reduce the unit price from around $ 645 to $ 91
currently the price rests around $ 130
with apple 's entry at&t will leave the dow jones
david blitzer , managing director and chairman of the index committee at s&p dow jones indices , said there was no need to have two big telecom companies in the equation
verizon , which has a bigger stock price and larger market value , is in the dow jones too
it will step in to lead the sector
with apple 's entry at&t will leave the dow jones with verizon representing the telecoms sector instead the last big shake - up of the 119 - year old dow jones came in september , 2013 when goldman sachs , nike and visa knocked out alcoa , bank of america and hewlett-packard
with news of the upcoming changes , apple 's stock rose $ 2.55 , or two per cent , to $ 128.99 in early trading on friday
at&t sank 46 cents , or 1.4 per cent , to $ 33.54
apple holds a market capitalization of about $ 736 billion , making it the largest publicly traded company in the world
at&t , by contrast , has a market value of $ 176.5 billion .
