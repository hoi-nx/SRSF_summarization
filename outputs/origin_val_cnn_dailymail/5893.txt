' team manager mick kearney admitted british and irish lions sexton and heaslip are both ' extremely eager ' to face wales this weekend
ireland are gunning to retain the six nations title for the first time since 1949 , and also claim a second grand slam in six years
johnny sexton limped out of the latter stages of ireland 's 19 - 9 victory over england in dublin on march 1 and has been battling to recover ever since
the 29 - year - old has a history of hamstring problems , but mick kearney does not expect that to colour his recovery
heaslip is expected to train fully this week and barring any setback will be available for selection ' from what i remember the last time he had a problem was between the australia game and new zealand game , in the november series just over 12 months ago , ' said mick kearney
' he actually recovered pretty quickly then
' he came off at half - time against australia and was fit to play and played the whole game , or most of the game against new zealand without any issue
' that certainly would n't be a worry at the moment
' heaslip ( heaslip ) has n't taken any contact yet
he will train fully today and provided there is no reaction he should be available for selection
' they are extremely eager , absolutely : very eager to play

ireland must win in wales and scotland to secure the grand slam and retain their six nations title - but , barring injury , will do so without veteran centre gordon
the 35 - year - old leinster centre has been omitted from schmidt 's training squad , with ulster 's darren cave and munster 's keith earls providing midfield cover
team manager mick kearney refused to accept gordon 's absence could spark the end of his glittering 81 - cap test career however
his long - term centre sparring partner brian o'driscoll retired last summer , but gordon himself has always been determined to push on to this year 's world cup
' that is a selection issue , yes , ' said mick kearney of gordon 's absence
' gordon has been an unbelievable servant for irish rugby
' he 's back fit , back playing for leinster , so certainly i would n't rule him out for future consideration
' both teams must give consent for saturday 's millennium stadium match to be played under a closed roof
team manager mick kearney said ireland will delay their decision until later in the week , and base it around the chances of rain
' we are waiting to see what the weather forecast turns out like , ' said mick kearney
' we do n't have to make a decision on that until 7pm on thursday
' we will wait until then before we make a final decision
' i think overall , our preference would be for a dry day and decent weather , rather than wet and miserable weather
' in good weather our preference would be for it to be open
