speaking at a court in colchester yesterday , judge advocate peters gave her a two - year suspended sentence and warned her to ' stay away from young boys '
caroline salisbury , who was 25 at the time , began having sex sessions in her living room with the boy a week after his 14th birthday in 2013 , the service civilian court was told
spared : caroline salisbury ( pictured ) - who lured the boy into her bed after meeting him on a school bus - was given a two year suspended sentence they met when she became a bus monitor escorting children of soldiers based in a british garrison in germany to school
colonel jones , prosecuting , told the court : ' she invited him to her house and the relationship developed from just being friends into what became a sexual relationship
' she would send him facebook messages when her husband , david , a corporal in the royal engineers , was out , so he could visit her married quarters for drink and sex
in one message she told the boy : ' come at four
he wo n't be in
i can not wait for you to f * * * me again
' col jones said : ' she had two accounts on facebook to communicate with him
it was not just about meeting up
declarations of love were made on both sides
' he added : ' because he was spending so much time with her his mother became suspicious
a friend of his mother visited her and showed her messages from salisbury which suggested a sexual relationship between her and the boy
' his parents alerted the military police and when they knocked on her door , the boy fled over the garden fence
despite twice being warned by the police not to meet him , caroline salisbury continued the affair
then , when his parents were having a barbecue , the boy did not attend and was not answering his mobile phone
his brothers went to caroline salisbury 's home and began banging on the door because they knew he was inside
neighbours called the police and the boy fled once more
col jones said : ' the boy later confessed to his father he had been in a sexual relationship with her and she was arrested
' sneaky : caroline salisbury would send the boy facebook messages when her husband , david , a corporal in the royal engineers , was out ( file photo of british soldiers abroad ) caroline salisbury told a neighbour she had been raped by him
but in an interview with the military police she admitted twice having sex with him saying he had forced himself on her , but did not say rape
col jones added : ' he was very upset at the end of it
he was totally besotted with her
' defence barrister glenser told the court that caroline salisbury was ' starved of affection ' by her husband who has since left the army and is working in saudi arabia
' it was for this reason she sought the company of people younger than herself , ' he said
' in the last week he has indicated that he is sorry for the way he has treated her and that he should have been more supportive of her
' mrs caroline salisbury , from suffolk , wiped tears away as mr glenser told the court : ' this is a shaming occasion for her
she desperately regrets what has happened
' judge peters told his wife : ' this was a boy who was a child of just 14 and to suggest he pressed himself upon you is revolting
' that is utterly criminal
the police warned you off and you carried on
young boys have to be kept safe and not be groomed and taken back to your house when your husband was away
' you were looking for love
you are a damaged woman
i am going to take an exceptional course â you have come within a hair 's breadth of going to prison for a long time
' i pass this suspended sentence with a heavy heart
you need to stay away from young boys
' caroline salisbury was placed on the sex offenders ' register for ten years and banned from having any boy aged under 16 in her home without parental consent .
