and then there were none
english football âs worst european campaign in more than 20 years is now complete
appropriately , given what went before , it ended with a humiliation
it had been a theme of the season for everton to provide hope in europe after poor champions league results but not this time
things spectacularly unravelled against dynamo and roberto martinez looked haunted as the reality of this 5 - 2 slaying sank in
yes , dynamo were superb but they were assisted by abominable defending
roberto martinez had complained a punishing fixture list is compromising the ambitions of premier league teams but fatigue had nothing to do with this night of high farce
dynamo players celebrate during a rampant display which saw the ukraine league leaders ease into the quarter - finals yarmolenko lets fly with a stunning strike to give the hosts the lead on the night teodorczyk celebrates after scoring kiev 's second on a disastrous night for everton in europe veloso hit the third to give dynamo the lead on aggregate which they never looked like relinquishing gusev followed his goal at goodison park with another against everton as the hosts heaped the woe on the toffeemen antunes completed dynamo 's scoring with a beauty from the portuguese defender to knock the stuffing out of everton lukaku gave his side hope but his equaliser proved to be a false dawn for everton , who subsequently conceded four dynamo ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : shovkovskiy 6 : silva 7 , khacherdi 7 , dragovic 7 , antunes 7 : rybalka 7 , veloso 7.5 : yarmolenko 8.5 , sydorchuk 6.5 ( buyalskiy 64 , 7 ) , gusev 7.5 ( kalitvinstev 90 ) : teodorczyk 7.5 ( kravets 74 , 6 ) subs not used : rybka , garmash , kravets , burda , buyalskiy , mbokani booked : rybalka , dragovic , antunes , goals : yarmolenko 21 , teodorczyk 35 , veloso 37 , gusev 56 , antunes 76 everton ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : howard 6 : seamus coleman 4.5 , phil jagielka 5.5 , antolin alcaraz 4 , leighton baines 5.5 : barry 5 , mccarthy 5 ( besic 78 ) : christian atsu 4 ( leon osman 65 , 6 ) , steven naismith 5 ( arouna kone 65 , 4 ) , ross barkley 5 : lukaku 6 subs not used : robles , gibson , stones , garbutt
booked : besic , leon osman , arouna kone goals : lukaku 29 , phil jagielka 82 motm : andrei yarmolenko attendance : 67,550 referee : deniz aytekin ( germany ) everton conceded five times and were fortunate not to ship another three or four , as dynamo ruthlessly exposed their naivety
as a result , there will be no english representation in a european quarter - final for the first time since 1992/93
to stand any hope of progressing , it was imperative for everton to take the sting out of the contest early on and , more importantly , quieten an excitable home crowd that had whipped themselves into a frenzy long before kick - off
instead , they performed like complete novices
they looked shaky from the first moment on a bare and bobbly pitch , with some players anonymous and others not up to the task
they needed to be tight and compact but they were open and exposed , inviting the hosts on to them
eventually , dynamo took advantage
andrei yarmolenko had made an impression on everton âs players with his style and grace in the first leg and he opened the scoring with a quite brilliant goal , bending in a 25 - yard drive that flashed past howard
the execution of the strike was magnificent but , on the touchline , roberto martinez stood aghast
why , the manager must have been wondering , was a player of his yarmolenko âs quality allowed to run 20 yards without anyone making a tackle ? it was the moment that sparked the game to life and for 10 minutes , the two teams began trading blows like boxers going through the gears
ross barkley hit the post ; dynamo responded with yarmolenko testing howard
everton roared back and had rattled the hosts with a brilliant effort from lukaku , the belgian scoring the 100th goal of his career with a bending left - footed effort from the edge of the area after seizing on a loose ball
it should have given them a platform from which to build
not a bit of it
dynamo went through the gears and ripped into everton with a spell that left roberto martinez and his players bewildered and broken
so bad was everton âs play , you sensed dynamo could score every time they got within shooting distance
teodorczyk made the aggregate all square in the 34th minute , nipping in front of antolin alcaraz to smash past the stranded howard
as he wheeled away gleefully , followed by his ecstatic team - mates , a number of everton heads started to drop
this was the key moment
yarmolenko 's sensational strike lit the touchpaper on a seven - goal game
find out more from match zone howard can only reflect on what might have been after conceding five goals on a dreadful day for the visitors a disconsolate everton attempt to come to terms with the glut of goals they conceded , but were made to play for defensive errors leon osman goes down after a strong challenge as the everton stalwart battled for possession in vain the scoreboard tells its own story as everton were outclassed by the wily ukraine , who used all their experience to advance ross barkley , who hit the woodwork twice , applauds the travelling everton fans after the end of their european adventure dynamo keeper oleksandr shovkovskiy celebrates their first goal as his side head to the last eight with the wind in their sails dynamo fans were in good voice as their side progressed in no small part thanks to a partisan atmosphere at the olympic stadium ukraine president petro poroshenko reacts after antunes ' strike as the ukraine champions marched into the last eight for the first time since the premier league 's inaugural season there is no english club in a european quarter - final
here 's how each fared
liverpool , ( february 26 , europa league last 32 ) : after finishing third in their champions league group , the reds were knocked out by besiktas on penalties
tottenham ( february 26 , europa league last 32 ) : knocked out by fiorentina after a 2 - 0 defeat in the second leg
chelsea ( march 11 , champions league last 16 ) : came a cropper against 10 - man paris saint-germain in extra time
arsenal ( march 17 , champions league last 16 ) : knocked out on the away goals rule despite a 2 - 0 win in monaco
manchester city ( march 18 , champions league last 16 ) : english champions beaten home and away by barcelona
everton ( march 19 , europa league last 32 ) : thumped 5 - 2 by kiev in ukraine
sensing they could kill the contest , dynamo swarmed forward and in the next attack , they scored again
this time veloso profited from another defensive mix - up , his shot taking a slight deflection off seamus coleman on its way past howard
for a club that has a chant about how they will â fight , fight , fight with all their might â for the royal blue jersey , the way in which everton collapsed was staggering
they lost their shape and lost their heart and were fortunate not to concede a fourth before the interval
how had it come to this ? half - time should have given roberto martinez a chance to unscramble the senses , to make changes and give everton clarity but , for some reason , he chose not to make any substitutions and dynamo simply re-emerged to pin them back on the ropes
this pummelling was not about to stop
dynamo made sure of a place in the last eight in the 56th minute when gusev converted from close range but , again , there were more shambolic errors
belatedly , roberto martinez called for replacements , leon osman and arouna kone coming on for steven naismith and christian atsu , but by then it was too late
dynamo were swaggering and about to crown their display in spectacular fashion
antunes delivered it , unleashing a 35 - yard missile with his left foot that arrowed past the helpless howard
the execution was breath - taking but , somewhat fittingly , he was given all the time in the world to pick his spot
why were everton going to make a tackle now ? eventually , everton stemmed the tide and scored another of their own , with phil jagielka glancing in a leighton baines corner , but this was no consolation
it should only have reminded everton of the opportunity they had squandered and how careless they had been
at the final whistle , they trudged over apologetically to the fans who had made the long journey from merseyside , the embarrassment finally at end
it was a dreadful way for an adventure that had brought such excitement to conclude
on this evidence , it will be some time before they return .
