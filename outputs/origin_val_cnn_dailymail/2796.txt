after the lord mayor âs show on saturday afternoon in cardiff â where their title hopes will be crushed or resurrected â england will set about further diminishing the value of the old calcutta cup at twickenham
stuart lancaster âs team can not lose
the notion of defeat is unthinkable , in an increasingly downgraded fixture
last year , the red rose raiders left murrayfield with a 20 - 0 victory and the scoreline fairly reflected the poverty of the scots display
if anything , it flattered them
england go through the motions in training as courtney lawes offloads the ball at twickenham tom wood passes the ball as england ran through their moves for the final time before the scotland clash england will be wounded after their defeat to ireland , and are sure to bounce back by beating scotland chris robshaw lifts the calcutta cup aloft after winning it at murrayfield last year stuart lancaster 's men need a win against scotland , and should get it against the wooden spoon candidates since then , cotter has brought kiwi steel and some encouraging results , but saturday 's visitors are bottom of the rbs 6 nations table after three straight defeats â the last at home to italy â and they have not won in south west london for two generations
margaret thatcher was prime minister the last time scotland left twickenham as conquerors , in 1983
since then , they have endured 32 years of failure at the home of their â english â and this does not appear to be the occasion when that dire run is destined to come to an end
andy farrell summed up england âs mood on friday , saying : â i âll be disappointed if we do nât get the performance this week â and with that hopefully we could be able to keep the record going
â so , at the end of a week which began with hogg bemoaning a lack of english â respect â for scots rugby , the lions full - back and his team - mates have a prime opportunity to regain it , by claiming a win which would amount to one of the upsets of the era
they will be desperate to salvage a crumbling campaign but england are also in wounded mode after their beating in dublin , which derailed the slam bandwagon for the umpteenth year
given the vast gulf in playing resources between the two nations , england would have the clout to prevail with three or four entirely different line - ups
james haskell goes for a run with the ball as england prepared for the must - win fixture at twickenham george ford works on his kicking as danny cipriani watches on during the final training session ben youngs throws as pass as england 's forwards look on , ahead of a game they should win easily england could beat scotland with three of four different xvs , and will have more than enough on saturday scotland go through their paces at twickenham on friday - it 's an important game for them to restore pride that is not to denigrate the scots ; it is just a reflection of stark reality
cotter âs side have dropped to 10th in the world rugby rankings , six places behind england who have shifted clear of fifth - placed australia
another defeat for scotland would leave them in danger of being over-taken by japan , while losing further ground on samoa above them
so if lancaster and his squad have any pretensions of mounting a meaningful world cup challenge , this is a fixture with no safety net
they can not lose , because to do so would shatter all hope of going into the tournament with their stadium regarded as a place where visiting teams fear to tread
defeat would wreck the quest to create that fortress - feel at twickenham and would also ensure that england could not rely on telling momentum to propel them into the showpiece event in september and october
it is quite feasible these nations will meet again in a world cup quarter - final at the same venue on october 18
the thought of losing that one would be enough to give lancaster sleepless nights for the next seven months
the last time scotland beat england at twickenham in 1983 , margaret thatcher was still prime minister john beattie celebrates a scotland try , but the calcutta cup has been devalued by england 's dominance since fortunately for the head coach , he has a squad who are driven by a fervent desire to make amends for their loss to ireland , and more than enough trump cards to ensure this is an occasion devoid of tension and a nasty shock at the end
what is crucially absent from the english armoury is an ability to shape their own championship destiny
in the hours before kick - off , they must decide whether to stay true to their pre-match plan involving a black - out of all news from cardiff , where wales can do them an almighty favour by ending ireland âs slam crusade at the penultimate stage
instead of being distracted by a game elsewhere which will all but confirm whether they remain in the title hunt , england will abide by one of their favourite mantras : â control the controllables â
the coaches will expect the returning courtney lawes to galvanise the home pack and shore up the line - out operation , while mike brown âs recall after injury will add nous to the back line
there will be blunt demands for a better start , better discipline , more assurance under the high ball and more collective conviction at the breakdown â with a particular onus on captain chris robshaw in that department
stuart lancaster 's side could face scotland in the world cup quarter - finals , which may worry them more scotland present more of a creative threat than in the recent past , despite the cruel injury to one of their stellar centres , alex dunbar
matt scott is a fine replacement , while hogg can run amok from deep and finn russell is a daring orchestrator at no 10 , alongside the canny greig laidlaw
but none of them can function without the ball
despite the imposing size and abrasive streak of the scots pack , they should be out - gunned up front
if the hosts â set - piece holds sway , which is likely , and billy vunipola can get his side on the front foot , george ford has the tools to unleash an array of predatory outside runners
england must win and they will win
the calcutta cup is no longer the cherished prize that it once was , so retaining it is a minimum requirement .
