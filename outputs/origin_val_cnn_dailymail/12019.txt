animal rights activists were stunned when the parent company of ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus , feld entertainment , announced it would eliminate elephants from its circuses by 2018
the elephants will then be retired to a conservation center in florida
' monumental and long overdue , ' was how the animal welfare institute put it
' startling and tremendously exciting , ' the humane society of the united states said in a statement
and the international fund for animal welfare called it ' a giant step in the right direction
' but activists soon focused on the timing , questioning why it will take three years to phase out the elephants from the traveling circus shows

the ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus said it will phase out its iconic elephant acts by 2018 just days before the announcement , peta ( peta ) prevailed in an open - records request and obtained documents proving that , at least since 2010 , ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis ( tb )
tb is highly transmissible from elephants to humans , even without direct contact
a statement from peta frames ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus âs announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country
' these elephants suffer greatly , but now their retirement is vital to everyone âs safety , ' the statement read
peta says the company 's move to retire its elephants heads off a scandal about the animals having tb while touring as many as one - third of the elephants having tested positive for tuberculosis , and several ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus employees have been treated for the disease ingrid e. newkirk , president of peta , said : ' many of the elephants are painfully arthritic , and many have tuberculosis , so their retirement day needs to come now ' the documents obtained by peta reveal that in 2010 , at least 11 elephants with the circus tested positive for tb , and that elephants used by ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus have had tb since at least 1978
as many as one - third of the elephants having tested positive for the disease , and several ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus employees have been treated for tb
tb carried by an elephant was linked to an outbreak among eight humans at an elephant sanctuary , some of whom had no direct contact with the elephant
peta said the documents also show that ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus consistently opposed efforts by officials to improve testing requirements for tb in elephants
according to former usda attorney kenneth vail , who is now the animal welfare act compliance officer for feld entertainment , tb is ' probably going to be the downfall of feld âs elephants '
ingrid e. newkirk , president of peta , added : ' many of the elephants are painfully arthritic , and many have tuberculosis , so their retirement day needs to come now
' ' if the decision is serious , then the circus needs to do it now
' kenneth feld ( left ) , ceo of feld entertainment , and his daughters , feed elephants at the ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus and center for elephant conservation , in polk city , florida however , executives at feld entertainment , ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus 's parent company , say it will take three years to build proper facilities for them on the 200 - acre plot of land in central florida that 's already being used as an elephant conservation center
they have repeatedly denied that the elephants are mistreated in any way in the circuses
' each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area , ' said stephen payne , feld 's spokesman , adding that permits , drainage issues and other logistics must be worked out
the company intends for the elephants to live out their years on the property , and since one elephant is 69 , they must plan for the long haul to care for the crop of gentle giants
the decision to phase out elephants from the ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus comes at a time when cities across the u.s. are cracking down on exotic animal displays
even before thursday 's announcement that the elephants will be phased out of ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus 's performances by 2018 , company officials already said they were pulling out of certain cities because of newly enacted restrictions
feld executives said the decision to end the circus 's century - old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length
elephants have often been featured on ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus 's posters over the decades
' there 's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers , ' said feld , the company 's executive vice president
' a lot of people are n't comfortable with us touring with our elephants
' feld owns 43 elephants , 29 of which live at the company 's 200 - acre center for elephant conservation in central florida
one elephant is on a breeding loan to the fort worth zoo
thirteen animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018
the company plans to retire its remaining 13 touring elephants to its conservation center in florida in 2018 feld entertainment , ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus 's parent company , say it will take three years to build proper facilities for all thirteen elephants to join the 29 already on site at the 200 - acre plot of land each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area , and permits , drainage issues and other logistics must also be worked out before the elephants can retire to the center another reason for the decision , company president kenneth feld said , was that certain cities and counties have passed ' anti-circus ' and ' anti-elephant ' ordinances
the company 's three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year , and feld said it 's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction
it 's also difficult to plan tours amid constantly changing regulations , he said
carol bradley , who wrote a book about the freeing of an elephant , called the decision ' earth - moving ' and thought the felds would never change their minds ' all of the resources used to fight these things can be put toward the elephants , ' feld said during an interview at the conservation center
' we 're not reacting to our critics ; we 're creating the greatest resource for the preservation of the asian elephant
' carol bradley , the author of the book ' last chain on billie : how one extraordinary elephant escaped the big top , ' which is about a non-ringling circus elephant , said she believes the feld family ' realized it was a losing pr battle
' ' this is an enormous , earth - moving decision , ' she said
' when i heard the news , my jaw hit the floor
i never thought they 'd change their minds about this
' in 2014 , feld entertainment won $ 25.2 million in settlements from a number of animal - rights groups , including the humane society of the united states , ending a 14 - year legal battle over allegations that ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus circus employees mistreated elephants
the initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 by a former ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus barn helper who was later found to have been paid at least $ 190,000 by the animal - rights groups that helped bring the lawsuit
the judge called him ' essentially a paid plaintiff ' who lacked credibility and standing to sue
the judge rejected the abuse claims following a 2009 trial
kenneth feld testified during that trial about elephants ' importance to the show
' the symbol of the ' greatest show on earth ' is the elephant , and that 's what we 've been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years
' when asked by a lawyer whether the show would be the same without the elephants , feld replied , ' no , it would n't
' the circus will continue to use tigers , dogs and goats , and a mongolian troupe of camel stunt riders joined its circus xtreme show this year
the symbol of the ' greatest show on earth ' is the elephant but feld entertainment now admits that the public is no longer comfortable with them touring with elephants , and keeping up with changing regulations is tough the circus business is changing and feld is now investing in more motor sports
in 2010 it created a motorcycle stunt show called nuclear cowboyz ( pictured ) and has acquired a number of other acts more motor sports , daredevils and feats of human physical capabilities will likely be showcased
in 2008 , feld acquired a variety of motor sports properties , including monster truck shows , motocross and the international hot rod association , which promotes drag races and other events
in 2010 , it created a theatrical motorcycle stunt show called nuclear cowboyz
roughly 30 million people attend one of feld 's 5,000 live entertainment shows every year
