it may sound like the plot of a disney movie - but todd the fox really does think he 's a dog
the animal was tamed after being rescued as a four - month - old cub and was raised as a domestic pet by owner emma d'sylva
since then the lovable fox has picked up a number of canine characteristics such as tail wagging , playing with toys and even walking on a lead
he also sleeps in a kennel in his enclosure in the garden , plays energetically with the other dogs and even wags his tail when it 's feeding time
emma d'sylva , 25 , from stanfield , stoke-on-trent , staffordshire , said : ' todd has been captive - bred so he has never been in the wild
' i 've had him since he was about four months old because his previous owners could n't look after him any more
canine customs : todd enjoys going on walks , playing with dog toys and even wags his tail when he 's happy sleeps in a kennel : the 11 - month - old domesticated animal spends his nights in a plastic kennel with blankets ' i get people coming over to me asking if he is a fox and if they can stroke him
' he was a bit crazy when he first came to me last year but now he has a really strong bond with me and he will walk on a lead
' he is very playful with me
he will run up to me wagging his tail when i go to feed him and he will roll over to have his belly tickled
' he will come into the house but he has got a purpose built enclosure and he much prefers being outside
' we got him a little plastic kennel in his enclosure with blankets which is similar to a dog bed
' he is similar to a dog but he is a bit more hyperactive
he gets on with my two dogs , and wants to play with them all the time
playful : the fox , pictured in the park with ms emma d'sylva , can not be let off the lead because he is deaf school visits : ms emma d'sylva has 40 pets and takes some of them , including todd , into schools and care homes so that children and the elderly can interact with them ' he tries to do what the dogs do but i ca n't let him off the lead because he 's deaf so i ca n't shout him to come back
' at first he was bonkers but he is getting more used to being in the company of other people now
' if people or dogs come up to him in the park he will lie down at first and freeze but after a few seconds he will sniff around the dogs or sit patiently
' todd also lives with emma d'sylva 's menagerie of other creatures at her three - bedroomed house including a skunk , a raccoon , lizards and snakes
she takes some of her 40 pets into schools and care homes to enable children and the elderly to interact with a range of captive - bred animals
emma d'sylva , who lives with her partner steve johnson , 34 , added : ' todd went out on his first school visit the other week and the children really enjoyed stroking him while he was in my arms
walking companions : todd is pictured in the woods with ms emma d'sylva 's two labradors sky and oakley ' he 's really getting used to things now and i 'm looking forward to letting more and more people meet him
' an rspca spokesperson said there were no legal restrictions on people keeping animals and pets in england and wales as long as they were treated well
he added : ' foxes have not been domesticated and a fox in captivity would have the same needs as in the wild
' anyone who keeps these animals is under a legal obligation to meet their needs under the animal welfare act 2006
