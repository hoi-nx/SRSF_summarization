warlord kony 's bloodthirsty lord âs resistance army is slaughtering elephants at an unprecedented rate and trading their valuable tusks for bullets
the poaching of elephants in garamba national park in the democratic republic of congo is increasing rapidly , with more than 130 killed in the southern region in less than 12 months
poaching is not uncommon in africa parks , but rangers at garamba national park have made a worrying discovery - the ivory is helping fund the lord âs resistance army 's war
speaking to mailonline , he said : ' it is very concerning the lord âs resistance army are selling tusks to fund their operations
' the elephant population in the central african republic parks and garamba national park could be entirely decimated if the problem continues
in garamba national park there are still elephants but poaching really has been on the rise
' mr lezhnev , who returned from the democratic republic of congo last week , has learned that a single elephant tusk can be traded for 18,000 bullets
' they do n't need guns , they have plenty of available guns , it 's really bullets they need , ' he added
' it takes only one bullet to kill an elephant
' the lord âs resistance army - a violent rebel group led by kony - is renowned for being one of the most brutal forces in the world
' worrying ' : ' the elephant population in the central african republic parks and garamba national park could be entirely decimated if the problem continues , ' said lezhnev , associate director of policy at the enough project

the lord âs resistance army first emerged in northern uganda in 1986 , where it claimed to fight in the name of the acholi ethnic group against the government of uganda president yoweri museveni
over the years , the lord âs resistance army has moved across the porous borders of the region : it shifted from uganda to sow terror in southern sudan before moving to northeastern democratic republic of congo , and finally crossing into southeastern central african republic in march 2008
combining religious mysticism with an astute guerrilla mind and bloodthirsty ruthlessness , leader kony has turned scores of young girls into his personal sex - slaves while claiming to be fighting to impose the bible 's ten commandments
as well as the rebel group , a recent report by the enough project revealed renegade elements of the democratic republic of congo national army and armed poachers from sudan are responsible for the recent upsurge in poaching
in the past , poachers have used very basic methods to slaughter the elephants , killing just one or two at a time
now , heavily armed groups are using professional techniques and are bringing down three to eight of these majestic animals at a time
their tusks are then cut off with chainsaws
there is also evidence of at least nine of the 131 elephants killed in garamba national park in the past 12 months being shot from helicopters
in may last year , ten elephants were murdered in one day alone in garamba national park , according to african parks , a conservation group that manages the park with democratic republic of congo authorities
at virunga national park , also in the democratic republic of congo , the elephant population has decreased by 90 per cent in the last twenty years , according to unesco
garamba national park in the north eastern corner of the democratic republic of congo is one of the oldest national parks in africa spotted : a group of suspected lord âs resistance army fighters escort captives carrying supplies in garamba national park high price : on the black market in asia , elephants tusks are valued at between Â£ 13,300 and Â£ 117,000 depending on their size
these tusks have been seized from poachers the elephant tusks are helping fund murder , mutilation , rape , widespread abductions of children and adults , sexual slavery
park rangers display tusks recovered in the park mr lezhnev stressed that rangers at the national park are working hard to prevent poaching , but they need more help
tracking poachers through the 3,000 sq - mile park is not only daunting , but dangerous , and rangers have been involved in deadly gun battles
' a lot of the north region is not patrolled very well , ' mr lezhnev said
' the rangers are active but are severely under capacitated
' to solve this problem , first of all the park rangers need significantly increased assistance
they have reported a pretty dramatic rise in poaching over the last decade
' killings : elephant numbers in the national park have fallen dramatically to about 2,400 from approximately 20,000 , largely due to poaching the lord âs resistance army - a violent rebel group led by warlord kony ( right ) - is renowned for being one of the most brutal forces in the world one of the reasons for the increase in elephant poaching is likely to be the rise in the price of ivory , which is at a record high because of demand in parts of asia , according to the enough project
on the black market , elephants tusks are valued at between Â£ 13,300 and Â£ 117,000 depending on their size
since the 1980s , the garamba national park elephant population has fallen to about 2,400 from approximately 20,000 , largely due to poaching
mr lezhnev added : ' if not enough action is taken , we could see the entire elephant population eliminated from these regions in the next 10 years
' help needed : rangers ( pictured ) at garamba national park are active , but need more help to tackle the problem , mr lezhnev said aerial shot of garamba national park , where elephants are being slaughtered by kony 's lord âs resistance army
