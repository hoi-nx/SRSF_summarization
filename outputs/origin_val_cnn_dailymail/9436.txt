a fed up father left his entire Â£ 2million estate to his two daughters â because his two sons refused to stop smoking
businessman van vuuren , 87 , who had suffered from cancer , warned his sons daniel , 60 , and marius , 55 , that unless they quit the habit they would not get a penny from him
marius said : ' my brother had told me what our father said but we thought it was a joke
we did n't take it seriously
' two sons have been disinherited for not giving up smoking when their father told them to do so in his will the two contested the will , saying that their father , from pretoria , south africa , had only written it as a warning , but had then died suddenly , leaving it the only signed will in his possession
the children only discovered the will , which was handwritten on a piece of paper , after their father 's death last year
at the high court in pretoria , daniel said he and his brother spoke about this prior to their father 's death , but they laughed about it as they thought it was funny he said : ' the truth is my father did admonish me on many occasions during his life that he would disinherit me if i did not stop smoking
' i never took his threat seriously and i was shocked when it appeared that he actually carried out his threat
' the brothers claimed it was then implemented by lawyers against their father 's wishes
however , it was ruled by judge pretorius to be mr van vuuren 's true will
judge pretorius said it was clear no other testament could be found , except for this paper
van vuuren 's secretary signed it as a witness , as required by law
she had worked for him for 18 years and confirmed his signature was genuine .
