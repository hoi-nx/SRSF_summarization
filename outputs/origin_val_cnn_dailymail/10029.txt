grayson perry 's unusual house holiday home has been branded an ' abomination ' by local villagers inundated with art fans flocking to see the property
the turner prize - winning artist teamed up with the organisation living architecture to design the unique holiday cottage in the sleepy village of wrabness
but locals - who battled the original plans - claim art fans flocking to catch a glimpse of the artist 's creation are clogging up the narrow streets
but the local council has already been forced to redesign surrounding roads and car parks to accommodate the influx of art fans
one frustrated villager , who refused to be named , said : ' this is a tiny village known for its tranquillity
' we 're not a snotty london art gallery , yet our tiny roads are now besieged on a daily basis by day trippers asking for directions to the dreaded ' house '
' i can only imagine how bad it will be in the summer
' i still do not understand how this abomination got planning permission in the first place ? ' wrabness parish council strongly objected to the proposal to knock down the existing farmhouse and replace it with the imposing structure that combines sculptures , tapestries and ceramics
villagers in wrabness have said that grayson perry 's ' gingerbread house ' has caused traffic chaos the turner prize - winning artist is known primarily for his work with ceramics , and right , the house in honour to a mythical essex woman called ' julie ' the original plans for the home were turned down by tendring district council but a re-submitted application for the wacky home was given the green - light by planners
the finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins , old - style tapes , hearts and the word ' julie '
grayson perry admitted he had originally designed the house whilst â doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the television â
the house is located on the banks of the river stour , in the rural village of wrabness he wanted it to resemble a â jewel box â that told the story of a mythical essex woman called julie , who had a difficult childhood , love life , divorce and late career
hence , there âs an 8ft statue of her on the roof , naked and pregnant , and her name is emblazoned all over the walls
essex county council highways authority have now agreed to redesign tiny local roads to improve access to the site
talks are also ongoing to use the nearby wrabness railway station as a car park for art enthusiasts
the cottage - officially named ' a house for essex ' - is set to open to holidaymakers in the next few months an essex highways spokesman said : ' following a meeting , it was agreed to implement a number of requests for road improvements in black boy lane , wrabness
' these include a variety of new and replacement road signs and renewed and repositioned road markings
' cllrs bass and johnson also agreed to write to ncp and national rail to encourage them to discuss parking issues with the parish council
