classical music can help slow down the onset of dementia , new research has found
scientists discovered that patients who listened to experts of mozart had enhanced gene activity in the brain in areas including memory and learning
meanwhile , the music also affected the activity of a risk gene connected to parkinson
classical music can help slow down the onset of dementia by enhancing gene activity in the brain , new research has found the finnish researchers found the changed activity was only present in ' musically - experienced ' patients , who listened to music regularly , suggesting the importance of familiarity with music
for the study , participants were asked to listen to mozart 's violin concert no 3 , g - major , k.216 , a piece that lasts 20 minutes
the experiment was carried out on both musically experienced and inexperienced participants
the research involved participants listening to mozart ( pictured ) for 20 minutes the study showed that genes were enhanced in those deemed ' musically experienced ' in areas such as dopamine secretion , which is when a neurohormone is released in the brain , synaptic neurotransmission , which is how neurons receive information , and learning and memory
meanwhile , the music appeared to down - regulate genes associated with neuro - degeneration , which is the progressive loss of the structure or function of neurons
the researchers said several of the up - regulated genes were ones which are responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds
this suggests a common evolutionary background of sound perception across different species , they said
one of the most affected genes in this area was synuclein - alpha ( snca ) , which is also a known risk gene for parkinson
study leader doctor jarvela , of helsinki university , said : ' the up - regulation of several genes that are known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggest a shared evolutionary background of sound perception between vocalizing birds and humans
' he added : ' the effect was only detectable in musically experienced participants , suggesting the importance of familiarity and experience in mediating music - induced effects
' dr jarvela added that the findingscould give give further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying music therapy
the effects of this are still largely unknown .
