britain is locked in a post-snowden â arms race â with terrorists who are using technology to spy on the security services and put â our people and agents at risk â , the head of mi6 warned last night
in his first public speech , alex younger made a series of pointed references to how britain intelligence agencies operate within some of the strictest laws in the world while our enemies were â unconstrained â
his comments will be seen as a rejection of the barrage of criticism aimed at mi6 , mi5 and gchq by us â whistleblower â edward snowden and his supporters in the britain
edward snowden âs cheerleaders claim he exposed mass unauthorised surveillance by the security services
mi6 chief alex younger said britain was locked in a post-snowden â arms race â with terrorists who are using technology to spy on the security services and put â our people and agents at risk â but mr alex younger said : â what really distinguishes us from our opponents is that we live by the values of this country and are regulated by its laws , even as we work in secret
â he warned that terror groups such as islamic state and al qaeda were increasingly using the internet to target the intelligence agencies
spy chiefs say the leaks revealed by edward snowden â who stole 1.7million classified documents â had revealed sensitive intelligence gathering techniques
sources have also warned the edward snowden files may have put individual agents in danger by revealing their identities or location
mr alex younger said : â the internet and big data can combine to our advantage , allowing us to know more about the people we meet and the places we meet them
using data appropriately and proportionately offers us a priceless opportunity to be even more deliberate and targeted in what we do , and so to be better at protecting our agents and this country
edward snowden â who stole 1.7million classified documents â revealed sensitive intelligence gathering techniques â the bad news is that the same technology in opposition hands , an opposition often unconstrained by consideration of ethics and law , allows them to see what we are doing and put our people and agents at risk
â so we find ourselves in a technology arms race
contrary to myth , human intelligence operations are not an alternative to technical operations ; the two are interdependent and are set to become more so
â the spy chief did not mention edward snowden by name
but , in a speech earlier this year , his predecessor sir john sawers said : â edward snowden threw a massive rock in the pool
the ripples from that have still not died down
â earlier this month , home secretary theresa may added that the leaks by edward snowden had â damaged â intelligence agencies across the world and drained britain âs spies of vital resources
mr alex younger was speaking at the unveiling of an english heritage blue plaque at the home of the first mi6 chief , sir mansfield cumming
known as â c â due to his habit of initialling his papers , sir mansfield lived and worked at 2 whitehall court in westminster at various times between 1911 and 1922
mr alex younger said : naturally , he would be as taken aback as any of his contemporaries at the way in which britain âs role in the world has altered
it fell to him to protect britain âs interests as an imperial power during a great war
my task is a bit more subtle , but no less taxing
