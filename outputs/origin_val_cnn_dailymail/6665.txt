the tragedy followed the arrest in honduran of handal , the alleged leader of a drug trafficking organization that coordinated the shipment of tons of colombian cocaine via mexico cartels to the united states
handal , a prominent honduran businessman , was taken into custody without a struggle in the northwestern city of san pedro sula on thursday near a hospital where his father was receiving treatment , president hernandez said in a television interview
police found 15 bullet casings at the scene , according to a honduran newspaper report hernandez said honduran judges would likely be in charge of the case because there has not yet been an extradition request from the united states
since 2013 , the united states government has identified handal as a drug trafficking kingpin who supplied colombian cocaine to mexico 's sinaloa and rival los zetas cartels using clandestine airstrips as well as land - based routes into guatemala , where the mexico gangs have a presence
handal 's father and his wife were also designated as leaders of the organization by the united states department of the treasury 's office of foreign assets control
" after several months of searching , today chepe handal has been detained and will now be judged , " hernandez said in a post on his twitter page
drug - related violence in honduran has increased in recent years since mexico 's drug cartels expanded there , enlisting honduran gangs and using its caribbean coast to transport south american cocaine to consumers in the united states .
