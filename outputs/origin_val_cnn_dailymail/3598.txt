choosing the perfect ski destination can be a tricky prospect
especially if you want to take your family
the first instinct is to think about the alps
but if you want to go away in february half - term - which we did - then the snowiest parts of france , italy and austria can be busy
we happened upon an alternative
fill your snow boots : norway can be an inexpensive alternative to the alps the slopes are snow - sure well into april , prices are reasonable and families are exceptionally well catered for
my wife and i have two children , maisie , five and imogen , three
that 's young to start skiing , but i was told that trysil would do the trick
after an easy transfer from oslo airport , we arrived at the radisson blu , one of two ski - in ski - out hotels
there is ten - pin bowling , an american - style diner , a soft play area and a vast multi-pool swimming area that would prove to be a huge hit with my lot
it is also right by the nursery slopes - our first morning found us riding the magic carpet to ski school
maisie was in a class of five , imogen was with three others
and by a happy quirk , they were being taught by two sisters , both delightful
by the second day , she was riding the mini drag lift and imogen was padding around on her skis , searching for stuffed toy lions and monkeys around the kids area
easy does it : trysil can be a perfect ski destination for families with young children by the end of the week , both were skiing better than i could have hoped
trysil has four main ski areas , all with excellent nursery slopes - with easy routes down from all points
the ski school also runs a drop - in creche from 10.45am to 3pm for Â£ 8 an hour per child , with a 30 per cent discount for siblings
we used this for our own ski time
the slopes are surprisingly extensive
hogegga is an area with mostly black runs - and new for this season is the first of a series of new gladed trails through woods
skihytta is a charming mountain hut serving its own beers , and moose shot by the owner
knettsettra is another must - visit mid-mountain restaurant and bar
it hosts free concerts for up to 5,000 people in march and april
the one sting in the tail is the cost of alcohol
a draft half - litre of beer cost me Â£ 6.50 and a bottle of wine Â£ 35
but the well - priced food balanced this out over the week
and it was not just about the skiing
downhill all the way : trysil has slopes for skiers all abilities , within quick reach of oslo we also took the girls dog - sledding across a beautifully scenic plateau , and our highlight of the week was a horse sleigh ride with a stop - off in a nordic yurt to cook hot dogs over an open fire
the girls definitely developed a taste for skiing , and we have a new love affair with trysil
we are already thinking about going back for half - term next year
