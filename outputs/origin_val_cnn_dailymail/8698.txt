promising at the altar to have and to hold your loved one , in sickness and in health , may seem like a straightforward pledge
but for men , some elements of the vow can prove easier to keep than others
a study shows that a couple is more likely to divorce if the wife falls ill. the researchers said their results indicate that some men simply can not cope with a poorly spouse
a study shows that a couple is more likely to divorce if the wife falls ill and researchers said their results indicate that some men simply can not cope with a poorly spouse after tracking 2,700 couples in the us from 1992 to 2010 , the us team found that divorce levels were roughly the same between healthy couples and those in which the husband suffered sickness
but when disease hit the wife , the likelihood of divorce rose
every two years the researchers interviewed the couples and asked whether either of them had been ill since their last session
over the 18 years , 859 marriages ended in divorce , 32 per cent of the sample group
for 24 per cent of the couples , tragedy struck when one spouse died , and 44 per cent were still going strong by the time the study ended
but among the 965 couples in which the woman got sick , the rate of divorce was 6 per cent higher
lead author karraker , assistant professor in family studies at iowa state university , said illness can add stress to a marriage because men may not be as attuned to taking on a caregiver role as women
â there is a difference between feeling too sick to make dinner and needing someone to actually feed you , â she said
â that âs something that can really change the dynamics within a marriage
if your spouse is too sick to work , we know that financial strain is a major predictor of divorce
â dr karraker said wives may also become dissatisfied with their husbands â ability to look after them
she added : â life or death experiences may cause people to re-evaluate what is important in their lives
â it could be that women are saying , â you âre doing a bad job of caring for me or i was nât happy with the relationship to begin with , and i âd rather be alone than in a bad marriage
â â the research was published in the journal of health and social behaviour .
