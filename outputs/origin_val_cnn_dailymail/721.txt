when it comes to four - wheel grand prix racing , britain âs future looks in good hands
lewis hamilton is the formula one world champion , and judging by the form he showed to win the australian motogp , he looks in good shape to become the first ever britain driver to retain his title
but glance towards two - wheel grand prix racing and you will find britain is still dining off championships and even race wins from the late great barry sheene
britain 's cal crutchlow will be riding for the honda team during the 2015 motogp season cal crutchlow hopes to hit the front of the motogp grid with honda after a disappointing year with ducati motogp has arrived in qatar to kick off the 2015 season on sunday , and while britain is looking for its first premier class victory since barry sheene triumphed in sweden in 1981 â its future also looks intriguingly bright
year 2014 2013 2012 2011 team ducati tech3 tech3 tech3 placing 13th ( 74 pts ) 5th ( 188 pts ) 7th ( 151 pts ) 12th ( 70 pts ) in fact , the talent coming through is arguably showing greater promise than that seen in formula one right now
bradley smith , 24 , and scott redding , 22 , impressed during 2014 and will be targeting podium finishes as a realistic possibility this season
for cal crutchlow , he âs been there before â often narrowly missing out on the top step of the podium in 2013
but following a terrible season at ducati last year , the coventry born star once again looks in a position where he could sneak on an opportunity to end britain âs 34 - year wait for a premier class race win
in 2015 , cal crutchlow will be on a honda bike not too far off the specification ridden by double world champion marc marquez , who dominated the 2014 campaign after winning the opening 10 races on his factory honda
cal crutchlow tests his honda around malaysia 's sepang circuit during a pre-season test for his new team the brit has also been testing at qatar 's losail circuit - posting impressive lap times riding for the satellite honda outfit , race wins are not expected but they certainly wo nât be ruled out
it âs very much the same scenario that cal crutchlow was in at yamaha âs tech3 team in 2012 and 2013 and one the 29 - year - old is aiming to return to
â so many guys could get on the podium
â there are 15 guys that are all so close at the moment
â i âd like to say my chances of getting on the podium are more than they were last year
if i could get back to where i was in 2013 and 2012 , i âd be quite happy because we were competitive enough there when i finished fifth and seventh in the championship
there âs a positive tone to his voice and a calmness to him which suggests he is much happier now than when i spoke to him at silverstone last august , shortly after his ducati departure following just one season was confirmed
ducati was always going to be a tough monster to tame
even the great valentino rossi gave up on the bike following two highly uncompetitive years
cal crutchlow reflects that while he has no resentment towards the team , he was constantly on the back foot following a big crash in just his second race on the desmosedici
' the austin crash wrecked the season for me , ' cal crutchlow added
' from that point on it was a downward spiral because i was riding injured for a long time but up until texas i was riding good and was really confident
cal crutchlow rides his ducati around aragon during practice for last year 's grand prix cal crutchlow would on to clinch third behind aleix espargaro ( left ) and race winner jorge lorenzo during the motogp at aragon late in the season which would prove to be his only podium with ducati â when i crashed at texas , it was through no fault of my own
it was of the biggest crashes that i âve ever had when i really hurt my hand but i came back too soon
the other two ducati riders were riding really well at the time and it was like a double whammy
â we came back towards the end of the season and we started to ride very strongly , but i enjoyed my time at ducati and they look to be doing a great job this year
â cal crutchlow referred to the testing times that saw andrea dovizioso top the time sheets in a pre-season qatar test , but it âs not just the italy outfit that are on resurgence
having ridden much of 2014 injured , cal crutchlow states that he is going into the new season with no problems and that includes on his unfamiliar honda where he aims to get more potential out of a bike which has already produced encouraging testing times in malaysia
â i feel good , i feel strong and my physical condition is no problem
but racing a motorcycle is one of the most physically demanding sports in the world and people do nât really realise that
â it âs more than twisting the throttle and braking
we have average heart rates of 192 - 200bpm over 45 minutes
â when i was at yamaha it was different [ learning a new bike ]
i was coming from world superbikes and the bike was completely different to anything i knew at all
the second and third years were quite similar to where i am now
cal crutchlow has previously mixed with the top guns in motogp , finishing second behind marc marquez ( centre ) and valentino rossi ( right ) in the 2013 german grand prix at the sachsenring while with yamaha crutchlow claimed four podium finishes with yamaha in 2013 including a second place at le mans cal crutchlow lifts the front wheel of his yamaha during a 2013 pre-season test at jerez â last year was a little tougher for me to get used to the ducati , but i was still quite confident even then
â i â ve been happy enough with my testing times , but i have nât taken advantage enough of the new tyre which i thought i would take
but that âs just the way it is
the honda you do nât take advantage as much as you would with the other bikes
â but learning to ride the bike is more important
it âs been encouraging , the long run i did in malaysia was ok , and of course i did nât do the long run in qatar because of the rain
â the subject of the britain motogp comes up
considering silverstone is a venue where cal crutchlow âs crashes see him visit the medical centre more than the podium in recent times , even he can admit that the circuit stepping in for the next two years to cover for the lagging circuit of wales project is a good thing
silverstone is the familiar home of the britain motogp in formula one , but the circuit has also stepped in to replace donington and the circuit of wales to host motogp for the next two years â it âs good
it should never have left us - not when there is not a circuit to go to
silverstone have put is so much time and effort to get us there in the first place and they really listened to the riders
â then they said it was going to donington because the circuit of wales was not built and i did nât think that was right
they might as well have kept it at silverstone so it âs good to be back there
' so with a britain motogp in place ( where an impressive 138,000 fans attended over the 2014 weekend ) and talent clearly coming through the system â why has britain struggled so badly to find a premier class winner ? with a hint of frustration , cal crutchlow states that the money being poured into motogp over in italy and spain is harming the opportunity for brits to land top rides
â we do nât get the opportunity
there âs been no britain riders on factory bikes
the year i was in a factory team , the bike was nât capable of winning , we saw that
there âs not been a chance to get on a factory honda or yamaha when it âs winning and that âs down to the system i feel
â there âs not enough money going to the riders like there is in italy and spain , and it âs just endless
