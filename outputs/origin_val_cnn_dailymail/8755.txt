ukip will form an electoral pact with northern ireland mps to keep the tories in power after the next election , farage said this morning
the ukip leader said the conservatives will emerge from the general election as the largest party but would n't have enough mps to govern on their own
mr farage said he would force an early referendum on britain 's membership of the eu as his price for keeping david cameron in number 10
ukip leader farage said the conservatives will emerge from the general election as the largest party but would n't have enough mps to govern on their own the ukip leader 's intervention comes amid growing pressure on the tories to rule out a power - sharing deal with ukip after the election
mr david cameron has repeatedly challenged labour to reject a coalition with the snp , but has side - stepped questions about whether the conservatives would rely on ukip to form a government
but mr farage said this morning said he would not have a choice
he said : ' at the end of the day , this is all about numbers , is n't it ? ' he added : ' i mean i still believe that the conservatives will be the biggest party â not least of which is because alex salmond 's party is doing so well in scotland
' i think between ukip and possibly the dup in northern ireland as well , there will be a body of mps there to have significant influence and to force a referendum on our eu membership
' mr farage has previously insisted he would be willing to support a conservatives minority government only if a referendum on britain leaving the eu was held before the end of this year â two years earlier than david cameron plans
farage said ukip would form an electoral pact with northern ireland mps to keep the tories in power after the next election the tories have insisted that mr david cameron needs two years to re-negotiate britain 's membership of the eu
but mr david cameron said : ' tusk and mr juncker , the two bosses of the eu , have made it perfectly clear there is no renegotiation
' when it comes to the fundamental point of the free movement of people and immigration into the britain , which is the number one issue in britain politics and i think between now and may 7 will start to dominate this general election campaign , there is no renegotiation
' david cameron may be forced to rely on ukip and dup mps to stay as prime minister mr tusk â the european council president â last week claimed mr david cameron 's proposal for a new eu treaty was ' mission impossible '
but the prime minister , speaking in brussels on friday , said a conservatives victory in the general election would give him a ' very powerful mandate ' to win sweeping reforms and insisted it was possible
he added : ' tom cruise normally prevails in the end
he 's a little bit smaller than me , but i hope to be just as effective
' but mr david cameron has refused to rule out a coalition with ukip , telling mailonline : ' i do n't want to have a coalition with anybody
' i 'm fighting for a majority government , there are 93 days to go and i 'm not going to speculate about any outcome other than victory
' last week the chancellor osborne demanded that labour say it would not form a coalition with the snp , who are expected to make big gains in scotland
but he refused to make the same promise about a conservatives - ukip tie - up
appearing on bbc one 's andrew marr show , mr osborne said : ' it 's just total nonsense , voting for farage makes ed miliband the likely prime minister and it means instead of getting the referendum on europe we get no referendum at all , so that 's what a vote for ukip is about and it 's a fundamentally different situation from the snp , you were asking ed balls about it , he again refused to rule out a deal with the snp
' we are fighting for a majority , we only need 23 more seats to get that majority
' farage and indeed ed balls are trying to muddy the waters , it 's a fundamentally different situation for this reason - farage is not going to win seats in the house of commons , even on his own boasts he 's only going to win a small handful
' the snp are likely to win dozens of seats because of the collapse of the labour , ed miliband ca n't be prime minister without the support of alex salmond and that creates an alliance between those who want to bankrupt the country and those who want to break up the country
' farage said ukip mps could join forces with dup members , led by nigel dodds ( left ) , in the commons to keep david cameron in number 10 mr farage has claimed that his party will win a ' handful ' of seats at the election , which means the tories would likely also need the support of northern ireland 's dup ( dup ) to maintain a minority government
ukip would back the tories ' first budget if a referendum on britain 's eu membership was promised before the end of 2015
up until now , the prime minister has vowed to hold a referendum by the end of 2017 , and has said he will campaign to stay in a reformed eu
but the latest polls suggest neither the conservatives or labour will have enough seats to form a government , meaning mr david cameron may have to find a compromise .
