in washington 's polarized political environment , support for israeli has been a rare area of bipartisan cooperation -- at least until now
israeli prime minister netanyahu 's speech to congress on tuesday threatens to undermine the nearly 67 - year tradition of bipartisan support that has endured since president harry truman became the first head of state to recognize israeli
netanyahu is driven not only by his concerns about iranian 's nuclear threat -- the topic of his address -- but also by domestic political considerations
israeli will hold its national elections just two weeks after his visit to washington
netanyahu is fighting for his political life as he faces a tougher than expected re-election campaign
he has been widely blamed at home for having failed to lower the high cost of living , an issue that his rivals have eagerly exploited
netanyahu has tried to offset some of this criticism by focusing on his perennial issue : iranian
a major televised address in washington concerning iranian 's threat , interrupted only by standing ovations from u.s. lawmakers , has the potential to be far more effective than any campaign ad in projecting gravitas , reinforcing his security credentials and reminding voters of his vast experience -- in contrast to his rivals ' inexperience -- in foreign affairs
yet netanyahu 's speech , while possibly giving him a short - term boost at home , will harm jerusalem 's relations with washington , not iranian 's nuclear program
speaker boehner 's late - january invitation to netanyahu to address a joint session of congress was coordinated with neither the white house nor the state department
it was , in essence , a political ploy aimed at undermining president obama as he strives to reach a historic deal over iranian 's nuclear program
in defiance of the obama administration , and rejecting advice from leading figures in israeli and key supporters of israeli in the u.s. , netanyahu accepted the invitation
by antagonizing the white house , boehner and netanyahu have put democratic party members of congress in a bind , forcing them to choose between two unenviable options : either attend the speech out of respect for a close ally , but in so doing flout the president -- their party leader -- or demonstrate loyalty to obama by snubbing the leader of a major u.s. ally
two senior democrats with sterling pro-israel credentials , richard durbin and feinstein , tried to diffuse this latest crisis between washington and jerusalem by offering to meet with the israeli premier behind closed doors but were rebuffed by netanyahu
feinstein had previously noted that an invitation to address congress during the israeli election period was " highly inappropriate
" in politicizing his visit to washington , netanyahu has allowed his bad blood with obama to spill over into his government 's increasingly complicated relationship with the democratic party
netanyahu no doubt believes that obama is misguided about the pending deal with iranian
indeed , there are good reasons to be skeptical of any agreement with a regime that has long engaged in deception and concealment with respect to its nuclear program
less than two weeks ago , the international atomic energy agency reported that iranian was continuing to evade questions about evidence of past work on designing nuclear weapons
yet netanyahu 's move is counterproductive
democrats on capitol hill who were inclined to support additional sanctions on iranian now feel compelled to back the president
in a rare move , five former israeli ambassadors have publicly called on netanyahu to cancel his speech
former mossad chief meir dagan has accused netanyahu of having caused israeli " heavy strategic damage on the iranian issue " by antagonizing the administration
netanyahu 's foray into partisan politics is hardly a new phenomenon
he has never hid his preference for the republican
during his first term in office , netanyahu irked president bill clinton by meeting with the rev. jerry falwell , then - house speaker newt gingrich and other detractors of the president a day before coming to the white house
a key netanyahu supporter is u.s. casino magnate adelson , a major republican donor who also owns the pro-netanyahu newspaper israel hayom
during the 2012 presidential campaign , adelson poured millions into republican challenger romney 's coffers , saying he was willing to spend $ 100 million to defeat obama
that july , netanyahu 's senior adviser , ron dermer , helped orchestrate romney 's visit to israeli in what amounted to an implicit endorsement of obama 's rival
dermer , a former u.s. citizen who once worked for republican pollster and political consultant frank luntz , is israeli 's current ambassador to the u.s.
it is dermer who coordinated the invitation to netanyahu with boehner but never mentioned the invitation to secretary of state john kerry when they met a day before boehner 's announcement
this time , netanyahu may have gone too far
national security adviser susan rice did not mince words when she called netanyahu 's latest move " destructive to the fabric of the relationship " between the u.s. and israeli
although the u.s. - israeli relationship is strong and resilient , rooted in common values and shared interests , netanyahu is subjecting it to an unnecessary test with unknown consequences by choosing to play partisan politics .
