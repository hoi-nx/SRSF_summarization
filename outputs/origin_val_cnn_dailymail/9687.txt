the former marine who killed american sniper kyle and his friend littlefield has been moved into a psychiatric prison for evaluation of whether he should be moved into the general prison population
eddie ray routh was transferred on monday to jester iv unit , a psychiatric facility in richmond , about 25 miles outside houston
eddie ray routh was convicted on february 28 of double murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole
a jury rejected his insanity defense that he should be put in a psychiatric treatment facility instead of prison
however , because of his psychiatric state , eddie ray routh could still be kept out of the general prison population and be kept in a mental facility in the prison system instead
he was transferred from a state prison near abilene , where he underwent an initial evaluation , to jester iv unit , which has more advanced medical facilities

the marine veteran appears thinner since he last appeared in public on the day of his murder conviction
the 2013 murder of kyle , a navy seal who wrote the best - selling book kyle , and his friend littlefield drew nationwide attention
kyle is the deadliest sniper in american history , with 160 confirmed kills
his trial took place not long after the release of ' kyle ' the movie , an oscar - winning biopic that starred bradley cooper as kyle .
