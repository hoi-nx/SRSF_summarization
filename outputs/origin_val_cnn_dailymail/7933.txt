but as the camera sweeps across the map , it soon becomes clear that this short film has re-imagined the tv fantasy series to deliver a very modern political message
titled game of cuts ( winter is coming for councils ) , it was produced by a campaign group which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern , midland and south - coast regions of england
the production , which cost Â£ 11,000 , cleverly echoes the drama played out in the hit hbo show
game of thrones spoof game of cuts was produced by campaign group sigoma , which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern , midland and south - coast regions of england made by sigoma ( special interest group of municipal authorities ) , it depicts a fictional kingdom where funding cuts have meant some regions can not fund vital services , while other areas moan about not having luxuries
in the opening scene are characters based on those from the house of lannister - a rich and powerful dynasty in the south
among them is a parody of king joffrey , a ruthless ruler , who is informed : ' the seven kingdoms prosper once more
' we must not jeopardise this by pandering to the whims of the north ... our funding cuts will help to protect the future of the seven kingdoms
' honourable northerner lord ned starp ( played in the actual series by sean bean as stark ) is seen right , in the foreground
he says to the evil king joffrey of the south ( left : ' your grace , what is the meaning of this ? the people of the northern cities are already on their knees ! our old and the sick have no one to care for them ' in the film , queen cersei is seen reinforcing the claims made by her son king joffrey enter honourable northerner lord ned starp ( played in the actual series by sean bean as stark ) : ' your grace , what is the meaning of this ? the people of the northern cities are already on their knees ! our old and the sick have no one to care for them
' ' our children have no places to read and our roads are crumbling
' but at every turn , starp 's entreaties are scoffed at
to join sigoma , council must pay an initial fee of Â£ 3,000
however , the film has been criticised by conservative party vice-chairman and former local government minister neill
he said : ' taxpayers ' money should n't be used to subsidise the box set fantasies of town hall officials
at the end of the short film , the king fires an arrow at lord starp , whose pleas for more funding in the north are scoffed at according to sigoma , by march 2016 , the amount of funding cuts for regions will be : ' it 's a complete waste of money , but also a complete fiction
it 's missing the key plot - there 's a black hole in the kingdom 's coffers , thanks to the bad old days of king gordon
' his hand of the king , baron red ed , may now eye the throne , but he would wind the clock back to same failed old policies of government waste and higher taxes , meaning less money to go around for local services
' meanwhile , labour councillor sir steve houghton , chairman of sigoma said : ' whilst councils have made every effort to absorb the funding cuts and adapt , the successive rounds of cuts mean that councils are rapidly running out of options for making the savings required
' clearly a situation in which some councils are struggling to provide essential services such as care and support for their most vulnerable residents , whilst others have more than enough , is clearly unfair and unsustainable , ' he told the express and star
he added that the reason the video was made was because national politicians were not listening
according to sigoma , since 2010 , local government in england has lost more than 40 per cent of its core funding
it also said that urban authorities , largely in the north and the midlands , have lost the most money as a result of these cuts
