arsene wenger has revealed how he scrapped the exit strategy drawn up for coquelin after a rapid mid-season transformation by the frenchman midfielder
in less than three months , coquelin has gone from an arsenal outcast on loan at charlton to a player of such vital importance that he has been equipped with a protective mask which will enable him to play despite a broken nose against qpr on wednesday
' it has been a surprise to everybody , ' said arsene wenger
' i told him at the start of the season to give absolutely everything until christmas and then we would sit down together and see where we were
coquelin stretches prior to arsenal 's training session ahead of their match against qpr coquelin almost went on loan to qpr at the beginning of the season but the deal collapsed late on ' in myself , i thought if he does n't play at all until christmas , there was only six months contract to go and i would let him go somewhere else
you let the boy go
you do n't leave him completely out of the squad for six more months
' coquelin almost joined qpr in august but a proposed one - year loan collapsed on deadline day and two months later he was loaned to charlton in the championship , only to be recalled early because arteta and flamini were struggling with injuries and poor form
' he was n't happy when i called him back , ' said arsene wenger
' he thought i had just called him back as cover
' coquelin made his first arsenal start for nearly two years at west ham on december 28 and has been ever - present in the barclays premier league since
last month , the 23 - year - old signed a new contract tying him to arsenal until 2018
coquelin has gone from being a reserve to a player that may be encouraged to play even though he 's injured arsene wenger admitted he had expected to release coquelin at the end of the season arsene wenger is criticised for his loyalty and patience with developing players , but this is a triumph for that policy and a reminder that some players take longer than others to mature
' he has analysed well what he is good at , ' said arsene wenger
he was in between the playmaking position and the box - to - box player and he is not that
he is a sitting player who can win the ball
' he has restricted his game to that and you make success in life with what you 're good at
you do n't have all the qualities but you have to express what you 're good at and he 's good at that
i think he can do that job
he is doing it now
' he is respectful , focused and open
he has a strong personality , he speaks his mind but does n't complain
let 's not forget , he has been world champion with the under 21s
but you have to climb from a youth prospect to a regular player in a top team and that 's not easy
he 's doing it now
' coquelin broke his nose against everton on sunday but trained on tuesday and has the mask ready if required at loftus road
coquelin 's stint in the first team has earned him a new long - term contract with the gunners the frenchman midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot flamini in the pecking order ' he knows it 's an opportunity for him , ' said arsene wenger
' sometimes when you wait for such a long time to get your chance and you get it , the more you have suffered , the more you enjoy it
the human being is a strange animal
' he has gone through a lot of doubt , questioning himself , at many times being discouraged that he does n't get a chance
now that he has a chance he does n't want to let it slip away
he is a winner and he wants to win
that 's why he is so committed
' arteta , despite nagging injury problems , will extend his contract for one more year and flamini has another year on his deal , while arsenal remain linked with lars bender , christoph kramer and morgan schneiderlin
' you can not want to play at a big club and have no competition , ' said arsene wenger
competition is part of our job
