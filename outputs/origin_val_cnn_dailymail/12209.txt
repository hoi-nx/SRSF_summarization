could it get any cuter than seal pup kisses ? the usgs and the u.s. department of interior this week shared a photo of a weddell seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom in erebus bay , antarctica
the expression of the mother is priceless
the photo was taken in october by usgs scientist link
link , a statistician , was helping researchers tag newborn seal pups
he confirmed friday that the adult seal was the baby 's mom
it 's hard to know what she was thinking when her baby nuzzled up to her in this photo , but link said the animals flare their noses when disturbed , " so this mamma was pretty relaxed , " link told cnn friday
" i have a great shot a few seconds later where mamma yawned hugely
she looked utterly content , to me
" the agency 's public affairs department had asked scientists for interesting images to post on social media
as the instagram caption notes , the weddell seals of erebus bay have been studied extensively for over 40 years
" because of its isolation , this population is undisturbed by human activities
the weddell seal population is healthy and stable , and thus gives a good example for studies of animal population dynamics
" link said it was a privilege to see the animals up close
" i was awed , " he said
" it 's incredible that animals can live and thrive in such harsh conditions
it 's hard to describe the remoteness and isolation of the spot -- bitter cold , high winds , no life to be seen except for the seals , an occasional skua or an emperor penguin
" after a seal pup is born , link said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area , with hardly any interaction with other seals
" mamma does n't even leave for a swim until the baby is nearly ready to be weaned , and even then does n't get to eat
so while baby puts on a couple of hundred pounds , mamma loses about twice that much , " he said
