he was the manager who wanted to be sacked
for while gus poyet may have vowed to fight on in the wake of saturday âs 4 - 0 humiliation at home to aston villa , monday âs dismissal as head coach of sunderland would have come as a mighty relief
gus poyet has long since lost faith in his vision for sunderland
frustrated by the influence of sporting director lee congerton in transfers , he was left with a dysfunctional team made up of players signed by both himself and the club hierarchy
gus poyet was sacked as sunderland manager on monday with the club one point above the relegation zone gus poyet was dismissed following the sunderland ' 4 - 0 premier league defeat at home to aston villa on saturday goalkeeper costel pantilimon looks dejected as sunderland were thrashed 4 - 0 at home by aston villa gabriel agbonlahor ( centre ) scored two of aston villa 's goals in the 4 - 0 win on saturday sunderland fans turned on manager gus poyet ( bottom left ) during the defeat by aston villa on saturday afteroon video poyet sacked as sunderland manager 525-poyet 's number of days in charge since his arrival on october 8 , 2013
75 - the uruguayan 's number of games in charge , winning 23 , losing 22 and drawing 30
3 - the number of games against bitter rivals newcastle
he won them all with an aggregate of 6 - 1
35 - gus poyet was the 35th man to manage sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker
22 - the number of years between sunderland 's appearances in a major final
gus poyet took them to the 2014 capital one cup final , 22 years on from their defeat to liverpool in the fa cup showpiece
14 - sunderland 's final position in gus poyet 's first season
4 - the amount of games won in the premier league by sunderland this season
the joint - worst with bottom side leicester
some of gus poyet âs press - conference outbursts distanced him from the personnel on the pitch and were not well received at boardroom level
â i am not going to be a head coach when it suits and a manager when it does nât , â he said in december
â it is clear what we need to do
that is down to recruitment
so , if you ever get the chance to speak to anyone on the recruitment side and ask them about it , you are lucky
if you do nât , do nât ask me
â such comments would not have been tolerated at other clubs and lee congerton informed owner ellis short that gus poyet was not the man to take them forward
gus poyet grew particularly disillusioned during january and when he let coach charlie oatway take a pre-match and half - time team talk there was a feeling he had lost interest
subsequent team selections left players and senior figures baffled - four central midfielders named in the starting xi versus hull , who play with wing - backs , being the most alarming example
gus poyet had lost his faith in his vision for sunderland and was fed up sporting director lee congerton ( centre ) gus poyet advised his son diego to sign for west ham last july rather than join him at the stadium of light but the players should not escape criticism , either
this is the third manager , following martin oâneill and paolo di canio , who has been sacked with the core of the current squad on the books
they have fought relegation during the past two seasons and have survived despite falling short of 40 points on each occasion
the squad has gone stale and so had gus poyet
he did not think the players were good enough to implement the attractive football he craved
certainly , not once was there any evidence of such a brand of play during his 17 months in charge
tellingly , the uruguayan also advised his son diego to sign for west ham last july rather than join him at the stadium of light
then there was his failure to promote from within the club âs academy , a major source of contention among staff who work with the youngsters
indeed , they were miffed at the sight of assistant boss mauricio taricco joining in first - team sessions rather than sending for one of their players
but gus poyet âs refusal to entertain academy prospects - not one such player started a game during his tenure - was symptomatic of his loss of love for the project on wearside
results , if not performances , were always just enough - 14 draws this season - to keep talk of a crisis in the background
gus poyet was appointed by sunderland in october 2013 following the sacking of paolo di canio but discord and discontent rumbled all the while and only now is it all being laid bare after the situation unravelled on the pitch in such shambolic fashion at the weekend
gus poyet âs behaviour in the dressing - room on saturday did little to convince the players he was scrapping for his and their survival
for gus poyet no longer wanted to be at the club and the key powerbrokers no longer wanted him there , either
his sacking was the best outcome for all parties
