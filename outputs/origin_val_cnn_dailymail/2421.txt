katie 's approach to weight loss is five parts stick , zero parts carrot overweight children are the latest target for serial ranter hopkins
the controversial columnist has said that fat children should be forced to attend special sports schools until they shed excess weight
writing in her column for now ! magazine , the 39 - year - old said : ' the most upsetting thing of all is a fat child
' watching fat parents drop their fat kids off at school in their cars makes me so angry my teeth itch and my nipples twizzle
' the mother - of - three adds in her video blog for the magazine that she blames the parents for children with weight problems : ' i 've always said that a fat child lives in the shadow of a fat parent
' the fat kids go through the school gates and there 's the fat mum in the car , who does n't bother to get out , still wearing her pyjamas ... and that really does my head in
' citing government statistics that say one - in - 10 four - year - olds are now overweight , the celebrity big brother star even goes as far to say that , if she had her way , fat children would be ' sent to special sports schools until they make the grade
' hopkins also opines that she thinks people in england are far too soft on ' fat shaming '
' there 's loads of fat kids and we do n't say anything because that would be fat - shaming , or bullying ... well , i disagree completely
' in england , we 're far too soft on it and we seem to think it 's okay that people are pureeing kfc to spoon - feed to their babies
' earlier this year , the opinionated former apprentice star filmed herself gaining and losing four stone in an effort to prove that obesity is purely the fault of the person carrying the weight
katie has form with insulting overweight people
on her television show making my fat , she was kicked out of an 800lb woman 's house after rows
now , she 's turned her venom to children , saying obese kids should go to ' special sports schools ' until they make the grade ' katie before her own weight gain ( left ) and after ( right ) in the programme , katie was frequently seen bursting into floods of tears over her new body shape , but also over the amount of food that she has to eat every day to put on the weight
she loaded up on junk food every couple of hours , setting herself a target of 5,000 calories every day
katie 's doctor advised her not to go through with the programme , warning the star that she faced a number of health problems including liver strain , damaged knees , altered blood chemistry , and stretched skin among other issues
but she persisted with the experiment , going so far as to travel to north carolina in the american to take part in an eating competition
katie reveals she had to sleep next to a sick bucket because overeating made her feel so nauseous at the fast food restaurant , customers are given 20 minutes to consume a monster burger , containing a kilo of meat and 8,000 calories
katie gave the meal her best shot , but only succeeded in consuming around half
she said : ' there are two kids in there who are around 15 or 16 years old and they must weigh between 200 pounds ( 14.2 stone ) and 300 pounds ( 21 stone ) each
' i ca n't understand why no one is telling them to stop
' i feel really sorry for those children
their parents were just there watching them eat
' i just want to go and ask them to stop
' i could n't do that to my children
i could never feed my children to death
' katie also visited an american called nicky , a woman who weighs 803lb ( 57 stone )
nicky is often confined to her house because of the weight that she carries around
while the women initially got on like a house on fire , katie quickly insulted nicky and the women became embroiled in an argument , which saw her asked to leave the house
the tv star was unrepentant , telling the cameras : ' there is no way she is really happy
' she has managed to become happy with what she has got by accepting it 's rubbish
' i would rather be put down than be nicky
' making my fat followed hopkins as she gained 4st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day , then lost the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise the end of the programme saw katie engage in extreme eating to try and put on the weight , gorging on 400 calories every couple of hours
hopkins strikes fear into the hearts of many people in the britain - she recently came second in a poll of the world 's most hated people
the television star 's documentary made her so disliked among larger ladies and men that they actively try to avoid her
she told femail : ' fat people can be quite afraid of me , there is this sort of hopkins fear
' a lot of them will actually cross the road to avoid me if they see me walking down the street
katie said she wanted her tlc documentary to start a debate about the nation 's obesity crisis ' others will present me with their excuses before i have even opened my mouth , which is weird because it 's not like i go around judging me all of the time
' fat mums completely avoid me , but that âs fine
' katie has had a bee in her bonnet about overweight men and women for a couple of years
last year she made headlines around the world after she revealed that she would n't hire a fat person because they are ' lazy '
so in the last six months , the 39 - year - old decided to put on 30 per cent of her body weight in just three months and then lose it just as quickly , to prove that larger people only have themselves to blame for piling on the pounds
the star has very little time for larger people , admitting than she can hardly bear to touch anyone carrying a little extra fat , but she has even less for their excuses
instead of laying the blame for britain 's obesity problem at the door of the takeaway shops and junk food companies , katie says it is the fault of the individual and they need to be aware that it is not okay to look as they do
katie said : ' at my heaviest during this television experiment , i weighed 12 stone
' nowadays , i hear a lot of women say 12st is nât that big - they say that because you can be 12 stone and a size 14
' but it 's strange idea that we think 12st is nât that big , i actually find it very alarming
' we keep pushing up the boundaries , first of all 10st was n't that big , then 11st and now 12st
' i really worry about the re-sizing that we have done as a nation
' by putting size 16 models in debenhams shop windows and embracing bigger seats , bigger beds and bigger geriatric ambulances - we are re-scaling what we perceive as normal
' the controversial figure claims that while she did n't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children , gaining 3st pushing her weight over 11st ' killed her ' and left her in constant floods but while katie thinks the plus - size models in debenhams shop windows are unacceptable , the super-skinny mannequins that recently caused an uproar in topshop are acceptable in her eyes
she said : ' i do nât mind skinny mannequins
' i did nât think that they were particularly skinny , i thought that they looked pretty alright
' there are a lot of kids at that age who are relatively skinny
i was a pretty skinny kid
' in terms of sizing , mango starts their plus - size collection at a size 12 and i âve always said that size 12 is a size called fat
' because for me , it âs not necessarily that a size 12 is fat , it âs so that people can have a sense of what is normal
' i believe that we take our cues on what is normal from what we see on the high street and as we are getting bigger , we are just re-sizing or super-sizing what we think is normal
' in part two of katie 's documentary she debated diet bloggers and plus - size campaigners katie 's approach to weight loss is five parts stick , zero parts carrot
asked about a fat tax as a potential solution , making customers pay a heftier tax on junk food than healthy produce , katie scoffs and suggests a far more radical option
she says : ' i âm not averse to the idea of a fat tax , but i would go much more brutal than that
' i think the fact that we do nât own our problems in this country is the biggest issue that we have
' for instance , our nhs in this country is free at point of use , but most people perceive that as completely free
' therefore , any problem that they create with their body is also free , with someone else footing the bill
' she continued : ' obese people are bankrupting us - they cost us something like Â£ 17.4 billion last year
' we need to make these people own the problem
so , we should have a social security insurance scheme , whereby people are charged if they do nât make a genuine effort to look after their own health
' if you do nât look after your own health , guess what ? you âre going to pay more
so if you smoke , guess what ? you âre going to pay more
you drink too much , guess what ? you âre going to pay more
' and if you eat yourself into being morbidly obese , then you âre going to pay for your hip operation as well
' that would make people own their problems better than some kind of fat tax
' because this tea and sympathy lark just is n't working
