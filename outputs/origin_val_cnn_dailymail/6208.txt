victims were allegedly lured into the ' boiler room ' scam by ' persistent and persuasive ' salesmen who told them the limited coloured stones would pay handsome returns because they were from mines which were closed or closing

prosecutor schutzer-weissman said investors racked up Â£ 1.5m losses after paying for precious gems through evolution and stonehouse global markets limited
she told the jury : â it was a stone to be used as an asset for investment
the caller was persuasive , the caller was persistent and always suggesting to the investor that purchasing coloured diamonds was an investment that would get good and reliable returns
â they were told often that diamonds would be scarcer and rarer and therefore more valuable because a mine , or mines , were closing or had closed
billy cosma , 23 ( left ) is also accused of conspiracy to defraud
hider esphari , 28 ( right ) admitted the charge at southwark crown court â they were told this was a limited time opportunity and they were told that the investment was guaranteed to provide a good return , depending of course on how long the diamond was kept before selling on
â calls would be followed by letters that provided more concrete information about the investment prospect of the stones
â she told the court how a certificate was sent for each purchased diamond , giving details of clarity and cut
but , crucially , the certificate did not include the value , the court heard
many clients also took up the offer of free storage from the company , said ms schutzer-weissman
the bank accounts for the companies showed more than Â£ 1,240 was spent in exclusive london department store harrods ( pictured ) the court was told how one investor allegedly duped the by scam was telephoned by hider eshpari
using an alias , he told him it was an â exciting market for coloured diamonds â and offered to send him a brochure
a short time later , he received more phone calls from evolution telling him there was fantastic potential for investment and that a mine was closing in australia , it is alleged
the client visited the company offices in august 2011 and agreed to buy a round brilliant orange brown diamond weighing 0.28 carats
he paid Â£ 5,550 for the stone after finding out it was one of the last they had in stock , jurors heard
later that month he visited again and purchased an orange yellow diamond weighing 0.31 carats for Â£ 14,450
hider eshpari told him its worth would rocket at chinese new year when demand for the diamonds increased
more than Â£ 2,000 was splurged in hugo boss , while Â£ 7,685 was spent in selfridges ( pictured ) but the first gem was worth only Â£ 270 and the second just Â£ 440
ms schutzer-weissman said : â those figures are not disputed - when i said there was a big mark up , those are the types of mark up we are thinking about
â it is agreed the diamonds sold by evolution are worth far less than they were sold for
â she added : â you may think that the business was being run as a cash cow for these defendants
â these defendants were aware that the benefits they receives were not as a result of business acumen but as a result of intentional and persistent fraud
