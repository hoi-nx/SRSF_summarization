in one , reynolds , who died in 2004 aged 44 , says he wrote the song for his mother
' she called and asked me one day , your father and i are filling out some paperwork and she said there 's a clause in there , " if you die before we do
" so i went and thought about this thing and i dealt with it the only way i could and that was in a song
" wilson , who lives in woodstock , georgia , claims she and reynolds , who sang as a duet called ashley wilson and reynolds , recorded the song on an album released on cassette in 1990

though the lyrics of the two versions are different , wilson said they ' contain the same title and dominant line in the chorus â¦ with substantially similar melody , rhythm and cadence , as well as substantially similar lyrical themes
