the patent shows that , in terms of design , the headset resembles skiing goggles rachel metz , writing for mit technology review , was able to test out one of the larger systems which will compete with the likes of facebook 's oculus rift and microsoft 's hololens
' magic leap had to come up with an alternative to stereoscopic 3-d â something that does n't disrupt the way you normally see things , ' she wrote
' as i see crisply rendered images of monsters , robots , and cadaver heads in magic leap 's offices , i can envision someday having a video chat with faraway family members who look as if they 're actually sitting in my living room while , on their end , i appear to be sitting in theirs
' or walking around new york city with a virtual tour guide , the sides of buildings overlaid with images that reveal how the structures looked in the past
' magic leap 's florida - based makers said it is a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality , which it calls ' cinematic reality '
the firm 's website features an elephant ( pictured ) moving realistically in a person 's hands sensors can track the wearer 's location and position , to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible
buttons on the visor could act like a ' home screen ' , to take wearers to menus , for example
while other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus , copy , select and back she says the experience is like ' watching movies where the characters appear to be right in front of me , letting me follow them around as the plot unfolds
' in october , magic leap announced it had raised $ 542 million in funding , led by google
other investors included qualcomm , the world 's leading phone chipmaker , andreessen horowitz , kkr , and legendary entertainment
the patent was filed in july 2014 by chief executive abovitz , and was awarded earlier this week
in terms of design , the headset resembles skiing goggles , connected to a battery pack
it connects to a network , which then connects to a so - called ' passable world model
' this model is created using a database of objects and ' object recognisers '
sensors can also track the wearer 's location and position , to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible
buttons on the visor could act like a ' home screen ' , to take wearers to menus , for example
while other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus , copy , select , back or cancel , and right clicks
in one drawing from the patent , a mother and child are in a supermarket , and a virtual version of their list appears on the trolley
other drawings show a man watching sport on this tv , with scores , player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him
the company appears to be aiming to fit its technology into a chunky pair of sports sunglasses wired to a square pack that users can place in their pocket
but the prototype that ms meltz used was fixed on ' unwieldy scaffolding '
the company wo n't say how it will shrink its device , but chief executive abovitz has confirmed that the headset will be a glasses - like system
despite the secrecy surrounding the system , it has been deemed exciting enough for google to have invested around $ 500 million
other investors included qualcomm , the world 's leading phone chipmaker , andreessen horowitz , kkr , and legendary entertainment
in january , an extensive patent not only showed how the augmented reality headset could look and work , it also provides a number of example uses
the patent was filed in july 2014 by chief executive abovitz , and was awarded earlier this week
it features a total of 180 pages and drawings detailing the look , functionality and uses for the device

further into the patent , a number of case uses are shown in the form of drawings
one shows a man watching sport on tv , with scores , player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him an example image , showing the blurring of a fantastical virtual reality object and the real world produced by the technology , is pictured
as part of google 's investment , sundar pichai , senior vice president of android , chrome and apps at the search engine , will join magic leap 's board buttons on the visor could act like a ' home screen ' , to take wearers to menus , for example

mr abovitz recently said : ' we have the term ' cinematic reality ' because we are disassociated with those things
' when you see this , you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years
' to go farther and deeper than we 're going , you would be changing what it means to be human
' the soon - to - be defunct google glass , already lets users see augmented reality
using a particular app for example , runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them
the magic leap patent shows how its headset could be used in a similar way by cyclists , for example
google glass also superimposes information on the periphery of a wearer 's vision
facebook spent $ 2 billion buying oculus last year , which makes a virtual reality headset , mostly aimed at gamers
unlike magic leap 's future device , it blocks out the real world around the user
gamers hope facebook and google 's involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology , which would make playing games and watching films more realistic , as well as creating other immersive experiences
a release date and price for the magic leap headset have not been revealed
