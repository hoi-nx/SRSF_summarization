huskins , 29 , is in good condition and had no apparent injuries , marlatt said
huskins left with police to meet several family members
vallejo police lt. park said that the case was being treated as a kidnap for ransom and investigators hoped to get a clearer picture of what happened by talking to huskins later that night
it was unclear whether that would happen in vallejo or whether detectives would have to travel to huntington beach , some 420 miles away
