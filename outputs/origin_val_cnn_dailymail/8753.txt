alvarez , who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of scully 's , offered the girls food at centrio mall in cagayan de oro city and then invited them back to their house
daisy said when they got to the house , alvarez bathed the girls while scully , who she referred to as the ' american ' , videoed them
the next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task
it was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other
