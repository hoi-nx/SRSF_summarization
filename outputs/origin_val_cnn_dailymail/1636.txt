the president had selected princeton to make it to the final four on his ncaa bracket
and although his niece did n't play in the game , there was still plenty of excitement to witness as the undefeated eighth - seeded princeton team overcame a tight first half to win 80 - 70
it was the first time the women 's team had won an ncaa game in princeton 's history

princeton won the game 80 - 70 and remained undefeated even the president could n't distract banghart , the team 's coach , from the important tournament game
banghart said she frequently saw obama during the game because he was sitting right in front of her family
' i 'd be like , " oh my god
but it certainly was n't my focus , ' she said
but banghart said having the president in the stands will certainly ' go down as a highlight
' even the opposing team 's coach had to get it on the obama action
i 'm going to let my guard down for a minute and be excited about that , ' said green bay coach kevin borseth
' i shook his hand
and i got a picture
' a brief chant of ' four more years ! ' rose from some spectators during the game 's second half , drawing a chuckle from obama
security was increased due to the president 's presence , with metal detectors and bomb - sniffing dogs present at the stadium 's entrance
