he continued to organise weekend events while studying medicine at edinburgh university , but they soon attracted hundreds of people and the hobby began placing more demands on his time
mr fletcher said : ' i originally started it as a hobby , something that i did for fun
i got to my final year of medical school and realised it was getting silly
' i 'd fly down on a wednesday to organise an event with hundreds of people at the weekend and then head back for exams
i had to give the company a shot
' he dropped out of university in 2001 to work on multiplay full - time and his mother , father and brother joined the business

he said : ' we 're very happy
this is a reward for those of us who have risked an awful lot
it recognises the hard work that everybody puts in

i did sneak a look at a few cars , though
' mr fletcher , who currently drives a jaguar xf , has been looking at aston martins , his mother said
he added that a lot of the cash will be reinvested in new equipment
' the sky 's the limit
we have had a rocket put under us and we 're going to be growing very fast , ' he said
' i would n't be surprised if there were 150 people working here in three years ' time
we 've got some big ambitions
' with the business initially revolving around him playing online and establishing contacts , now he hardly has any time to play games himself as work takes over

i exist so that other people can play
