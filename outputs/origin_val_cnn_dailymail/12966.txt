venezuela has given the u.s. embassy in caracas 15 days to downsize its staff from 100 personnel to 17
" with respect to bringing the number of staff at the u.s. embassy in venezuela to 17 , a period of 15 days will be given to decide which staff will stay in our country , " said venezuela 's foreign minister delcy rodriguez on monday
venezuela 's official news agency agencia venezolana de noticias ( agencia venezolana de noticias ) said the americans embassy has been asked to reduce its personnel to a staff of 17 to match the number of venezuela personnel working in their embassy in the americans
last month , the americans government approved a law under which venezuela officials allegedly involved in human rights violations are to have their visas revoked and their americans assets frozen
following that decision , venezuela president maduro announced that that americans will need visas to visit venezuela
moreover , a group of prominent americans officials , current and retired , will be banned from entering venezuela because of what maduro said was their involvement in " bombing iraq , syria and vietnam " and other " terrorist " actions
the officials include george w. bush , former americans vice president dick cheney , former cia director george tenet and several current members of congress , including ileana ros-lehtinen , bob menendez and mario diaz-balart
on saturday , maduro also said an unspecified number of americans were arrested " a few days ago " for engaging in espionage and recruitment activities
the president said they included an latin american pilot of latin american origin , arrested in the southwest border state of tã¡chira
he said the pilot was found in possession of " all kinds of documents " and was being interrogated by the authorities , though he did not identify him
the venezuela government has made many similar claims in recent years , without ever substantiating them
" there have been a lot of anti-american rhetoric again coming out of the venezuelan government with a lot of baseless allegations , " said state department spokeswoman marie harf on monday .
