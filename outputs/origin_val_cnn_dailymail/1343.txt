a young sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street has escaped going to jail after a judge found the killing was done in the most ' extreme circumstances '
silva stabbed her boyfriend of four years , polkinghorne , five times on mother 's day in 2012 after he arrived outside her marrickville home in sydney fuelled on the drug ' ice '
the 25 - year - old domestic violence victim sat down and wept after justice hoeben sentenced her to two years ' imprisonment
however the prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour
in handing down his sentence , justice hoeben said he accepted silva 's comments that mr polkinghorne had been ' very abusive '
' i dealt with it for so long , i thought i could change him , ' silva had said
while he found silva did intend to cause mr polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head , he said the situation was ' exceptional '
' the factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased
' the offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment
' she faced the nsw supreme court in sydney on friday where her jail sentence was suspended during the course of her trial , silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by mr polkinghorne to her in the lead up to his death
in one , mr polkinghorne threatened to ' cave her face in '
another message , from the day he was stabbed , read : ' i hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped
' mr polkinghorne , the court heard , had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice
silva stabbed polkinghorne five times after he arrived outside her marrickville home in sydney fuelled on the drug ' ice ' the court heard that mr polkinghorne arrived outside ms silva 's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone , months after she had ended their relationship
ms silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself , while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside
upon returning to the scene , she stabbed him in the shoulder , chest and back
before his death , during a phone conversation between silva and her brother miguel , she was heard saying : ' he reckons he 's gon na come and kill me , right now â
when miguel tells her to call the cops , an increasingly distressed silva replies : ' why do you think i do n't tell them so he can bash me up all the f * * * ing time
i 'm sick of it ... and i do n't know what to f * * * ing do any more
' ' is there anyone we can f * * * ing contact ... to get him killed or something ? ' she asks , later adding : ' do n't worry i 'll f * * * ing stab him myself '
justice hoeben called the situation ' exceptional ' after accepting silva 's comments that mr polkinghorne had been ' very abusive ' silva also believed he had shot and killed nikolas argiropoulos , whose body was found in a park in birchgrove in sydney 's inner - west on march 22 , 2012
outside court , her lawyer adam houda said there were no winners in this tragedy
' my client has had to endure the most extreme forms of physical , verbal and psychological abuse and in that light the sentence imposed today was the appropriate one considering the extraordinary circumstances of this case , ' he said
' it 's now time to heal
