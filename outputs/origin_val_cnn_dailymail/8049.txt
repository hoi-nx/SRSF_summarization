dan lassman , 23 , who owns the peugeot , said he had parked it outside his home and was perplexed when he went outside and realise it had been moved ' when it 's a fairly newish car , you do n't want people damaging it
' during the day it can be a bit of a free - for - all on the road because you do get a lot of people who park and walk into town rather than pay for a ticket or you get a lot of the staff in town but there 's quite a lot of free space

' he thought it was just " women driving " but i 'd been ill all day and had n't left the house

' we 're hoping to catch the van driver so we can claim on his insurance or we 'll have to pay out hundreds of pounds as we were due to sell it shortly
