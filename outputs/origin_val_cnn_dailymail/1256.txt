sir michael wilshaw , chief inspector of schools and children âs services , said saving youngsters from exploitation required â political and moral courage ' politicians were yesterday warned they should never ignore sex crimes against children out of a misguided fear of being called racist
sir michael wilshaw , chief inspector of schools and children âs services , said saving youngsters from exploitation required â political and moral courage â on the part of local leaders
â they must never allow misguided beliefs about the impact for certain ethnic and cultural groups to get in the way of confronting this horrific abuse wherever it occurs , â he added
his warning came amid the row over the failure of social workers , politicians or police to act against gangs of mostly pakistani men who exploited hundreds of children in rotherham and oxford
an inquiry last month said rotherham councillors shied away from the issue for fear of being accused of disturbing â community cohesion â
it added : â by failing to take action against the pakistani heritage male perpetrators of child sexual exploitation in the borough , the council has inadvertently fuelled the far - right
â last week an inquiry into a similar scandal in oxford , carried out by the head of the local safeguarding board , said there was â no evidence of any agency not acting when they should have done because of racial sensitivities â
but the thames valley police and crime commissioner accused it of â pulling its punches â
sir michael wilshaw âs warning was contained in an ofsted report that found most local councils charged with looking after children âs safety are failing at the job
only ten out of 43 inspected over the course of a year were found to give a good standard of care and protection
criticised : rotherham 's director of children 's services between 2008 and 2014 joyce thacker ( left ) and former rotherham council leader roger stone ( right ) were both criticised for their inaction over the scandal sir michael wilshaw said youngsters who go missing from children âs homes while in council care are disproportionately at risk of abuse but social workers in some areas still fail to take notice of them
he added : â we found children and young people who had been missing were either not having an interview on their return or having one that was of poor quality
' there was no clear understanding of why children had gone missing
