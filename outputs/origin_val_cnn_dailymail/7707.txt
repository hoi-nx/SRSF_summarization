cancer survival rates in britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other european countries , experts warn
even for breast cancer â one of the most treatable forms of the disease â the figures are still well below those reached by france , sweden and italy in the late 1990s
for lung cancer , the rates are so far behind that patients in britain are now half as likely to survive as those living in austria
macmillan cancer support has described the situation as â shameful â and warns too many patients are dying needlessly here when they would survive had they been treated elsewhere in european
cancer survival rates in britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other european countries , despite billions of pounds being spent to improve the britain 's survival rates ( file picture , posed by models ) and despite billions being spent to improve cancer survival rates over the last 15 years â Â£ 640million invested by labour in the early 2000s and Â£ 750million by the tories â britain does not appear to have gained any ground
in 2002 labour increased national insurance tax by 1 per cent as part of a budget introduced by then chancellor gordon brown specifically to pay for major improvements in the nhs , notably cancer care
but only this month figures showed that waiting times for scans are at their highest in seven years while a report by mps warned of â unacceptable â variation in care
data analysed by macmillan shows that 81 per cent of breast cancer sufferers in britain survive five years
this is a lower rate than france , sweden and italy in the late 1990s , when the figure was 83 per cent
in these countries the survival rates are now 86 per cent or higher
for bowel cancer , 54 per cent of britain can expect to survive five years , whereas in the late 1990s it was already 59 per cent in finland and 55 per cent in norway , the netherlands and france
the five - year survival rate for lung cancer here is currently 10 per cent but in several countries , including austria , germany and italy , it was at 11 per cent by the late 1990s
lynda thomas , chief executive of macmillan cancer support , said : â frankly , this is shameful
what we can see here is that better cancer survival rates are not unachievable
â if countries like sweden , france , finland and austria can achieve these rates , then the britain can , and should , bridge the gap
â experts are not sure why our figures remain so far behind but it may partly be that doctors are not detecting the illness early enough , before it has spread to other organs
it may also be down to patients not being offered the newest , most effective drugs nor the latest surgical procedures , which are routinely available in other countries
this is particularly true for the elderly who are often denied chemotherapy or surgery on the grounds that they are considered too frail
experts are worried improvements made to survival rates have stalled because the nhs can not cope with the ever - increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer
it is estimated that about half of us will get cancer at some point in our lifetimes
the figures are taken from a comparison of survival rates of european countries carried out by researchers at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , known as the â concord programme â
meanwhile , the latest monthly nhs statistics showed 18,740 patients waited longer than six weeks for tests to diagnose cancer such as x-rays , ct scans or ultrasounds â up 40 per cent in a year and the worst figure since february 2008
it follows a report by mps warning of â unacceptable â and â unexplained â variation in cancer detection and treatment across nhs england â particularly for the elderly
sean duffy , of nhs england , said : â we are diagnosing and treating more people than ever before and as a result the nhs is helping more people than ever survive cancer
