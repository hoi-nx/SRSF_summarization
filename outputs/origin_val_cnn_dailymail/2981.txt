with its green spaces , pavilions and cafes , this planned redevelopment of the manhattan waterfront looks like any other city regeneration project
but in fact the plans have been designed with a far more serious goal in mind â to protect the island and its 1.6 million residents from a repeat of the devastation wreaked by hurricane sandy in 2012
the 10 miles of parkland and public open space that skirt in a u-shape around manhattan will in fact be used to camouflage raised barriers and deployable walls that will be essential to battle rising waters in the event of a storm
the project by danish designers , the big ( big ) , aims to create a protective ribbon around lower manhattan , shielding buildings from flood and storm surges
it shows how the manhattan coastline will be defended from floodwater by use of a series of berms or raised shelves
deployable walls , clever planting , kiosks , sport areas , cycle routes and walkways have also been incorporated into the scheme that will defend the city
when fully completed the ambitious project will run from west 57th street , down to the battery park and up to east 42nd street
' you wo n't see it as a flood wall that separates the life of the city from the water , ' bjarke ingels told dezeen
an sirr report recommends eight continuous miles of integrated coastal protection around manhattan after hurricane sandy the flooded defences should prevent flooding like that scene seen in manhattan in the wake of hurricane sandy in 2012 and also double as leisure amenities before and after : the bridging berm will provide ' robust vertical protection ' for the lower east side from future storm surges and rising sea levels
pictured : existing condition , left , and improved condition , right this is the big 's long term vision for the bridging berm , which will be transformed as part of the first phase of the scheme phase one : the bridging beam will create vistas over the lower east side of manhattan that visitors will be able to use to relax , socialize and enjoy river views there are also plans for outdoor public pools , similar to the harbour baths in copenhagen , to be incorporated into the proposals on 10th street as part of the bridging berm alongside the bridging berm a new scenic cycle way will be created for bike riders to enjoy on the banks of the manhattan shoreline this bridge , right , and the view of east river park , left , will be improved as part of the first ambitious of the project to protect manhattan the bridging berm or shelf will provide robust protection for the lower east side from future storm surge and rising sea levels
this shows an accessible ramp connection that will make the greenspace available to all between the manhattan bridge and montgomery street , deployable walls are attached to the underside of the fdr drive , ready to flip down to prepare for flood events
how the flip downs would work in the event of flood water surging towards manhattan and the homes and businesses ' when you go there you 'll see landscape , you 'll see pavilions , but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects manhattan from flooding
' hurricane sandy left parts of new york in ruin when it battered the us eastern seaboard in october 2012 , damaging 305,000 homes and leaving in its wake $ 19 billion worth of destruction
the dryline was one of six winning projects chosen as part of the hud 's ( hud ) rebuild by design competition
in fact , big was the only company to bid to create flood defences for manhattan
' it was a bit like going to a big dance , ' mr bjarke ingels , told the guardian
' no one picks the pretties girl because they are all a bit shy
' in total $ 920 million was allocated to the winning schemes across the hurricane sandy - affected regions of new york , new jersey and new york

there are also now proposals to create the world 's first underground park , known as the low line , in an abandoned trolley terminal below the lower east side
as part of the manhattan dryline project , original called the big u , the design team interviewed residents and local business owner 's to ensure their plans would benefit the local communities
as a result the defences may take the form of a grassy knoll in one area , but public community space in another
the almost 90 degree angle of the new york ' bight ' acts as a funnel directing storm surges directly into the heart of the city this image show how hurricanes are becoming more and more frequent as the earth grows hotter ' we 're doing it in a way that will be in dialogue with all the neighborhoods along the big u , so that what we 're doing will never be perceived as a war zone , or a piece of resilience infrastructure , ' mr bjarke ingels previously told wired
' when you go there in the future you will see amenities that are tailored to the neighborhoods
undulating landscapes , street furniture , pavilions , that are part of an environmental and social program
' the project is set to be completed in three phases
the first phases , has been granted $ 335million funding from hud , and will redevelop the lower east side
it will involving raising a 15ft tall bridging berm that will cut through east river park and provide a barrier to protect low - lying ground , according to the guardian
the dryline project also features plans for swimming pools , aquariums , pavilions , and parks the scheme , created by the big ( big ) , has been created with the help of local communities when fully completed the ambitious scheme will create new public open spaces running from west 57th street , down to the battery park and up to east 42nd street the design includes open spaces and sports areas that people will be able to use in good weather bjarke ingels said : ' when you go there you 'll see landscape , you 'll see pavilions , but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects manhattan from flooding
' spanning a mile - and - a - half long , the earthen berm will provide a ' robust vertical protection ' from future storm surges and rising sea levels
it will also offers accessible routes into the park and provide space for relaxing , socializing , and enjoying views of the park and river
between manhattan bridge and montgomery street deployable walls will be attached to the underside of the fdr drive , ready to flip down to prepare for flood events
the panels will be decorated by local artists and provide a colourful ceiling above the east river esplanade when not in use
the east and west boundaries of the battery , that were key inlets during hurricane sandy , and led to the flooding of manhattan and close down the financial district
according to the plans by big - in partnership with one architecture , starr whitehouse , james lima planning + development , level infrastructure , burohappold , arcadis , green shield ecology , aea consulting , project projects and the school of constructed environments at parsons - a berm and a series of knolls will not just provide protection , but also a place where people can sunbath , farm and garden
fishing piers , an aquarium , swimming pools and pavilions are also said to feature in the 10 - mile long scheme
the first phase of the project could be completed within in five years , new york mayor bill de blasio told the new york post last year
hurricane sandy battered the us in october 2012 and caused over $ 19 billion dollars worth of damage at the time us president barack obama declared the situation a ' major disaster ' flood waters from hurricane sandy rushing into the port authority trans-hudson station in october 2012
