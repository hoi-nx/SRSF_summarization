martin ' mad dog ' allen returns with his latest column for sportsmail
the barnet manager admires jose mourinho 's courage in playing kurt zouma against tottenham but takes aim at the sluggish strikers currently masquerading as manchester united stars
mourinho 's got balls ! chelsea manager jose mourinho threw kurt zouma in against tottenham to shield the back four , to stifle and stop the opposition in the capital one cup final
they were rewarded with a clean sheet
how many managers would have the confidence to play a centre - back in central midfield in a cup final at wembley ? in front of 90,000 fans and millions watching across the country - across the world
it must be said , jose mourinho âs game management is second - to - none
it was no surprise that their goal in that game came from a set play and their second on the counter attack
jose mourinho 's game management is second - to - none , particularly when it matters most he soaks up the pressure , waits for the game to open up and frustrate the opposition
he knows within his ranks he has game winners who will score
the work ethic he has drawn from those technically brilliant players is astounding
his ranting and raving about the injustices from referees puts pressure on the officials into giving chelsea better decisions
he is the master at it and keeps all the attention and focus off his player
but above all , he âs got balls
the chelsea manager threw youngster kurt zouma in to protect the back four against tottenham slipping at the top the pressure , the anxiety , the expectancy , not rotating enough ? what is it about the top teams slipping up at this point in the season ? getting close to the finishing line , you start looking over your shoulder
we all know running a race it âs better to chase a person in front than to be looking behind you
i do nât know the answers , i wish i did
in the championship we âve seen bournemouth fall from the top , wycombe wanderers have done in league two , my club barnet have fallen behind in the conference
even jose mourinho âs chelsea had a blip , although they are managing it well
we see it right across all sports
we see it in golf in the masters every sunday night at amen âs corner
we see it when cricketers get into the 90s and are chasing a century
we see it in darts when the players start missing doubles
over the next two months , the teams who come out on top will be the ones with the goal - scorers , who maintain their self belief throughout it all
eddie howe has seen his bournemouth side slip away from the top of the championship recently manchester united âs sluggish strike force how slow is radamel falcao ? and robin van persie has lost half a yard of pace from his days at arsenal
you ca nât fault radamel falcao for his work ethic and atittude
he most definitely has that
but he lacks a yard or two of explosive speed
manchester united have crept up on to the shoulders of the champions league places , but there is far from enough pace and athletic ability in the group to make it into the top four
radamel falcao has failed to hit the ground running and appeared slow in a manchester united shirt robin van persie seems to have lost half - a - yard of pace under louis van gaal at old trafford one person i keep hearing about ... darrell clarke , bristol rovers boss darrell clarke has grafted through the lower levels where he had success
as a player he was at mansfield town , hartlepool united and city
he âs a young manager , only 37 - years - old , who has done a magnificent job galvanising rovers after relegation from league two
it showed how much it meant to him when he was reduced to tears after they were relegated out of the football league for the first time in the club âs history last season
they have kept thousands of very passionate supporters this season and he has guided them to the top of the conference table
he is a manager to look out for in the future
bristol rovers manager darrell clarke has grafted through the lower levels and enjoyed success one thing i 'd change about ... golden eye i think there should be a referee in the stand , who has the opportunity to stop play and call back decisions in exceptional circumstances
an extra set of eyes on the pitch
it is something may be to look at for the future
on big decisions in penalty boxes and major incidents there should be a referee in the stand with access to video replays to review key decisions within games
penalties , sending offs , balls over the line , the odd elbow here and there
if the are in contact with the referee they can give him a heads up
things happen so quickly it âs often so difficult for the officials to make the right decision
of course the game would just carry on as normal , but if there was something missed or that the referee or the linesmen got wrong then the man in the middle can get help from golden eye in the stands
something sooner or later has got to be done to help these referees who are now getting criticised left , right and centre every week by managers across the board
roger east ( sending off sunderland 's wes brown ) would 've benefited from an extra official at old trafford the big issue ... manchester city 's squad i must say i do like mr manuel pellegrini
he is cool , he is calm and he managed to put out a lot of fires that were raging in that manchester city dressing room after taking over from roberto mancini
it does make me smile when so many so - called experts totally annihilate his tactics , most of whom have never even managed at any level
criticising him for playing two up front and getting out - numbered and out - played in midfield
last year , he won the premier league
so is he really , seriously tactically inept ? he would have his reasons for what is going on there , but clearly it is not working
manuel pellegrini has struggled in the defence of his premier league crown with manchester city captain vincent kompany has n't been able to continue his sterling form at the back for city however , it it not always just about the tactics of the manager
there is clearly something missing in the dna of the city squad
they look lacklustre and without real fire in their belly
and when you âre dropping your captain , your talisman , it is yet another big , brave decision from the man i always regard with the utmost respect
it looks to me like he needs to move a few on , to move city forward up to the next level .
