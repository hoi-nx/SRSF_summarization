ed miliband yesterday left the door open to a labour - snp coalition after the general election â as the latest polls point to a â braveheart battalion â of nationalists storming westminster
in a speech to party members in edinburgh , led by jim murphy , the labour leader ignored calls from his own frontbench , led by shadow chancellor ed balls and health spokesman andy burnham , to rule out a deal with nicola sturgeon âs party
last week a poll by tory peer lord ashcroft put the snp on track to increase its representation at westminster to 56 of scotland âs 59 seats , up from just six seats now
they include tommy sheppard in edinburgh east who , as the mail on sunday has previously reported , left aggressive messages about the monarchy during the royal wedding â including the line â off with their heads â â and mhairi black , aged just 20 , who has talked about headbutting her labour opponents in mhairi black-paisley
the snp âs projected success could cancel out labour gains in other parts of the britain , leading to a dead - heat between the two main parties â and allowing nationalists to play â kingmakers â
many labour mps think the only way to avert a humiliating collapse is for mr ed miliband to tell voters he wo nât deal with the nationalists , to persuade anti- conservative voters that a vote for him is the only way to remove cameron from downing street
however mr ed miliband barely mentioned the snp at the labour spring conference
the labour leader said : â the tory could wreak havoc in scotland without winning a majority by being in government as the largest party
â tommy sheppard - edinburgh east tommy sheppard is an unreconstructed republican who tweeted â off with their heads â during the royal wedding in april 2011 and said â this might be a good time to declare a provisional government â
unreconstructed republican : tommy sheppard mhairi black-paisley and south the student , who is tipped to beat the shadow foreign secretary douglas alexander at the age of just 20 â which would make her the britain 's youngest mp â wants to headbutt â fat - cat labour councillors â and tweets about her boozy antics
future mp ? 20 - year - old student mhairi black caithness , sutherland and easter ross paul monaghan was suspended in 2008 from his job as head of planning and development at northern constabulary , a scotland police force , after circulating an unflattering email about his boss
paul monaghan : caithness , sutherland and easter ross martin docherty-dunbartonshire west martin docherty issued a call to arms to nationalist supporters in january , with the volunteer activist urging voters to take the opportunity to â hold westminster âs feet to the fire â
martin docherty : dunbartonshire west tasmina ahmed and south the ex-soap actress was a tory and then briefly a labour party member before she signed up to the snp
as a tory she described alex salmond as â hopelessly out of his depth â
ex-soap actress : tasmina ahmed - sheikh alison thewliss - glasgow central alison thewliss boasted that she used labour campaign literature to wipe her bottom
the councillor , who could topple former labour deputy leader anas sarwar , also wrote in 2007 about her labour rivals : â can i hope some of them keel over ? â glasgow central : alison thewliss phil boswell - coatbridge , chryston and bellshill phil boswell posted messages on social media last month praising anarchy in greeks
the oil engineer said : â it âs about time we did like the greeks and disempowered the corrupt self - serving establishment parties
â phil boswell : coatbridge , chryston and bellshill george kerevan - east lothian the former member of the international marxist group told november âs snp conference that the britain has a â disastrous economy whose banking system is an organised criminal conspiracy â
george kerevan : east lothian but he failed to spell out whether his own party would be willing to strike a deal with another party if it does not win a majority
mr cameron responded by raising the spectre of a left - wing axis between labour and the snp
he said : â if you thought the worst outcome for this election was a labour government led by ed miliband , think again
' you could end up with a labour government led by ed miliband â propped up by the snp â an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt britain and the people who want to break up britain
' and even today , ed miliband will not rule out a deal or backing from the snp
if he cares about this country he should do so
â an snp spokesman said : â the snp are fielding an excellent team of candidates to give scotland a powerful voice in the house of commons
