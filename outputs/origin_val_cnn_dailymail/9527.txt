over the past two years , the duo â real names anthony mcpartlin and declan donnelly â have starred in a series of morrisons campaigns they 're the nation âs favourite hosts of saturday night tv , but cheeky chappies ant and dec will no longer be the face of struggling supermarket chain morrisons , the mail on sunday can reveal
over the past two years , the duo â real names anthony mcpartlin and declan donnelly â have starred in a series of morrisons campaigns
but now they and the retailer have parted company , ripping up their multi-million advertising deal
and last night there was mystery over who exactly had ended the relationship
sources close to ant and dec said they had been offered another 12 - month contract but turned it down
however , business insiders told the mail on sunday that morrisons would not renew the deal because it wants future advertising to emphasise its value credentials and the quality of its food , which the duo no longer represent
analyst bryan roberts , of market research firm kantar retail , said : â in marketing terms , this is absolutely the right thing to do
' people turn on the television and see two incredibly wealthy lads being well paid to advertise a supermarket which is supposed to be helping us save money
â people are far more savvy these days and they can make that connection
and chairman andy higginson said it had slashed the value of its property portfolio by Â£ 1.3 billion
both morrisons and ant and dec declined to comment on the decision
sources said the supermarket chain decided not to renew the advertising contract with the pair
