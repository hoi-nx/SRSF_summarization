a city in southern chinese has banned any new restaurants from making one of the region 's most popular dishes in a bid to control its rising air pollution problem
firewood chicken has become a popular delicacy in kunming , regional capital of yunnan province , with dozens of restaurants springing up in the last few months to offer the dish
local officials have decided to stop licensing new firewood chicken restaurants and ordered existing premises to burn a more environmentally friendly fuel , according to the people 's daily online
officials in chinese have banned restaurants from making firewood chicken because they believe burning lots of firewood to create the popular dish releases too many pollutants into the already smog - filled air in cities to create the dish , large quantities of firewood are burned every day to cook chicken for around 40 minutes
a 2.5kg chicken takes between 1.5 to 2.5kg of firewood to cook
it is estimated that for a restaurant with a capacity of around 30 diners around 550kg of firewood would be burned during busy periods , and this would have a huge impact on air quality
a spokesman for xishan district environmental protection bureau said ' no new applications for firewood chicken restaurants are being accepted and this has been the case for almost a year already
' many entrepreneurs have recently tried to open firewood chicken restaurants but we have rejected them all
' he added that restaurants which had opened in the last year and were awaiting approval were operating illegally
air pollution has long been a problem in chinese , where cities are often overcome with thick smog existing restaurants will now be required to use more environmentally friendly fuels , such as charcoal
chinese 's ' air pollution prevention law ' stipulates that : coal , pulverized coal , combustible waste , direct burning of biomass fuels ( trees , straw , sawdust , rice husk etc ) are all high - polluting fuels
the cooking process of firewood chicken comes under the new restrictions
some restaurants in kunming have already opted for more environmentally friendly options , with one restaurant in guannan road using the greener charcoal option
southasia garden firewood chicken restaurant simply uses gas and serves the dish in earth pots to give it an authentic taste
chinese has for years been hit by heavy air pollution , caused by enormous use of coal to generate electricity to power a booming economy - the world 's second largest - and more vehicles on the roads
air pollution is increasingly acute in chinese cities , including in wuhan in central chinese 's hubei province it has become a major source of popular discontent among chinese citizens , leading the government to declare a ' war on pollution ' and vow to reduce the proportion of energy derived from fossil fuels
earlier this month under the dome , a film about the country 's notorious smog , went viral with more than 155 million views in just one day .
