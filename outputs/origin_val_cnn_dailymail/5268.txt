at my current vintage , 62 , my mother was content to spend her days playing golf , perhaps a rubber of bridge , popping in on the grandchildren , then spending the evening watching tv
in the past seven days , by contrast , i âve attended a leaving party for friends in their late 50s who are starting a new life in the country ; given a presentation on post-war art and the politics of memory to fellow undergraduates on my part - time degree course ; drooled over ralph fiennes in his latest theatre production ; and hosted supper for some girlfriends â finding time , in between , to buy a pair of skinny jeans and get my roots tinted
like most women of my age , i âm occasionally exhausted , but in the main , engaged , active and having as much ( if not more ) fun than ever
linda kelsey says aged 62 she is occasionally exhausted but is very active and having more fun than ever so , i ca nât understand why mariella frostrup â a woman who is smart , successful , has the voice of a vamp and looks that make men of most ages go weak at the knees â has declared herself , at a mere 52 , the poster girl for the fed up 50 - something brigade
despite the evidence to the contrary , mariella frostrup thinks women over 50 are the hard done by generation
â politicians do nât talk to us , â she moans
we are nât sold music or movies , fashion or cosmetics , aside from â miracle â creams promising to reduce wrinkles so we dare show our unsightly faces in public
â it simply is nât so , mariella frostrup
julianne moore , 54 , has won an oscar , julie walters , 65 , has stolen the limelight from the young , good - looking cast of channel 4 âs indian summers and 50 shades of grey , based on the books of e. l. james , 51 , has become the highest grossing 18 - plus film ever
monica bellucci , 50 , is smouldering away as the latest bond girl , 65 - year - old twiggy is fronting a magazine cover and new beauty campaign , and theresa may , 58 , is said to be in the running as a potential next leader of the tory party
all this as the second best exotic marigold hotel , full of fabulous oldies , promises to outdo the success of the first on the ( truly ) silver screen
mariella frostrup , 52 ( pictured ) , thinks women over 50 are the hard done by generation having conflated her existential angst at turning 50 with what she perceives is going on in society at large , mariella frostrup seems to have missed the blindingly obvious fact that older women have never been so visible â or so courted
not just by politicians , who know the grey vote is the most likely to turn out at the ballot box
but now we âre worth more than a bob or two ( over- 50s represent 76 per cent of the nation âs wealth ) , by retailers and advertisers who realise we âre worth wooing because of , and despite , our wrinkles
that makes me grateful , not grumpy
compared with our mothers â generation , there âs been a seismic shift in attitudes
even if there âs still a way to go we should be recognising that whole new windows of opportunity have opened up
julianne moore , 54 ( pictured ) , won the best actress accolade at this year 's oscar like mariella frostrup , i remember that turning 50 can feel like the beginning of the end
yet when i saw older friends were getting on with their lives with added relish , i was determined to enter my new half - century with cocktails and laughter
to paraphrase noel coward : to hell with what comes after
i hired a marquee and invited 100 family and friends to eat , drink and dance the night away
the party broke up at 3am when the police shut us down because the music was annoying neighbours three streets away
of course , there are real physical and psychological reasons why hitting the big five - 0 may be a wobbly moment in a woman âs life
julie walters , 65 ( pictured ) , has stolen the limelight from the rest of the cast of channel 4 âs indian summers while the menopause can be liberating , it carries a sense of loss of possibilities as well ; at least it did for me
not to mention it saw me stop sleeping and take up sweating and flushing bright red for three years
but while former generations had to suffer in silence , with hrt and alternative remedies and therapies , we can at least alleviate some of the symptoms
my 50s were nât without their fair share of turbulence
at 55 , my 23 - year relationship came to an end after my husband announced he needed a gap year and never came back
my darling dad died that same year
my only son left the nest shortly after and i had emergency surgery for a blockage in my intestines that nearly killed me
but determined not to be defeated , i set myself a bucket list , including writing a novel ( i published three ) and learning to sing ( sadly , my voice is as awful as ever )
i started walking an hour a day , and went back to university to study art and literature , one of the most stimulating and satisfying things i âve ever done
monica bellucci , 50 ( pictured ) , is the latest bond girl and will star in the new 007 film , spectre and after my marriage breakdown , i was overawed to find out love can flower at any age and sex can be better than ever
i was 56 when i met my partner , ronny , a year after my husband walked out
all these things i did or discovered because , as a woman in my 50s , i still could
how different it was for my mother âs generation , who seemed to accept that slowing down was inevitable in their 50s
â you do too much , you need to rest , â is my 87 - year - old mother âs mantra
in some ways , we women in our 50s and beyond are nât just luckier than our mothers , we âre also luckier than the men of our own generation
as we go downhill physically , we have an arsenal of hair dye , skincare and make - up at our disposal , and can even have work done if we âre all that bothered
as for fashion , i do nât resent the fact that i ca nât suit all the latest trends
these days i stick to tried - and - tested shapes and styles that work for me â there are plenty of retailers supplying them
there âs still so much i plan to do
there âs another novel to write
a masters degree once i âve collected my ba later this year
65 - year - old twiggy ( pictured ) is fronting a magazine cover and new beauty campaign if some of the ads aimed my way are the saga cruises mariella frostrup objects to , that also does nât bother me â my partner and i have planned our american road trip this summer with the help of the internet rather than a package tour
m y friends are nât being put out to pasture , either
one of my closest , who âs just turned 65 , was devastated when her husband left three years ago after 40 years
but after dabbling with internet dating she met a lovely new beau
mariella frostrup âs portrayal of older women feels outmoded and overplayed â not to mention the route to becoming self - obsessed and feeling terminally sorry for ourselves
getting old is impossible to imagine when you âre young
but then getting old is not what it used to be
the truth is we older women have never had it so good and the opportunities to turn this stage of the game into the time of our lives have never been more abundant
we should all be celebrating , not complaining .
