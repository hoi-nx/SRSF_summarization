the leader of the islam group who defended isis executioner mohammed emwazi has sparked further outrage after he refused to condemn the stoning women
asim qureshi , the director of cage , was last night quizzed about extremist positions advocated by islam scholars - including female genital mutilation , domestic violence and stoning as a punishment for adultery
but mr asim qureshi , appearing on the bbc 's this week programme , failed to speak out against the practices - while also defending the right of muslims to wage jihad
it comes after he defended the london - raised fanatic mohammed emwazi - unmasked as the infamous fanatic ' jihadi john ' - as a ' beautiful , kind man '
' we know that it is incumbent upon all of us , to support the jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the west
february 26 , 2015 : mohammed emwazi was an â extremely gentle , kind , beautiful young man '
he was â extremely kind , extremely gentle and the most humble young person i ever knew â
march 3 , 2015 : ' what we want is to understand whether or not the security agencies , their actions , led to him feeling like he does not belong to britain society
we never said there is a direct causality
â march 5 , 2015 : " jihad is part of the religion of islam
" pressed by neil , the show 's presenter , to condemn a series of extreme positions , including claims that jews are descended from pigs and homosexuality is evil
he responded ' i 'm not a theologian ' before adding : ' i have absolutely no idea what you are talking about
' mr neil accused mr asim qureshi of advocating jihad and sharia law
mr asim qureshi responded : ' as far as i am concerned , sharia law is n't practised correctly anywhere in the world
jihad is part of the religion of islam
' he repeated his criticism of mi5 and the security services , claiming they helped to radicalise young islam men by mistreating them
former home secretary johnson said his remarks showed ' what we are up against in terms of the ' moderate front '
the exchange came after london mayor boris johnson accused mr asim qureshi of being an apologist for terror
mr asim qureshi last week described london - raised fanatic mohammed emwazi â accused of being the infamous ' johadi john ' in the isis beheading videos - as an ' extremely kind ' and ' extremely gentle ' man who had been radicalised as a result of harassment by security agencies
the cage research director said he believed the approach taken by the agents was ' a factor in the reason why he felt like he did n't belong in the britain any more '
mr johnson responded : ' i really , really think that the focus of your indignation and outrage should be on people who go out to join groups that throw gays off cliffs , that behead people who do n't subscribe to their version of islam , that glorify in the execution of innocent journalists and aid workers
mr asim qureshi â who last week described the britain fanatic mohammed emwazi unmasked as jihadi john , as a ' beautiful young man ' - ' these should be the object of your wrath , not the security services who are trying to keep us safe
' mr asim qureshi , 33 , has revealed the he became ' anti-white ' at the Â£ 18,000 - a - year whitgift school in croydon , south london , which he attended as a child
the controversial campaign chief was born in britain to pakistani parents and â thanks to his mother 's ice - cream business â was sent to 400 - year - old whitgift
jihadi jihadi john 's sister is ' living in fear ' after receiving death threats , a close friend said today
student shayma , 23 , has been tracked and abused on facebook , forcing her to close her account
she and the rest of mohammed emwazi 's family are now living under police protection in a secret location after mohammed emwazi was unmasked as jihadi john
a friend of shayma told the evening standard : ' they are struggling to live a normal life
' shayma came back from holiday not too long ago to all of this drama which occurred overnight
she does not deserve to be blamed for her brother 's evil actions
' the only thing she and mohammed emwazi have in common is that they are blood , but she is not a terrorist
