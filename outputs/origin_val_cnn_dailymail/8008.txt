exposure causes immediate reddening and blistering to her skin she has since been diagnosed with multiple allergies and conditions including solar dermatitis , vasodilation disorder and chronic actinic dermatitis the 18 - year - old said : ' being allergic to the sun and heat has meant i ca n't lead a normal life like any other teenager
' instead i 've become nocturnal to escape the sun. ' people often think i 'm lying , but it 's absolutely devastating
' all i want to do is simple things in life like walk to the shops or learn how to drive
' while she had always suffered from skin problems , autumn 's condition began to cause severe complications when she was 13 - and suffered a severe reaction to the sun. ' i 'd only been out there for ten minutes but my shoulders burnt so badly that my dad compared me to a human candle , ' she recalled
' it was as though my skin was melting and i was inconsolable - the pain was horrendous
' that 's when i think we all knew that something was really wrong as no - one burns like that , it was n't normal
' autumn went to see various doctors and dermatologists before undergoing dozens of tests - including one to see if she was allergic to the family 's pets
she has since been diagnosed with multiple allergies and conditions including solar dermatitis , vasodilation disorder and chronic actinic dermatitis
she said : ' all of the different allergies and conditions combined are crippling and make life extremely difficult
' even when i go to the hospital or doctors i go beetroot red , because the lights in the waiting rooms are so fluorescent
' indeed , any uv light or temperature change can cause her skin to dry , crack and come out in hives and lesions which are extremely painful
autumn 's condition has left her confined to home for fear of a painful attack ; she ca n't even attend school while she had always suffered from skin problems , autumn 's condition began to cause severe complications when she was 13 - and suffered a severe reaction to the sun after 10 minutes in the sun as a young teenager , she suffered a severe reaction
' it was as though my skin was melting and i was inconsolable - the pain was horrendous , ' she said she added : ' it took a long time for me to be diagnosed and i had to wait over six months to see a leading specialist
' in this time i was prescribed steroid tablets but disastrously they made me put on six stone in a really short space of time
' i was unrecognisable and developed two near fatal conditions on top of everything else
' as autumn 's condition became worse her parents had to make the tough decision to home school her
she said : ' school became hard as no - one understood what was wrong and people judged me
matthew gass , spokesperson for the british association of dermatologists said : ' solar urticaria describes a relatively rare type of urticarial ( also known as hives and weals ) which is induced by exposing your skin to sunlight
' while it can start at any age , it appears to be those aged between 20 and 40 who are most affected
' solar urticaria is caused by the release of histamine from cells in the skin called mast cells
' the main symptoms of solar urticaria are itching , stinging and burning
' rarely the rash is accompanied by symptoms such as headache , nausea , vomiting , breathing difficulties and low blood pressure
' taking measures to avoid to sunlight exposure is important to prevent its occurrence and you can do simple things like wear sun cream , sensible clothing , gloves , photo protective window films and take antihistamines
' ' i began to miss most lessons as the florescent lights everywhere were causing me to react and i could n't escape the daylight
' it was easier to learn from home and over time we 've managed to get my allergies somewhat under control
' her typical day now consists of waking up at 5pm
' my dinner has become my breakfast and i stay up all night chatting to people from australia , ' she explained
' i paint a lot to pass the time while everyone else sleeps and it 's become a real passion of mine
' i ca n't really remember life before my allergies , but i wish i could do normal things other people are doing my age
' she has been told that as she gets older , the allergies should calm down - but she still worries about the future
even as a child , autumn suffered with skin problems
she had eczema by the time she was just six weeks old , but her parents , andy and sally , dismissed it and thought it was just irritated skin as she was born healthy with no complications
mr everitt-brick , 45 , a freelance software developer said : ' from the age of three , autumn 's skin gradually became more and more irritated
' we just did n't know what was wrong with her , we tried everything to sooth her skin but it would always dry out again and become really sore
' it 's horrible watching your little girl grow up and not being able to help or know what 's wrong
' it 's so tragic as autumn is now 18 and she should be able to go out and socialise and not be stuck in her room hiding behind curtains
' he added that despite being well educated , his daughter has been unable to sit her exams due to the fluorescent lighting in exam halls
' she 's really bright but it means she has minimal chances of employment , as well as her being asleep all day and awake all night , ' he said autumn ( pictured ) has been told that as she gets older , the allergies should calm down - but she still worries about the future the main symptoms of solar urticaria are itching , stinging and burning
sometimes the rash is accompanied by symptoms such as headache , nausea , vomiting , breathing difficulties and low blood pressure autumn 's family has now begun fundraising to try and help autumn lead a normal life
' until now we 've worked extremely hard to do support our daughter on our own , ' her father said
' but being self - employed is tough sometimes and we ca n't afford the small things that would make a huge difference to autumn 's life
' we would like to get uv films for the windows so we can all look outside and know she 's safe
' even uv safe clothing would mean she could go outside in the day when her friends are out
' there are a number of things that could help
' despite all of this though autumn is brilliant , she always puts other first , she even donated her hair to the little princess trust last year
' we are so proud of her , we just want to do everything we can to help her
