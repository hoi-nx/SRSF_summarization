craig gordon once sweated anxiously in a television studio while scotland toiled at hampden to see off one of the smallest nations in world football
come sunday , he sincerely hopes the national side will not put viewers through a similar experience when gibraltar come calling
craig gordon , then sidelined by a fractured arm , accepted the offer to turn pundit for the evening as liechtenstein visited glasgow for a euro 2012 qualifier in september 2010
craig gordon hopes scotland will not put fans through the tense evening against gibraltar it was a decision he began to regret as craig levein âs side entered injury - time facing utter humiliation with a 1 - 1 scoreline
only thanks to a 97th - minute header from stephen mcmanus was craig gordon spared the most awkward possible piece of post-match analysis
â i was in a television studio the night of the liechtenstein game , â he recalled
â that was a different life i had back then
â towards the end i was sitting there worried what i was going to say at full - time to defend the rest of the boys
craig gordon can expect a quiet evening on sunday when scotland face minnows gibraltar â so thankfully we managed to grind it out because i do nât know what i would have said if we âd drawn that one
â when stephen mcmanus scored i jumped out of my seat in the studio because it was hugely important to get that win
â that night is a reminder of what can happen in any game of football
it can be difficult and at this level you do nât want to lose a goal to give yourself an uphill task
â if you do that it can get edgy so we âre well aware of the need for a fast start on sunday and a good tempo so we can take care of things
â these are the games we have to win and historically it has nât been that easy for us
â getting the win is what we have to focus on first and foremost
stephen mcmanus spared scotland 's blushes with late winner against liechtenstein in 2010 â if we can do that then looking to score a few goals comes afterwards â but winning the game is the main thing
â craig gordon made his first scotland start in more than four years when he played the first half of wednesday night âs 1 - 0 friendly win over northern ireland before being replaced by allan mcgregor
however , with david marshall having served as gordon strachan âs more regular no 1 , he has no idea whether he will form what should be an untroubled last line of defence against gibraltar
â it was great to stand out there and sing the national anthem again , â said craig gordon
â you âd always prefer to play the first half rather than the second
â it was just good to get back out there , though
it was enjoyable and both keepers got a clean sheet
â i do nât know what will happen on sunday â the manager will decide that
â he told us about the northern ireland game on wednesday morning and i âm sure it will be the same again at the weekend
