mooyman turned her back on a glamorous life as a model and swapped it for a job in the iron ore mines of western australian , which has earned her enough money to buy her three investment properties
the 25 - year - old started modelling from a young age and often saw her face plastered on promotional nightclub and festival posters
ms mooyman , from bunbury in western australian , made the unusual career switch at the age of 19 when she became a mobile plant operator at a mineral sands mine in cataby
mooyman used to be a promotional model but now she drives heavy machinery in the mines after six years behind the wheel of heavy machinery , ms mooyman , who is now a fully qualified operator , is adamant she can hold her own - despite working in such a predominately male industry
' i was a little nervous first coming into this work , being so isolated from everyone into such a small area grouped together with mainly blokes around , ' she said
' but i survived my first couple of shifts and an older lady took me under her wing
' we started having after work drinks with my crew and that 's when the potty mouth started
i was now just one of the guys holding my ground not taking any of their nonsense
' you just need to learn to speak up and do n't take their jibes seriously and you 'll be fine
' at 19 , she decided to leave the modelling industry ( right ) behind and head to the mines at cataby in western australian ( left ) she is now a fully qualified mobile plant operator at a mineral sands mine because she wanted to do something new and exciting ms mooyman said she wanted to move into the mining industry as it was ' something so new and exciting ' with ' heaps to be learnt '
' once i started i was earning more than i ever did locally and loved being outdoors all day
i could n't imagine doing anything else , ' she said
' it 's definitely not for all men and women as there are so many downsides to being away
' ms mooyman said she left the modelling industry because she needed a more stable profession
' i started modelling at a young age but it was never serious enough for me to take it up further , ' she said
' when i was 18 years old i did a lot of promotional modelling night clubs , festivals and concerts in the perth area
ms mooyman ( pictured left and right ) said she earned more working at the mines than she ever did locally ' this involved photo shoots for particular venues to use for advertising purposes so i was plastered on posters for events also wearing certain outfits
' but i was paying off loans and needed a change of job so a friend helped me out
' now mooyman has three investment properties and is hoping her successful stint at the mine will help her set - up a life with her partner
she said she was grateful for the opportunities given to her , but she realised it was not for everyone
now mooyman has three investment properties and is hoping her successful stint at the mine will help her set - up a life with her partner ' in no time i 'd developed skills to operate a large variety of machines such as excavators , loaders , dump trucks , water carts , tractors and forklifts - you name it , i 've driven it , ' she said
' i 've been contracted to work on a variety of sites including gin gin , eneabba and local areas around perth
' these would be a few weeks at a time working solo to get a job complete so i was stuck at the mines for long periods at a time
' it can be very isolating
being stuck in a tiny bedroom is n't for everyone
' but it 's been a great step for me and something that i never knew i 'd end up doing
