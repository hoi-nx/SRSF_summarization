marvel is going back to war
the massively popular superhero entertainment factory has the third " captain america " movie on the way , " civil war , " which will include iron man and quite possibly , the new spider-man
it 's based on a story arc from almost a decade ago , which tackled issues of freedom versus security , with the two heroes going toe to toe against one another
this summer , marvel plans to revisit that storyline as part of the much larger return of " secret wars , " its biggest crossover event of the 1980s
the effects of this will be huge to the comics , ending 33 of the company 's titles
cnn spoke to writer charles soule , who has gained acclaim for his work on " superman / wonder woman , " " swamp thing , " the death of wolverine , " " she-hulk " and more
he gave us the scoop on the return of " civil war , " one year before it hits the big screen
cnn : what can fans expect from your " civil war " storyline ? soule : " secret wars " is an opportunity to revisit some of the great marvel stories of the past
one of those is " civil war , " and i got the call to work on that
" civil war " happened in 2006 and 2007 , and in that story captain america and iron man went after each other based on an ideological difference on superheroes in the world
what i 'm doing is taking that story in a different direction
cnn : will this be a way for those who are interested in the upcoming movie to dive into that story ? soule : absolutely
if you look at the ideas that that story had , iron man thought superheroes should have to register with the government , and become something of a police force
captain america thought that that was restricting the central freedoms of this country
it was a debate of security versus freedom
we 're taking that basic idea and expanding it to a larger canvas
the registration act is all in the past at this point
it 's more of a world drastically changed based on a superhero war , and it 's a huge story and it 's fun to be able to involve every marvel character there is
cnn : is this one of the biggest stories you 've worked on ? soule : i 've been on big books but this one feels huge
it affects every character in one way or another , and it deals with some central issues to the modern world
that 's not always something you get to do in a marvel story
cnn : so this will have many twists and turns away from the original story ? soule : the idea is to take some of the events in the original storyline and spin them off into entirely new stories
without spoiling , this deals with a world that has been ravaged for quite some time when we pick up the story
i felt the original " civil war " explored those questions very well
if i was going to play in this sandbox , i wanted to ask my own questions .
