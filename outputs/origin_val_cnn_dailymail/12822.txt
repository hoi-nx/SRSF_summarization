as planets go , mercury does n't get a lot of love
people spend more time on google searching for queen singer freddy mercury than planet mercury ... and freddie 's been gone for nearly a quarter - century
not even nasa spends much time there , making it the least - explored inner planet in the solar system
but one question has long perplexed scientists : why 's the darned thing so dark ? compared with our own moon , which is about the same size , mercury reflects much less light
scientists at lawrence livermore , brown university and the planetary sciences institute say they may have found the answer : it 's been " effectively painted black , " in the words of megan bruck syal , a postdoctoral researcher at lawrence livermore
over the eons , the researchers argue in a paper published monday in the journal nature geoscience , microscopic meteorites spawned from carbon - rich comets may have contributed enough dark - hued carbon to reduce the amount of reflected light
the pieces seem to fit together : there 's a lot more carbon dust thrown off from comets close to the sun , where mercury orbits -- about 50 times as much for mercury as for our moon , the researchers say
and tests using a big nasa gun made to simulate planetary impacts on a small scale seem to show the theory is plausible , the authors say
" we show that carbon acts like a stealth darkening agent , " said peter schultz , a professor emeritus of geological sciences at brown university
" from the standpoint of spectral analysis , it 's like an invisible paint
