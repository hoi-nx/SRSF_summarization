a russia motorist was shocked to discover his Â£ 5,000 car had been frozen solid in a block of ice after leaving it parked on the side of the street during a heavy snow storm
pokrovski , 32 , left his lada priora parked in a small ditch beside a block of flats in the city of saratov , south - west russia
the small ditch filled with water overnight and by the time pokroviski had returned to the car in the morning , the water had frozen solid above the level of the wheels
pokrovski parked his Â£ 5,000 lada priora , pictured , in a drainage ditch overnight outside a block of flats when pokrovski returned to his car the following morning he discovered it was frozen in a block of ice the water flooded into the car , almost covering the seats , pictured , before it froze into a solid lump pokrovski asked several of his friends and neighbours to help him try to free the car , but after an hour of trying to chip away at the solid block of ice , they were forced to give up after temperatures plummeted to minus 30 celsius
pokrovski said : " we tried pouring hot water over it but that just froze and made it worse
' we then tried hacking the ice away with spades and knives , but it is so hard some of them broke
' he then called a local car garage to see if they could help , and was told it would be a waste of time
garage owner andrey teliatev , 45 , said : ' i 'm not even sure its worth trying to get free
' the engine will be dead from being flooded and i do n't think it can be repaired
' in fact , repairing it would cost about the same as getting a new one
' pokrovski added : ' i ca n't believe this
' if i had n't parked in that ditch this would never have happened , but who would have thought it ? ' i guess the snow must have melted and then when the temperatures fell froze
' pokrovski 's mechanic warned that after such an ordeal it would be cheaper to buy a new car pokrovski said he tried pouring boiling water over the ice but it froze instantly making the situation worse
