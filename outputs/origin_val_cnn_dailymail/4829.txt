mocked : texas senator cruz , 44 , has been mocked online by the prank presidential candidate cruz is being mocked online by internet pranksters who turned a site bearing his name into an ad for president obama and his immigration reforms
while the 44 - year - old senator ( r-texas ) was busy launching his campaign in virginia and touring tv studios , anybody logging onto tedcruz.com this week will have got a surprise
for , rather than being festooned with smiling pictures of the tea party darling and talking up his hopes of ' reigniting the promise of american ' , the page ribs him about two of his bugbears
the simple site has a black background and says , in large , grey text : ' support president obama
immigration reform now ! ' the presidential hopeful , who constantly castigates obama and speaks out on border control , is using tedcruz.org for his campaign instead
it is hardly the only such jibe internet users have made at cruz 's expense
tedcruzforamerica.com has been programmed to redirect users straight to healthcare.gov - the medical insurance exchange established by the president 's obamacare laws
the site seems especially apt given that cruz today admitted that he himself is signing up for obamacare , as he will no longer be covered by his wife 's plan
a third snub comes in the form of tedcruz.ca , a site dedicated to reminding voters that cruz , son to a cuban father and american mother , was in fact born in canada
his place of birth is not widely thought to rule him out as a presidential contender , but will still function as a stick for critics to beat him with
to the point : logging on to tedcruz.com takes uers to the above page - two lines of text supporting obama mocking : tedcruzforamerica.com sends users to the obamacare health insurance website , above
