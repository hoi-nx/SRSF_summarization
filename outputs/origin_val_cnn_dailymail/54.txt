statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent , researchers claim
a breakthrough study found that the cholesterol - lowering drugs improved outcomes for those suffering from the common cardiac disorder
the medication has already been linked to a reduction in heart attacks
prevention ? cholesterol - lowering statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent , scottish researchers found but the latest research is the first to show the benefits for those at risk of heart failure â which occurs when the organ struggles to maintain adequate blood flow to the body
scientists from the glasgow said their findings herald a â significant benefit â for the near - one million uk affected by the condition
exerts from the university âs institute of cardiovascular and medical sciences reviewed 17 statin trials involving more than 100,000 patients as part of their analysis
lead researcher dr preiss said : â heart failure is disabling , expensive to treat , especially in more advanced stages , and patients have a poor outcome
â while it has been assumed that statins reduce the development of heart failure simply because they reduce heart attacks , to our surprise this had not been definitively shown before
â the results of this analysis clearly show a modest , but significant benefit , reducing hospital admission for heart failure by 10 per cent , which is clinically important
â heart failure happens when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body
around 100,000 uk a year are thought to die from it
damage : heart failure ( pictured ) affects nearly a million birtons and develops when the heart is unable to maintain adequate blood flow to meet the needs of the body figures show 15 per cent of patients with the condition die in hospital â twice the european average â partly because of late diagnosis and treatment that fails to adequately control symptoms
signs including swollen legs , tiredness and shortness of breath â which usually worsen following exercise
dr preiss added : â it is probable that statins decrease the degree of ischaemia [ lack of blood flow ] that occurs before a heart attack , leading to a decrease in the number of people with other ischaemic events and reducing the chronic impact on the heart
â further study of the potential mechanism is needed
â the study found a 10 per cent reduction in first hospital admissions for heart failure , although researchers believe the impact of statins has been underestimated
the study was reported at the european atherosclerosis society congress in glasgow and was published online in the european heart journal
between eight and ten million adults take statins â which are now the most widely prescribed drugs in the uk
the nhs estimates they save 7,000 lives a year in the uk , despite growing concern over the extent of side effects such as increased risk of type 2 diabetes
doctors once prescribed the drug to those with a 30 per cent risk of a heart attack within the next decade , but this was cut to a 20 per cent risk in 2005
under current guidance , the threshold is even lower
those who have a 10 per cent or greater risk are being offered statins , including patients aged 80 and over
cholesterol - lowering drugs can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent , researchers claim
a new study shows for the first time that statins improve the outcome for those suffering from a common heart disorder
researchers from the glasgow carried out a review of 17 statin trials including over 100,000 patients
the new drugs block bad cholesterol more powerfully and in a different way than existing drugs a new type of cholesterol - lowering drug may halve the risk of a heart attack or stroke , new research suggests
people taking the experimental drug for high cholesterol were half as likely to die or suffer a heart attack or stroke as those taking conventional statins
the results could offer an alternative to the estimated one in three westerners with high cholesterol who have been unable to manage their condition with diet , exercise and statin drugs currently on the market
the results are ' really impressive and very encouraging ' for the new drugs , said one independent expert , dr judith hochman of nyu langone medical center
the u.s. government will decide this summer whether to allow two of these drugs on the market
the drugs are evolocumab , which amgen wants to call repatha , and alirocumab , which regeneron pharmaceuticals and sanofi have named praluent
they lower ldl or bad cholesterol more powerfully and in a different way than existing drugs , by blocking pcsk9 , a substance that interferes with the liver 's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood
side effects remain a question , though , especially on thinking , confusion and memory - problems the fda has already voiced concern about and asked the companies to track
although the drugs are linked to a reduction in heart attacks , this did not explain the benefits in heart failure
lead researcher dr preiss , at the university âs institute of cardiovascular and medical sciences , said : â heart failure is disabling , expensive to treat , especially in more advanced stages , and patients have a poor outcome

â heart failure affects nearly a million birtons and develops when the heart is unable to maintain adequate blood flow to meet the needs of the body
signs and symptoms including leg swelling , tiredness and shortness of breath , usually worse on exercise , can affect the patient âs quality of life
dr preiss said : â it is probable that statins decrease the degree of ischaemia ( lack of blood flow ) that occurs before a heart attack , leading to a decrease in the number of people with other ischaemic events and reducing the chronic impact on the heart

â the study found a 10 per cent reduction in first heart failure hospital admission but researchers believe the impact has been underestimated
overall , 200 patients with heart disease would need to be treated over 5 years to prevent one hospital admission
