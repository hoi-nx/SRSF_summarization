seeing a rainbow often fills people with a sense of joy , regardless of whether it is their first or 19th time witnessing the colorful creation
rainbow gathering -- annual events that take place throughout the world -- encompass a vibrant mixture of the environment and people to produce a similar feeling of excitement
photographer matjaz krivic 's " somewhere under the rainbow " series was shot over 19 years at rainbow gathering in various countries
according to matjaz krivic , the meaning behind the name of the events originates from an ancient hopi native american prophecy about " rainbow warriors
" rainbow gatherings involve a temporary community of people who meet to share their similar ideals -- peace , harmony , freedom and respect
those participating in the gatherings collectively refer to themselves as a " rainbow family
" the community , which welcomes a wide spectrum of ages , comes together to embrace nature and establish an alternative space away from society 's popular culture of consumerism , materialism and mass media
those who attend are not required to pay any form of money , not even for food , and the gatherings do not have rigid structures of dominance nor one specific leader
instead , rainbow gathering are essentially idealistic movements driven by the convergence of its community 's beliefs in a more equitable society and its people 's love and tolerance for one another
" the magic hat goes around and you put money if you have or if you want , " matjaz krivic said
" ( but ) nobody needs to pay for the food
everybody is welcome to go and eat there
" matjaz krivic says that rainbow gathering also tend to take place in regions of the world that " need to be healed " after having experienced devastating conflicts
past gatherings include those held in serbia , bosnia and ukraine
" i really do n't like what 's going on in this world
... there 's just so much stuff happening , " matjaz krivic said
" you can always go to ( rainbow gathering ) and stay there and have a nice time , and you do n't even have to pay for it
it will be a nice time , nice energy , not aggressive
" one of the most enjoyable aspects about rainbow gathering is the many workshops and activities that are available , where people engage in and learn about everything from yoga and tai chi to meditation and healing techniques
another significant part of rainbow gathering is the all - encompassing sound
" i like the music , i 'm an audiophile
i like all sorts of music , but when i go there it 's live , it 's there , " matjaz krivic said
" it 's like two guys playing and eventually it 's like 50 people playing and the music is just so beautiful
" the first rainbow gathering took place in colorado in 1972 , and it is believed to have been organized by youth counterculture " tribes " from northern california and the pacific northwest
since then , the gatherings have extended to other areas in the united states as well as a number of different countries
the international gatherings generally take place during the summer , before august 's full moon
according to matjaz krivic , the exact locations of some of the rainbow gathering are revealed through hand - drawn maps and presented to those who have attended a gathering in the past

matjaz krivic has had a diverse range of experiences at rainbow gathering , and maintaining a consistent photographic process over the years has enabled him to witness firsthand the growth of his photography
ever since his first rainbow gathering , matjaz krivic has been using the same two film cameras and lenses
" the gatherings did n't change , " matjaz krivic said , " but my photography did change -- a lot
... i consider photography differently now
" matjaz krivic says a key consideration when taking photos was the use of film cameras as opposed to digital , which he believes do not fit in with the atmosphere of the gatherings
he also had to carefully decide who to photograph
" i had some friends and i could take photos of them , and then eventually when i was going on and on , it just became like a family , " he said
" it 's like people that you know for 20 years and you see them every year
" just as every person sees a rainbow in their own unique way , " somewhere under the rainbow " enables viewers to let their vision roam freely around every corner of the photos , leaving them to cultivate their own perspectives and ripen their imaginations
in one photo , matjaz krivic takes viewers to pakistan in 1998 , where a man mesmerizes viewers as he stands in pristine blue water holding a mango in his hands
it 's then 2003 in france

viewers later discover a delicate morning hug between a man and woman at last year 's rainbow gathering in hungary , with a sunflower softly blooming out of a ukulele
as for matjaz krivic , he feels that " somewhere under the rainbow " is not finished and will never be
" i will never complete it
i will always go because i like it , " he said
" i will take photos again of friends , and just go on with it
