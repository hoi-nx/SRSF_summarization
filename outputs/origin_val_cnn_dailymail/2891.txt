a lamb believed to be the biggest ever born in the uk weighs as much as a toddler
the super-sized animal - christened the big one - was delivered via caesarean section on tuesday at ty mawr farm in denbigh , north wales
it tipped the scales to a whopping 24lbs 2oz - almost three times the size of an average newborn lamb
the big one ( right ) towers above other lambs that have also been born on the farm this week ( left ) dafydd , who works full - time on the farm with parents edmund and llinos , said : ' the lamb is absolutely huge
' it was delivered about five days early so it makes you wonder what size it would have been if the pregnancy had gone to term
' we have had big lambs before but i have never seen anything like this
' as soon as it was delivered the vet weighed it straight away and she was just smiling because of how big it was
' dad and i guessed about eight or nine kilograms - we could n't believe it when she said 11
it is about the size of a three or four - week - old lamb
' the previous record holder for the biggest lamb in the uk was joan , born in lancashire in 2013
dafydd , 18 , said : ' the ewe went into labour early and we did n't even have a chance to deliver naturally
' we had to take it to the vet for a caesarean because of the size of the lamb
' it is healthy though , it 's spot on
the ewe is doing well too
they are together but she just ca n't keep up with the lamb 's demand for milk because it is so big
' so i am having to feed it a lot of milk by bottle too
it will be interesting to see how he develops

dafydd ( right ) , who works on the farm with parents edmund and llinos , said : ' the lamb is absolutely huge ' the lamb 's mother ( left ) can not keep up with its demand for milk , so it has to be given a bottle by dafydd as well ' i think it is the biggest to have ever been born in the uk
i did some research online and a lamb called joan was born a few years ago at 24lbs , so ours is 2oz heavier
' the biggest lamb born at the farm previously was around eight kilograms
the family are now considering whether to send an application to the guinness world records to have the big one 's record claim substantiated .
