' as the snow piled higher and higher , it became darker and darker until i was surrounded by an eerie black silence , broken only by the sound of my slow breathing and racing heartbeat , ' he wrote
' " okay " i thought to myself ; " you âre dead "
' i was convinced that they would not find me in time
unable to move i focused on slowing my breathing , relaxing and conserving oxygen
' mr mort describes the relief he felt when he was finally able to see the sky again
' soon my vision became brighter and i heard some muffled voices , then suddenly everything went white as dan and leonard excavated my face ... i cried with happiness and relief , ' he wrote
mr mort said he wanted to tell his story to raise awareness of how dangerous avalanches could be .
