a mother - of - three says she was shocked to open a bag of her favourite crisps and discovered the world 's smallest wotsits inside
bhatti , 29 , from derby , found several mini-wotsits measuring just 1cm long in her 99p multi-pack of the cheesy snacks
the crisps were dwarved by the regular versions , which measure around 3.5cm , much to the amusement of her family
' it 's so funny
my family eats quite a lot of them and i like them because they 're not oily like other crisps
' i think these ones could possibly be the smallest in the world
what are the chances of finding so many at once ? it 's very unusual
' they certainly would n't fill you up but i suppose they 're good if you 're on a diet
' the crisps were dwarved by the regular versions , which measure around 3.5cm , much to the amusement of ms bhatti and her family ms bhatti said she has not contacted manufacturers walkers over the minature crisps , but said she would do if she found more
' i do n't feel ripped off , ' she said
' at the end of the day they 're wotsits
i have n't spoken to walkers about it and i did n't take them back to the shop
' i do n't feel hard done by , it 's quite funny really , my kids think they 're hilarious
' but if it happened again , i would probably have a word with walkers
ms bhatti found several mini-wotsits measuring just 1cm long in her 99p multi-pack of the cheesy snacks which she bought at a discount retailer in derby ' i 'd already seen a post on facebook where somebody was saying they had small wotsits so i 'm not the only one
' ms bhatti says she and her family have decided against eating the crisps , but do not know what they are going to do with them
' at first the kids were really excited and wanted to eat them but when we found more they said they wanted to keep them , ' she said
' i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do with the wotsits now
the kids will probably go in the cupboard and eat them when my back is turned
