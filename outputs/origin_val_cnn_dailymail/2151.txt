england 's hopes of winning the grand slam is over after being comfortably beaten by ireland in dublin - who themselves moved to the top of the six nations standings and put themselves in pole position
robbie henshaw scored the only try of the game and jonny sexton kicked four penalties and a conversion as the irish dominated stuart lancaster 's side for most of the game
but the star was scrum half conor murray who terrorised his opponents with his clever kicking and quick thinking passing
conor murray ( cetre ) was the star for ireland during their win over england in the six nations clash ireland rob kearney â 6.5 made a couple of important tackles when england threatened out wide , but not a major presence in attack
tommy bowe â 6 ireland did nât play expansively so he was quite peripheral
one glaring fumble but largely tidy in defence jared payne â 6 another who did nât have much of an opportunity to run with the ball but he tackled and competed at rucks with gusto
robbie henshaw â 8 he had already shown great courage and commitment over the ball , before his brilliant try settled the match
robbie henshaw ( left ) collects the high ball to score ireland 's only try in their victory over england simon zebo â 7 soon set his stall out with swerving runs
superb in the air ; with one brilliant leaping catch above several opponents
jonny sexton â 7.5 eventually withdrew injured but pulled the strings with typical authority and quick off the line in defence
conor murray â 9 enhanced reputation as one of the world âs best scrum halves
his kicking tormented england and one fine break early in the second half
conor murray 's kicking and passing game troubled the english throughout as he showed why he 's rated so highly jack mcgrath â 6.5 he was asked to once again fill cian healy âs berth at loosehead prop and he did not disappoint as a physical deputy
rory best â 9 the ulster hooker is a stalwart of this team and was superb
efficient at lineout , nearly scored early on and a ruck colossus
mike ross â 7 england would have hoped to gain an advantage in the scrum , but the leinster tighthead ensured that did nât happen
devin toner â 6.5 one crucial lineout steal in the first half
eclipsed by his second - row partner around the field but a solid effort
paul oâconnell â 8 another giant display by the veteran lion
he kept carrying hard throughout and was a towering figurehead
jonny sexton kicked four penalties and a conversion to help the irish seal their place at the top of table peter oâmahony â 7 the munster flanker offered his side the abrasive , unglamourous work they needed to gain the edge up front
jordi murphy â 7 impressive over the ball despite conceding early penalty
not a prominent ball - carrier , but played his part in momentous win
sean oâbrien â 6 went off before the half - hour and seemed to be concussed after a strong drive out of defence
replacements s cronin 6 , c healy 6 , m moore 6.5 , i henderson 6 , t oâdonnell 6.5 , i madigan 5 , f jones 6
england alex goode â 7 composed under high ball , showed intent to run from deep , good escape from behind own line but beaten to kick for robbie henshaw try
anthony watson â 5 missed early high kicks and struggled in the air
made one blistering run from deep but spoiled it with wild off - load
jonathan joseph â 6 after two glorious performances , this was n't his day
no chances to cut loose but he kept looking for work
luther burrell â 6.5 prevented best from scoring a try amid early siege and often carried strongly in midfield to give his side momentum
jack nowell â 7 energetic and committed , couple of good kick - and - chase efforts and late on he threatened the irish defence , to no avail
jack nowell ( right ) was england 's best performer in a disappointing performance in dublin george ford â 6 conceded turnover in the first minute and blew hot and cold from then on
some nice touches but some lapses too
ben youngs â 6 looked bright and dangerous for a spell during the first half but could nât match conor murray âs impact with testing box - kicks
joe marler â 6.5 heavily involved
forceful hits , a few effective carries and strong over the ball , to continue his fine test form
dylan hartley â 6 his lineout throwing went awry a couple of times in the first half but he was full of intensity around the field
george ford ( left ) kicked three penalties for the away side but he struggled with lapses in concentration dan cole â 6 one barnstorming charge late on , but by and large the leicester prop was occupied with desperate fire - fighting up front
dave attwood â 7 prominent with early carries , aggressive in defence and showed staggering work - rate , especially during the first half
george kruis â 5.5 kept trying in vain to pressurise the irish kickers
not among the leading carriers and quieter than in previous games
james haskell â 6 strong defensive presence early on and he made the irish fight for every yard , but a limited breakdown presence
dave attwood ( centre ) also gave a solid performance and showed terrific tenacity and fight billy vunipola â 6.5 as with earlier matches , he grew into it as time went on , after a slow start
was at full throttle in the final quarter
chris robshaw â 6 not his best game
conceded penalty in first minute , a fumble later and could nât impose order amid hasty chaos
replacements t youngs 6.5 , m vunipola 7 , n easter 6.5 , t croft 6 , r wigglesworth 7 , b twelvetrees 6 .
