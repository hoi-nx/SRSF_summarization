montabaur , german on the surface , germanwings co-pilot andreas lubitz seemed , in the words of those who had known him , normal , capable , even fun
but , german prosecutors said friday , he was clearly trying to hide something in the days before he sent germanwings flight 9525 plowing into a mountain , killing himself and 149 others aboard
investigators searching andreas lubitz 's dusseldorf apartment said they found documents revealing he 'd been declared unfit for work
the letter , dusseldorf prosecutor christoph kumpa , said , was found " slashed " in a dust bin
the revelation only adds to the myriad questions swirling around andreas lubitz , 27 , whom authorities say deliberately destroyed the plane
the biggest question of all , still , is why ? lufthansa ceo ' speechless ' that 's the question police were hoping to answer as they searched andreas lubitz 's apartment
police spokesman markus niesczery said a team of five investigators went " through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot 's motivation might have been , if he did indeed bring the plane down
" they did n't find a goodbye note or anything directly explaining the crash , the public prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf said in a statement
they say it will be a few more days before they can say anything more publicly about what they found
outside the apartment , neighbors contacted friday said they did n't know andreas lubitz and are simply flummoxed by all the attention to the quiet suburban neighborhood featuring a handful of businesses , restaurants , running rails and a lake
meanwhile , about 85 miles ( 136 kilometers ) away in the town of montabaur , the house where andreas lubitz 's parents live was shuttered and guarded by police
a group of men , perhaps investigators , were the only ones granted access on thursday
on friday , there was no activity at all
montabaur , in western german , is where andreas lubitz pursued his love of flying from a young age
at a club on the outskirts of town , pilots who knew andreas lubitz said they were shocked to hear what investigators said
they said the man they know never would have deliberately crashed a plane
between age 14 and age 20 , andreas lubitz was a regular fixture at the gliding club
" ( he was ) a very normal young person , full of energy , " klaus radke said
" what can i say ? he had a bright future
he made his hobby into his job
what more can you hope to achieve ? " the authorities ' explanation does n't ring true for ruecker , another pilot who knew him from the flight club
" knowing andreas , this is just inconceivable for me , " ruecker told the reuters news agency
" he was a lot of fun , even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet , " ruecker said
" he was just another boy , like so many others here
" an acquaintance said andreas lubitz was health conscious
he was a recreational athlete and did n't smoke
" i ca n't imagine that he was mentally ill , depressed and sad
he does n't seem like that , " johannes rossbach told cnn
" so i was shocked when i heard that
" an 8 - minute descent to death before tuesday 's crash , andreas lubitz appeared to have a " clean bill of health , " according to a germanwings representative
then came friday 's announcement of the discovery of documents revealing an illness that apparently made him unfit to fly a plane -- in the eyes of at least one doctor
prosecutors did n't reveal what the illness was , but said the discovery " leads to the preliminary conclusion , that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment
" the new york times and the wall street journal , citing unnamed sources , reported that andreas lubitz suffered from mental illness
meanwhile , a dusseldorf clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently 17 days ago , " concerning a diagnosis
" but the university clinic said it had not treated andreas lubitz for depression
andreas lubitz had been with germanwings , a budget airline owned by lufthansa , since september 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time , the airline 's media office said
officials say he passed a psychological test when he was hired , had no known ties to terrorism and showed no sign of medical distress during the flight
lufthansa ceo spohr told reporters that andreas lubitz " interrupted " his training , which he began in 2008
that break lasted several months , he said , but added that such an interruption is n't uncommon
spohr said he could n't give any information about why the co-pilot had stopped and then restarted his training
if it was for medical reasons , he said , then that information would have been private before the crash , but it will be part of information gathered during the investigation
reuters reported that a german newspaper , bild , said andreas lubitz had been treated for depression about six years ago
citing internal documents forwarded by lufthansa to german authorities , bild reported that andreas lubitz had suffered a " serious depressive episode " around the time he took a break from his pilot training in 2009 , reuters reported
the bild report said he then spent about 18 months getting psychiatric treatment
lufthansa officials and german prosecutors declined to comment on the bild story , reuters said
most of andreas lubitz 's training took place at the lufthansa flight training center in german
he also trained in the united states , spending six months at facility in arizona as part of a required program to get his license , a lufthansa spokesperson said
a former trainer at the facility said the training is " extremely stressful
" " what made the hairs stand up on my neck in this case is that the co-pilot took some time off during training
for me that is very inexplicable and highly unusual , " oly olson said
" usually the pilot trainees either progress or wash out , i never saw anyone take a break
" he clarified his remark , saying some people left due to a death in the family
spohr said lufthansa pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying
however , the airline does consider an applicant 's psychological state , along with other factors , when hiring pilots , he said
" we do n't only look at competence but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities , " spohr said
" he was 100 % set to fly without restrictions , " he added
" his flight performance was perfect
there was nothing to worry about
