a quadruple amputee rottweiler named brutus is getting the chance to walk again thanks to a new set of artificial limbs
brutus , who lives in loveland , colorado , is only the second dog to ever have four prosthetic limbs
the dog became disabled after he got frostbite on all four paws and was maimed by his breeder , who tried to amputate the damage himself
' you ca n't explain to an animal why you are putting these contraptions on their feet , ' she told fox 31 denver
' you ca n't explain it to them , that it 's to help them
' brutus ' new limbs , which he was outfitted with in september 2014 , gives him a high step that resembles a ' bucking bronco '
although brutus can now take walks outside , aquilina wants more for the two - year - old dog
' it 's not always pretty , ' she said
' we want to be able to give him a higher function where he can run and play with other dogs , go on hikes

he will soon undergo physical therapy and get an improved set of prosthetics aquilina has brutus do exercises and play outside so that he can become better at balance
and the dog will soon undergo physical therapy and get an improved set of prosthetics to boot
brutus ' artificial limbs were made by orthopets of denver , which makes prosthetics for about 250 animals around the world every year
orthopets founder martin kauffman said brutus was ' dealt a short hand ' but can now ' get out and do normal doggy things '
' it just makes you feel so good , ' he told fox 31 denver
aquilina said brutus is an example of why people should n't give up on animals with disabilities
' if he ended up in a shelter they 'd say he was unadoptable because he 's missing his feet , ' she said
' i think its good for people to know we can work with animals like this
