' we want our kids to be happy - so we work hard to buy these things for our kids but they just go and teach them how to swear
' said mr amari black , who believes the foul language is down to a malfunction in the toy
' he can say " mum " , " dad " , " please " , " thank you " , and sadly " f * * k you "
' we 've been buying peppa pig toys for our kids for years but will never buy them again
' job centre advisor mrs black , 34 , said she was shocked when relatives questioned whether amari black had learned the swear word from his parents
he got in trouble at my mum 's for saying it and told me off because she thought he was learning it from us at home , ' she said
' he 's definitely banned from playing with it now
' we would never use that language at all , let alone in front of an impressionable child
' i want to encourage him to talk as much as possible , but it 's hard because whenever i tell him he 's doing well , he responds with ' f * * * you '
' mother - of - four marcha says she has written two emails of complaint to manufacturers inspirationworks , but is yet to hear back
she said : ' i feel devastated and let down by them
' inspirationworks is yet to comment on the family 's claims .
