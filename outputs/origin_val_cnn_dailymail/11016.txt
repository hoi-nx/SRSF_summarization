museums give a snapshot of the past but their static displays struggle to truly emulate what it would have been like to live in an ancient era
now an archaeologist is hoping to merge the present with the past using augmented reality to make people feel as if they have travelled back in time
the dead men âs eyes app puts virtual buildings on top of real world images , and his dead men âs eyes âs nose bag emits odours to make the environment smell like it would have done in the past
the dead men âs eyes prototype was developed by dr stuart eve from ucl
it uses augmented reality to lay virtual images onto the real world ( virtual huts are shown on the site of a prehistoric settlement on leskernick hill , cornwall )
the setup uses the camera on an ipad and an augmented reality app the prototype applications and hardware were developed by dr stuart eve , an honorary research associate at the institute of archaeology university college london ( ucl ) and a member of l - p : archaeology
dead men âs eye uses an ipad âs gps to pinpoint the user âs location
when they hold the ipad âs camera up to the landscape , virtual reconstructions are placed on top of the real world images
these reconstructions move and change in real - time as the user moves around the terrain
it uses a mixture of the unity3d gaming engine and vuforia âs augmented reality technology to place the virtual layers in their correct location and perspective - taken from archaeological data - based on where the user is stood
' augmented reality enables us to give glimpses into the past - that are not possible if you are just walking around a site or indeed part of a city of a rural field in the middle of nowhere , ' dr eve told mailonline
' these ' experiences ' could be easily recreated within a virtual reality environment , by donning an oculus rift and some vr gloves we can see and touch the past
during the bronze age the site on bodmin moor was a tin - mining village
when dr eve held the camera up to the hill ( left ) a series of huts appeared to make it look like he was exploring the ancient village ( right )
these reconstructions move and change in real - time as the user moves around the terrain to make this experience more immersive , the archaeologist also developed the dead men âs nose ( shown being worn by dr eve )
it can emit specific smells and these could include the smell of barbecues wafting through a virtual scene , or the bag could feature smells of woodsmoke and manure ' however , by creating the whole experience within a computer and then donning a pair of closed goggles - we run the risk of cutting ourselves off from the real world - and creating bands of zombies plugged into computers who never have any experience of the real world and instead choose to live within a virtual world - with all interactions mediated through a computer

the dead man âs nose is a prototype of a smell delivery device that wafts smells to the user 's nose based on their location
the hardware is built using an arduino microcontroller and computer parts and can be used with any scent of the user âs choice
software-wise , the device connects to a webserver and â fires off â smells when connected to the unity3d technology , for example
consequently the smells are released at the correct time and location as the user explores
in one example dr eve used his technology on the side of leskernick hill , in the middle of bodmin moor in cornwall
during the bronze age the site was a tin - mining village
when dr eve held the camera up to the hill a series of huts appear to make it look like he âs exploring the prehistoric settlement
â seeing a reconstruction of the village that can be physically explored when you are standing in the real location is a visceral experience and , for me , comes pretty close to a time machine , â added dr eve
to make this experience more immersive , dr eve has also developed the dead men âs eyes âs nose bag
the devices can either be placed around the landscape to emit specific smells , or worn by the user as they explore the augmented world
for example , the smell of barbecues could be wafted through scene or a bag could feature smells of woodsmoke and manure
â the dead man âs nose is a very early prototype of a smell delivery device that wafts certain smells gently into your nose based on your location , â said dr eve
the hardware uses an arduino microcontroller with standard computer parts and can be used with any scent of the user âs choice

the app recognises a user 's location and overlays the historic image over the current view - augmenting the reality that the smartphone camera perceives in february last year the museum of london updated its streetmuseum app to let people walk side - by - side with londoners from the 19th and 20th century
for those using the app on the move , the app recognises their location and overlays the historic image over the current view - augmenting the reality that the smartphone camera perceives
each historic photograph was taken by a renowned photographer , including henry grant , wolfgang suschitsky , roger mayne and george davison reid
there are more than 100 locations and images ranging from 1868 to 2003
consequently the smells can be released at the correct time and location as the user explores
â technological development is moving at an incredible rate , and already it is possible to wear transparent glasses with forward - facing cameras to overlay the ar information directly onto your field of vision , rather than having to use a portable handheld device such as a mobile telephone â continued dr eve
â as this develops further , this will go some way towards mitigating the disconnectedness of having to hold up a mobile device in order to experience the virtual objects
â the name of the prototypes was taken from the montague rhodes james ' short story , â dead men âs eyes ( a view from a hill ) â
in the story , character mr fanshawe discovers a pair of field glasses and when he looks through them , he sees the past
' it is really exciting stuff and the technology is in its infancy - but as with any new thing - it has to be carefully led in the right way , otherwise it will just end us up in some dystopic future where we get things beamed directly to our brains ! ' concluded dr eve
