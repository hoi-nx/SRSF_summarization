a small town in upstate new york stands divided after their high school 's decision on wednesday to broadcast the pledge of allegiance in arabic
it was meant as a way to celebrate national foreign languages week -- each day , the announcements and pledge at pine bush high school would be recited in a different tongue
however , the outrage it caused in some students and parents quickly forced administrators to issue an apology and a promise to henceforth only recite the pledge of allegiance in english
now , lines have been drawn in pine ( pop. 1,600 ) as some students and teachers are outraged that an apology was issued at all while others applaud the decision and say the pledge should never have been recited in a language other than english
' ' something that was supposed to be good but turned out not to be , ' joan carbone admitted
the attempt at teaching a lesson in multiculturalism caused a backlash almost immediately
the herald-record reports that the broadcast by student assembly president zink was ' greeted by catcalls and angry denunciations in classrooms throughout the school
' by wednesday afternoon , principal aaron hopmayer had apologized in a schoolwide announcement
the school would also soon post an apology to its website
' the intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than english still pledge to salute this great country , ' the statement read
' we sincerely apologize to any / students , staff or community members who found this activity offensive
in our school district the pledge of allegiance will only be recited in english as recommended by the commissioner of education
' ' it 's the right thing to do ' : student assembly president zink did the reading and says he would do it again
however , administrators were quickly forced to apologize students came out both against the reading and against the backlash as superintendent joan carbone said the controversy had ' divided the school in half ' though he did n't make the decision to make the day 's announcements in arabic himself , according to twc news , zink says he was perfectly okay with reading the arabic script for the day , though he knew it would be controversial
' i knew exactly what would happen , ' he told the herald-record
' i knew many would n't support it
' that includes many of the student politician 's constituents at pine
' here 's my issue
you made the decision to turn the school against itself , a move you knew would make pine look bad , ' student alan bavolar tweeted to zink
student alex krug also opposed the recitation
' it 's the pledge of allegiance , we 're saying it to the american flag
i think it should be said in english
it is foreign language week but we do n't even offer arabic in pine bush high school , ' he said
others supported zink 's decision and were appalled by the backlash , like senior miranda monroe , who tweeted : ' " i go to pine bush but i 'm not racist " * me introducing myself to new people * ' despite all the controversy , zink wo n't apologize for his decision to read the pledge in arabic
' it 's the right thing to do , ' he said
zink was bombarded online by his detractors and his supporters wednesday but says he supports what was initially a gesture of multiculturalism
