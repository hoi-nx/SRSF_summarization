froch is challenging ward to cross the atlantic for the first time in his career and face him at nottingham forest âs city ground
ward earned recognition as the world âs supreme super-middleweight when he defeated froch in the final of the super six tournament in atlantic city
but the america has fought only twice in the three years and three months since that points victory and the wba are now ordering a mega rematch between him and froch with both their belts on the line
froch wants a fight with ward to take place at the home of nottingham forest froch was last in the ring when he defeated george at wembley last summer ward is that organisation âs â super â champion , froch the holder of their â regular â world title
the cobra is daring the man who calls himself ward to nerve himself for a first fight outside the americas
â i fought him in the america , â froch says
â now it âs only right that he comes over here
to be a truly great champion you have to box overseas
â ward needs to be forced to travel out of his comfort zone
he will discover that i âm a very different animal here than i was that night on the boardwalk
â froch would love the fight with ward to take place at the city ground where his team nottingham forest play froch clearly has n't been slacking off since last summer as this picture posted on twitter shows ward ( left ) signed with jay z 's roc nation sports promotional company earlier this year that evening of december 17 , 2011 represented ward âs only fight in more than six years outside his native california , where the overwhelming majority of his bouts have taken place
the closest he has come to risking his unbeaten record abroad has been in two relatively insignificant fights in the caribbean in 2007 and 2008
froch suspects ward believes he will relinquish the wba belt , as he did his ibf world championship last month
but he warns : â i vacated the ibf title so as not to delay james degale from getting his chance any longer
but i âm not giving up the wba title
â froch is aware that without him bringing a belt to the table there would be little incentive for julio cesar chavez jnr to go ahead with a fight in las vegas , which is one of the cobra âs two remaining ambitions
froch lost to ward on points back in december 2011 in atlantic city , new jersey that defeat for the cobra was one of only two in his career as a professional the other is to box at the ground of his beloved nottingham forest , which was the potential venue for a clash with america âs veteran idol bernard hopkins
froch accepts that the wba mandatory ruling means ward must now take the place of bernard hopkins in those talks
the wba are giving them until the end of this month to negotiate terms , before putting the fight out to purse bids
froch expects that to happen , which might necessitate a change of dates
promoter eddie hearn , with whom he meets this week to discuss strategy for the negotiations , is provisionally holding the city ground for may 30
that is the night of the fa cup final and there would be a sizeable over-carry of tv viewers from wembley on to pay - per - view with sky
but froch says : â that is already short notice for me and if we have to wait for purse bids there wo nât be time for proper training camps for either of us
i would hope we can find another date in middle to late june
â he has been pondering retirement since his brutal ko of george at wembley
that remains an option , even though he has kept working in the gym to maintain an impressive physique , as a recent picture posted on twitter reveals
froch had been due to face julio cesar chavez jnr ( left ) but was forced out with an injury froch is also keen to fight ring legend bernard hopkins ( left ) who lost to sergey kovalev last year â i will only get back in the ring for a fight that really floats my boat , â says froch
â and when you think about it , beating ward in nottingham would be a fantastic way to end my career
â highly regarded though ward is , such a triumph is not beyond the realm of possibility
in fact , the timing would offer froch his best chance of avenging one of the only two losses on his record â as well as inflicting a first defeat on ward
embroiled in promotional disputes and plagued by injuries , ward has fought only once in two - and - a - half years
and that was a full year and four months ago in a points victory over edwin rodriguez , who had failed to make the weight and mostly went through the motions of a non-title bout
froch says : â the nine months since i knocked out george is the longest i âve been out but ward has to be really rusty
â also , a lot went wrong for me in that super six final
i was looking forward to appearing in madison square garden but it was moved to atlantic city
out on the shore in the cold of mid-winter
the date was pushed back so i had to hang around in america a lot longer than planned
it ended up a week before christmas and my mind was on getting home to the family instead of the fight
â it âll be very different in the english summer
â and what more pleasant time could there be to re-float the boat ?
