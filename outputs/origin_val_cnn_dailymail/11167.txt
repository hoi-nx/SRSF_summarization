thousands of people gathered in a small texas town this weekend to watch rattlesnakes get cleaned , skinned , milked and more - some visitors even left their mark on the wall with bloody hand prints
the annual sweetwater jaycee âs roundup hosts hunts , beauty and eating contests , demonstrations , vendors selling snake - skin products and more
attendees could even buy fried rattlesnake , which apparently takes like chicken
before the snakes are cooked , however , they are passed through an assembly line , where they are killed , decapitated , then cleaned and skinned as they hang from a wire
the roundup , which has been going on since 1958 and is the oldest and grandest in texas , began to control the population of rattlesnakes in the area , according to the odessa american , but now more people are drawn to the sheer awe of the event

the event brings more than $ 2million into sweetwater - a town with a population of 11,400 - and proceeds go toward community projects , youth sports and helping the disabled and disadvantaged
a hunt for snakes starts about a month before the roundup , and hunters are able to harvest about 5,000 pounds of snakes - which averages out into about 1,000 snakes
hunters use a gassing technique , where they spray gasoline through copper tubes to lure the snakes from their hiding places

the four - day event brings about $ 2million into the sweetwater community but the gassing method is controversial in texas , as people fear it hurts other animals and habitats , and could be facing a ban , leaving an uncertain future for the roundup
hunters use the gasoline to hunt in large volume in colder , wetter weather
if gassing is banned , they will potentially have to postpone the roundup
though the texas wildlife department has been looking into gassing for years and nearly banned it in 2013 , the organization delayed making a decision until september so sweetwater representatives and researchers could propose an alternative solution
some opponents to the roundup are concerned with the treatment and slaying of the rattlesnakes and suggested a no - kill roundup
jaycees , however , told the odessa american that it would be irresponsible to release such a dangerous creature back into the area after capturing it
