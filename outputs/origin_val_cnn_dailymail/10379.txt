the soothing tones of bob drifted through the air at stamford bridge as the teams prepared for extra-time
some were down on their haunches , receiving pellets of information , others flat on their backs receiving muscle rubs
' do n't worry ' bout a thing , ' sang bob
if this were t20 cricket it might have been his theme tune , a special request on his 37th birthday
why worry ? this was all under control
someone seemed to be guiding chelsea on a celestial path into the last eight
was it eden hazard ? thibaut courtois ? bjorn kuipers ? wailers ? mourinho and the wailers ? or another other - worldly force
chelsea players look dejected after being dumped out of the champions league at home to psg chelsea boss mourinho looks furious on the touchline after watching his team twice concede a lead turned out it was none of them
turned out there was something to worry about
that something was psg , a team with bottle to match their talent
a team which took everything mourinho could throw their way , scored twice from set - pieces and emerged triumphant
it leaves chelsea to focus on the barclays premier league title
roman abramovich looked down from his seat in the west stand
the champions league will have to wait for another year
and it leaves english football to contemplate the prospect of no teams in the last eight for the second time in three years
chelsea can have no complaints
almost every decision went their way
still mourinho had the audacity to shake his head when the fourth official declared two added minutes at the end of extra time
roman abramovich looks down from his seat in the west stand as chelsea crashed out of europe his players left the pitch in scenes reminiscent to the defeat against barcelona , only this time they would not blame the referee
and it all seemed to be going to plan , when the chaos first descended before half - time , mourinho snuggled back into his seat alongside rui faria in the chelsea dug - out
a few yards to his right , laurent blanc was flapping his arms in despair
on the pitch , david luiz was in danger of losing control
story of the game : minute 31 , minute 43 , minute 58 , minute 96 , minute 114 as is the fashion at stamford bridge
at least , that 's how it went on the previous outing , an equally frenzied draw against burnley , the fall - out of which was still falling out days later
psg manager laurent blanc holds his arms out in the direction of the fourth official as mourinho looks on former chelsea man david luiz gestures towards blues striker diego costa during wednesday 's encounter here was mourinho 's chaos theory unfolding again
traps set were stumbled into by psg , a club still naive to the injustices of this competition in the closing stages , when the teams are so tightly matched , tactics cautious and the importance of decisions by the officials magnified beyond belief
chelsea learned the hard way over the years but are now among the most seasoned
they break up play , they milk the contact , they circulate the tacklers , they over-react and pressurise the officials
on the side , mourinho and the wailers do their bit
it does not guarantee anything , of course
not against this calibre of opposition
but every little helps , and their manager understands this better than most
hence his pre-match posturing and the clear mind to react when the tie tilts and blurs
edinson cavani took the ball around thibaut courtois ( right ) but rattled the post with the goal exposed psg frontman edinson cavani reacts after missing the chance to put the ligue 1 side ahead in the 58th minute as the first half ended in manic scenes , mourinho made his decisions
here was the theory amid the chaos
off came oscar , to prevent a second yellow card , to tighten the centre of the pitch with ramires and to add the fizz of willian
cards played , the manager was tenser and prowled his technical area during the second half , his hands sunk into his coat pockets , until it was time to remonstrate and demand more his players
tighter , faster , they could not allow the tempo to slip against psg
perhaps he should have scored
his team - mates threw themselves to the turf in despair
minute 43 was a penalty chelsea might have had
minute 31 was the red card for zlatan ibrahimovic
it was harsh and it might have killed off weaker teams
they have bottle to go with their ability
psg striker zlatan ibrahimovic is shown the red card after a collision with chelsea 's oscar the 33 - year - old heads into this challenge with oscar ( left ) in the first - half which got him sent off the psg forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with oscar chelsea captain john terry ( left ) reacts after zlatan ibrahimovic 's tackle on oscar in the first - half at stamford bridg chelsea had work to do
they had to stop football breaking out , for one thing , because when it did , the french were better at it
as in paris , thibaut courtois came under fire as those in front of him started to wilt
it has been an intense campaign and , despite his fears about the relentless intensity of the english game and the way some training sessions are more competitive than the games in french football , mourinho has been low on rotation
he has relied instead on the rotation enforced by various suspensions
on thursday night he lost matic , and the decision to send on zouma backfired when they conceded almost immediately
minute 81 they liked at the bridge
minute 86 , not so much
when gary cahill scored , the first thing mourinho did was to turn to the crowd and urged calm
then he sent on zouma
when david luiz equalised , again he called for calm
this time the message was aimed at his players
take it into extra-time if necessary , with the extra man
no - one had minute 114 on their burnley bingo card
this time the chaos theory did not work
psg defender david luiz celebrated excitedly after scoring against his former club at stamford bridge thiago silva 's late header loops over the outstretched arm of thibaut courtois to knock chelsea out
