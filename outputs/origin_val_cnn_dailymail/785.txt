flying winger navas says he will not adapt his game at city , insisting he is told by manuel pellegrini to stay wide and use his pace
navas has prominently featured for champions but has n't scored in the premier league this season

' that is what got me here , always trying to get on the wing and play fast
that is my game , and that 's what i am asked to do and what i try to do in every match , so i do n't feel i have had to really adapt my game too much
' navas also insisted that city are n't giving up on the dream of retaining their title , despite chelsea leading the manchester club by six points with a game in hand
he added : ' i think there are many games left
until it is impossible to come back , we will look to close the gap , but we realise it is going to be difficult , but there is a chance
