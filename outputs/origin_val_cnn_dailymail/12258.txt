two uk charities have stopped funding a muslim advocacy group that had earlier helped isis 's masked murderer " jihadi john , " now identified as emwazi , before his radicalization , the group said
the human rights and advocacy group cage in west london said it accepted the loss of funding from the roddick foundation and the rowntree charitable trust
but cage blamed a " neo-conservative " leadership on the uk 's commission for pressuring the two charities to halt funding
" we respect their decision
we thank them for their past support
both of these charities have played a significant role in contributing to the development of muslim civil society here in the uk , " cage spokesperson amandla thomas-johnson said friday
the termination of funding came after the commission " took robust action " and cited how " public statements by cage officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities , " the commission said in a statement
the commission did n't specify those statements by cage , but stated that " in our view , those statements increased the threat to public trust and confidence in charity and raised clear questions for a charity considering funding cage 's activities as to how the trustees of those charities could comply with their legal duties as charity trustees , " the commission said
" cage is not a charity but has been in part funded by uk charities
as it is not a charity and given the nature of its work , and the controversy it has attracted , the commission has been concerned that such funding risked damaging public trust and confidence in charity , " the commission said
" as the regulator of charities , we expect all charities and trustees to ensure that all charitable funds are used according to their charity 's purposes and in the way that the public would expect , " the commission said
cage said it had worked with emwazi and indicated that uk authorities ' tactics pushed him to radicalize
cage said that emails he sent the organization paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help
emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it , according to cage
emwazi , a kuwaiti - born west london , was a " polite " and " beautiful young man " who would drop into the cage office with treats to thank the group for helping him , the group said
emwazi came to cage in 2009 looking for support when he felt that uk authorities were -- in the words of asim qureshi , cage 's research director -- " harassing " him
but emwazi has now been identified by u.s. officials as the masked man in isis videos showing beheadings of western hostages
more than a dozen uk administrative court documents obtained by cnn reveal uk security services initially believed emwazi was part of a radical west london recruitment network for terrorist groups in east africa
the two charities gave sizeable funds to cage
the rowntree charitable trust has given 271,250 uk pounds , or almost $ 408,000 , to cage since 2007 , the commission said
the trust had pledged a total of 305,000 pounds , or almost $ 459,000 , the commission said
the roddick foundation gave cage of 120,000 pounds , or more than $ 180,000 between 2009 and 2012 , the commission said
in acknowledging the funding losses , cage criticized the commission
" this is just another manifestation of their objective of pursuing a cold war on uk islam , " thomas-johnson said
" cage will remain committed to its principle of speaking truth to power and calling for accountability and transparency
we will not hesitate in performing our role as whistleblowers and as advocates for due process
" supporters of cage tweeted their criticism of the commission and the two philanthropies ' decision to terminate funding
one supporter remarked that " if @ uk_cage is not there to provide us with a counter-narrative when it comes to ' radicalization ' ...
who will ? ! " the commission said it will soon conclude its " open cases " into the two charities and publish a report and lessons " for other charities which fund non-charitable bodies
