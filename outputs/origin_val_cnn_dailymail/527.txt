while some may question whether taxpayers can afford to buy the new planes , air force col. mccain argues that they ca n't afford not to
' it 's the only 747 - 200 left in the united states that is flying

' the top priority is an affordable aircraft that will meet the presidential requirements , ' said mccain , who is in charge of ordering the new air force one
' we 're buying up to three
it depends on all the availability of having two airplanes available for the president at any one time
