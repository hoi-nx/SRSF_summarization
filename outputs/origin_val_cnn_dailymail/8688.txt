daniel vettori became the 12th player to take 300 one - day international wickets as new zealand eased to a six - wicket victory against afghanistan
the 36 - year - old , who took an impressive 4 - 18 , is the first new zealander to pass the landmark and now sits in the esteemed company of greats such as muttiah muralitharan , wasim akram and glenn mcgrath
afghanistan required a seventh - wicket partnership of 86 between najibullah and shenwari to post a respectable 186 all out , having chosen to bat , but a 19 - ball 42 from mccullum ensured there would be no shock in napier
daniel vettori became the 12th player to take 300 one - day international wickets daniel vettori of new zealand celebrates taking the wicket of zazai of afghanistan at the world cup daniel vettori celebrates with mccullum after taking the wicket of zazai during the world cup match perhaps a mark of the man and an added insight into the where the focus of the team remains , daniel vettori said the landmark was something he would think about after the world cup
' right now we are caught up in the middle of a world cup , ' he said
' we have an important game on friday ( group game against bangladesh ) , and then probably the most important of our careers the following saturday ( quarter - final )
' maybe in a month , it will be the time to look back on it
i did n't go into the world cup thinking about that milestone , i did n't believe i would take this many wickets in this few games
' understandably stung from being smashed for a record - breaking 417 runs by australia in perth days earlier , nabi chose to bat after calling correctly at the toss
afghanistan were made to pay for a choice that signaled a slight naivety within the camp , with their own coaching staff having previously admitted that bowling was the side 's strong suit
the newcomers to the world cup stage collapsed to 34 - 3 and then 59 - 6 , as daniel vettori caused most of the damage after trent boult had javed ahmadi trapped lbw for just one
mccullum has developed into an imposing captain , known for his ingenuity and outrageously attacking fields â so his decision to bowl his spinner in just the third over was met with mild surprise
the decision was less genius and more to allow new zealand 's opening bowlers , southee and boult , to switch ends
the 36 - year - old is the first new zealander to pass the landmark of 300 odi wickets new zealand eased to a six - wicket win over afghanistan at the world cup on sunday he now sits in the company of greats such as muttiah muralitharan , wasim akram and glenn mcgrath daniel vettori of new zealand speaks at a post-match press conference following their world cup win still , daniel vettori showed that he 's as accurate in the third over as in the 15th as he struck with his first ball
usman ghani lost sight of the ball and saw his off stump disturbed
with his opening strike bowlers having switched ends , mccullum resumed the pace attack , and asghar stanikzai could only send a short ball from boult into the geelful clutches of martin guptill
southee , struggling with his line and length , was replaced by daniel vettori , who took no.300 by bowling nawroz mangal for 27 with the first ball of his third over
the auckland - born spinner was on a roll and had nabi ( 6 ) and zazai dismissed off consecutive balls
nabi was caught at slip , while zazai was trapped leg before
that brought najibullah to the crease for the hat - trick ball , and the batsman was welcomed by the sight of nine men around his bat , with no fielder outside the circle
however , he survived and showed maturity beyond his years in his partnership with shenwari before departing after a run - a - ball 56 that ended when he top - edged a short and wide bouncer from adam milne to daniel vettori at third man
new zealand 's ross taylor gets a handshake from afghanistan 's hamid hassan ( left ) after the match new zealand are very much on course to end their world cup victory drought shenwari , undoubtedly afghanistan 's best batsman in this tournament , was the anchor of his side 's innings , and he made 54 off 110 balls before falling to corey anderson
an entertaining cameo from hamid hassan ( 16 off 21 ) took afghanistan to 186 , but for the fifth consecutive world cup match new zealand bowled out their opposition
the number of orange target t - shirts seemed to double after the resumption of play with the crowd undoubtedly expecting mccullum to send a few balls into the stand and help them earn a share of the pot of money for the ' one - handed crowd catch ' promotion
but mccullum cleared the rope just once in his innings before being bowled by nabi with one that kept a touch low
his departure unsurprisingly slowed the run chase , and when kane williamson picked out midwicket off shapoor zardan for 33 , the afghanistan believed they had a chance
two comical run - outs saw martin guptill ( 57 ) and grant elliott ( 19 ) further add to the nerves of the mclean park crowd , but ross taylor , the birthday boy , held his nerve to steer new zealand home
the same side , the same outcome , the same feeling after the match â new zealand are very much on course to end their world cup victory drought .
