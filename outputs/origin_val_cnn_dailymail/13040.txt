texas sen. ted cruz will announce monday that he is launching his campaign to become the 2016 gop nominee for president
ted cruz has been positioning for this nomination almost since he entered the upper chamber in 2012
his announcement takes place at a bastion of conservatism , liberty university , the institution founded by evangelical leader jerry falwell
ted cruz is going to run from the right
he has spent much of his short career in washington blasting the " mushy middle " of his party ( which might be news to most democrats ) , which he dismisses as a " failed electoral strategy
" during a recent visit to new hampshire , where he vowed to eliminate the department of education and the internal revenue service , ted cruz said that " i 'm pretty sure , here in new hampshire , y'all define gun control like we do in texas : gun control is when you hit at what you aim at
" fifty years ago , another gop senator ran this kind of campaign , arizona 's barry goldwater , who took on president johnson
ted cruz will test the conventional wisdom that barry goldwater 's strategy was and remains a failure
when republicans voted to nominate him in 1964 , barry goldwater told the delegates that " extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice
and moderation in the pursuit of justice no virtue
" when the icon of moderate gop , new york gov. nelson rockefeller , spoke to the convention , the delegates hissed and booed
the outcome was far from great for the gop
johnson defeated barry goldwater in a landslide election that brought in huge liberal democrats majorities that passed the exact programs that conservatives abhorred
although barry goldwater was clearly wrong when he ran in 1964 , ted cruz thinks that the times have changed
is he right ? right now , the chances are not great
if ted cruz really sticks to this strategy of extremism , he faces very long odds of making it to the white house
the strategy might help him to garner some primary votes against jeb bush in red states , but it is not an approach with a great track record
even as the gop has shifted to the right in recent decades , gop candidates who have obtained the nomination , and those who have also won the presidency , always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes
ronald reagan had anti-communism and tax cuts to attract voters into one big tent , and george h.w. bush had a thousand points of light
his son george w. bush emphasized policies tied to " compassionate conservatism " to prove that he was not an extreme zealot
even republicans who did n't win in the general elections , like john mccain and mitt romney , did not win the primary and caucus tallies by only playing to the base
notwithstanding the conventional wisdom , even in primaries it seems that gop voters understand the importance of finding someone who has the potential to win in november
this coming election will be tough for gop
as all the experts have shown , the electoral college math does not favor the gop
some experts have predicted that democrats have over an 80 % chance of winning the electoral college
according to the washington post , if one looks at the states where the margin was narrow in the 2012 election , five currently favor democrats ( florida , iowa , minnesota , ohio and pennsylvania ) while in others , like colorado , democrats have a very good chance of winning as a result of demographic trends , namely growing minority populations that favor their party 's nominee
barring any dramatic changes in the coming months , democrats will also have a very strong and seasoned nominee in hillary clinton
ted cruz is also not just someone who defends extremism but a politician who can easily be tied to the congressional obstructionism that has turned off so much of the electorate
the gop has been dragged down by the kind of politics that voters have observed in washington
in 2014 , congressional approval ratings plummeted to 14 %
as the new year began , the approval ratings were only slightly better : just 16 %
this is the congressional republicanism where ted cruz comes from
many voters who like conservatism and the gop do n't love what their representatives are doing on capitol hill
the kind of scorched earth , always say no to anything politics has not done well in terms of the favorability ratings
there have been few practitioners of this style of legislative politics as prominent as ted cruz
during his campaign for the presidency , he might pay the price for the kind of politics that brought him great attention in congress
when barry goldwater squared off against johnson in 1964 , the president predicted that there would be a " frontlash " of gop and independent voters who would move way from the gop just because barry goldwater was at the top of the ticket
this was johnson 's response to predictions of a backlash in the south from democrats who were angry about civil rights
the frontlash , johnson explained to bill moyers is " liberals , independents , moderate gop
" the electorate is not as likely to experience any dramatic swings like we saw in midwestern states in 1964 , where solidly gop areas went democrats because they were scared off by barry goldwater , but a ted cruz campaign could be exactly what democrats need to cement victories in the swing states where the outcome is still uncertain
monday , ted cruz will bask in the spotlight of his announcement
but gop are going to have to really think hard about whether they want to put all of their electoral eggs in this volatile basket which , at least based on the history , has a very slim chance of winning .
