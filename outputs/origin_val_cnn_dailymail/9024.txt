later that day , she went to the train station and was given a handwritten note from josh as well as the phone , which had cost Â£ 250
and she was stunned to see that instead of his address , josh had left her a lovely message , which said : ' do n't worry about the money , just do something nice for someone else
' ms michelle hickinbottom , from west heath in birmingham , decided to start a social media campaign to track down the youngster
and after her posts were shared thousands of times on facebook and twitter , josh 's mother brown came forward on friday
she said josh , who attends alvechurch cofe middle school , is ' overwhelmed ' by the response
ms michelle hickinbottom said : ' i just wanted to find him as i thought it was a lovely thing to do
i said to him on the phone at the time it was really appreciated and to leave his address so i could send him Â£ 20 to thank him really
michelle hickinbottom had offered to post josh Â£ 20 to thank him if he left his address , but was stunned to find a heartwarming note , which said ' just do something nice for someone else ' from him instead ' i was choked when i saw the letter
he will go far in life with an attitude like that
he seems a great lad
' she added : ' we are really grateful because my daughter has got a lot of photos on there she wants to keep
' it is more sentimental and personal than anything else
' i think he knows how appreciated he is and hopefully other people will be inspired by this
' mrs brown said : ' we ca n't believe all the lovely comments that people have taken the time to post on facebook and twitter , josh is so pleased
michelle hickinbottom ( pictured with daughter shaunnah ) said she was ' choked ' when she read the letter ' we are still overwhelmed by the lovely posts and the attention it has attracted
' we are very proud of him
but he just did the right thing
it was the only bit of paper i had in my handbag
it was the back of an envelope
' it was all josh 's idea
he said he was n't going to take any money off her and he 'd just ask her to do something nice for someone else in future
' josh said : ' i was going to birmingham to see the canals being drained when i spotted this phone on the seat
' not long after a lady phoned it and said it was hers
i told her i was coming back through selly oak and i would leave the phone there for her
' she was very grateful and said for me to leave a note with my address on and she would send me Â£ 20 as a thank you
' but i decided to leave the note asking for her to do something nice instead as i thought it was the right thing to do
' my dad always says ' what goes around comes around ' and if i lost my phone i would like to think someone would do the same to me
' i did n't think it was a particularly extraordinary thing to do
but i was gobsmacked when it appeared all over facebook and twitter
' josh 's father tim added : ' we knew nothing about the search for him
my wife was in town when a friend came over and asked ' did your josh find a phone ? ' ' she said ' yes , but how on earth do you know ' and her friend replied : ' because it 's all over facebook '
' every josh on the internet has been contacted about it by the looks of it , i ca n't believe have big it has become
