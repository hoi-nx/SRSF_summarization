accused murderer kelsall 's confession that he was having intrusive thoughts about killing a ' random ' was a chilling prophecy and key to the case against him , the crown says
' the truth is simple
it is awful , but it is simple
this man killed morgan huxley for no reason , ' peter mcgrath sc said
looking directly at the jury , the crown prosecutor on tuesday detailed point by point the aspects of the case against the 22 - year - old , that , he said , would leave them to infer only one thing
