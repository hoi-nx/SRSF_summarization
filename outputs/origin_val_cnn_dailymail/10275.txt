there is upset within the rugby fraternity about the rfu , the richest rugby union in the world , charging for disabled access to england matches at twickenham for the first time this season
the proceeds from saturday 's full house for the six nations title decider against france includes money from wheelchair users having to pay Â£ 41 for entry when the rfu policy had always been for free access and car parking for those using wheelchair facilities â and their carers , if needed
one rfu mandarin said : â it âs quite appalling such a charge should be brought in when the wheelchair - bound have been allowed in free at twickenham from time immemorial
it âs not as if the rfu need the money and is just another example of their rampant commercialism to squeeze extra cash from everywhere , even the disabled
it âs a scandalous state of affairs that needs to be quickly revoked
â the rfu are charging wheelchair users Â£ 41 to watch england play france at twickenham on saturday rfu policy had always been for free access and car parking for those using wheelchair facilities the rfu , who have 2,318 wheelchair enclosure spaces and a terrace with lift access for 112 , say their executive staff brought in the charges following an audit of disabled access by level playing field with the new pricing package being deemed industry standard
lpf said in their report that charging the same price as for able - bodied spectators in the same seating category promotes equality
a rfu spokesman said : â we are committed to investing all additional ticket revenue raised from the new charging policy to the upgrading of disabled facilities within twickenham and we have had a lot of positive feedback
we do not charge for tickets issued to charities nor for tickets to those injured playing rugby
â england play france on saturday still in with a chance of being crowned six nations champions the england cricket team âs apparent over-reliance on data during their hapless world cup campaign led to huge criticism aimed at head coach peter moores
and england team analyst leamon , a cambridge maths graduate and former eton schoolmaster , badly hurt his foot after kicking out in anger in his hotel room in wellington after a late - night debate with some media pundits about the importance â or not â of cricket stats
the unnecessary comment that had leamon steaming was from the obnoxious paul allott , lancashire director and peripheral figure on sky , who asked the numbers expert : â have you ever played the game ? â england 's apparent over-reliance on data at the world cup led to criticism aimed at peter moores the proposed 2016 olympics men âs team gb football side , mischievously relayed to the other home nations by former fa general secretary alex horne on his last day in office , has been kiboshed , not only by the fifa in zurich last thursday , but at the fa board meeting on the same day
the three other countries were strongly opposed and the issue has also raised questions as to why england have had a monopoly on the team gb football seat on the british olympic association
however there are still plans to send a team gb women âs side to rio

blatter said : â my manifesto is the work i have done in fifa

but clegg needs the azerbaijani - bankrolled games to go well first and he âs just lost his second communications chief in quick succession â both leaving suddenly for personal reasons .
