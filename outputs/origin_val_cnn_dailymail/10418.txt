these are the stunning aerial images that appear to show an ' underwater vortex ' in the indian ocean off the coast of mauritius
but despite the appearance of an underwater waterfall along the coast of the tropical island , it is really an optical illusion
the illusion of the dramatic vortex has been created by a run - off of sand and silt deposits
the optical illusion , off the south - west tip of the island , can be seen from a bird 's eye view and is even present on google maps
the island nation of mauritius was first discovered by arabic explorers and has since been colonised by the portuguese , french , british and dutch
mauritius , which lies off the coast of africa in the indian ocean , became independent in 1968 and a republic in 1992
