there was nothing more mind - numbingly maddening in the aftermath of england âs worst world cup exit yet than the immediate reaction of moores
â we thought 275 was chaseable
we âll have to look at the data , â said a coach now fighting to avoid his second ignominious exit from international cricket as the reality of an embarrassing group stage elimination sank in
well , england should rip up their data along with their whole philosophy towards one - day cricket and start again
moores faces an uncertain future following england 's humiliating exit from the 2015 cricket world cup england were beaten by 15 runs at the adelaide oval to make it four defeats against test cricket - playing nations england captain morgan looks dejected as he leaves the field after their world cup match morgan 's fifth odi duck in 12 innings summed up their poor performance at the world cup 90 - the amount of runs captain morgan scored in five innings at the world cup 12.2 - the overs it took for new zealand to beat england 's total of 123 in their second group game
111 - australia 's margin of victory in the opening game of the tournament 654 - total of runs scored by australia and sri lanka against england 1 - number of centuries scored by an england batsman against test cricket playing nations 72 - number of runs scored by sri lanka off the bowling of chris woakes 0 - number of wins registered by england over test cricket playing nations in the tournament 0 - the number of centuries scored by a bangladesh batsman in a world cup before playing england on monday
37.4 - 1 - 234 - 5 - chris woakes 's tournament bowling figures
49 - the amount of runs steven finn went for in two overs against new zealand
you do not need analysis to know that they have stunk this tournament out and , after this 15 - run defeat by bangladesh , are once again the laughing stock of the cricket world
the only statistic moores needs to know is that england , having been thrashed by australia , new zealand and sri lanka , were humbled by a bangladesh side who beat them here at their own very english game
the key data is that england , having defeated just scotland so far , have excelled themselves in being even worse at this world cup than the five previous stinkers since they came so close to winning the 1992 tournament in australia
and this humiliation has come after the ashes were moved and a winter of one - day cricket provided to try to make sure england had every chance of finally competing for a first global 50 - over trophy that looks further away than ever
in truth , arranging a one - day series against sri lanka before christmas was akin to putting a sticking plaster on a gaping wound because england are light years away from the dynamic , vibrant teams we have seen here
to hurl all the blame in the direction of moores would be unfair but there is no question that his position must now come under serious scrutiny , as too will that of the man who re-appointed him in paul downton
graves does not become ecb chairman until may but he is not the sort of man to postpone a big decision and the coach and managing director may soon be caught up in the new broom that is sweeping through the english game

we 've got nine guys who have n't been to a world cup before
' that 's the reality of it
you make your choice , you pick the side you think is the best team , which we did , and we have to accept they did n't play well enough
' warne and kevin pietersen were among those criticising england on twitter after their early elimination in the group stages
' england had the wrong team , the wrong style of play and everyone could see it
tonight 's result is not a shock , i feel for morgan
coach is in trouble , ' warne tweeted
kevin pietersen added : ' i can not believe this
but , well done bangladesh ! you deserved it ! ' do not say we have n't prioritised odi cricket ! we played a back - to - back ashes to make sure england played six months of odis before this world cup ! ' gary lineker , the former england striker , said : ' bangladesh win ! congratulations to them
the good news is , england ca n't possibly get any worse
' and piers morgan wrote : ' what an absolute disgrace
[ paul downton ] paul downton and moores have dragged english cricket into the sporting sewer with their petty , clueless incompetence
' i want paul downton and moores sacked today and kevin pietersen restored to the team
this farce just reached its true , hideous nadir
' i would n't trust paul downton and moores to run a * * * * ing bath , let alone the england cricket team
' moores pictured after the defeat as he speaks with press in adelaide about their world cup exit to highlight moores immediate mention of data on television is not to take a cheap shot at a decent man who appears to be liked and respected by players who on the whole have let him and their country down here
by the time he gave a more considered press conference yesterday there was no mention of the statistics that seem to have weighed down even a free spirit in morgan , who has been a huge disappointment as captain here
my gut feeling is that moores will be given the summer before england think about replacing him but a personal view is that maybe his assistant paul farbrace , an asia cup and world twenty20 winner with sri lanka before throwing in his lot with england , could take extra responsibility for limited - overs cricket
england are about to embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 tests in 10 months and the danger is that one - day cricket will again be shoved to the bottom of england âs list of priorities unless a clear strategy is undertaken
the overwhelming favourite to succeed moores if and when he goes is gillespie but he distanced himself from the role yesterday and there is no doubt that the yorkshire coach and his family are happy and settled in leeds
joe root ( centre ) exchanges words with bangladesh captain mashrafe mortaza ( left ) at the adelaide oval bangladesh sealed a surprise win over england at the world cup as moores and his men suffered elimination gillespie has already turned down a role with his native australia under darren lehmann and has been given permission by yorkshire to coach a team , probably adelaide , in next year âs big bash while staying at headingley
the constant year - round slog of international cricket is making it harder for countries to attract the best coaches and former yorkshire chairman graves may need to be at his most persuasive if he wants to recruit his old county coach
moores and paul downton are not the only ones under the microscope
morgan refused to say that he wanted to carry on as one - day captain yesterday and reiterated his intention to miss england âs one - day international against ireland in may , their first of another â new â era , to play in the ipl
well , i am sorry but if he does want to continue then he needs to be with the team in his native dublin , particularly as it will be impossible for england players touring west indies next month to make the ireland trip on may 8
the sheer volume of cricket means that the best way for england to catch up in 50 - over cricket is to build a new young team of one - day players as different as possible to that which will contest test cricket in the next year against west indies , new zealand , australia , pakistan and south africa
morgan looks to have been given the backing by moores to continue as england 's one - day captain alastair cook ( left ) was devastated to be axed from 50 - over cricket on the brink of his first world cup ian bell , who left england far too much to do against bangladesh by getting out after scoring 62 off 83 balls , will surely bow out of one - day cricket after friday âs dead rubber against afghanistan while it is in the best interests of jimmy anderson and stuart broad for them to do the same
joe root was strongly considered for the one - day captaincy by england when they sacked alastair cook before they plumped for the out - of - form morgan and i would give him the one - day job now and build a new team around him
it is certainly possible to envisage a squad led by joe root and including jos buttler , who came so close to recuing england yesterday , alex hales , moeen ali , james taylor , ben stokes , jason roy , james vince , sam billings and adil rashid growing into an outfit capable of competing in the modern one - day world
but the seam bowling remains a huge worry , not least the absence of a quick left - armer
bangladesh , worthy quarter - finalists now , had the fastest bowler on show yesterday in rubel hossain , who took four wickets , and that must be the first time they have ever had more pace at their disposal than england
the lack of variety in england âs bowling is one of the many reasons why they will be on their way home before the business end of this elongated tournament
and why they will be returning to the drawing board when they get there in their never - ending search for one - day success .
