a wave of h7n9 bird flu in china that has spread into people may have the potential to emerge as a pandemic strain in humans , scientists have warned
the h7n9 virus , one of several strains of bird flu known to be able to infect humans , has persisted , diversified and spread in chickens across china , the researchers said
this has fulled a resurgence of infections in people , posing a wider threat
in a study published in the journal nature , they said : ' the expansion of genetic diversity and geographical spread indicates that , unless effective control measures are in place , h7n9 could be expected to persist and spread beyond the region
' the h7n9 bird flu virus emerged in humans in march 2013
a wave of h7n9 bird flu in china that has spread into people may have the potential toemerge as a pandemic strain in humans it has since then infected at least 571 people in china , taipei , hong kong , malaysia and canada , killing 212 of them , according to february data from the who ( who )
after an initial flare up of human cases at the start of 2013 , the h7n9 appeared to die down - aided in large part by china authorities deciding to close live poultry markets and issue health warnings about direct contact with chickens
but infections in people increased again last year and in early 2015
this promoted researchers to try to understand more about how the virus re-emerged , how it might develop , and how it might threaten public health
in this study , an international team of scientists led by yi guan of hong kong university monitored the evolution and spread of h7n9 over 15 cities across five provinces in china
by collecting and sequencing a large number of samples , they found that the h7n9 virus is mutating frequently , acquiring genetic changes that might increase its pandemic potential
a large number of new genetic variants of the virus have become established in chickens and have spread across the country , probably because of poultry trade movement , they said
flu experts not directly involved in the research said its findings were interesting but did not necessarily show the h7n9 was changing in ways that made it more likely to develop into a pandemic flu strain

the h7n9 bird flu virus emerged in humans in march 2013
it has since then infected at least 571 people in china , taipei , hong kong , malaysia and canada , killing 212 of them ' what we do n't know from this paper is the significance of all these mutations that are accumulating as the virus persists and spreads , ' said wendy barclay , an expert in flu virology at imperial college , london
' this is especially relevant for human health - does any of this change the pandemic potential of the virus ? , ' she told reuters health
in its latest update on the flu strain , the geneva - based who said it ' continues to closely monitor the h7n9 situation ' and conduct risk assessments
' so far , the overall risk associated with the h7n9 virus has not changed , ' it said
yi guan 's team , however , said their analysis pointed to a need for heightened vigilance of h7n9 and for curbing direct human contact with live poultry at markets
' permanent closure of live poultry markets , central slaughtering and preventing inter-regional poultry transportation during disease outbreaks are needed to reduce the threat of h7n9 to public health , ' they wrote .
