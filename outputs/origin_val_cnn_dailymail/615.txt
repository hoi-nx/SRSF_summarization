children of smokers may be up to four times more likely to develop heart disease later in life
and the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child 's exposure to secondhand smoke , researchers warn
therefore , the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all , they say
the findings confirm previous research that linked tobacco smoke and toxins with a lasting effect on children 's cardiovascular health
the new research confirms tobacco smoke and toxins have a lasting effect on children 's heart health finnish children were measured for their exposure to passive smoking and whether their carotid arteries - the blood vessels that carry oxygen - rich blood to the head , brain and face - had become narrowed or blocked due to plaque build - up in adulthood
plaque buildup is made up of fatty deposits and other cells that can build up in the walls of the arteries over time , making them thicker ( and therefore harder for blood to flow ) as plaque continues to build , it can actually narrow or begin to clog arteries
this slow plaque buildup in arteries over time is a progressive disease called atherosclerosis
the study involved children whose blood samples were taken in in 1980 and 1983 as part in the cardiovascular risk in young finns study
in 2001 and 2007 , ultrasound readings of their carotid arteries were taken
then in 2014 , finnish researchers measured the participant 's childhood blood cotinine levels from samples collected and frozen in 1980
cotinine is a biomarker of passive smoke exposure
the researchers found that 84 per cent of children from households where neither parent smoked had non-detectable cotinine levels in their samples
however , only 62 per cent of children from households where one parent smoked and 43 per cent of children from households where both parents smoked had blood samples with non-detectable cotinine levels
the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child 's exposure to secondhand smoke , the researchers warn
therefore , the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all the risk of developing carotid plaque in adulthood was almost two times ( 1.7 ) higher in children who had one or both parents who smoked , compared to children of non-smoking parents
and the risk was elevated even if parents tried to limit their children 's exposure , warned the study , published in the journal circulation
children whose parents smoked but did n't limit exposure had almost twice the risk - and those fiull exposed had four times the risk , the study found
study author dr costan magnussen , of the university of turku , said : ' although we can not confirm that children with a detectable blood cotinine in our study was a result of passive smoke exposure directly from their parents , we know that a child 's primary source of passive smoke exposure occurs at home
' for parents who are trying to quit smoking , they may be able to reduce some of the potential long - term risk for their children by actively reducing their children 's exposure to secondhand smoke , by not smoking inside the home , car , or smoke well away from their children
' however not smoking at all is by far the safest option '
repeated exposure of children to secondhand smoke is child abuse , a leading doctor has warned
goldstein , a professor in family medicine , says exposure is as abusive as leaving children unattended in hot car , or drink driving
he claims he was forced to speak out after caring for ' too many children hospitalised with asthma and pneumonia , caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke '
dr goldsteimn argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse his controversial opinion piece has been published in the latest issue of the annals of family medicine
in it , he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse
' but what if the substance is secondhand smoke ? , ' he asks
dr goldstein , who is director of the tobacco intervention programs in the university of north carolina school of medicine , says the damage from smoke is ' as abusive as many other commonly accepted physical and emotional traumas of children '
his comments come after years of caring for children who have suffered severe respiratory illness due to secondhand smoke exposure
in the opinion piece , he writes : ' scientific research over the last decade has increasingly demonstrated that exposure to secondhand smoke is not simply a nuisance ; it is deadly
' secondhand smoke exposure causes multiple diseases in children , including asthma and pneumonia , and results in thousands of avoidable hospitalisations
' it is a major cause of sudden infant death syndrome and may cause lung cancer and heart attacks with repeated exposure
he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse ' no safe level of exposure exists ' [ therefore ] , purposefully and recurrently exposing children to secondhand smoke - a known human carcinogen - despite repeated warnings , is child abuse
