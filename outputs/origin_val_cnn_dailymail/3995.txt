yet another former model has publicly accused embattled entertainer cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her on at least two occasions nearly 40 years ago
cosby 's latest accuser , known only as patricia , was one of more than a dozen women who anonymously testified against the comedian as part of a 2005 lawsuit filed by andrea constand - a former basketball star and temple university employee who was among the first people to call out cosby
the multimillionaire tv star settled the lawsuit a year later for an undisclosed amount , and his accusers were effectively ' silenced , ' said patricia
cosby 's legal team have repeatedly said their client denies all of the allegations of sexual misconduct
speaking in an exclusive interview with buzzfeed this week , patricia , now 58 years old and living in california , finally got to tell her story involving the powerful show business big - shot who allegedly lured her to his home under the guise of an acting lesson and took advantage of her after spiking her drink
patricia said she was 22 years old in 1978 when cosby invited her to a dinner party at his home in shelburne falls , massachusetts
the young model , who first met the famous comic while working as a conference planner at the university of massachusetts - her and cosby âs alma mater - assumed that the actor 's wife , camille , will be joining them for dinner
but when she arrived the cosbys ' house , patrica said she found a table set just for two next to a fireplace
â i felt alarm bells go off because it did feel intimate , but i was trying to be so grown up and mature , ' she told the site
jane doe : patricia was one of more than a dozen women who anonymously testified against the comedian as part of a 2005 lawsuit filed by andrea constand ( left and right ) the young model accepted a drink from her famous host , who then proceeded to give her a set of peculiar acting directions : patricia was asked to pretend to be a queen with oatmeal dripping down her face
' it was so creepy , ' patricia told buzzfeed
' he told me to convince him that i could remain regal and queenlike no matter what i looked like
' as the odd improvisational game went on , patricia said she started to feel strange and eventually blacked out
in a now - familiar scenario , patricia said she later woke up naked in bed to find cosby standing over her dressed in a robe
the comedian allegedly said that the young woman got sick and he had to remove and wash her soiled dress
she recalled that at the time , it sounded like a plausible explanation
on her way home after the disastrous dinner , patricia got violently ill and had to pull over four times to throw up
patricia , an aspiring singer and actress , said she felt embarrassed and was certain that cosby would not want to help her anymore with her career in show business
but cosby followed through on his promise to mentor her , paying for her acting lessons in new york and los angeles , getting her a gym membership to help her lose weight , and regularly checking up on her progress
ideal : the last time patricia saw cosby in 1980 , the comic allegedly requested that she style her hair like queen queen noor ( left and right ) regal : patricia claimed cosby was ' obsessed ' with the beautiful american - born consort of king hussein , and that he even sent her a photo of the queen so that a hair stylist could replicate her loose bun patricia also accompanied the married actor to several events around the country
the last time she saw cosby during a live taping of the dinah shore show in 1980 , the comedian had an odd request : patricia was asked to style her hair like queen noor of jordan
patricia claimed that cosby was ' obsessed ' with the striking american - born consort of king hussein , and that he even sent her a photo of the queen so that a hair stylist could replicate her loose bun
after the show taping , patricia claimed that cosby talked her into taking some pills to relax her
she awakened the next morning naked and knew at once that something was awry
' i was very sick and knew that someone had penetrated me , ' the ex-model told the site
patricia then confronted cosby , but the comedian became furious , accused her of being an ingrate and threw her out of his suite
the woman kept mum about her experiences for the next three decades , saying that she felt ashamed and partially responsible for what happened to her because she trusted the wrong person and let herself be blinded by ambition
patricia finally broke her silence in 2005 after her therapist gave her the number of the detective investigating the allegations against cosby
she then joined 13 other women who agreed to testify as part of andrea constand 's five - count lawsuit against the beleaguered comic
patricia has become the seventh jane doe to speak out
she hopes other alleged victims will follow her example and come out of the shadows
' you 're not alone , ' she said
' you do nât have to keep this a secret anymore
