silva is a retired teacher for the american school for the deaf
silva and her husband , john , both having hearing difficulties , and in 2009 fell in love with a deaf siamese cat they found on the website petfinder
the cat , bambi , was in texas , so it took a while for her to be transported to connecticut where the couple live
in that time silva made the decision that she was going to teach bambi , as well as her other cats , bobcat and thomasina , how to sign
and she believes it worked paws up : in a video posted online , and silva told the huffington post : ' since my daughters learned signs from infancy , i had ideas how to introduce sign
she added : ' guess i missed the kiddies so i began teaching the kitties ! ' silva said it took time , but after dedicating herself to the task , she eventually got there
the cats are now able to understand her signs for words such as ' stay ' , ' sit ' , ' shake ' , ' dance ' and many more
' cats become much more interactive with people because they want to communicate , ' silva said
' bobcat was a '' pillow that ate '' before he learned sign
all rise : the cats seem quite up on the whole ' up ' sign , according to silva 's youtube video treat time : silva 's method for teaching the cats involved a lot of discipline
and treats ' he interacted with other cats , but ignored people
' after he learned sign at age 7 years , he became the extroverted show cat ! ' my cats will also do tricks with other people who sign with them
' the video of silva and her signing was made by her son - in - law , tim o'donnell , and originally posted to youtube .
