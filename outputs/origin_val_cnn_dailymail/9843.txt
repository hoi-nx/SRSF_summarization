whatever efforts virgin australia are making to provide flyers with cheaper fares , one of their passengers would prefer that they spent a little more on the up keep of their planes
one irate passenger was so angry at the lack of cleanliness of his virgin australia plane during a flight from sydney to melbourne that he took a video of it and uploaded it to youtube
the man known only as stuart mc called the video : â virgin australia â a disgrace
â what looks like a bolt is lying down the side of a seat along side some chewing gum ' and they want us to believe tiger is the discount carrier ...
this is the seat i was allocated this afternoon on va 868 syd to mel
obviously short cutting cleaning is the way to making a profit for virgin australia , ' stuart mc commented on the youtube segment
however it was definitely a warts and all video with dirty seats the first thing that you see
dust and grime also can bee seen lying down the side of the seat as the camera pans along you then see what looks like chewing gum , dust , grime and bits of paper down the side of the seat
it 's clear that the seats and down the side of them had not been cleaned for quite a while
even the arm rests were dirty
it was a gross rather than great experience
not that it was the only airline to be a loser in the cleanliness stakes
after splashing out up to Â£ 9,000 on first class flights on ba from gatwick to the caribbean , on what was supposed to be a ' trip of a lifetime ' , tv news presenter owen thomas was horrified to find dirt and grime caked around his first class seat
dust , detritus and hairs can be clearly seen in an other shot the arm rest of the seat has obviously not been washed for a while videoing the evidence , the former bbc anchorman posted the evidence on twitter , dubbing the service ' filth class '
narrating the short 30 - second video , the presenter explains : ' so this is ba first class and it is abs filthy
you see the marks on here , most of these you can just actually scrape off
' you see the stains down here
it 's when you open your seat that the real horror begins there is also dust and dirt down the side of the arm rest ' this is first class
' the former bbc anchorman and reporter flew off to st lucia with a companion on saturday in first class seats that retail on ba 's website for nearly Â£ 9,000 each in peak - season january
