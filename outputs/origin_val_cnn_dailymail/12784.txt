ryan reynolds gave us a sneak peek at his new costume last week , and followed it up with a first look on video
the actor posed on a bearskin rug to show off how he looks as masked marvel character deadpool in a post that quickly got positive responses from fans on social media
the photo is a parody of burt reynolds ' famous nude image from a 1972 issue of cosmopolitan and is very much in keeping with deadpool 's wisecracking , tongue - in - cheek persona
( here 's the original , in case you were born after 1972 or chose to delete the image from your mind
) deadpool 's costume , a favorite among comic book fans and convention cosplayers , includes a mask that covers the entire face , so we might not see the face of 2010 's sexiest man for much of the movie
ryan reynolds played deadpool in 2009 's " x-men origins : wolverine , " but he never wore the famous red and black attire
instead , he wore an unremarkable black suit bearing none of the hallmarks of the costume worn in the comics
as the vanity shot indicates , ryan reynolds will be fully suited when returns to the role in first the feature - length " deadpool , " scheduled for release in 2016
in response to skepticism online who was beneath the mask , screenwriter rhett reese confirmed via twitter that ryan reynolds was indeed in the suit
then as a special treat for april fools ' day , ryan reynolds was " interviewed " by " extra " host lopez , about the debate over whether the movie should be rated r. or r. the ultraviolent deadpool would seem to lend himself to an r rating , but ryan reynolds settled all that in memorable fashion , " killing " lopez in the process .
