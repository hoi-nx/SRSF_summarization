many football love stories start with a game shared with dad
i never had this , but i âd heard the stories and was hoping for that father - son experience when i took my eldest son jayden to wembley on sunday
he âs 10 and a chelsea fan like his dad
not like his brother koby who is seven and declared recently that he âs changing teams to support manchester united
on my mind was the paris metro incident
not that i was worried about the real chelsea fans but more so those idiots who put on the shirt claiming to be chelsea fans without caring what image or message they send out , and are just out to cause trouble
chelsea supporters pose with duberry ( centre ) and his eldest son , jayden ( second right ) at wembley chelsea fans cheer on their team in the capital one cup final - and duberry was one of the supporters at wembley chelsea celebrate winning the coca-cola cup at wembley in 1998 , duberry 's first trophy as a professional i did nât know what to expect
i was nât 100 per cent confident but we went by public transport on the jubilee line to wembley park because we wanted to walk down wembley way
a cup final would nât be the same without it
it was great to see jayden âs excited face counting down the stops as we neared the stadium
as soon as we stepped out of the station we saw waves of people in blue and white
what a great feeling it was walking down wembley way with my son
as a player you do nât get to experience this
i was loving it as much as him
the different races in blue shirts walking towards the stadium was clear to see
it was nothing like the image those racist idiots painted of chelsea fans on the paris metro
' as a player you do nât get to experience the walk down wembley way
i loved it as much as my son ' , said duberry ' it was a great feeling it was walking down wembley way with my son among different races in blue shirts ' the scenes on wembley way vastly contrasted with the behaviour of some fans on the paris metro last month chelsea have a more cosmopolitan set of fans than when i was playing
you have fans from all nationalities and not only british descent
the club must be happy with the progress and that paris incident must have felt like a painful kick in the short - and - curlies
after stopping to grab pizza , we went inside and when you see the pitch and the stadium , you ca nât help but wish you were out there
i played my one and only wembley cup final in march 1998 in this same competition , but known then as the coca-cola cup
we beat middlesbrough 2 - 0 and it was my first trophy as a professional
the chelsea supporters at wembley were a mixed set of fans from different races , families and groups ' when terry scored the first chelsea goal i enjoyed a brilliant , that father - son moment of celebrating ' as we took our seats , i gave him a history lesson about the day i played in this final 17 years ago
around us again were a mixed set of chelsea fans from different races , families , groups of lads and father and sons
after a while a few asked for pictures with me and also offered some kind words to me about my time at the club , dads explaining to their kids i used to play for chelsea and making me feel old
flag waving and singing songs with jayden and the other chelsea fans was great
i just had to make sure he missed out certain words to a few songs and it was fine
when terry scored the first chelsea goal it was brilliant , that father - son moment of celebrating was priceless , then to see the other fans celebrating with him was great
and just when i thought the smile on his face could nât get any bigger his favourite player , costa scored the second
' costa ( right ) , my son 's favourite player , scored the second goal to seal victory for chelsea ' costa 's deflected effort beat hugo lloris to make it 2 - 0 to chelsea in the capital one cup final when the final whistle went , we were high - fiving and hugging strangers and watching terry lift the trophy which brought back memories for myself of dennis wise letting gianluca vialli lift the trophy in 1998
we went home on the tube amongst lots of spurs fans , disappointed but singing very loudly
jayden kept laughing every time he heard a rude word
it was the only part of the day when i felt uncomfortable
it was a shame to hear more stories about alleged racism on a train later in the night
' watching terry lift the trophy with his team - mates brought back memories of my coca-cola cup win ' costa and terry pose with the capital one cup final trophy on the wembley pitch after the 2 - 0 victory the sooner a strong radical punishment for such behaviour is put in place the better it is for all
thankfully we saw nothing like it
i had enjoyed the day as a black father and a chelsea fan watching his team win at wembley
the only colour that mattered was the same one wrapped around the cup â¦ â¦
' the only colour that mattered was the one of the ribbons on the trophy , and they were chelsea blue '
