together : newly with his mother joan collins in 1999
he described her as a ' narcissist ' as alexis carrington in the glossy soap opera dynasty , she was a difficult and controlling mother
but dame joan collins â portrayal may have been closer to life than audiences realised , according to her only son
newley , 49 , said he loves the 81 - year - old actress â deeper than i can process â but added that he had a strained childhood relationship with her and described her as a â narcissist â who â abandoned â him and his sister tara , 51
the portrait painter also said : â her life still seems far too dramatic
she is always dealing with some disaster
as much as she says she longs for a peaceful life , i do nât think she could handle it
â mr newley , whose father was dame joan âs second husband , the actor and singer anthony newly , has described his early life in a yet to be published memoir , hollywood child ; the rights have been bought by a film producer
â my mother was nât a monster , she was a narcissist , â he said in an interview with the sunday times
â i ca nât remember her hugging me , but that does nât mean it did nât happen
â i just wanted mummy to love me , and i wanted a connection with the mummy i found so overwhelming and so dazzling
she nourished me in a way a muse nourishes ; at a distance
â he claimed his mother handed over care of her two children to a nanny because she was â overwhelmed â by being a mother , leading him to feel she had abandoned him
mr newley puts his mother âs alleged coldness down to her difficult relationship with her own father
â it âs true to say my mother did nât receive a great deal of affection from her father , â he said
â he was a glacier
my mother did nât get physical warmth from her father and a girl needs that

mr newly has revealed they had a strained childhood relationship and he felt abandoned after she left him in the care of a nanny he also revealed his unusual relationship with the nanny , sue delong , who later committed suicide after being fired from a series of jobs
he said how he would get almost sexual gratification from her physical methods of disciplining him
he said : â there was a lot of s&m
she would nât just sit on me , but sit and grind me into the carpet
it was like the relationship boys might have with their older brothers , but in my case it was with a woman who was employed , so it had a different frisson about it
â mr newly with his father , anthony newly , dame joan 's second husband ( left ) and at his mother 's book launch ( right ) the portrait painter also revealed his unusual relationship with the nanny , sue delong , who later committed suicide after being fired from a series of jobs mr newley said that he and his mother â who married fifth husband percy gibson , 49 , in 2002 â are currently â recalibrating â their relationship and have frequent lunches so they can talk
he also gave his assessment of his father , who died in 1999
while describing him as a musical genius , â the third in the holy trinity of sinatra and sammy davis â , he put his father âs comparative lack of success down to his womanising
