kremer , 49 , stole almost Â£ 2million from estate agency he worked at and used cash to fund gambling habit and bought ' laird ' title a bookkeeper stole almost Â£ 2million from his employers and used some of the money to buy a plot of land in scotland - complete with an aristocratic title
kremer , 49 , admitted fiddling the books at the estate agency he worked for in wokingham , berkshire , and used most of the cash to fund an internet gambling habit , a court heard
five members of staff at richard worth estate agents were made redundant due to the losses while the company fell into financial ruin
kremer , who has a husband of four years , sobbed in the dock at reading crown court on friday as he was jailed for five years after the judge described his offence as ' almost as bad as it can get '
prosecutor davies told the court kremer 's crimes came to light on january 31 , 2013 , after the salaries of two employees had not been paid
she said : ' jones , the company director , made inquiries about the balances in five of the company accounts because it was believed the balances were not as they should have been
' the court heard he had altered the figures on at least two of the accounts to an inflated sum to make them look higher than they were
he was confronted by staff and admitted taking Â£ 1.9 million over a four and a half year period , from july 2008 to january 2013 , and spent more than Â£ 630,000 on gambling
mr recorder martin heslop qc said : ' one of the gambling companies described him as their best customer
' credit card bills showed payments exceeding Â£ 4,000 a month and some of the cash was spent on hotels
he also bought a small plot of land in scotland which meant he could use the title laird julian kremer and he asked for his personal details to be altered to reflect the name change
company director , jones , who runs the company under the names richard worth ltd , richard worth residential ltd and richard worth holdings ltd , told the court he had known kremer for almost 20 years
miss davies said : ' kremer stole around Â£ 250,000 a year and told mr jones cash flow was not improving due to debts
' after the discovery , mr jones did everything he could to minimise financial ruin for the company
kremer , who has a husband of four years , sobbed in the dock at reading crown court ( pictured ) on friday as he was jailed for five years after the judge described his offence as ' almost as bad as it can get ' ' he had to borrow Â£ 250,000 personally and made redundant five members of staff
he took on a Â£ 1million debt which will take many years to repay
' the business was the bedrock of his retirement planning and he doubts he will ever recover from the financial disaster
' defending , sellick said mr jones had sold the letting limb of the business and the other was still trading
he told the court : ' he is of hitherto good character , he accepts this involves a very large sum
he made an immediate confession to his employers and he repeated this when he was arrested
' he now has nothing
he was heavily addicted to gambling and had to sell his Â£ 400,000 house
' by the 1990s , he had lost three of his grandparents and his mother 's brother
his brother simon was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2004 aged 41
' kremer separated from his wife in 2007 and has been in a civil marriage with his now husband since 2011
mr sellick said : ' he knows he has to be punished
i ask that you impose a sentence that will not crush him entirely
' the court heard kremer , formerly from wokingham , and now living in plymouth , devon , pleaded guilty to one count of theft from an employer in january
kremer admitted altering figures to make them look higher than they were and his crimes only came to light after there was not enough money to pay two members of staff at richard worth estate agents in wokingham jailing him for five years , mr recorder heslop said : ' this case paints a sad picture of a man of previous good character
' there are severe financial and personal consequences for those who suffered as a result of this theft
a suspended prison sentence is , i am afraid , wholly inappropriate
' this was a professional , sophisticated and at times extremely clever and deliberate theft involving fraud , forgery and misrepresentation to those for whom you worked and it is a theft on a very significant scale carried out over a substantial period of time
' the total sum is Â£ 1,981,936 and this is as bad a case as one could imagine
it is quite clear the money went on gambling
' there is also evidence of high living
you were using this money to enjoy a significantly high level of living
' kremer , carrying a large holdall and wearing a black suit and yellow tie , wiped his eyes as he was led away while family members sitting in the public gallery sobbed .
