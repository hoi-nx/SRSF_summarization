a mother - of - two claims she is forced to spend Â£ 2,000 a month on the school run after her son was denied a place at four local primary schools
frustrated beard , 26 , from orpington , london , says she spends around Â£ 100 per day ensuring four - year - old archie gets to school
but instead of walking her son to the local school like most parents , she is forced to drive 25 miles to archie 's current school in kings hill , kent
beard claims she spends Â£ 100 per school day - Â£ 2,000 a month - on the school run after son archie , four , did not get a place at a local school
they are pictured with father byron and little poppy , aged two this map shows the journey mrs beard does every day to ensure her son gets to his school 25 miles away the accounts manager then drops her two - year - old daughter poppy at a nearby nursery , before parking at the closest train station and getting the train to work in south bromley - just a few miles from her home
and at the end of the day , she has to do the entire journey in reverse , before picking them up from a childminder
she eventually gets the children home at around 8pm - 13 hours after they leave the house every morning
mrs beard said : ' it 's awful at the moment
we are under a lot of stress
' the kids are always sleeping in the car on the way
' the family estimate they spend around Â£ 2,000 a month on the school run - or Â£ 100 per school day
every day they have to pay for : more than 50 miles worth of petrol : costing Â£ 5 to Â£ 10 a day parking at west malling : Â£ 4 return train ticket from west malling to bromley south : Â£ 21.70 childminder : Â£ 20 at approx. Â£ 5 per hour nursery : Â£ 35 - Â£ 50 per day breakfast club for two children : Â£ 5 total : minimum spend of Â£ 95 per day mrs beard and recruitment manager husband byron , 30 , have already spent around Â£ 12,000 on the school run since archie started in september
they say they spend the money on petrol , train tickets , parking , a childminder , breakfast club and nursery fees
now the couple are so fed up with the daily grind that they have decided they have no choice but to sell their Â£ 400,000 home and move closer to the school
a spokesman for bromley council refused to comment on the case specifically
the spokesman said : ' bromley council is responsible for ensuring that children applying for a bromley school are offered a school place
' in common with the rest of london we have had exceptionally high demand for reception places and have worked hard to provide all parents who applied on time with an optimal school place
' the high demand means that proximity to school criteria may have a small radius , particularly in a year with large numbers of siblings
' the pan-london admissions scheme distributes places in a scrupulously fair and transparent way based on the eligibility criteria including the applicant 's permanent address and the number of places available at each school
' many schools are over-subscribed and can not offer to all who apply , and only reach limited distances under the proximity criteria
' the family say they spend Â£ 100 a day on petrol , train tickets , parking , childminder , breakfast club and nursery
