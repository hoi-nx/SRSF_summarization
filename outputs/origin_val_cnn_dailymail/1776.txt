the cheer for an ap mccoy - ridden winner this week might be loud but the decibel level could be matched if a runner trained by sandra hughes reaches the winner âs enclosure
and thursday might be that day as the sandra hughes - trained lieutenant colonel is 8 - 1 third favourite for the ladbrokes world hurdle , while the tullow tank is no forlorn hope in the opening jlt novices â nh chase
both will also carry a wave of sentimental support from the cheltenham crowd as sandra hughes took over the family stables close to the curragh after her father , dessie , lost his fight against cancer in november
sandra hughes celebrates victory at fairyhouse with lieutenant colonel and jockey bryan cooper a festival legend , dessie âs eight wins as a jockey included the 1977 gold cup on davy lad and the 1979 champion hurdle on monksfield
they were matched by eight winners as a trainer , headed by the back - to - back champion hurdle victories of hardy eustace in 2004 and 2005
appropriately , the track have named the prize for this week âs top trainer in dessie âs honour
it is a tribute that the sandra hughes family appreciate but securing a winner with what sandra hughes refers to as â dad âs horses â would be even more special
sandra hughes , whose thunder and roses unseated its jockey in the nh chase on tuesday , said : â it is great to get dad âs horses here because that is what he would have wanted
everything he did each season was working towards it , so to be honoured is lovely
trainer dessie hughes , who passed away in november last year , celebrates with bryan cooper in the winners enclosure after our conor 's win in the spring juvenile hurdle â we always came as a family so it is quite tough not having him here , but i feel he is looking down on me
and to see the warmth and the love people had for him was genuinely overwhelming
there is a big contingent over with us , the usual crew
the head of the ship is missing but we are here to make him proud
â with sandra hughes this week is dessie âs widow , eileen , and his son , richard , the three - time flat racing champion jockey who last week announced he will be setting up training in britain next year
but it was always the plan that sandra hughes would take the helm at her father âs stable
she said : â i thought it would be in 10 or 15 years â time
i never realised it would be this quick
but things happen and you just have to get on with it
our whole life revolved around putting the horses first and that is what we had to do
â me and richard are very close
it is great to have him for advice , even if it is at the end of a phone call
thankfully , i inherited a fabulous team of horses and a fabulous staff and it is working so far
â jockeys line up to observe a minute 's silence at cheltenham racecourse after the death of trainer sandra hughes the tullow tank is so called because it is the nickname of ireland rugby forward sean oâbrien
owner connell said : â i bought the horse from a friend of sean oâbrien and he was there at fairyhouse when he won his beginners chase
we had a couple of drinks and a good chat
â he is keen enough on his racing
his day job is a farmer when he is not playing rugby
â the horse won first time out and disappointed on his next two runs but we identified reasons for that
we are hoping he will put up a good show and is on his way back
â a win for the tullow tank would be popular as connell suffered the blow of losing sandra hughes - trained our conor in a fatal fall in last year âs champion hurdle
the hand of dessie is also very much behind the path steered by lieutenant colonel this season
he had always wanted a six - year - old he felt was some way off maturity to have another season over hurdles so , after he was beaten in his first steeplechase at naas in november , sandra hughes was delighted when his owners , ryanair boss michael and his racing manager brother eddie , suggested he switch back to the smaller obstacles
it has been a highly successful decision with two grade one wins snapped up â the hatton âs grace at fairyhouse a few days after dessie died and the christmas hurdle in december , beating jessica harrington âs jetson on both occasions
sandra hughes added : â he ran in a beginners chase and he was a little bit disappointing but it was always dad âs plan to keep him over hurdles for an extra year
he thought it would make a man of him
â so i was delighted when eddie and michael suggested going back over hurdles again , and plan a kicked in again
it was what dad wanted
â sandra hughes fits first - time cheekpieces on lieutenant colonel , who will be ridden by bryan cooper , and is also optimistic the tullow tank will run well
â i am very happy with him
his jumping has been a little bit of an issue but he jumped well at leopardstown last time and we feel we have him spot on
this was the race he was trained for all year so hopefully we will get it right
