retired print worker mr derek verlander said that he relied on library books and magazines for inspiration about all things japanese
he said : â the end of my garden is in a dip from a railway cutting
' some of my neighbours filled theirs in but i decided to create a pond and got some koi carp from a woman in basildon
king of the castle : the ballroom shed in keyworth , nottinghamshire , which is another entry in the 2015 shed of the year competition wheely good : the pear tree wedding hq shed in northamptonshire - the base of a vintage and classic volkswagen wedding hire company small opening : the hobbit house in merseyside , which has entered the annual competition sponsored by garden woodcare firm cuprinol â then when i looked on books about koi carp , i saw pictures of japanese gardens and thought that was a nice theme to go with
at the beginning , the garden was a wilderness
' it has become a 30 - year project , doing a bit more year by year
' i got the idea of the japanese bridge from a picture of one i saw in a library book
â i have had three bridges down the years as the first two were made from soft wood that rotted
' i prune holly bushes and fir trees into different shapes to make the garden look more japanese
â i have got two buddhas and three statues of bald - headed monks
' and five years ago , i saw a picture in a magazine featuring the chelsea flower show of a traditional japanese tea house
so i decided to create a westernised version of it
â mr derek verlander was quoted Â£ 7,000 by a local firm to build the tea house â so set about doing it himself for under Â£ 1,000

mr derek verlander relied on recycled kitchen doors and shower screens too to cut costs
the tea house also contains a tropical fish tank , tv and dvd player , sound system , bar , fridge - and a kettle
mr derek verlander said : â i have never actually been to japanese and i prefer ordinary tea , so i have typhoo in the teahouse
my wife linda and i have the odd gin and tonic in there too
' i collect japanese ornaments for the tea house very cheaply from charity shops
' i got some sake jars for only 30 pence each
my wife has girls â evenings in the tea house with her friends and our grandchildren love it - although they call it the â treehouse â
â i go down there every day to feed the fish
if i win the â shed of the year â competition i will have to put the prize money towards a trip to japanese for us

and almost a third - 32 per cent - admit their shed is so messy that they can barely get in through the door
