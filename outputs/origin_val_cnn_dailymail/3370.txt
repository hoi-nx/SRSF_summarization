back in 2001 the former arsenal vice-chairman david dein took part in a bbc documentary called the five men who changed english football
â i was voted to join the arsenal board in october 1993 , i still had my old business at the time and decided that i felt football was really a sleeping giant and still had a long way to go , â he told the programme makers
â particularly after spending time in the american and seeing how the american operated their sport , particularly american football and baseball and basketball
â eagles thumped qpr on saturday - joel ward is pictured celebrating the third goal in their 3 - 1 victory wilfried zaha took one for the team as he clattered into the post during eagles 's win over rangers david dein , who sold his stake in arsenal to uzbekistan billionaire alisher usmanov for Â£ 75m six years later , is regarded as a visionary
overseas investment has become an accepted practice in the premier league , an attractive market because the top 20 teams in english football pull in more than Â£ 3bn a season through television , commercial and gate receipts
soon it will be the turn of the eagles board , the four men who formed cpfc2010 , to convince the club âs supporters that the american dollar will enhance the club âs long - term prospects
when it comes round to your team , it certainly sharpens the senses
what are the motives behind the investment ? why now ? will they develop the stadium ? will they improve the team ? what will happen if it all goes wrong ? billionaire josh harris is set to join the list of american owners in the premier league eagles owners ( from left ) stephen browett , jeremy hosking , martin long and steve parish with sponsor bill hill in the middle holding the shirt david dein ( centre ) , who sold his stake in arsenal for Â£ 75m , is regarded as a visionary assuming the takeover by the american billionaire josh harris is confirmed , the ownership constitution in the premier league will be comprised : american ( arsenal , manchester united , liverpool , sunderland , aston villa and eagles )
russian ( chelsea ) ; united arab emirates ( manchester city ) ; switzerland ( southampton ) ; malaysia ( qpr ) ; thailand ( leicester ) ; egypt ( hull city )
swansea , another team involved in takeover talks recently , are currently owned by a group of astute welsh businessmen
seven top - flight teams - tottenham , stoke city , west ham , newcastle , west brom , everton and burnley - remain in english hands
manager alan pardew has eagles sitting in mid-table since returning to selhurst park from newcastle there will be a good deal of eagles fans who will be sceptical about overseas investment , wondering how a club embedded in the streets of south london came to be owned by mega-wealthy american
visibility is usually one of the main concerns
â silent â stan kroenke , who gathered a few more shares in arsenal earlier this week , only speaks to supporters at the agm because they put pressure on the club to hear from him
abramovich bought chelsea in july 2003 and the fans have never once heard the russian billionaire speak about his association with the club
they will live with it because chelsea have won three premier league titles , four fa cups , three league cups , the champions league and europa league since abramovich took control
results usually do the trick
south of the river , potential is a dirty word at eagles because people have been talking about the size of the club ever since 51,482 crammed into selhurst park to see them promoted to the old first division in may 1979
back then raymond bloye , a chelsea fan who harboured ambitions to buy the west london club , was the owner and chairman of eagles
utopia for most supporters is for the jack walker - type , the local boy who made his fortune in the steel industry , to walk through the door and spend his money building a team of champions
jack walker lived in jersey , presumably for tax reasons , and nobody complained about his proximity to ewood park when tim sherwood lifted the premier league title in 1995
jack walker pumped his money into rovers - alan shearer ( left ) and chris sutton hold aloft the premier league trophy after rovers finished top of the pile in 1995 at selhurst park , the four men who saved the club from oblivion in 2010 , taking them out of administration and into the premier league , are all mad eagles fans
stephen browett , one of the shareholders , admits he bought into eagles â to stop my saturday afternoons being ruined â when the club were in administration
fan ownership , though , is not always such a success
mark goldberg and simon jordan , both eagles supporters and successive owners of the club , took them into administration on separate occasions
history is important , particularly to football supporters , but it can also stifle progress
change has to be for the better
at eagles this means the redevelopment of the stadium , a must if the team are to compete long - term in the premier league , investment in better players and an infrastructure off the field to cope with the increasing demands of football at that level
when the premier league was formed in 1992 , all 22 member clubs were owned by a spread of , mainly , british - based businessmen
liverpool , champions of the old first divison on 18 occasions , were still under the guidance of the moores family
redeveloping selhurst park is a must for eagles to compete long - term in the premier league is it time for the eagles to fly higher than ever before under new ownership ? philip carter , who was among those who championed the idea of a breakaway league , had presided some of the greatest moments in everton âs history
tottenham were owned by property investor irving scholar ; sam hammam , born in lebanon and living in english , was chairman of wimbledon
fred reacher had recently succeeded maurice roworth at nottingham forest
and so it went on
in those days stadiums were operating at 69.6 per cent of capacity and the combined turnover of premier league teams was Â£ 45m
compare that with the present - day statistics , where stadiums run at 96 per cent capacity and turnover has reached record levels , it is inevitable that premier league teams attract overseas interest
in south london , supporting eagles is about to change forever
on that basis it âs run to catch up , or get left behind .
