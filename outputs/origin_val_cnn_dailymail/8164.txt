the bbc has hired bodyguards to protect its director general around the clock after he received a death threat for sacking jeremy clarkson
the bill to licence fee payers for extra security is expected to run into thousands of pounds after a menacing email to lord hall , apparently from an obsessive top gear fan overseas
but scotland yard insisted the threat was not considered grave enough to warrant diverting its own officers to guard lord hall
in response , the bbc hired security firm london protection services to protect lord hall , 64 , and his wife cynthia , 62 , at a cost estimated at more than Â£ 1,000 a day
guards in marked and unmarked vehicles were seen outside the couple âs Â£ 1.5million 18th century home in oxfordshire
the bbc âs head of security made an urgent appeal on wednesday for former special forces personnel to take part in the operation , the mail on sunday reported
a security source told the paper : â a select group of close protection officers were told that , as a direct result of the top gear punch - up and jeremy clarkson being sacked by the bbc , the d-g had received a death threat
â some of the operation was visible , as a deterrent , while other bodyguards would have kept a very low profile
â lord hall sacked jeremy clarkson , 54 , after an internal inquiry found he had launched an â unprovoked verbal and physical attack â on junior producer oisin tymon , 36
visible security : lord hall leaves his home last week accompanied by guards , with the bill expected to run into the thousands the row broke out after the star complained no hot food was available at the yorkshire hotel where the tv crew were staying after a day âs filming
last night scotland yard said police were investigating an allegation of threats to kill after the email to lord hall
a spokesman added : â inquiries are ongoing to establish where the email came from
at the moment we think it was sent from abroad
â we do not have any officers guarding him
the security is being organised by the bbc
â police sources played down the seriousness of the potential threat to lord hall
one said : â this is very much a local investigation by the bobbies in the borough of westminster
it would be wrong to think that there are a crack team of detectives on it
â we âve not considered it necessary to take officers away from other duties to guard him
â tory politician philip davies , who sits on the commons culture , media and sport committee , said : â the police are best placed to know how serious this threat is
obviously the person who sent it is some kind of nutter
but you never know what these people are capable of
â the bbc are in a difficult position
if they do nothing about it and something dreadful happens , they will be criticised
but if they take some action and nothing happens , they will be accused of over-reacting
â london protection services boasts of having 1,000 certified guards available nationwide and is said to charge Â£ 300 per man per shift
the bbc said : â we would nât comment on security matters
â n chris evans has denied rumours that he is being lined up to replace jeremy clarkson on top gear
the radio 2 and one show host , 48 , who collects classic cars , has said he would not take the job even if it was offered .
