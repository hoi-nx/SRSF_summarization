' despite having complete confidence in her unfinished venue megan crofts admits that there have been a few difficulties with planning
' of course , some aspects of the planning have been difficult , for example , figuring out flowers and themes was a little tricky because we have n't seen the interior or any colour scheme
' living so far away has also been a little tricky , but the team at the venue have been great at liaising with my parents
' megan crofts will not be the first in her family to celebrate a milestone at the royal college of surgeons , as her father , trevor , is a fellow of the royal college of surgeons
