six months ago kobane was a city in panic as the kurdish were desperately fleeing isis forces as they bared down on the border town , fearful that they would be slaughtered like the yazidis before them if the settlement was overrun by the fanatical jihadis
now the terrorists have gone , beaten back into the desert by kurdish forces and coalition airstrikes , and the residents can return to their ' saved ' city
but , as these images show , not a lot of the home they remember is still standing
tanks rust in the streets , buildings reduced to mere shells after bombings serve as temporary shelter for those who survived , while a little girl is reduced to lighting a fire underneath a piece of rubble in the street to keep warm
a sign which once proudly displayed the town 's name now stands riddled with bullet holes , like the few buildings left standing around it
the battle for kobane was the fiercest and most bloody battle of the war against isis to date , and represented the group 's first major defeat after months of virtually unopposed victories which saw them take swathes of territory in iraq and syrian
at one point things looked so bad that turkey president recep erdogan declared the city was only hours away from completely falling into isis ' bloodstained hands
victory was secured at the end of january after the last isis fighters were forced from the city 's suburbs and into their strongholds along the euphrates river
civilians forced to flee across the border into turkey are now returning home
the residents who survived or have returned are now faced with living in conditions like this pride : a syrian kurdish woman sweeps rubble out of what is left of her home after isis fighters fled the city of kobane
the fighting here lasted for four months , and has left the city in ruins making the most of it : just six months ago this kurdish boy , along with thousands of other kurdish , were desperately fleeing kobane , fearful they would be slaughtered if the city was overrun
now they can return , but little of their previous home remains desperate : with little or no access to water and electricity , this young girl is forced to light a fire underneath rubble in the street to keep warm and cook her food shattered : a kobane sign riddled with bullets and shrapnel marks mirrors the condition of the few building that are left standing around it homecoming : after four months of fierce fighting the kurdish , who were facing near extinction at the hands of isis , are able to return to what is left of their home town and begin rebuilding it flattened : a girl rides in a trailer being towed into kobane by tractor as rows of levelled houses can be seen in the background
the city was heavily bombed by coalition warplanes during six months of fighting in order to dislodge isis troops taking cover there all gone : a kurdish man looks out over the destroyed city of kobane from the balcony of his bullet - riddled home , just over a month after the last isis fighters fled for their strongholds along the euphrates river littered : a woman stands among the ruins of her old home , as the streets around her are scattered with rubble , clothes , and ruined cars destroyed : the remains of another tank are testament to the ferocity of the fighting in kobane
against all the odds , kurdish forces which were at one point pinned in the centre of the city , managed to fight their way out and claim victory nothing left : a man holding a rolled up cigarette and clutching a glass of drink stands among the ruins of his house
at one point the situation here was so dire the turkey prime minister warned the city was hours from falling into isis hands all he has left : a kurdish man walks back into his home after six months spent hiding from isis across the border in turkey
on his back he carries everything he owns wrapped into a rug back to business : a baker goes back to work amid the shattered remain of kobane as residents go about trying to rebuild their previous lives what remains : a kurdish boy walks down the stairwell of his home in kobane , littered with rubble and a keyboard
isis fighters have previously been videoed destroying the instruments for being ' un-islamic '
