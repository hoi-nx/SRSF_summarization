â be honest , do you really hope so ? â quizzed vettel when rosberg claimed â it would be good if they [ ferrari ] can come a bit closer â
vettel added : â seriously ? you finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it âs going to be closer ? so you hope you slow down ? is that what you âre saying ? â rosberg responded : â i hope that you can give us a challenge
because it âs important for the sport and for the fans
and i do think about the show
i want to give people a great time at home watching on tv or at the track
if you do come a bit closer , that would be awesome for everybody

â you can come if you want , we can invite you , â said rosberg
â ok , thank you for the invite , i âll come , ' vettel replied
the spat continued when vettel said it was â a shame â that his team - mate kimi did nât finish the race â the finn was forced to retire after his pit - crew failed to properly attach his rear - left tyre during his second stop
â you find it a shame that your team - mate did nât finish ? â quizzed rosberg , seemingly still irked by vettel âs earlier interrogation
i do nât know how much you like each other , â answered vettel in reference to rosberg âs relationship with lewis hamilton , which descended into chaos at times last season as they vied for the title
â but kimi and myself we get along , so i think it is a shame , ' vettel added
lewis hamilton saw off the challenge from rosberg to win the opening race of the new season video hamilton cruises to victory in australian gp q : question to both lewis hamilton and rosberg
we âve seen dominance in qualifying , dominance in the race today
is this it for the season ? a two - horse race between you two for the title or can you envisage any of your rivals making in - roads into your supremacy ? lh : i think rosberg was just explaining â¦ i did nât know , i did nât see the times or anything but i think the ferraris have taken a huge step forward
it âs clear they âve made one of the biggest steps
so we definitely can not back off because i âm sure they âre going to be pushing
and i anticipate we might have a good fight with them at some stage this year â¦ rosberg ? nr : i hope we can have a good fight
i think the next couple of races we âre going to be leading the way for sure , and we âre going to try and keep it that way , but we know it would be good if they can come a bit closer , as long as they do nât come too close â¦ sv : be honest
do you really hope so ? seriously ? you finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it âs going to be closer ? so you hope you slow down ? is that what you âre saying ? nr : i hope that you can give us a challenge ! because it âs important for the sport and for the fans
and i do think about the show
half of me â or a part of me â thinks about the show because i want to give people a great time at home watching on tv or at the track
if you do come a bit closer , that would be awesome for everybody
sv : first suggestion , if you do nât mind , i think your garage becomes public for malaysia and everyone can have a look
no ? i âm joking
nr : you can come if you want , we can invite you â¦ sv : ok , thank you for the invite , i âll come
nr : friday malaysia , ok
sv : engineers â room ? debrief , i âll be there
q : vettel , among the races to come , which one do you feel will be the one that is easier for you , for ferrari to catch up to the mercedes ? i think malaysia will be difficult but what about bahrain or shanghai ? sv : easy , for us ? i think if you look at the gap , nowhere is going to be easy
i think we have to focus on ourselves , make sure that what we learned this weekend we âre able to take into the next races
the most important thing now is that if we finish â we did finish right behind mercedes today
we need to confirm that in the next race , that âs the priority number one , so we need to make sure that i was not just a one - off
as i said , kimi did nât finish , which is a shame
we could have scored a lot more points today
nr : ... that you find it a shame that your teammate did nât finish ? sv : yes
i do nât know how much you like each other but kimi and myself we get along , so i think it is a shame
nr : i though as a racing driver you might like it that you have a couple of points advantage over him now
i do nât want to get you off the foot there , sorry
look at him , look at him go ... sv : i can see your point
no , no. i can see that at the moment , where we are , we want to make sure we catch you guys and to do that we both need to score
yes , i honestly think so and i honestly did nât want to see the second car not finishing today
nr : because i âm ready for it now , you caught me a bit off guard before but now i âm ready for it ! teen sensation verstappen missed out on finishing in the points in his grand prix bow
verstappen , 17 , the youngest driver in f1 history , was running in ninth before mechanical gremlins struck
he was forced to park his toro rosso after 32 laps , which , in a remarkable coincidence , was the same number his father jos completed before retiring on his 1994 f1 debut in brazil
lewis hamilton âs win , the 34th of his gp career , means he has won seven of the last eight races
it leaves him five shy of vettel , fourth on the all - time list , and seven adrift of boyhood hero ayrton senna
it is understood that susie , the british racer , will not deputise for valtteri bottas in malaysia if the finn fails to recover from his back problem
â susie is our test driver , not our reserve driver , â said the team âs boss claire williams .
