alastair cook fell cheaply in both innings as mcc lost inside three days to county champions yorkshire in abu dhabi
alastair cook , who made just three first time round , mustered five at his second attempt on tuesday morning - before his attempt to dispatch a short ball from brooks went straight into the hands of rashid at midwicket
the england captain will next week depart for his first international assignment of this ashes year - to take on west indies
alastair cook trudges off the field in abu dhabi after falling for five following just three in the first innings the england captain faced 30 balls for his five for the mcc as they were easily beaten by yorkshire but he will do so on the back of two failures in his only two first - class innings since last season
without a major contribution from him - and despite 74 in the second innings from his fellow , and former england , opener nick compton - mcc went down by nine wickets
they conceded a first - innings deficit of 151 , and then managed only 220 all out next time as brooks ( three for 22 ) and rashid ( four for 72 ) took the bowling honours - england 's leg - spin call - up finishing with two wickets in two balls
yorkshire needed 20 overs under lights against the pink ball in the desert to knock off the 70 required
alastair cook 's potential england opening partner , adam lyth , wrapped up the match with 46 not out adam lyth hits through the offside at sheikh zayed stadium as yorkshire claimed a nine - wicket victory first - innings centurion adam lyth , alastair cook 's prospective new test opening partner after being named in the squad to take on the west indies , finished the match with successive boundaries off adam riley for an unbeaten 46
the white rose therefore started the new season with an emphatic win
alastair cook caused a stir last week when he described england 's decision to replace him as their world cup captain as " probably wrong " , in hindsight
he continued his poor form in a one - day international series in sri lanka late last year , and england responded by dropping him in favour of eoin morgan
yorkshire opener , adam lyth ( centre ) , at the end of the match as his side needed 20 overs to chase down 70 they went on , however , to make an embarrassing early exit from the global tournament in australia and new zealand - beating only minnows scotland and afghanistan , and eliminated by a defeat against bangladesh
alastair cook agreed to play for mcc against yorkshire at the sheikh zayed stadium in the traditional curtain - raiser for the new season
but there was to be no return to form for england 's most prolific england centurion - who is without an international hundred in any format since may 2013 .
