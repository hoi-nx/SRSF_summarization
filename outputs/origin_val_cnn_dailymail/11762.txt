they may not be much to look at - but these scraps of land and tumbledown shacks could prove a bargain for buyers in new orleans
the city government is selling some 1,700 vacant lots and ruined properties which have gone unclaimed for years - many since the devastation wrought by hurricane katrina in 2005
tens of thousands fled the city , never to return , in the wake of the devastating storm , leaving many homes to crumble into ruin , and patches of land to grow wild
past its best : this property , 1904 frenchmen street , is one of the homes for sale
the vast majority of the lots are empty plots typical : more than 1,000 empty spaces like these will be sold - after the city has given up any realistic hope of finding previous owners
pictured is 838 bellville street and after years of taxes and charges on the land piling up , city authorities have decided to cut their losses by putting them all up for auction
there is no minimum bid , but every property comes with at least $ 3,000 of fees - meaning nothing will go for less than that
the properties were only put forward after city tax collectors tried to find the rightful owners and failed , the new orleans times-picayune reported
many have so many charges stacked up that paying them off would cost more than the plot is worth
nonetheless , anybody interested must put down a $ 650 deposit , to cover the cost of trying again to track down the owners and giving them one last chance to square their debts
anomaly ? apartment # 10 inside this building , 627 ursuline avenue in the french quarter , is also listed for auction , despite its much smarter appearance than most lots for sale
however , there is no word on what it is like inside tempting : this patch overgrown weeds - also known as 3050 north miro street - is one of the almost 1,800 lots for sale some of the lots are empty patches of ground , others are overgrown with weeds or piled with trash
many are barely a mile from the historic french quarter , and not far from parks or the shores of lake pontchartrain
one property , on the city 's ursuline avenue , appears to be within a still - standing and well - appointed apartment building - but there was no word on its condition inside
other complete properties , largely wooden shacks , are so dilapidated they can hardly stay upright
they are being listed online by civic source , a company holding the auction on the city 's behalf
buyers are being encouraged to cross-references the addresses with online street view services to get a look at what they are bidding on
empty : the unused land around this university building is another one of the lots - listed under 131 south liberty street all - natural : 1925 felician street is another of the chunks of land which has gone unclaimed and unmaintained trash - heap : 3039 pauger street was another of the vacant lots up for sale in the huge auction city authorities have also said that all the sales are conditional on the auctioneers being able to get title insurance for the homes
however , unlike similar schemes in other cities , there is no provision that owners have to develop or repairs the plots - or even live there
this has raised fears that professional investors and would - be landlords will take advantage of the low prices to turn large profits after improving the properties , especially as prices and the reputation of new orleans as a city recover
however , the prospect seems not to worry the administration of mayor mitch landrieu , which could earn millions of dollars from the sale .
