a former uncover cia officer has launched a $ 25 million lawsuit against the spy agency in federal court , claiming he was wrongly fired after a senior manager fabricated allegations to tarnish his career , have him sacked and keep him from marrying the woman he loves
the officer filed the lawsuit in u.s. district court for the district of columbia under the pseudonym charles in january
charles ' lawsuit alleges that he had a solid record as a cia officer , reaching the bureaucratic equivalent of a lieutenant colonel in the military
he served in a war zone , won awards and received good ratings , the lawsuit says
a former uncover cia officer has launched a $ 25 million lawsuit claiming he was fired after a senior manager tarnished his record and prevented him from marrying the woman he loves but he ran afoul of his bosses after he filed an age discrimination complaint in 2009 , the lawsuit says
his complaint asserted that managers sought to impede his romantic relationship with another cia non-official cover officer - 21 years his junior - who became his fiancee , the suit says
the pair had planned to spy overseas together as a ' tandem couple , ' but have n't spoken to her since his firing , the lawsuit says
in march 2011 , charles claims that a senior manager ' took the monstrous step ' of ordering the woman to cease all contact with him , threatening her with an assignment at cia headquarters in washington if she disobeyed , effectively an end to her career overseas , reports the daily beast
charles says he is suffering depression as a result of having no contact with his fiancÃ©e who he ' thinks about [ her ] every day and misses her as much today as on the first day of his forced separation from her
' the suit also accuses the cia of illegally barring the former officer from publishing his novel , tentatively titled madhouse : a forbidden novel of the cia
the cia allocated billions of dollars to expanding the noc program after 9/11 , but the effort was largely a failure , claims mack charles in his lawsuit the cia faces occasional employment lawsuits like any other government agency , but this one is unusual because of the plaintiff 's claim to have been a non-official cover officer , or noc , in cia parlance
most cia case officers work out of embassies posing as diplomats , giving them a level of protection should they be arrested while committing espionage
nocs pose as businessmen , scholars or scientists in an effort to distance them from the u.s. government and afford them access to people who would never set foot in a u.s. embassy
if caught spying overseas , they could be jailed
the noc program is even more secretive than traditional espionage , and officers who participate often operate using their real names instead of aliases
the cia allocated billions of dollars to expanding the noc program after 9/11 , but the effort was largely a failure , former officers have said â a charge charles repeats in his lawsuit
the suit says the leader of the cia 's global deployment initiative â its main non-official cover program â tried to get charles fired in 2009 , but a cia board declined to take that step
mack charles filed his $ 25 million lawsuit in the u.s. district court for the district of columbia in january charles claims that another former agent jones was able to publish their book about life as a noc after that , the lawsuit says , another senior officer , who headed the special activities division â the cia 's paramilitary arm â wrote a memo alleging that charles had in the past fudged expense accounts
that allegation is false , the lawsuit claims , but it says the allegation led to charles ' termination in december 2010
the equal employment opportunity commission ruled against charles ' discrimination complaint
the lawsuit alleges that the officer who wrote the memo , who is not identified by name , had a ' checkered career ' that included a drinking problem , and was asked to retire amid sexual harassment allegations
the head of the global deployment initiative was a subpar officer who also abused alcohol , the lawsuit alleges , claiming that the ' multibillion - dollar ' noc program ' was shot through with waste , fraud , and abuse
' when he submitted his novel to the cia 's publication review board , the lawsuit says , charles was told he could not publish any of it for fear his true name , which he used while working undercover for the cia , would be revealed
the suit notes that at least one other former noc has published a book under a pseudonym , jones , while keeping his true name a secret
jones did so without seeking permission from the cia , leading the agency to obtain a court ruling in 2012 seizing the proceeds
charles and his supporters are asking the public for financial donations to help fund his legal battle and have setup a gofundme.com page .
