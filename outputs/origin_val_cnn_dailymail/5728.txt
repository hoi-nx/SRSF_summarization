the new surface 3 has a slightly smaller 10.8inch screen , but will run a full version of windows 8.1

the new tablet has a slightly smaller screen - 10.8 inches rather than 12 atom x7 processor front - ( 3.5mp ) and rear - facing ( 8mp ) cameras that both capture 1080p video 10 hour battery life ' as we planned the next addition to the surface family , the questions to answer for our customers became simple , ' said panos panay of microsoft
' what product would we build to be sure we could make the very best of what we built in surface 3 available to many , many more people ? ' we started with what we âre known for â a great tablet that works as a laptop , the ability to run all windows 8.1 apps including full office , and a pen experience that really sets surface apart
' we knew we would offer all of this in a more affordable package but decided at the outset that we would make no compromise on maintaining the beautiful fit and finish , the craftsmanship that so many love in our surface products
' priced at $ 499 ( vs $ 799 to $ 1,949 for the pro 3 ) , the new tablet has a slightly smaller screen - 10.8 inches rather than 12 - a slower processor , and less flexible kickstand - just three angles rather than unlimited positions
