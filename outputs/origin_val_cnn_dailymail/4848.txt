the labour party has upset its own mps after selling mugs promising a control on immigration
the Â£ 5 souvenirs were supposed to drum up cash for the party 's election fighting fund
but they have sparked a storm of criticism , with prominent backbencher diane abbott branding them ' shameful '
ed miliband 's promise to control immigration has been used as an unlikely slogan for a Â£ 5 red mug on sale on the labour party website labour party released five mugs to coincide with the launch of ed miliband 's five election pledges
each red mug , sold through the party 's website , has one of the pledges written in white
but the one promising ' controls on immigration ' has uspet some of the party faithful
ms diane abbott wrote on twitter : ' this shameful mug is an embarrassment
' but real problem is that immigration controls are one of our 5 pledges at all
' at 5pm on sunday there were 267 of the mugs still available , according to the labour party website
the other pledges are : ' a strong economic foundation ' , ' higher living standards for working families ' , ' an nhs with the time to care , ' and ' a country where the next generation can do better '
at 5pm on sunday there were 267 of the mugs still available , according to the labour party website labour party mp diane abbott , a former frontbencher in mr ed miliband 's health team , condemned the mugs - and policy - as ' shameful ' a labour party spokesman said : ' labour party has five election pledges
this is one of the election pledges
' mr ed miliband was tackled on immigration last week as he appeared on the first tv contest of the election campaign
told that the last labour party government 's figures on the numbers expected to come to britain were ' farcical ' , he admitted : ' yes , they were wrong
i think that we benefit from our diversity , immigrants over the years have made a big contribution to our country but we do need proper controls
but he refused to set a limit on the number of people he thought could live in britain before it was full
' i 'm not going to get into your hypotheticals , ' he told interviewer jeremy paxman on the sky news / channel 4 programme
challenged about his ability to take difficult decisions , mr ed miliband shot back : but am i tough enough ? hell yes , i 'm tough enough
' the ' hell yes ' slogan has also been seized on by the labour party , which has had it printed on t - shirts for sale to raise money for campaign coffers
challenged about his ability to take difficult decisions , mr ed miliband shot back : ' am i tough enough ? hell yes , i 'm tough enough
' the slogan has been put on t - shirts now being sold by the labour party cameron has come under fire after promising ' no ifs , no buts ' to cut net migration to below 100,000
but latest figures released last week show that a total of 298,000 more people arrived in britain than left in the year to september , as the numbers arriving from the rest of the eu hit a record high
a record 624,000 arrived in britain in a year , up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months
at the same time , 327,000 left , a figure which has barely changed since 2010
some senior tories urged mr cameron to ditch the pledge , but he has vowed to repeat it for the general election this year too
he told the sunday telegraph : ' britain is facing quite a lot of pressure because the level of migration has been too high for too long
you see that on school places , and you see that in some places on the health service
' i can absolutely say to people who are concerned about this , ' i hear you , i hear your concern , i get your message
he insisted he sticks to his pledge : ' you can call it an ambition , you can call it a target
that is what i want to achieve
