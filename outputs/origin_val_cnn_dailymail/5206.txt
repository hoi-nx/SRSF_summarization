fresh from his return to england colours in the rbs 6 nations , cipriani was back in action on tuesday to front the â welcome back to milk â campaign for a2 milk
cipriani 's superb form for sale sharks saw the talented fly half called up to stuart lancaster 's squad for the 2015 championship
the former wasps and melbourne rebels playmaker made a number of impressive cameos from the bench during the championship and capped off his first appearance at twickenham since november 2008 with a late try in the 47 - 17 victory against italy in february
' milk has always been a vital part of my training regime , but for some reason ordinary milk was making me feel lethargic and bloated
since i discovered a2 milk i have been feeling fantastic , ' said cipriani
' i know a2 milk has become huge in australia where it was initially launched and i once lived
i want to do the same here and help change the lives of kids and adults who have had trouble with ordinary milk like me
it has changed my life â i want to encourage others to try it for themselves
cipriani came off the bench to score a late try for england in their 47 - 17 victory against italy in round two ' milk is such an important food - for growth , bone health and also for post-training recovery
if i had n't ditched ordinary milk and taken up a2 milk , i would n't be feeling as good as i do today
' cipriani will back in sale sharks colours on sunday as steve diamond 's side welcome gloucester to the aj bell stadium for a crucial aviva premiership clash .
