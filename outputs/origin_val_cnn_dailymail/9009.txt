uk 's biggest pensions firm has come under fire for exploiting savers after dishing out Â£ 49million in pay and perks to its bosses last year
with less than a week before the biggest shake - up in the pensions market for more than a century , insurance giant pru was last night accused of â greed â after revealing the extraordinary awards lavished on its senior executives
mps and pension experts said the scale of the awards would be particularly galling for millions of savers trapped in poor - value annuities or paying excessive charges
tidjane thiam ( left ) , the pru âs ivorian chief executive , was the highest paid board member , but this was dwarfed by the Â£ 15.4million scooped by fund manager richard woolnough ( right ) tidjane thiam , the pru âs ivorian chief executive , was the highest paid board member , with a total package of Â£ 11.8million last year â a 36 per cent pay rise from the Â£ 8.7million he received the previous year
this takes the total amount he has collected in five years at the helm to more than Â£ 41million
the 52 - year - old announced his resignation earlier this month and will shortly become chief executive of credit suisse
but his pay was dwarfed by the Â£ 15.4million scooped by fund manager richard woolnough â who runs almost Â£ 35billion of savers â money for the pru âs investment arm m&g
mr richard woolnough runs several funds which are widely held in savers â pensions and investment isas
these include the m&g optimal income fund , which runs just under Â£ 24billion of savers â money
pru âs nine board directors shared a total of Â£ 49million in pay and perks last year
mike wells , the boss of the insurer âs us arm and the man expected to take over from mr tidjane thiam , was paid Â£ 11.4million
last night dr ros altmann , a leading pensions expert and a government adviser for older workers , accused pru of â short - changing â savers who took out annuities by offering poor rates
tidjane thiam , the pru âs ivorian chief executive , was the highest paid board member , with a total package of Â£ 11.8million last year she said : â over the last few years pru has been one of the worst culprits , offering poor annuity rates
' i would imagine that any saver short - changed in one of its annuities would feel most uncomfortable to know the extra profit this company has made on their retirement fund has helped bump up the pay for its top bosses to a figure they could only dream of earning in a lifetime
â today a 65 - year - old man with a Â£ 100,000 pensions pot would receive an annual income of just Â£ 3,899 from a pru annuity
this is more than Â£ 400 less per year than they would get if they shopped around for the best deal
earlier this year an investigation by the city watchdog found the Â£ 12billion - a - year annuity market is not working well for customers , with millions of people trapped in poor deals
john mann , a labour member of the treasury select committee , said : â savers and particularly pensioners will be incredibly angry at this greed which comes at their expense
the failure in annuities demonstrates why such obscene pay is out of order
â the payouts are bigger than those handed out to uk âs biggest banks , which have been the primary focus of anger over fat - cat pay
lloyds â chief executive antonio horta osorio was comfortably the highest - paid bank boss in the uk last year , scooping Â£ 11.5million
stuart gulliver of hsbc was next in the pecking order with Â£ 7.6million
in comparison , highly paid pensions bosses have largely managed to avoid the limelight
but the increasingly fierce criticism of the pensions industry â including accusations of excessive charges and poor annuity rates for savers â has contributed to growing criticism over pay
last night pru defended the huge payouts
it said profits at the company jumped 14 per cent last year to Â£ 3.2billion , while it paid out Â£ 945million in dividends to shareholders , a 10 per cent jump on the previous year
a spokesman said : â the remuneration of our leadership team is closely linked to the strong long - term performance of the business
