vitaã¯ lampada , which means ' the torch of life ' , also makes reference to the battle of abu klea in sudan in january 1885
the poem , in full : there 's a breathless hush in the close to - night â ten to make and the match to win â a bumping pitch and a blinding light , an hour to play and the last man in
and it 's not for the sake of a ribboned coat , or the selfish hope of a season 's fame , but his captain 's hand on his shoulder smote ' play up ! play up ! and play the game ! ' the sand of the desert is sodden red , â red with the wreck of a square that broke ; â the gatling 's jammed and the colonel dead , and the regiment blind with dust and smoke
the river of death has brimmed his banks , and england 's far , and honour a name , but the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks : ' play up ! play up ! and play the game ! ' this is the word that year by year , while in her place the school is set , every one of her sons must hear , and none that hears it dare forget
this they all with a joyful mind bear through life like a torch in flame , and falling fling to the host behind â ' play up ! play up ! and play the game ! '
