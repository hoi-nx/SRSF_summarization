a video has revealed just how smart pigs are , which may leave some people a little more reluctant to tuck into a choice cut of pig
the latest evidence of the creature 's intelligence shows a pig sorting shapes without any human intervention
moritz the pig in berlin , germany has solved a complex puzzle
the pig did it without any help from a human
in a video ( shown ) the pig puts coloured shapes into a wooden block
recent research also revealed they have empathy like humans the video was recorded by eberkopf , who lives in berlin , germany
in a video , moritz the pig places coloured pig - shaped blocks in corresponding coloured holes on a wooden board
the pig does this using its mouth , without any help
â animals are an important part of our society , â said ms von eberkopf
the sign of pig intelligence follows research earlier this year when scientists discovered that the creatures may be capable of empathy - a characteristic thought to be almost uniquely human
in an elaborate experiment , experts discovered that pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates
this findings by wageningen university in the netherlands suggest that swine respond to each other âs feelings , and adds weight to the argument that the practice of separating the animals in farms is especially cruel
the pigs were trained either to anticipate happiness or distress , by playing them music and either rewarding them with a pleasant treat such as chocolate raisins and a roomy house filled with peat , or putting them in a stressful situation , such as keeping them in isolation in a small pen
untrained , â naÃ¯ve â pigs were placed in a pen with a pig conditioned to expect happiness , or one that expected discomfort
all the pigs were then played the same music â a piece by bach - used in training
some of the trained pigs showed that they anticipated what may happen to them , either by displaying happy behaviours - such as wagging their tails and barking - or signs of stress , such as keeping their ears back , urinating and defecating
despite most of the trained pigs failing to react at all , they were still taken to another pen , leaving the naÃ¯ve pigs behind , and were either rewarded or punished , depending on their training
the naÃ¯ve pigs , which could not have known what lay in store for their penmates , reacted to the trained pigs â behaviour anyway
asian elephants show concern for others when they are stressed , using their trunks to caress the suffering elephant and emit a soft ' chirp , ' discovery recently reported
consoling elephants put their trunk into another elephant 's mouth so they are vulnerable , perhaps showing they are there to help
crows and ravens are also known to be emotionally intelligent , with researchers at the konrad lorenz research station in austria finding that the birds comfort others that are stressed after a fight
ravens sit next to the distressed bird so their bodies are touching and sometimes preen it
university of portsmouth research has shown that orangutans ( stock image ) can be so full of empathy that they take on the moods of others
when one orangutan laughs , others often join in scrub jays - another member of the corvid family - have ' funerals ' for deceased friends , according to research by the university of california , davis
they fly over the dead body , wailing and screeching , which may be a sign of grief
mice have been shown to detect pain among others but only appear to console their family and friends
garet lahvis , an assistant professor at oregon health and science university , said : ' mice are capable of a more complex form of empathy than we ever believed possible
' similarly , rats are believed to be able to respond to excitement , fear and anger
they even help each other out with no prospect of a reward , according to washington state university
the rodents also show that they enjoy being tickled and playing by giggling
gorillas not only care for each other but have even been seen to care for dolls

the sign of pig intelligence follows research earlier this year when scientists discovered that the creatures may be capable of empathy - a characteristic thought to be almost uniquely human
in an elaborate experiment , experts discovered that pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates for example , when a trained pig showed it was stressed , a naÃ¯ve pig acted in the same way , by becoming more alert and keeping its ears back
the behaviour was even more noticeable when the untrained animals noticed the behaviour of trained â happy â pigs , with the animals becoming more playful and wagging their tails
to test that the animals were responding to each other âs behaviour and not simply the music , the scientists played the naÃ¯ve pigs the tune
they showed no signs of changing their behaviour , indicating they were showing empathy with the trained animals
the findings were published in the journal animal cognition .
