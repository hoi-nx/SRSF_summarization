the attack on tunisian 's famed bardo museum is just the latest evidence that parts of north and africa have become a magnet for islamist extremism
tunisian -- lying just across the mediterranean from europeans , but bordered on one side by libyans and on the other by algerian -- has until now not suffered the kind of large - scale terror attacks seen in both those nations in recent years
but it has emerged as a place of increasing concern as the threat of islamist extremism has intensified in the region
islamist terrorists also have struck in algerian , where they killed at least 37 hostages at a gas field in 2013 , and in libyans , where terrorists killed the u.s. ambassador and three others in 2012 and where isis has established a beachhead in the east
al qaeda 's north african offshoot al qaeda in the islamic maghreb ( al qaeda in the islamic maghreb ) , which has its roots in algerian , has captured territory in mali and taken hostages -- often europeans -- in countries such as niger and mauritanian
so what is the world doing about it ? the u.s. has created a military command in africa and also established a special operations base in djibouti , which borders somalia in the horn of africa
french has sent troops to mali
and , as cnn recently reported from chad , western militaries have trained special forces from several northern north african nations to take on the islamists
here 's a country - by - country look -- although not exhaustive -- at how islamist extremism has reared its head across a swath of africa
algerian is home to a long - running islamist insurgency
in perhaps the highest - profile incident , islamist militants attacked the in amenas oil and gas plant in southern algerian in january 2013
at least 37 hostages , including three u.s. citizens , died in the seizure of , and ensuing special forces assault on , the remote facility
dozens of assailants also died in the days - long siege
the attack was the work of the mulathameen brigade , which translates as the " signatories in blood brigade
" last september , another islamist group beheaded a 55 - year - old french hiker , herve gourdel , after seizing him as he walked in djudjura national park in central algerian
days earlier , the outfit -- jund al khilafa , a splinter group of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -- had pledged allegiance to isis
militants affiliated with al qaeda in the islamic maghreb had previously also kidnapped foreigners in algerian , including italians and spaniards
in 2007 , al qaeda in the islamic maghreb launched a suicide bombing campaign in algerian , which included a deadly bombing against the u.n. headquarters in algiers
in january , a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital , tripoli , killed 10 people , including an u.s.
the attack was swiftly claimed by wilayat al-tarabulus , isis ' name for the province
politicians in tripoli disputed the claim
besides its growing presence in tripoli , isis is now the dominant force in derna in eastern libyans and controls parts of the town center of sirte , the hometown of former libyans strongman moammar gadhafi
before the advent of isis , an islamist group called ansar al shariah was blamed by the u.s. for carrying out the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the u.s. consulate in benghazi in which ambassador christopher stevens was killed
state department computer expert sean smith and former u.s. navy seals tyrone woods and glen doherty , then acting as security contractors , also died
in 2012 , islamist extremists capitalized on chaos in mali after a military coup and uprising by tuareg tribesmen to seize control of a large piece of northern mali , an area the size of french
french intervened militarily in early 2013 and helped to push back the islamists
since then , mali 's government has battled various rebel factions , mostly in its northern region , with the help of french and north african forces
recent attacks include a shooting earlier this month at a bar popular with expatriates in the capital , bamako , which killed five people , including french and belgian citizens , authorities said
a north african jihadist group , al-murabitun , claimed responsibility for the attack , according to mauritanian news agency al akhbar
al qaeda in the islamic maghreb issued a warning to french via jihadist websites in january , following terror attacks in paris , stating that " french pays the cost of its violence on islamists countries and the violation of their sanctity , " citing the presence of its soldiers in mali
according to analysis by jane 's defence weekly , despite the shift of jihadist activity east toward libyans , " mauritanian is still an aspirational target for jihadist groups due to its military co-operation with french and algerian
" jihadist groups including al qaeda in the islamic maghreb and the mulathameen brigade operate in the porous border areas between mauritanian , algerian , mali , niger and libyans
militants have in the past kidnapped foreign workers for ransom , including three spaniards in 2011 , according to jane 's
however , since 2011 jihadist activity in the country has declined
mauritanian troops joined the fight against al qaeda in the islamic maghreb militants in mali
militant group boko haram has waged a campaign of terror in mostly northern nigeria for over a decade
it has attacked the country 's police , military , banks , bus stations and crowded markets , as well carrying out a string of church bombings
perhaps the most notorious incident came last april , when boko haram militants kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school in chibok , in borno state
most of the girls remain missing
in january this year , hundreds of boko haram gunmen seized the town of baga and neighboring villages in northern nigeria , as well as a multinational military base , leaving bodies scattered everywhere and as many as 2,000 people feared dead
the group 's stated aim is to institute sharia , or islamists law
earlier this month , in an audio message purportedly from leader abubakar shekau , boko haram pledged allegiance to isis
it had previously declared ties to al qaeda in the islamic maghreb
al shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the somalia government in an effort to implement a stricter form of islamists law , or sharia
it has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in somalia and beyond , notably neighboring kenya
its most high - profile attack came in that country in 2013 , when gunmen struck at nairobi 's upscale westgate mall , pulling out weapons and gunning down shoppers
the gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them
as many as 67 people died in the siege
the group has carried out numerous attacks in somalia 's capital , mogadishu , and elsewhere
just last week , its target was government offices in the city of baidoa
it has also recently called for attacks on shopping malls in the u.s. , canada and britain
the pentagon said this week that a key al shabaab operative connected to the westgate mall attack , named as adan garar , was killed recently by a u.s. drone strike
in september , al shabaab leader ahmed abdi godane was also killed in a u.s. airstrike near barawe city
gunmen who besieged the bardo museum in tunis are thought to have claimed 23 lives , most of them foreign tourists
interior ministry spokesman mohamed ali aroui told national radio that the assailants were islamists , but authorities have n't been more specific than that
nine arrests have been made in connection with the attack
isis claimed responsibility for the attack in an audio message posted online thursday
cnn can not independently verify the authenticity of the audio statement
the attack occurred even as the country 's democratically elected parliament was meeting to discuss new anti-terror legislation
up to 3,000 tunisian are believed to have traveled to iraq and syria to fight as jihadists , more than any other country , according to the international centre for the study of radicalization in london
the fear is that many of these fighters will return to north african to join isis - affiliated groups there and carry out attacks
al qaeda 's north african affiliate is also a threat
in late 2012 , al qaeda in the islamic maghreb set up a branch in tunisian called the uqba ibn nafi brigade , a 60 - strong jihadi outfit composed of tunisian , algerian , and some libyans
the group , believed to include fighters driven out of mali by french forces , has been responsible for a string of attacks on tunisian security services in mountainous djebel chaambi region along the algerian border
