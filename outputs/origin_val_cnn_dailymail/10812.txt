when ronaldo started the year with a ballon d'or award nobody thought 2015 could ever turn into his annus horribilis
but since his ' siiii ! ' war cry in zurich when he collected the trophy and sent an ' i 'm coming for you ' message to messi , the real madrid forward 's fortunes have been in free - fall to the extent that the exit door that leads back to manchester united has been opened once again
ronaldo 's agent jorge mendes told spanish radio his player would go on scoring goals for real madrid until he is 40 as the club and the player 's entourage celebrated his well - deserved gong in january
real madrid forward ronaldo sits on the bernabeu pitch during his side 's 2 - 0 win against levante the former manchester united man endured a frustrating evening despite his side 's la liga victory ronaldo has a shot at goal on sunday night but he was unable to find the back of the net but since then he has been sent off and banned for two games ; chastised by supporters for holding a birthday party through the early hours after a humiliating derby day defeat by atletico madrid and pledged a vow of silence after the team 's defeat in the champions league to schalke
manchester united have been linked with both a bold move for gareth bale or a romantic return for ronaldo
sources in real madrid now say of the two moves , it would be a bid for ronaldo that would meet with less resistance
for all the boos and whistles for gareth bale from sections of the santiago bernabeu crowd the club president florentino perez is firmly behind his Â£ 86million signing and sees him as ronaldo 's heir apparent
ronaldo is even understood to have done more to help the former tottenham forward as he tries to push his profile and get himself on next year 's ballon d'or podium
the request was not received with open arms
much like gareth bale when he scored twice on sunday against levante
gareth bale celebrates after opening the scoring but ronaldo appeared frustrated that he had n't found the net ronaldo celebrates winning the premier league title with manchester united shortly before leaving in 2009 a return to old trafford is not out of the question for the portuguese superstar after a miserable start to 2015 real madrid trio ronaldo , gareth bale and karim benzema share an embrace after the welshman 's second goal gareth bale , pictured with his partner emma rhys-jones , is seen as the heir to ronaldo by florentino perez ronaldo failed to celebrate his team - mate 's opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring after failing to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the six - yard area
like the incredible sulk of old , ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after gareth bale converted the rebound
gary lineker tweeted : ' ronaldo 's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to gareth bale scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy
' he was also frustrated when gareth bale scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a ronaldo shot but enough to divert it past the levante goalkeeper to wrap up the three points
and with those two goals for gareth bale and a string of misses from himself in what remained of the game , including one sitter in injury - time and a weak shot from a perfect gareth bale cross in the first half , ronaldo went straight down the tunnel at full - time , not to the centre circle to applaud supporters
ronaldo split up with his long - term girlfriend , russian model and actress irina shayk , in january ronaldo 's form has dipped since his split and messi now has more goals than him this season irina shayk accompanied ronaldo to the fifa ballon d'or awards in january 2014 but she was absent this year off the pitch things have gone no better for him with a split from russian girlfriend irina shayk ensuring he has filled the pages of many of spanish 's gossip magazines amid speculation about why the couple broke up and who his next partner will be
all this with the clasico on the horizon â a match he would never have dreamed he would go in to on fewer goals than messi who now has two more than his rival
last year ronaldo raced to a 12 - goal lead over messi who was struggling for form and fell out spectacularly with his manager luis enrique
messi 's relationship with his coach is now on the mend and he has scored 20 goals since the start of the year
things change so quickly in spanish football and ronaldo 's last three months are evidence of that
what also may have changed is the possibility that after six extraordinary seasons at the bernabeu ronaldo could yet find time in his record - breaking career to go back to old trafford for a glorious swansong
