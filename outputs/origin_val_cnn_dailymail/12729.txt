pakistani 's highest court friday ordered the release of lakhvi , the alleged mastermind behind the mumbai attacks , calling his detention illegal
lakhvi , a top leader of the terrorist group lashkar-e-taiba , was not present at friday 's court proceeding
the terror attacks in india left more than 160 people dead in november 2008
in the attacks , heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around mumbai , including luxury hotels , the city 's historic victoria terminus train station and a jewish cultural center
on friday , india summoned the pakistani high commissioner " to convey our strong feelings about ( the ) lakhvi verdict , " said india 's external affairs spokesman syed akbaruddin
last year , the court granted lakhvi bail , a decision the pakistani government had said it would challenge
many in india are still angry over the attacks and had criticized the bail decision
" it is very disappointing that the accused of the mumbai attacks has been granted bail , " the nation 's home minister , rajnath singh , said in december
india executed the last surviving gunman from the attacks in 2012
other suspects were all killed during the series of attacks , which went on for three days
