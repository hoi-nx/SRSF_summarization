mogadishu , somalia islamic militants with the extremist group al-shabaab mounted a bloody attack thursday on government administration offices in baidoa , somalia
initial reports to police indicate that nine people , including four attackers , were killed after gunmen in military uniforms attacked the house of the former somalia parliament speaker and current president of the newly established southwest regional administration , said col. abdi , a somalia police officer
the attack began when a car bomb detonated at the gate of the state palace in baidoa city , some 250 kilometers ( 155 miles ) northwest of the capital , mogadishu
heavy gunfire broke out between somalia troops backed by ethiopian forces inside the house of the regional president , sharif hassan sheikh aden
explosions and gunfire were still going on over an hour after the initial assault , abdi said
al-shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack
a broadcast by the group 's official radio station , andulus , said that al-shabaab gunmen had entered the regional president 's house and killed seven ethiopian soldiers
the african union 's special representative for somalia , ambassador sidikou , condemned the attack , saying it had targeted troops who have worked to restore peace to baidoa
" i am deeply saddened by news of the attack in baidoa this morning , " he said in a statement released by amisom , the african union mission to somalia
sidikou said he had also received reports of an attempted attack at a mogadishu hotel wednesday night
" these are desperate attempts by al-shabaab to seek relevance , following the massive defeats they continue to suffer from the somali national army working together with amisom troops , " he said
al-shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the somalia government in an effort to implement a stricter form of islamic law , or sharia
it has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in somalia and beyond , even calling , in a video released last month , for attacks on shopping malls in canada , the united kingdom and the united states
united states authorities downplayed the threat
