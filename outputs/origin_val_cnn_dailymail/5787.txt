he is passionate about conservation and was in china 's yunnan province to highlight the plight of the region 's wild elephants and to call for an end to the ivory trade
but as prince william was feeding treats to rescue elephant ran ran , just a few miles away , other animals were living in conditions that campaigners describe as ' dingy ' and with their legs encased in chains
filmed having their trunks sat upon by visitors by a sky news camera crew , the elephants are displayed in twice - daily shows at the the xishuangbanna wild elephant valley park
later , he did speak about the plight of china 's elephants , although he once again steered clear of discussing the circus , which is on the same site as the sanctuary he was visiting
' it is appalling that elephants and many others may be extinct in the wild in our lifetimes , and we seem to be hurtling towards the tragic outcome , ' he said
' the extinction of animals such as elephants , rhinos and pangolins would be an immeasurable loss to the whole of humanity
' but his efforts risk being overshadowed by the controversy over the visit , with kensington palace saying they were aware of the existence of the circus beforehand
performance : the elephants were filmed being made to perform circus tricks for crowds of tourists chained : campaigners say the elephants live in dingy pens between performances there , say campaigners , the wretched performing elephants , many of which have had their tusks filed down , are trained to give rides and kick footballs around an arena
some are even trained to dance to disco music and form a pyramid during shows that take place four times a day
between their â performances â they are chained by their legs in dingy pens
kensington palace , however , said that while it was aware of the issues , the focus of the visit was for prince william to learn more about the region âs conservation efforts and engage with the positive work being done
the nature reserve says its elephants are from thailand and not from the local wild population
mayhew , chief executive of the tusk trust of which william is patron , defended the prince 's decision to visit the park
' different cultures have different ways of doing things , of course it 's not the way we do things , ' he said
' but you know i think today was very much about highlighting the illegal wildlife trade - this trip for him in terms of conservation has been about watching , listening , learning about the challenges faced by conservationists here in china
' dressed up : the animals are also made to wear bizarre versions of human clothing such as glasses exposed : the performance was filmed by a camera crew from sky news aware : kensington palace said they knew of the circus before the visit took place the prince , who began the day at the xishuangbanna natural nature reserve , had been hopeful of seeing some of the animals in their natural habit - the last tropical rainforest in china which hosts some 250 wild asian elephants - 90 per cent of its wild elephant population
apparently unbothered by the 33c heat , the prince climbed 200 or steps up to a wooden viewing platform
sadly for william , there were none to be seen , although it was a different story when he arrived at the sanctuary to meet ran ran
' you 're going to get indigestion ' , smiled the prince as he fed the elephant handful after handful of carrots - much to both her and his delight
the visit was designed to highlight the prince 's conservation work - and raise awareness of the need to end the illegal trade in ivory
a royal source has said that during william 's talks with china 's president xi jinping earlier this week wildlife protection and the illegal trade in ivory were raised and that he was pleased by china leader âs pledges to clamp down on the industry
criticism : his visit was overshadowed by controversy about a nearby elephant circus saved : ran ran was discovered in a river in 2005 with terrible injuries caused by a poacher 's trap performing : according to campaigners , other elephants nearby live in chains and are made to perform tricks in a speech before he flew back to britain , william described the greatest threat to elephants worldwide today as the â ruthless and organised poaching and trafficking â industry
he said : ' it is appalling that elephants â and many others â may be extinct in the wild in our lifetimes , and that we seem to be hurtling towards that tragic outcome
' the illegal wildlife trade is therefore our common enemy
it is a vicious form of criminality : plundering the natural resources of poorer countries , taking lives , hindering development and spreading corruption
it erodes the rule of law , fuels conflict , and may even fund terrorism
' traffickers think nothing of violating laws and sovereignty anywhere they can to exploit a loophole or turn a profit
and international cooperation is our strongest defence against them
' ' i think what we 've just heard is a really powerful speech appealing to the china people following on from a very constructive meeting that i gather he had with the president on this issue , ' added mr mayhew afterwards
' just think about it , in the last four months he has raised this issue not only with the president of china but the president of united states - i do n't know anybody else who has managed to do that in years
' aware : kensington palace said they were aware of the proximity of the circus before the trip not talking : the prince did not take questions on the circus but later emphasised the need for conservation ivory : china 's elephants have been decimated by the ivory trade - something william hopes to change getting the locals on side : he also met local villagers , who sometimes come into conflict with elephants
