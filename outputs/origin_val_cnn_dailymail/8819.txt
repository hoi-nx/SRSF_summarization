it 's not as easy when it comes to health care
the truth is that undergoing a simple tonsillectomy can cost as little as $ 4,000 to as much as $ 14,000 , depending on the city , according to new data compiled by gawker

herniated disc decompression surgery costs $ 15,000 in washington and more than three and a half times more in houston and los angeles - more than $ 48,000
a simply tonsillectomy will run $ 3,500 in washington - but costs $ 14,000 in san francisco
the reason health care costs are not widely advertised stems from the fact that they vary based on who ends up paying - and insurers do n't like revealing the negotiated final amount
however , there has been a recent push towards price transparency
some states have started making databses of health care costs based on insurance claims and other insurance data
