he does n't walk around the prison a lot like he used to but when he has to walk to get his meals in the commissary he walks with a new silver cane while grimacing in pain on display : oj 's knee injuries had such an impact on his health , attorney johnnie cochran , used his disability in his trial for the murder of wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ron goldman
to convince the jury that he was not physically capable of the killings
at one point johnnie cochran instructed oj to stand and raise his suit pant leg to show the jury his multiple scars on his left knee to prove he was severely handicapped oj was found guilty in 2008 of criminal conspiracy , kidnapping , assault , robbery and using a deadly weapon and was sentenced to thirty - three years in prison with the possibility of parole after nine years , in 2017
' i can only get mediocre health care in here , ' oj told a fellow inmate , ' and it really pisses me off because i have the money to go to any specialist in the world to get knee surgery but they wo n't let me leave to get help
' they do n't give a damn that i am going to end up crippled and ca n't walk for the rest of my life ' a prison insider tells daily mail online , oj does n't walk around the prison a lot like he used to but when he has to get his meals in the commissary he walks with a new silver cane , grimacing in pain
oj stops frequently to lean up against the wall to rest if there is not a bench nearby to sit and complains the pain is getting worse every day
oj is given pain medication but it only helps him sleep , it does n't make the pain go away during the day
and oj 's girth does n't help
says the prison insider , ' oj started gaining weight because he was eating pork - n - beans , breads and a lot of sweets , like cookies and ice cream but now that he ca n't get any exercise he has ballooned up to almost 340 pounds
' when there was nice weather oj used to walk around the track on the prison yard for an hour at a time but now the pain in his knee is so severe he can barely walk ten steps without moaning in pain
oj 's weight is definitely a factor and putting more stress on his knees but he also has advanced arthritis
' oj 's knee injuries are a result from his 11 - year career as a running back in the nfl and although he has gone through two surgeries on his left knee in the late 1970 's he is still in extreme pain
these injuries had such an impact on his health oj 's attorney , johnnie cochran , jr. , used his disability in his murder trial 20 years ago to convince the jury his knee was so weak that he was not physically capable of killing his ex-wife , nicole brown simpson and her friend ron goldman
at one point johnnie cochran instructed oj to stand and raise his suit pant leg to show the jury his multiple scars on his left knee to prove he was severely handicapped
oj may be getting released from prison in 2017 on parole and he 's telling the other inmates it looks like he 's going to be leaving there in a wheelchair
oj , then with the buffalo bills , is carried off the field at the end of the half
this is not the first time that his pal al cowlings ( at right , no. 82 ) helped take him away
he was along on the low - speed chase in the bronco ' following the murders oj is not in jail for the murder of his wife nicole brown simpson but for criminal conspiracy , kidnapping , assault , robbery and using a deadly weapon years later ' i wo n't be out of here for at least another two years and if they wo n't let me get to a specialist soon i may never walk again ! ' oj slammed his fists down on the table , revealed the insider
' i have the money to pay for any surgery i need and the transportation so it wo n't be on the freakin ' tax payers but they are still saying ' no. ' ' most of the time if a patient gets a recommendation from a doctor to have surgery but it is not life - threatening , the prison will deny that request , ' the insider added
' oj said they just gave him a pill and told him to take it easy
' hehas talked to his attorneys about going to court so he can get some outside medical help but by the time the courts decide he may be already on parole
' oj is in bad shape and it 's only going to get worse
the pain is excruciating and his knee is so deformed that he cant even straighten his left leg anymore
' oj is so worried about being seen in a wheelchair that he said he is not going to tell anyone , not even his family , when he 's leaving lovelock
' oj said when he gets parole he will leave in the middle of the night so he can disappear and there will not be any pictures of an old man a wheelchair on the cover of every newspaper across this country with the caption , ' the juice - old and broken ! '
