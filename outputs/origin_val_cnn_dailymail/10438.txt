i came for an exchange of our thoughts

the group âs eurozone analyst mujtaba rahman said : â the prospects of a deal are diminishing , as germany , the eurogroup and greece continue to posture
while berlin still wants to keep greece in the eurozone , it will not be flexible regarding the conditions attached to more financial aid
