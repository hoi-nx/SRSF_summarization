price on its head : the helmeted hornbill has become a target for poachers due to the popularity of its ivory it is one of the world âs strangest birds , with a huge domed bill , a 6ft wingspan and a call that sounds like maniacal laughter as it echoes across the borneo rainforest
but the helmeted hornbill is being driven towards extinction â by a surge in the black - market demand for its ivory in china
the bird â dubbed â the farmer of the rainforest â for its vital seed - spreading role â has become the latest victim of organised wildlife crime , according to a report to be published this week by the eia ( eia )
its ivory is now worth three times more than that of elephants , and illegal poaching is spiralling out of control
hornbill expert hadiprakarsa warned : â if no one pays attention , this bird is going to become extinct
â the illegal trade is being fuelled by the desires of china âs wealthy middle classes for carved ivory items
with â white â elephant ivory and rhino horn becoming more scarce , the eia found traffickers were dealing instead in â red â ivory from a hornbill casque
this now sells for as much as Â£ 4,000 a kilo â three times the price of elephant ivory
there are no reliable estimates of the impact of poaching on populations across the hornbills â historic range of borneo , sumatra and the malaysian peninsula , but in one region alone , the west kalimantan , an estimated 6,000 birds are killed every year
mr hadiprakarsa , director of the indonesian hornbill conservation society , said : ' a few years ago helmeted hornbills were common in the west kalimantan , but on my last visit i did n't see any and local villagers said they had n't either
' hunters are now pushing into the remotest areas of the forest
â the illegal trade in ivory from the birds is being fuelled by the desires of china âs wealthy middle classes for carved ivory items china visitors look at souvenirs made from ivory at a market in angola
the ivory , which comes from helmeted hornbills , is three times the price of that of an elephant poachers , who shoot then decapitate the birds , often return from expeditions with as many as 20 hornbill heads
these are then sold for up to Â£ 300 each to middle men or direct to smugglers exporting to hong kong and china
eia campaigner debbie banks said : â what is sickening is this trade has nothing to do with tradition or medicine â it âs purely about demand for luxury vanity products
