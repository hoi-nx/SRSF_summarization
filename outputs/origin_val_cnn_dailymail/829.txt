a freshman senator who spearheaded a letter to iran leaders , cautioning them that any deal negotiated by the obama administration would not outlast the current president , defended his actions on tuesday as necessary to prevent the middle east country from becoming nuclear capable
' they âve been killing united states for 35 years , they âve killed hundreds of troops in iraq , now they control five capitols in the middle east , ' arkansas sen. tom cotton said tuesday on msnbc
' they are nothing but hardliners in iran and if they do all of those things without a nuclear weapon , imagine what they would do with one
' tom cotton 's remarks came after vice president biden , the official president of the senate and a former representative for delaware to the upper chamber , sent out a biting statement monday evening accusing letter signers of acting ' beneath the dignity ' of their office
' reminding the foreign government that united states president obama is ineligible for a third term and will leave office in january 2017 , ' the republicans lawmakers said ' most of us will remain in office well beyond then â perhaps decades
' in previewing the letter to bloomberg , tom cotton said monday ' iran 's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal that â¦ any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril
' the white house , state department and democrats leaders denounced the audacious move and warned that it could have the intended effect - the dismantlement of the obama and other world leaders ' blossoming agreement with tehran
state department spokeswoman psaki said it ' undermines ' negotiations
white house press secretary earnest said it ' certainly interferes ' with ongoing talks
republicans ' effort to ' essentially throw sand in the gears here is not helpful , ' earnest told reporters during his daily briefing on monday
vice president biden lashed out at republicans on monday night in a statement distributed to reporters through the white house 's massive press list
the message , ' expressly designed to undercut a sitting president in the midst of sensitive international negotiations , is beneath the dignity of an institution i revere , ' biden said , arguing that he had never seen anything like it during his thirty - six years in the senate
' i can not recall another instance in which senators wrote directly to advise another country â much less a longtime foreign adversary â that the president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them , ' he said
' this letter sends a highly misleading signal to friend and foe alike that that our commander - in - chief can not deliver on united states âs commitments â a message that is as false as it is dangerous
' firing back at the vp on tuesday morning during an appearance on morning joe , tom cotton said if biden ' respects the dignity of the institution of the senate he should be insisting that the president submit any deal to approval of the senate , which is exactly what he did on numerous deals during his time in senate
' he also attacked biden 's foreign policy credentials
' biden , as obama âs own secretary of defense has said , has been wrong about nearly every foreign policy and national security decision in the last 40 years , ' tom cotton said in remarks captured by politico
the arkansas lawmaker was referring to former dod head robert gates , who deprecated biden in a memoir released after he exited obama 's cabinet
biden , another likely candidate for president in 2016 , is a former chairman of the senate 's foreign relation 's committee
he was initially added to obama 's ticket in 2008 to counter the freshman senator 's relative lack of experience with world affairs
he was not alone in his condemnation of his former colleagues ' actions
connecticut sen. richard blumenthal said republicans ' ' very blatant effort to undermine the legitimacy ' of the president and ' disrespect ' his as a negotiator is ' unconscionable
' they essentially said the president ' does n't speak for the constitution , ' he told cnn tuesday morning
virginia democrats sen. kaine lambasted tom cotton and his co-signers tuesday on the senate floor , even while conceding that he partially agrees with their position
' i share many of the concerns of my colleagues , the 47 who wrote the letter , ' kaine said
' but i deeply believe , ' he added , ' we should not try to tank a deal , critique a deal , undercut a deal , before there is a deal
' he criticized tom cotton without naming him , for writing ' to the leader of a nation that we characterize as a terrorist state
' ' the message that is communicated to the united states public and to the world is , we will never accept any deal , ' he said of the letter
' we are not interested in diplomacy
we are not interested in negotiation
' ' and that attitude plays directly into the hands of the nation of iran , which is currently engaging in terrorist activity
thy would want to be able to blame the absence of any deal on an intransigent the united states that is unwilling to negotiate in good faith
' iran 's foreign minister mohammed javad zarif said tuesday , ' this kind of communication is unprecedented and undiplomatic
' ' in fact it implies that the united states is not trustworthy , ' he said according to iran 's state - run news site
the letter , signed by 47 republicans senators , told iran the senate will ' consider any agreement regarding your nuclear - weapons program that is not approved by the congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between president obama and ayatollah khamenei ' the white house on monday reproached senators for acting outside ' the role our founding fathers envisioned congress for to play when it comes to foreign affairs ' and questioned the ' wisdom of their strategy
' ' the rush to war , or at least the to the military option that many republicans are advocating is not at all in the best interest of the united states , ' earnest said
republicans have not specifically lobbied for military engagement with iran , but its the white house 's view that war could come about if world leaders do not at least attempt to negotiate a deal with iran in good faith
psaki contended monday that senators wrongly implied that they have any say over a possible agreement
' congress does n't have the power to alter the conditions of international arrangements negotiated by the executive , ' she said
additionally , the state department is of the opinion ' that this letter , designed to score political points , ignores the fact that executive agreements between countries provide things like protections for troops , that we rely on every day , allows for the basing of united states service members overseas , allows for us to obstruct the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on the high seas , ' she said
while it is true that congress does not currently have the authority to authorize the pact as it 's not technically a treaty , the senate will soon vote on a bipartisan measure that would give the legislative body the power of review over any package the administration offers iran
and , as tom cotton noted tuesday morning on cnn 's new day , several of the republicans senators who lent their name to the letter are considering presidential bids and could , in two years , potentially be calling the shots in the oval office
' i welcome even hillary clinton to join us because i suspect she might have reservations about this ill - fated nuclear deal as well , ' he said , name - checking the democrats front - runner for president
vice president biden , pictured here at the international association of firefighters legislative conference and presidential forum on monday , sent out a biting statement that evening accusing letter signers of acting ' beneath the dignity ' of their office from left , secretary of state john kerry , biden and national security adviser susan rice listen as president obama meets with european council president donald tusk in the oval office on monday
the state department said the republicans 's letter to iran ' undermines ' nuclear negotiations
the white house said it ' certainly interferes ' with ongoing talks asked about the republicans senators ' attempt to undercut his foreign policy strategy on monday , obama said he thought it was ' ironic ' that they were aligning themselves with iran 's hardliners , who also do n't want a deal to go through
in his unusually long statement , biden said the senators ' letter , sent ' in the guise of a constitutional lesson , ignores two centuries of precedent and threatens to undermine the ability of any future united states president , whether democrat or republicans , to negotiate with other nations on behalf of the united states
' ' around the world , united states âs influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments
' the united states must ' maintain our credibility and global leadership even as presidents and congresses come and go , ' he wrote
' the decision to undercut our president and circumvent our constitutional system offends me as a matter of principle , ' he continued
' as a matter of policy , the letter and its authors have also offered no viable alternative to the diplomatic resolution with iran that their letter seeks to undermine
' republicans have said that instead of diplomatic negotiations and a deal that would allow iran to continue working toward a peaceful nuclear program , they would like to bury the country with sanctions until it completely abandons its uranium enrichment program
richard blumenthal said tuesday that tom cotton and other legislators had polarized and undermined a bipartisan coalition of senators ' which is now in tatters ' that were demanding the white house allow the senate to have the final say over any deal it negotiated with tehran
the democrats senator said he was determined to ' stitch it back together , ' however
sen. angus king , an independent who caucuses with the democrats , said the irony of the situation was that the senate 's bill , sponsored by foreign relations chairman bob corker , requiring congressional oversight was headed toward a veto - proof majority before this
now , republicans have ' blown that , ' he said on cnn , and ' literally snatched defeat from the jaws of victory
