' hey i 've been in the car since four o'clock , i am starving , ' he said in the fox video
' i 'm just getting something really quick
' nothing could stand between jimmy and his fish sandwich
except maybe the breakfast menu
' is it too early to get a fish sandwich ? ' jimmy asked a drive - through employee , only to be told the fast - food restaurant was solely doing breakfast
it would have to be an egg mcmuffin and a black coffee instead for jimmy - medium - sized please
nothing could stand between jimmy and his fish sandwich - except maybe the breakfast menu
jimmy had to settle for an egg mcmuffin and a medium - sized black coffee instead he may have been caught off - guard , but jimmy made sure to still deliver the news to the people - even if it had to be reporting what he could see from the drive - through line
' i 'll tell you folks , stay put , its bad out here , ' he said as the camera panned outside his front window to a parking lot covered with snow
' i 've been out since four folks , stay put , trust me
