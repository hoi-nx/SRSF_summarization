are you better off than you were five years ago ? this will be one of the central questions of the general election
british politicians on both sides hope to recreate the powerful attack that reagan famously launched against jimmy carter in the 1980 us presidential election , when he asked if voters if they felt their incomes had improved over four years
george osborne yesterday boasted that this year families will be Â£ 900 better off than in 2010 , while labour claims workers are Â£ 1,600 worse off
the tories ' focus on real household disposable income takes into account the effect of tax and benefit changes , and suggests incomes overtaking 2010 levels by the end of 2015 chancellor george osborne argues that families will be better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 one of the big surprises of the budget yesterday was george osborne 's announcement that incomes this year would be higher in real terms than in 2010
after years of austerity and slow growth , many tories had given up hope being able to go into the election with voters feeling the benefits of the recovery
the chancellor told mps : ' to the question of whether people are better off at the end of this parliament than they were five years ago we can give the resounding answer ' yes '
' you can measure it by gdp per capita , and the answer is yes â up by 5 per cent
' or you can use the most up - to - date and comprehensive measure of living standards which is real household disposable income
' in other words , how much money families have to spend after inflation and tax
' it is the living standards measure used by the office for national statistics and by the oecd
' on that measure i can confirm , on the latest office for budget responsibility data today , living standards will be higher in 2015 than in 2010
' and it confirms they are set to grow strongly every year for the rest of the decade
' the british people for years paid the heavy price of the great recession
' now , the facts show households on average will be around Â£ 900 better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 â and immeasurably more secure for living in a country whose economy is not in crisis anymore , but is instead growing and creating jobs
' labour 's ed balls claims wages are worth Â£ 1,600 less in real terms than they were in 2010 labour has long argued that wages outstripped by inflation have left workers feeling poorer
they argue that average weekly earnings have fallen in real terms from Â£ 453 in 2010 to Â£ 418 in april 2014
the attack is based on the claim that austerity choked off the recovery in 2010 , leaving employers unable to give pay rises
each year that prices rose faster than wages , workers saw that they cash did not go as far each month as it used to
in the commons today , ed balls declared : ' for all the chancellor 's hubris , yesterday 's budget has changed nothing for working people in our country
' the chancellor spent an hour telling people they have never had it so good but working people are still gbp1 , 600 a year worse off on average after five years of the tories
' ' even on his own measure , people are worse off than they were in 2010
' this is the first parliament since the early 1920s when the average person in work will be worse - off at the end of a parliament than they were at the beginning
' the fact is in answer to the famous reagan question - ' are you better off than you were five years ago ? ' the answer is a resounding no. ' they both are
much of the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the tories and labour are using different figures and different time scales
george osborne used real household disposable income , which is the amount of money a family has after tax and benefit changes take effect
figures published by the office for budget responsibility show that real household disposable income is lower than in 2010 in every year until the end of 2015 , before rising annually towards 2019
technically it means that incomes will not be above 2010 levels until the end of this year , not before the election
ed balls uses gross weekly earnings , which is the amount workers are paid before tax and benefit changes take effect
labour 's figures also only cover the period up to april 2014 , compared to mr george osborne 's date at the end of 2015
paul johnson , director of the ifs , said : ' average household incomes have just about regained their pre-recession levels
they are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010 , and possibly higher than their 2009 peak
' but that still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history
having household incomes crawl back up above pre-recession levels six or seven years after the recession hit is no cause for celebration
' as ever there is much truth in both numbers
real earnings have fallen , as mr miliband says
real incomes should be above their 2010 level as mr george osborne says
' we are for sure much worse off on average than we could reasonably have expected to be back in 2007 or indeed back in 2010
' whether or not voters feel they are better off - and crucially will get better off in the future - will be key to deciding who is in number 11 after the election when voters go to the polls in 49 days , both sides will keep repeating their claims
neither of which will reflect the true state of family finances on may 7
labour is still looking back a year , while the tories are looking ahead seven months , based on a forecast
in truth , most people do not really know if they are actually better off than they were five years ago , when inflation , tax and benefits are taken into account
being told you 're better off will alienate those who are struggling , but after years of austerity voters also want a bit of optimism
even if they do not yet feel like the good times are back , they will want to believe george osborne when he says : ' the sun is starting to shine
' and for the first time in five years he has some figures to prove it .
