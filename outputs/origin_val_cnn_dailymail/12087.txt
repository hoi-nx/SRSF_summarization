the scotland first minister invited the cameras into her spotless house near glasgow , which interviewer susanna reid looked like a ' show home '
ms sturgeon credited her husband peter , the scottish national party 's chief executive , with staying up late to clean the house and admitted to being so bad in the kitchen she is on first name terms with her takeaway delivery driver
in a revealing personal interview , she discussed balancing family life with running scotland , not having children and how she likes to unwind at weekends
the 44 - year - old , who replaced salmond last year , admitted to finding ways to avoid helping out around the house
despite her husband peter murrell running the scottish national party , she told itv 's good morning britain that all she does is irons his shirts
' i 've developed this thing that if i iron peter 's shirts on a sunday night then that kind of gets me off the hook of any other domestic tasks because in my head that 's me i 've pulled my weight in the house , of the domestic chores
' the interview was carried out at the couple 's home in uddingston just outside glasgow
good morning britain 's susanna reid told ms sturgeon that he immaculate house looked like a ' show home ' ms sturgeon invited the cameras into her home near glasgow as part of a series ahead of polling day on may 7 the cameras showed ms sturgeon opening the door to reid , making coffee and sitting in a conservatory to answer questions
reid told her : ' we are in your lovely home now
it 's like a show home
' ms sturgeon replied : ' that 's because i had my husband up most of last night cleaning it
it 's not always this tidy
' in one recent interview david cameron was seen preparing dinner , but the best ms sturgeon could do was make a coffee
' i 've never been very good in the kitchen , ' she admitted
sturgeon married peter murrell , the scottish national party 's chief executive , in 2010 ' i like indian takeaway , ' she said , before joking : ' the fact we are on first names terms with the person who delivers it on a friday night should n't allow you to read anything into my lifestyle
' reid also asked her about whether she had made a decision not to have children
ms sturgeon said : ' people have started asking me , ' was it a conscious decision ? ' it has n't been , it 's just you know life takes certain directions and it does n't take other directions and that 's about as complicated as it gets
' the former solicitor married mr peter murrell in 2010
together with salmond and spin doctor kevin pringle , they were the four party chieftains who guided the party from multiple election defeats to the brink of breaking up the united kingdom
ms sturgeon has been a member of the scottish parliament since 1999
she put her name forward to become scottish national party leader in 2004 , but stood aside when mr salmond threw his hat into the ring
she stood as his running mate and became deputy leader for a decade until mr salmond quit in the wake of the no vote in september 's independence referendum
ms sturgeon admitted that during her time in politics she had gained a reputation for being ' scary ' with a tough persona
she said : ' politics is a very male dominated , male driven profession
i was , not just a woman , but a young woman and i suppose you end up trying to behave in a way that you think is expected of you
' ' i am quite driven , i know what i think and i know what i want to achieve but i also hope that people who are asked to describe me , would describe me as pretty down - to - earth , loyal , friendly
the more experience i have got in politics i think the more i have allowed me to shine through
' she refused to speculate how many seats the scottish national party will win on may 7 , but suggested her party would perform better in a coalition than the lib dems
' i 'm not going to put a number on it , opinion polls do n't win elections , hard work , persuasion , having the best policies and the best ideas for the country wins elections , so we 'll try and win as many votes as we can and hope that translates into as many seats as possible
' the liberals in my view have got themselves into the position they are in just now which is facing political annihilation in a few weeks time , not because they went into coalition but because they went into coalition and immediately abandoned all of their principals
