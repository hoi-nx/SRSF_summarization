increasing danger : iranian diplomat nour-ahmad nikbakht was working at iranian 's embassy in the yemen capital sanaa ( pictured ) in july 2013 when he was kidnapped by terrorists and held for more than 18 months the militants held him in a remote area between the southern provinces of shabwa and baida , tribal and yemen security sources said
as he returned today to tehran 's mehrabad airport , he told state media : ' i was kidnapped by unknown gunmen and terrorists as i left my home to go to work
' he added that ' many efforts were made by soldiers from ( iranian 's secret services ) , the intelligence ministry and the foreign ministry ' to secure his release
the state news agency quoted deputy foreign minister hossein amirabdollahian as saying : ' a special team from the intelligence ministry was able to free nour-ahmad nikbakht from the clutches of terrorists in a series of complex and difficult operations in a very particular part of yemen '
mr nour-ahmad nikbakht was the second high - profile hostage to be freed in yemen this week after a saudi arabia diplomat kidnapped in 2012 and held by al qaeda was released on monday
with oil giant saudi arabia on its northern border and al-shabaab base somalia a short way across the sea , yemen is in a crucial position in the fight against terror
but the un has warned yemen is ' on the brink of civil war ' after iranian - backed shia muslim militants known as houthis seized the capital in september
the move prompted a violent backlash by sunni militants - including al qaeda , many of whose terrorist operations are run from yemen
' on the brink of civil war ' : yemen gunmen loyal to the houthis movement which has swept to power in sanaa last month al qaeda - linked fighters seized an army base in the southern province of shabwa which had held up to 2,000 government soldiers
the ansar al-sharia group said on twitter that it had set off a suicide bomb at the gate , took control of three guard towers and a tank and imprisoned some of the troops
the houthis , meanwhile are continuing their spread across the country too prompting violent clashes with sunni tribesmen
jamal benomar , the un special envoy to yemen , said last month : ' we believe the situation is very dangerous
yemen is on the brink of civil war '
he accused all sides of contributing to the political and economic turmoil and called for more talks
yemen has been gripped by unrest since president ali abdullah saleh stepped down in early 2012 after a bloody year - long popular uprising
in january last year , another iranian diplomat , ali asghar assadi , was shot dead in an attack in a neighbourhood in sanaa housing several foreign embassies .
