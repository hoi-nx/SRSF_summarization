brittany maynard says in a video recorded 19 days before her assisted suicide death that no one should have to leave their home to legally end their life under doctor 's care
the 29 - year - old california woman had terminal brain cancer and moved with her family to oregon before killing herself last november
' unfortunately , california law prevented me from getting the end - of - life option i deserved , ' she said in the recording released wednesday , hours ahead of a senate health committee hearing on the issue
' no one should have to leave their home and community for peace of mind , to escape suffering , and to plan for a gentle death
the 29 - year - old moved to oregon last year to apply for fatal drugs and died in november staying strong : maynard 's widow , dan diaz , stands to the right of a television screen airing the video at the california state capitol on wednesday while maynard appeared calm and collected through most of the video , she did turn passionate when she spoke about her state government forced her move to states in order to get the drugs she needed to end her life
' how dare the government make decisions or limit options for terminally ill people like me , ' maynard said
' making aid in dying a crime creates undue hardships and suffering for many people who are terminally ill and suffering tremendously
' the laws in california and 45 other states must change to prevent prolonged , involuntary suffering for all terminally ill american
' freedom from prolonged pain and suffering is a most basic human right , ' maynard says
while the video played , maynard 's husband dan diaz stood to the side and fought back tears
tragedy : maynard found out that she had terminal brain cancer a little more than a year after she married dan diaz when she spoke to reporters afterwards , he said that assisted suicide is n't for everyone , but that every american should have the option of dying the way they want
' what my wife did on nov. 1 was by her design , ' dan diaz said
' she avoided a painful , drawn out process and harmed no one else
' maynard 's mother , deborah zieglar , also spoke , saying : ' life is more than breathing air in and out of your body
the definition of a good life and a good death varies person to person
california need the freedom to deal with terminal illness as they determine
' the bill is expected to face a strong challenge , led by medical and religious groups
opponents see huge consequences for allowing doctors to prescribe fatal drugs
among the opponents are other terminally ill patients such as tippetts , a 38 - year - old colorado mother of four , who wrote an open letter to maynard in october urging her not to end her life
tippetts wrote that suffering can be ' the place where true beauty can be known
' she died this month of breast cancer
advocates for aid - in - dying laws say legislators in at least 17 states have introduced similar measures this year
but past proposals have foundered in statehouses amid emotionally charged debates and strong opposition
loved : maynard died in her oregon home in november , surrounded by her husband , parents and other members of her family some medical groups say prescribing life - ending medication violates a doctor 's oath to do no harm , while some advocates for people with disabilities fear some sick patients would feel pressured to end their lives to avoid being a financial burden
advocates have said they would consider taking the issue to voters if it fails in the california legislature
the practice is legal in five states , including oregon
the other states are montana , new mexico , vermont and washington
before her death , maynard had made her case public with online videos , which were viewed tens of millions of times
maynard 's husband , dan diaz , and her mother , deborah ziegler , joined state lawmakers in sacramento on wednesday to release her taped testimony in support of senate bill 128
the proposal by sens. bill monning , d-carmel , and lois wolk , d-davis , would allow terminally ill patients to kill themselves in california with drugs and dosages recommended by a doctor .
