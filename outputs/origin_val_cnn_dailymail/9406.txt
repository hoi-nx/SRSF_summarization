the build - up to manchester united âs fa cup quarter - final against arsenal has inevitably rekindled memories of their epic encounter in 1999 ; roy keane âs sending - off , peter schmeichel âs penalty save and giggs â mazy , mesmerising winner followed by a shirt - stripping celebration
manchester united âs semi-final victory at villa park that night came to epitomise sir ferguson âs treble - winning team
the penchant for high drama
the never - say - die spirit that he instilled in his players
and a â we âll score more goals than you â attitude in going toe - to - toe with any opponent , be it barcelona or blackburn rovers
so as manchester united prepare to face the gunners again for a place at wembley on monday night , it âs perhaps understandable if their supporters are growing disillusioned by the brand of football being offered up by louis van gaal âs team
giggs ( right ) scored arguably the greatest fa cup goal in manchester united 's 1999 win over arsenal giggs watches his left - foot strike fly past david seaman as defender toy adams slides in too late giggs ' semi-final winner was followed by a shirt - stripping celebration in an iconic moment at villa park manchester united won the treble with ole gunnar solskjaer 's late champions league strike against bayern munich it does nât seem to matter what tactics the dutchman employs , the result seems to be the same
whether it âs down to a three - man defence , a midfield diamond , or simply a case of launching high balls up to marouane fellaini , manchester united simply have nât been very entertaining this season
there is a caution , a lethargy , to van gaal âs side at odds with the traditions of the club
giggs espoused it when he was installed as caretaker manager for the final four games of last season
â it âs going to be my philosophy , manchester united âs philosophy , â said giggs at the time
â i want players to play with passion , speed , tempo and be brave with imagination â all the things that are expected of a manchester united player
manchester united âs philosophy is to attack
â no wonder the old trafford legend seemed a little underwhelmed as van gaal turned to him to celebrate a late 1 - 0 win over newcastle last week
current manchester united boss louis van gaal has been criticised for his brand of football this season van gaal 's philosophy this season is different to manchester united 's trademark cavalier style of play juan mata ( right ) leads the way as manchester united 's current crop prepare to face arsenal in the fa cup david de gea , marouane fellaini and luke shaw ( l-r ) could all start against the gunners at old trafford scholes , giggs âs former team - mate who joined him on the coaching staff for that brief stint last year , has described manchester united âs football as â miserable â
â manchester united âs history was built on attacking football , which does not always mean that the team kept clean sheets or did not concede chances , â says scholes
â to beat opposing teams you have to attack , and to attack you have to take risks
too few of the players in the current team are prepared to take those risks
â ferguson âs teams did not always dazzle on the big stage , of course
the goalless 2005 fa cup final against arsenal ranks as one of the worst in recent memory , though largely due to the negative tactics employed by arsene wenger before his side won on a penalty shootout
equally , manchester united âs 1979 final against the gunners is lauded as one of the classics by those who sometimes forget that the first 85 minutes were pretty turgid
sir ferguson guided manchester united to 13 premier league titles during his 1,500 games in charge of the club eric cantona ( left ) led manchester united to four premier league titles during the 1990s cristiano ronaldo ( right ) was the epitome of manchester united 's pleasing - on - the - eye style during his time at the club dave sexton was in charge of manchester united that day
his sacking two years later in 1981 was attributed to the fact that his team were just too boring even though manchester united had just ended the season with seven straight wins , typically six of them by a one - goal margin
it is a reminder that results are not always everything at old trafford as van gaal continues to build on an impressive record of just two defeats in 22 games
dave sexton paid the price for failing to play the manchester united way ; a cavalier style built on width and speed and a commitment to attack and entertain the fans
â all those lads you see going to the factory in trafford park , they come to watch you on saturday , â sir busby told a teenage bobby charlton on his arrival at the club
â they have boring jobs , so you have to give them something they will enjoy
â dave sexton ( centre ) was sacked as manchester united manager in 1981 after failing to play the manchester united way manchester united supporters displayed a banner demanding the sacking of ferguson during the late 1980 's tommy docherty embraced busby âs philosophy
ron atkinson too , though neither with the greatest success
when home attendances dropped to 33,000 during ferguson âs darkest period in late 1989 , it was largely down to a dreadful run of results that left manchester united hovering above the relegation zone
one could argue that manchester united are not much worse to watch under van gaal than they were under david moyes , with better results
but fans expect more from the Â£ 150million spent last summer and the names on the team sheet
they find it hard to take when wayne rooney is dropped into midfield , marouane fellaini goes up front , and sam allardyce of all people gets to label their team â long ball united â
in recent weeks , they have taken to urging their team to â attack , attack , attack â and booed when the ball is passed back to david de gea
van gaal is understandably proud of the fact that he has won a trophy in his first season at each of his clubs
but as manchester united aim to move a step closer to lifting the fa cup for a record 12th time , he would do well to remember that style counts every bit as much as silverware at old trafford
angel di maria 's form has dropped alarmingly after a bright start at old trafford following his summer move di maria ( centre ) was substituted at half - time during manchester united 's 2 - 0 win at home to sunderland last month deploying marouane fellaini ( right ) as a makeshift forward has also received negative feedback this term
