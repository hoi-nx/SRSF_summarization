disgraced news anchor williams has shown his face in public for the first time after being yanked off of his slot on nbc 's nightly news
williams , who was kicked off the show for lying about surviving an rpg attack in the iraq war , was the guest of honor at a fundraiser for the private catholic high school he attended as a boy
the shamed newsreader schmoozed with guests at a casino in atlantic highlands , new jersey , in the hope of scraping together $ 1million to prop up the mater dei prep school in nearby middletown
schmoozing : williams , second from right , showed up at a fundraiser for the mater dei prep school he attended until 1977
he also shelled out $ 50,000 to a save - the - school fund back in the day : williams is pictured above in the 1970s , when he attended the high school budding : williams , right , was editor of the student newspaper at the new jersey school speaking to the two river times , williams waxed lyrical about his schooldays
he said : ' i had four great years here
i did not know it then , but it was the last degree i âd ever earn
it âs a wonderful school , and it should be open for a long time , for everybody '
' four great years ' : williams committed to helping save the school just before nbc suspended him according to the asbury park press , williams topped off his attendance at the $ 125 - per - head dinner with a $ 50,000 donation
he handed over the cash without a salary to back it up - as nbc has cut his pay for the duration of his six - month suspension
williams left mater dei in 1977
afterwards he attended community college and two universities , but never graduated
according to the gala 's organizer , maria buzzanco , there were ' warm hugs ' for the beleaguered anchor at the event , and ' everyone was telling him how much they support him '
he first committed to trying to help save the school days before he was punished by nbc bosses for telling exaggerated tales about covering the iraq war
williams had routinely claimed he was on board a chinook helicopter which was hit by a rocket - propelled grenade , which miraculously did not explode
he later admitted he was n't there
his old school has also been struggling in recent months , announcing in february it needed to raise an urgent $ 1million on top of the $ 10,000 a year it collects from each of its students
fundraisers say they now have more than $ 900,000 of their hoped - for total , some $ 80,000 of which was raised at the fundraiser williams attended
