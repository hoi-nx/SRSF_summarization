two neighbouring ancient craters thought to be have been formed by the same impact event are now thought to have been created by two separate asteroids
the extremely unlikely formation theory was reached after scientists re-analysed rocks at the site , and found dates for the two were vastly different
while both had been thought to be 285 million years old , it now appears one of the craters is actually 450 million years old but , by chance , was created in almost exactly the same spot
its thought the east crater asteroid impacted a marine environment during the ordovician period , 490 million years ago
the west crater was created in the permian period 285 million years ago and impacted the landmass pangaea researchers from the university of western australia say the clearwater lakes in canada were formed by two separate events in a ' pure coincidence '
the remarkable finding , if confirmed , has important implications for other so - called ' doublet ' craters in the solar system , previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time
and the huge difference in time between the two events is even more amazing as , at the time the first crater was made , the location of the second was underwater
the research was published in the journal geochimica et cosmochimica acta and reported by astrobiology magazine
impacts that leave behind a 62 - mile ( 100km ) diameter crater or less , such as those that struck the clearwater lakes , are widely thought to have no global effects
in fact , impacts can even increase biodiversity
for example , the great ordovician biodiversification event , which saw an explosion in the number of animal species around 470 million years ago , has been linked to frequent impact events at the time
this is possibly due to the fact that an impact could disrupt local life just enough to let another species dominate , or because slowly cooling craters can provide habitats for life
even if the clearwater lakes impacts were caused by a double impact , the extra energy released by two bodies smashing into the earth simultaneously would have had no significant effect on life
while the fireball and earthquake would have decimated any life within a few hundred kilometers , the impacts were not big enough to cause much chaos on a global scale
the clearwater lakes in canada are a pair of lakes labelled as west and east
the smaller eastern crater is about 16 miles ( 26km ) in diameter , while the western crater is about 22 miles ( 36km )
in the original theory , a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago
but the researchers say the original methods used to date the east lake , by measuring amounts of argon - 40 , were inaccurate
upon analysing new samples at the site , they found a maximum age of 460 million years , far older than the west clearwater lake , which is 285 million years old
' the close spatial arrangement of the two clearwater lakes is most likely pure coincidence , ' the researchers wrote in their paper
a similar figure was reached by researchers in 1990 by a separate research team , but at the time the findings were dismissed as incorrect due to a supposed contamination from excess argon
but with four different rock samples from various parts of the lake now studied , the researchers say it is highly unlikely they would all yield the same false age
' we think that the accurate age for the east clearwater crater was , in fact , already measured back in 1990 , ' said geologist and lead author dr schmieder of the university
the smaller eastern crater is about 16 miles ( 26km ) in diameter , while the western crater is about 22 miles ( 36km )
in the original theory , a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago , but that is now believed to be inaccurate the remarkable finding , if confirmed , has important implications for other so - called ' doublet ' craters in the solar system , previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time
shown is a map of the location of the clearwater lakes it 's unlikely that the event that formed the clearwater lakes had any significant impact on life
even if the clearwater lakes impacts were caused by a double impact , the extra energy released by two bodies smashing into the earth simultaneously would have had no significant effect on life further evidence for the latest findings comes from the amount of chlorine in the two craters
this part of canada - referred to as laurentia - had less land 460 million years ago than it did 285 million years ago , when waters receded , forming the landmass called pangaea
the rocks from the east crater have more chlorine than the west crater , suggesting they formed on a coastline when water was still abundant in the area
despite the fact that it is statistically very unlikely for the two craters to have been formed in two separate impact events , the new evidence unearthed by the team shows that in this case the more unlikely scenario is true
' overall , the doublet theory has been so compellingly advocated over the decades that alternative scenarios seem to have been abandoned , ' said dr schmieder
' in our view , there is a whole line of geologic evidence that argues against the double impact
