a political operative has sued presidential campaign adviser axelrod over axelrod 's claim that he came up with the attack strategy that saved an embattled philadelphia mayor in 2003
philadelphia campaign consultant keel said it was his idea to blame republican for an fbi listening device found in democratic mayor john street 's office
keel considers the decision to attack then - president george w. bush 's republican administration ' a defining moment ' of his career , according to his lawsuit
' his brazen and successful handling of the crisis launched keel to the forefront of his profession , ' said the legal filing , filed earlier this week and first reported on by the philadelphia inquirer
in his book ' believer : my forty years in politics , ' axelrod takes credit for the plan to accuse president george w. bush 's justice department of trying to sink the street 's re-election bid
axelrod , obama 's senior campaign strategist in 2012 , is under fire on at least two fronts for claims he made in his new political memoir whose idea was it ? philadelphia mayor john street ( right ) swept to a re-election victory in 2003 after his campaign aides hatched a plot to blame republican for alistening device the fbi planted in his office the fbi bugged the street 's office as part of a ' pay - to - play ' probe that led to the indictments of a city treasurer , a top street fundraiser and 10 others
the mayor himself was never charged and denied wrongdoing
the street had initially been quiet about the bug found in his city hall office but went on the attack as the campaign claimed that republican did it
weeks later , he won re-election in a landslide
axelrod , in a statement , said his book does not rule out the possibility that other advisers ' arrived at the same conclusion or proceeded on parallel tracks
' but the lawsuit claims axelrod was unreachable on the day keel came up with the strategy â and later opposed it
shawn fordham , mayor street 's 2003 campaign manager , submitted a statement with the suit saying that axelrod eventually ' got on board ' and called keel a ' hero
' keel also sued penguin random house , axelrod 's publisher
it dismissed keel 's claims as ' utterly absurd
' axelrod served as president obama 's chief campaign strategist in 2008 and 2012
now the founding director of the institute of politics at the university of chicago , axelrod cut his political teeth at age 27 as a city hall correspondent and columnist at the chicago tribune
three years later he jumped to politics with a communications director job for sitting u.s. senator paul simon
mitt romney 's personal assistant garrett ( right ) saw and heard everything the republican candidate said and did during the last presidential race , and he said axelrod lied about the 2012 election night concession call to make the republican look like a race - obsessed sore loser in addition to the the street campaign , axelrod later managed the re-election campaign of harold washington , chicago 's first black mayor , he later worked for then - senator john edwards ' 2004 presidential campaign and latched on to obama 's 2008 effort
ultimately he became one of the president 's most senior advisers before departing the white house in 2011
his career has also included political consulting for liberal candidates in canada and italy
' believer : my forty years in politics ' came out in mid-february and has already brought complaints from two people who say axelrod lied in the memoir this year he 's consulting with britain 's labour party in advance of may 7 elections
labour party has said axelrod is being paid a ' six - figure salary ' for his advice , and that he is working with douglas alexander , labour party âs shadow foreign secretary â largely via telephone conference calls
the street case is the second claim that he lied in his memoir
the personal aide of one - time republican presidential nominee mitt romney blasted him last month for writing that mitt romney had claimed president obama 's 2012 election victory was the product of an aggressive get - out - the - vote operation tageting blacks
garrett told cbs news that axelrod told a ' ridiculous ... lie ' about a phone call between obama and mitt romney on election night
the republican nominee , according to axelrod 's account , angered obama when he called to concede the race â saying , ' you really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like cleveland and milwaukee
' that 's how obama remembers it , axelrod wrote
' in other words , black people , ' his book records the president as saying , ' that 's what he ( mitt romney ) thinks this was all about
' garrett claimed he was in the room listening to mitt romney 's end of the conversation , and it never happened
separately , axelrod made news in february with a speech at the university of chicago institute of politics by claiming that the obama presidency has seen ' six years in which there has nât been a major scandal
' that claim drew a mix of applause and laughter from his audience .
