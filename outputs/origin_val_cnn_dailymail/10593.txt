before stiviano 's recordings toppled donald from ownership of the clippers , she boasted she would be the next mrs. sterling
she would pick up envelopes of cash in an alley behind the family 's real estate company and told employees at the firm she would one day be their boss
those predictions seemed like a fantasy on wednesday as donald 's wife went after the $ 3.6 million that she said the younger woman swindled from community property the couple amassed over 60 years of marriage
' she 's been very , very nasty to me , and she 's been mean to my husband
' stiviano , 32 , will have her own chance to testify on thursday in the nonjury trial in los angeles superior court as to why she should keep gifts that included a duplex , ferrari , jewelry and designer clothes
the trial put the sterling and stiviano together in the same room about a year after the recording of donald telling stiviano not to publicly associate with blacks culminated with his lifetime ban from the nba and the record $ 2 billion sale of the team
whether stiviano was ever a girlfriend to the billionaire or mistress , as his wife contends , she was downgraded to ' ex-friend ' when donald took the stand
donald , 80 , who has been diagnosed with symptoms of alzheimer 's , was at times forgetful and testy
he said stiviano had n't contributed ' 50 cents ' to the $ 1.8 million duplex now in her name
donald , 80 , said stiviano , right , had n't contributed ' 50 cents ' to the $ 1.8 million duplex now in her name donald , a lawyer and shrewd businessman who made a fortune buying apartment buildings across los angeles , never explained why he purchased the house , though he made it clear he paid every penny because he said stiviano was poor and her family was on welfare
he said the house was supposed to be in the name of his family trust
noting that stiviano is part black and hispanic , he said she illegally got her name inserted into escrow documents by befriending a hispanic bank employee who added her name to a $ 1 million check
stiviano 's lawyer , mac nehoray , said donald gave the gifts when he was separated from his wife and that no real community property was transferred to his client
further , he said the law does not allow a spouse to seek that money from a third party
donald said he only intended to loan a ferrari and a bentley to stiviano , but he put them under her name so he would n't be liable if she killed somebody , adding that she was once charged with drunken driving
the chief financial officer of sterling 's real estate company testified that it appeared his boss was cutting checks intended for stiviano that made it hard to trace where they went
' i believe he was doing it to lose the bloodhounds through the creek , ' schield testified
donald said he only intended to loan a ferrari , pictured , and a bentley to stiviano , but he put them under her name so he would n't be liable if she killed somebody , adding that she was once charged with drunken driving former clippers owner donald sits with stiviano courtside in 2011
on wednesday he told a judge that she had swindled items worth $ 3.6 million from him schield , who notified sterling of the questionable checks , said he witnessed stiviano getting envelopes of cash or cashier 's checks from employees at beverly hills properties and she once told the accounting department they would one day work for her
' i thought it was pure lunacy , ' he said
the sterling , who were at odds in the same courthouse when sterling won the right to sell the team last year over her husband 's objections , presented a mostly unified front
while donald denied the couple was ever estranged , his wife said they separated after the death of a son
she also said she drafted divorce papers last year , but never filed them
she said their relationship remained strong and displayed several affectionate cards her husband gave her for birthdays and their anniversary
one close family friend , superfon , said she vacations with the two and often feels like a third wheel as they walk hand - in - hand
she described meeting stiviano in the restroom once at a clippers game where the ' friendly girl ' complimented her on her coat and purse
when she returned the favor , stiviano gushed that donald had bought her things and she planned to marry him
' i said , ' but he 's married to my girlfriend , ' superfon said
' no worries , honey , ' stiviano replied
' i 'm going to be the next mrs. sterling
