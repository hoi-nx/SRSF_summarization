anyone who enjoys reading over someone âs shoulder while on public transport , or indeed looking at their laptop screen , should be aware
for a man on a recent flight found the perfect way to prevent a nosey fellow passenger â by filming him from his laptop camera
videoed sitting next to each other on an aeroplane , the filmmaker can be seen talking to his friends on the internet via facebook
the video maker recorded the man via photobooth on his laptop , which he opened and left hidden in the background of his screen the man sitting next to him sits with his arms crossed and with his eyes on the screen
but as the video maker motions to look in his direction the man quickly turns his head and stares blankly out of the window
returning to his laptop , the video maker keeps an eye on the man who straightens himself back up and scratches his head , as if wondering whether he had been spotted
as the passenger goes in for a second look the process is repeated as the film maker turns towards him and he recoils once more
the man puts on a pair of glasses so as to get a better look at the screen , much to the amusement of the filmmaker caught in the act ! the passenger quickly turns away as the man looks around to confront him smiling as he catches him out a further three times , the video maker notes with a caption that the man is pretending to look out of the window even though it is pitch black outside
the video concludes with the man putting on a pair of glasses so as to get a better look at the screen , much to the amusement of the filmmaker
explaining how he came about filming the man , the video maker wrote on his original upload of the video that he opened up photobooth â an apple mac application that allows you to take pictures and videos â and left it on hidden in the background
