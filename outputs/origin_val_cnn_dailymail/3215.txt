the reigning super bowl champ just happened to be playing basketball with nba legend jordan
the three professionals also played golf together at some point , as shown in a photo bradley posted on instagram
jordan , who won six nba titles over the course of his career and is now the majority owner of the charlotte hornets , can be heard talking trash during the video clip of the pickup game
in the video , jordan called for an ' and one ' while he 's in the process of draining a jumper
he then said : ' hey man you guys have youtube ? put on jordan for real
' before he put up the photo , bradley , 28 , had a number of humorous responses to questions he was asked on twitter
the pga tour player wrote : ' i schooled him in every other play
' my life is complete
' do n't ask em how golf went early that day
' brady posted a video of himself going cliff diving while he was vacationing during the nfl offseason bradley , 28 , had a number of humorous responses to questions he was asked on twitter after the game the four - time super bowl winning quarterback has earned nearly $ 150million in salary alone over the course of his career , according to spotrac
jordan , 52 , who played in 16 nba seasons , earned about $ 94million in salary
they have both banked substantially more cash than that from endorsement deals with companies like nike , under armour , mcdonald 's , uggs , movado watches , glaceau smartwater and others
bradly won the pga championship and was also named rookie of the year in 2011
after brady posted the video of the dive onto his facebook page , he indicated it might be his last big jump before he was seen on the cliff or in the bahamas , brady hit the beach with gisele and their kids there were 11 league titles on the court on saturday between jordan , brady and bradley
if brady wins another title , he will be the only quarterback in history with five super bowl wins
he would have to win the big game two more times to equal jordan 's six
if bradly wants to catch up to jordan or brady , he has his work cut out for him .
