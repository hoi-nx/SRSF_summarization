real 's star - studded attacking force might be struggling to fire , but barca coach enrique has no such problems with his wealth of talent up front

it 's the sixth successive season in which he has topped 40 goals , with 41 from 38 games so far this campaign
luis suarez has now scored six goals in his last four games , and 13 from 26 overall appearances since joining from england club liverpool after a world cup that ended in a lengthy ban for his bite on italy 's giorgio chiellini
" luis suarez and lionel messi are having more and more chemistry , and today we all saw what they bring to the team , " enrique said
" i like ( ivan ) rakitic wherever he plays on the field
he always knows what to do with the ball and is one of the best signings we 've ever had
" " ( gerard ) piquã© has always known how to score , above all on set plays
it 's a perfect solution for games when our opponents collapse defensively
" both teams had a player sent off in front of a crowd of over 87,000 , barca 's best this season : rayo vallecano defender tito for a foul on luis suarez in the 55th minute that allowed lionel messi to make it 3 - 0 with a retaken penalty ; and dani alves for tripping alberto bueno , who also netted the resulting spot - kick
