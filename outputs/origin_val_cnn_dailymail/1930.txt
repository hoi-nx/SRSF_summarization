hearn has submitted a formal proposal for a summer blockbuster between frampton and quigg
significant hurdles remain in making a june bout between these super-bantamweight world champions , most notably because they are backed by different broadcasters , with frampton enjoying huge exposure on itv while hearn 's fighters , including wba ( regular ) champion quigg , operate on sky
the dilemma is between the lure of terrestrial television and the greater prize purses that would most likely be generated by a box office event on sky
for his part , hearn has now tabled a proposal and is waiting on a reciprocal suggestion from mcguigan , who manages ibf champion frampton
frampton ( left ) and quigg ( right ) could be in line for a super-bantamweight bout in june hearn has tabled a proposal for the fight but significant hurdles still remain frampton 's manager mcguigan will talk with his boxer as a decision draws near it remains to be seen if there will be a way forward from there , with mcguigan adamant after frampton 's excellent win over avalos last month that the fight should prioritise exposure over ' greed '
but hearn told sportsmail : ' quigg is not worried about where the fight is staged or what television channel it is shown on â we just want to make this fight
of course the finances have to be right and we have submitted a proposal that will pay both fighters huge money
they ( frampton and mcguigan ) will talk with their broadcaster and see what 's on offer and then hopefully we will sit down as soon as possible
' after that , we can push negotiations on
i 'm not sure if we will ever find an agreed split - i would be happy for a 60 - 40 purse split in favour of the winner
if you really fancy it i ca n't see a problem with that
frampton celebrates after his victory over avalos in belfast , northern ireland in february frampton spins to address the crowd after stopping avalos in the fifth round last month ' we can talk about world titles and legacy and exposure but ultimately this is a super fight â and in a super fight it is only right that these two great fighters get the best deal possible financially
' venues for what would likely be the biggest fight in britain this year are currently under consideration in belfast , where frampton is from , as well as manchester and the o2 arena in london
hearn added : ' if we can all reach an agreement , then i would love to make this fight in june
we 'd be happy to fight in belfast if the numbers were right , but likewise manchester would be brilliant and so would the o2 arena in london
there is a long way to go but who would n't want to see this fight ? ' after frampton 's thrilling itv debut against avalos on february 28 , in which he extended his record to 20 wins from 20 fights , mcguigan said : ' hearn thinks of the numbers all the time , let 's think of the game , let 's think of it being free - to - air and millions and millions of people enjoying watching it because it will be a great fight
