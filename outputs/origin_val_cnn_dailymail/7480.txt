it 's well accepted that the bars preferred by backpackers offer cheap drinks and the chance to meet like - minded future facebook friends , but fremantle prison yha is offering up a whole new experience
western australia 's only world heritage - listed building has been transformed into a youth hostel where worldly travellers can spend a night behind bars in the cells previously occupied by hardened criminals
bookings open this week ahead of the opening of the hostel following a renovation of the famous institution 's women 's prison which took nine months
bookings open this week for the fremantle prison yha , a youth hostel in western australia 's only world heritage - listed building perfectly manicured lawns have replaced the dirt - covered yard that prisoners would have used for exercise in the former jail a combination of new and old is found at the fremantle prison 's new short - term accommodation the fremantle prison 's women 's division has been transformed from a place for incarceration to a haven for young travellers fremantle prison yha spokeswoman emily abbott says the launch of the hostel will be the culmination on five years of planning for a project that almost did n't get off the ground but that it is now â one of the most unique accommodation options in the country â
the north - western complex of the prison was built in the 1850s and originally served as the cookhouse , bakehouse and laundry but the closure of perth gaol meant a place was needed to keep female prisoners
they were transferred to fremantle prison yha and the wing was secured by an extra wall to keep them in , with varying results
and as western australia âs criminals increased with the population , the division was further extended until it was rendered redundant by the building of the specialist bandyup women 's prison in 1970
the entire prison was closed in 1991 and its historic status has since been confirmed and honoured by unesco , a blessing and a curse as far as the hostel is concerned
inspection time at the cells will take on a whole new meaning when the fremantle prison yha opens soon a double bunk fits perfectly in this rather luxurious cell formerly occupied by law - breaking women hangings , floggings and some famous escapes once took place in the prison soon to be filled with smiling faces the fremantle prison 's cookhouse before being devoted to women has extensive stainless steel food preparation facilities â the status as a world heritage site added many challenges to the development , which was shelved a number of times before finally receiving approval in april 2014 , ' abbott says
building approval was officially given the green light the following month
the prison itself was built by convicts between 1851 and 1859 , and was consequently referred to as the fremantle prison
it remained a prison for 136 years until it closed , with the women 's prison part of the property used as education facilities by tafe school of art and design from 1993 to 2009
fremantle prison was built by convicts from 1851 - 1859 and the majority of original features have been preserved throughout the facility reminders of the history of the prison , from past inmates to renowned escapees , are found throughout the halls a tribute of sorts on the wall honouring estelle williams , an escapee who climbed onto the roof and then perimeter wall to get out in 1931 a recreation of a typical cell that would have been home to a fremantle prison yha inmate around 1855 the fremantle prison 's entire complex serves as a popular and award - winning tourist attraction in its own right only a small overhaul was needed - and allowed due to the heritage listing 's restrictions - to turn the prison into short - term accommodation which abbott says is ' as prison - like as it is comfortable '
the walls , floors , windows and bars in some case retain the feeling of a place where you could be locked in with the key thrown away , but additional facilities have also been added to bring the hostel in line with its competitors
for those who do n't like the idea of being behind bars , the victorian - style guards â cottages outside the front gates are a more luxurious option
the women once locked away in this wing would have usually â offended the good order â of society , with the most common offences including ' vagrancy , loitering in public places , drunkenness , obscenity , soliciting , running a brothel , being idle or having no visible means of support ' .
