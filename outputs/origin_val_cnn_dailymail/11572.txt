pushed further on that statement , he added : ' i understand it 's hard to see
our first goal is to get out of the pool and then give ourselves every chance of winning the world cup
' we never change [ our views on what we can achieve ]
we are in this sport to win
there is no doubt about that
there is a process to getting there - we need to get out of our pool first
scotland were thrashed 40 - 10 by ireland on their own patch at murrayfield on saturday ' we 're in a tough pool - it could have been worse
we have tough games particularly against south africa and samoa that we need to make sure we perform well in
' it 's a pool i think we can do well in and then [ if ] we get a favourable quarter - final we move on from there
you just need to take it one game at time and that 's what we are going to do
' scotland ended their campaign with another hard - luck story as ireland steamrollered their way to a thrilling title triumph with a 40 - 10 win
and david denton admits it was not the way he saw the championships going
scotland lost all five of their six nations matches in 2015 to finish at the bottom of the table ' today was a disappointing end to a disappointing campaign , ' he said
' we came in to this competition with a lot of ambition and the prospect of winning the trophy
we came in thinking we were a good enough team to do that
' but a few of the results did n't go our way and today we were n't good enough
' there are a lot of things we can improve on and we will do
' was it realistic to think we can win the title ? one hundred per cent
there was no ambiguity about
( coach ) vern ( cotter ) said it at the start and we all believed it
' we went into the france game thinking if we win in paris things could start turning our way
