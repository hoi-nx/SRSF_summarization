like many professional athletes , woods has decided to move into the hospitality industry with a huge new restaurant set to be opened this year
but it appears to have already hit a speed bump , with project developer nicholas mastroianni revealing it can not be named ' woods ' because nike owns the rights to the golfer 's full name
he made the claims when asked in an interview about the florida project 's clunky name - the woods jupiter : sports and dining club
woods is unable to name his restaurant after himself because nike owns the rights to his name , the project developer has claimed in an interview with golf.com , he said he was told that ' nike has the rights to the name woods ' , adding that even gaining permission to use woods ' name in a press release was ' over the top '
however , woods ' manager mark steinberg has contradicted the claims , saying nike does not own the rights to his client 's name
he said : ' i ca n't imagine how this could have been communicated this way
it is wholly inaccurate and categorically false ' , golfchannel.com reported
' woods owns his own name and always had
' a nike spokesperson supported this , denying the corporation owned the rights to the name woods
developer allied capital and development of south florida previously said the property is expected to be a 5,900 - square - foot restaurant , likely to open in early 2015
woods said he envisions ' a place where people can meet friends , watch sports on tv and enjoy a great meal
' i wanted to build it locally where i live and where it could help support the community
' the restaurant will be located in a new shopping center development called harbourside , which is set to open in full in october
the $ 150million development will feature an amphitheater , marina , restaurants and shops and woods says he 's had his eyes on the property for two years
mr nicholas mastroianni said : ' i could nât be more excited to have woods âs new establishment operating within harbourside place , ' the palm beach post reported
' it âs gratifying to see the final stages met with support from local , national and international organizations such as mr woods
