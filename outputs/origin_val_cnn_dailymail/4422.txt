on the eve of bobbi kristina âs 22nd birthday yesterday gordon , whose social media presence had become increasingly desperate and erratic tweeted , â i âm so hurt i wan na do myself in , i know i have to strong [ sic ]
â in an insight into his spiraling mental state , on tuesday he tweeted â you all blame me but i tried my best and it was nât good enough sorry
â earlier he tweeted the simple plea to bobbi kristina , â i love you soooooooo much plz wake up
â through it all , he has not been allowed to visit with her , as tensions between gordon and the brown family have escalated on the edge : gordon was seen on outside north fulton hospital near atlanta , where bobbi kristina was first taken after she was found unconscious face down in her bathtub a helping hand : dr. phil is concerned about gordon and his on his way to offer assistance it is five weeks since bobbi kristina was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the roswell , georgia , home she and gordon , 25 , shared
the only daughter of whitney and brown has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother âs death in eerily similar circumstances
the singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near los angeles on 11 february 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre grammy awards party
but unlike marion â pat â houston âs death that was ruled accidental , police are treating bobbi kristina âs near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21 - year - old as a criminal investigation
two weeks after being admitted to atlanta âs emory hospital bobbi kristina was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection
instead she was given a tracheotomy
but any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures
while bobbi kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with gordon , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged
it was gordon who found bobbi kristina and who was administering cpr when first responders arrived on the scene
but other than this , few details have emerged
there have been reports that bobbi kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub
gordon and bobbi kristina in happier times
gordon has been banned from seeing her by the brown family in addition to this she had been using cocaine , heroin and xanax in the months before the january 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to people
just two weeks ago gordon was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the bobbi kristina and his georgia home â a home owned by whitney until her death â as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining cctv footage from security cameras located at the roswell residence
lawyers for gordon had tried to argue that the warrant issued on february 12 was an infringement of their client âs privacy but they subsequently dropped the case
meanwhile the nature of gordon and bobbi kristina âs union has come under intense scrutiny
both have referred to each other as â husband â and â wife â in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that gordon â who was unofficially adopted into the family by whitney when he was 14 â has married the girl who he once knew as a â sister
â in his most recent tweets gordon who had previously called bobbi kristina his â wife â refers to her as his â fiancÃ©e
â what is clear is that , in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left bobbi kristina fighting for her life , her life had become increasingly chaotic
just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver jeep liberty and drove headlong into a gray ford taurus
the driver of the ford and a passenger in her jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at roswell , georgia
gordon too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months
police were also called to her home on january 23 after reports of a fight there
a security guard at the gated community where bobbi kristina lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people â hitting each other and swinging â outside the three - bedroom townhouse
officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation
speaking to daily mail online a former boyfriend of bobbi kristina who remains a close friend , zach jafarzedeh gave an insight into the torrid pair
he said : â gordon has a short temper and bobbi kristina can be difficult
â it was a tug of war , because they are both very stubborn people
bobbie is very sweet , giving and caring , but she wants all of you , everything
â and gordon like space , that âs where a lot of the tension between them came from
â he revealed that gordon was â getting a little wild
â he said : â he was getting into car accidents
he âs been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years
he âs got a need for speed
he âs getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [ from bobbi kristina , sole inheritor of whitney âs estate ] and crashing them life and right
â he had a couple of chevrolet camaros
he liked fast cars , bmws , that kind of thing
he cares , but he was nât slowing down
â against this backdrop , hostilities between gordon and bobbi kristina âs father , brown , and other family members have publicly exploded with gordon an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure
gordon has accused brown of only being after his daughter âs money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return
bobby kristina âs aunt marion â pat â houston is the executor whitney âs estate estimated at between $ 12 and $ 20million trust she took out a restraining order against gordon in march citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in bobbi kristina because of her money
according to pat the tweets , including one that read â loam i got bigger guns than you
watch them react to this , â were specifically aimed at threatening her
pat , who was one of whitney âs managers , has made no secret of her disapproval of bobbi kristina and gordon âs â sibling â relationship having turned into something romantic
in increasingly erratic tweets gordon has raged against singer brown accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years
he has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both whitney , who struggled with drug abuse , and bobbi kristina fell on his shoulders and that , now just 25 , it was too great a duty to bear .
