suh âs wish appears to have come true , with the miami dolphins set to make him the nfl âs highest - paid defensive player
after the lions declined to use the franchise tag on suh to save $ 26.5m of cap space , the miami dolphins look to have beaten oakland , jacksonville , indianapolis and san diego to the most coveted signature in this year âs free agency
suh will on tuesday sign a $ 114million , six - year deal with around $ 60m guaranteed , espn report
with no state taxes in florida , the deal dwarfs jj watt âs current six - year , $ 100m deal which the texans â defensive end penned last year
suh will on tuesday sign a $ 114million with the miami dolphins with $ 60million guaranteed suh , the second pick of the 2010 draft , is a four time pro-bowler and three - time first team all-pro and led the lions with 8.5 sacks last season
at 28 , suh is in his prime and is a once - in - a decade type of player whom the miami dolphins can build their franchise around
a fearsome pass rusher , he was the cornerstone of nfl âs best rushing defense and helped the lions to the play - offs last year
he will join the likes of cameron wake and oliver vernon in an aggressive front four
in his five years in detroit , suh played 80 out of 82 games
he was suspended for both of those for stamping on evan dietrich-smith of the green bay packers in 2011
veterans such as cortland finnegan ( right ) were among those released by the miami dolphins to free up cap space following his exit , the focus for the lions front office will be getting fellow defensive tackle nick fairley to stay
after declining his fifth - year option last year due to injury concerns , the 26 - year - old is considered the second - best free agent defensive tackle
should suh depart , which appears likely , they will need a run - stuffer alongside him
the free - spending dolphins had a roster clear - out which paved the way for suh âs arrival
veterans such as brian hartline , brandon gibson , dannell ellerbe and cortland finnegan were among those released to free up cap space
suh and the miami dolphins travel to london later on this year to play the new york jets on october 4 in the first international series game of the 2015 season .
