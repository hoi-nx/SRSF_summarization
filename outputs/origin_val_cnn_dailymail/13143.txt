the isis is making headlines again
on wednesday , images began circulating from the city of raqqa in syria of a man being thrown off a building , allegedly after a conviction for a homosexual act
the scene is sickening and horrifying
and it 's meant to be , because isis is not only killing individuals it accuses of homosexuality -- it is trying to spread terror among people who do not conform to traditional ideas about what women and men should look like , do , or say
this latest execution is the eighth that isis has claimed it carried out for sodomy
in addition , the sohr ( sohr ) has reported the murders of four more men , also accused of sodomy , who were killed in similar style by isis in syria
isis is allegedly also responsible for stoning at least three women in syria accused of adultery
it 's clear that these chilling spectacles are staged with the intent to terrorize
some of the men were photographed either being thrown from the tops of tall buildings or stoned or shot to death ( and in some cases both )
in its social media postings about the executions , isis shows victims being brought to a city center , with militants purporting to read from a self - styled " court " ruling before conducting the execution in front of a crowd
a final picture usually depicts a lifeless body
the militia 's propaganda machine gathers local communities and posts images on social media with a clear intention : to warn against any kind of transgression and spread terror
the iglhrc ( iglhrc ) , of course , condemns these acts
but it is also important to note that we have very little information on the executions themselves
indeed , despite our efforts , and those of other independent observers , neither the accusations nor the exact nature , time , and location of the executions can be corroborated
we know nothing about the victims ' sexual orientation or gender identity
without evidence or independent confirmation , we must therefore be cautious about assuming anything about the individuals involved
still , whatever the uncertainties in these individual cases , as iglhrc and the women 's rights organization madre have asserted , the public and gruesome nature of these executions , and isis 's previous threats against those who commit what they deem to be " sodomy , " raise concerns for anyone in iraqi or syria who does not conform to traditional ideas about " proper " women and men
and the reality is that these most recent executions are certain to heighten alarm and psychological suffering among lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and intersex individuals -- and indeed terrorize the population generally -- in the areas under isis 's control
for iraqi individuals who are perceived to deviate from prevailing gender norms , living under the rule of isis means living with the constant shadow of a potential death sentence , as pointed out in our report with madre and the baghdad - based organization of women 's freedom in iraq
where do we go from here ? there are no shortcuts or easy answers to stopping the violence of isis
the antidote to their bleak worldview will be long - term and hard - won , rooted in the tenacity and wisdom of resilient local communities
however , the international community must act urgently to protect lives and help those fleeing violence today
internal and external resettlement of persecuted people should be stepped up with greater financial support to u.n. agencies and human rights ngos who work directly with vulnerable people
meanwhile , applications for asylum by persecuted individuals should be expedited
we can not sit idly by while isis commits wanton violence in the name of protecting " morality
