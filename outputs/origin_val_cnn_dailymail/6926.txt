ed woodward and the glazers love an eye - catching signing at manchester united but for manager louis van gaal the enforced absence of Â£ 59.7million winger angel di maria against tottenham on sunday might be the best news he âs had this season
of all the troubles that have afflicted van gaal in the last few months , none will have frustrated him more than the most expensive player in premier league history
di maria flickered brightly when he first arrived from real madrid but the last six months have signalled a steady decline due to injury , loss of form , an unfortunate burglary and most recently a stupid red card for pulling referee oliver against arsenal on monday night
angel di maria pleads his innocence after being booked by referee oliver in the defeat to arsenal oliver shows the red card to di maria after he tugged at the referee 's shirt following a yellow card di maria walks off the pitch after receiving the red card during the fa cup quarter - final with arsenal manchester united now have to face tottenham without him as they begin a run of key fixtures that will define their chances of getting into the champions league
liverpool , manchester city and chelsea all await in just over a month
yet di maria âs absence also gives van gaal an opportunity
by his own admission , the manchester united manager likes to kill off opponents by applying pressure through extended spells of possession
it requires patience from fans and players
for an instinctive risk - taker like di maria , it âs akin to being a square peg in a round hole
and for manchester united , the deliberate build - up does nât work if after 20 passes , their star man dribbles into a defender and does nât fight to win the ball back
lvg has tried the argentine in several positions but none have worked
without di maria against tottenham , themselves pushing for a top - four place , van gaal has greater options
he can opt for two traditional wingers , ashley young and adnan januzaj , recall the flair of mata or goal - poacher âs instinct of radamel falcao , or play a midfield three of michael carrick , ander herrera and daley blind to give him the control he craves
for now , van gaal is treading carefully with di maria
it would nât be wise to tell the board they âve wasted their money and with the player âs confidence at a low ebb after his red card hastened manchester united âs fa cup exit , the manager wants to build him up , not destroy him
manchester united ace ander herrera battles for the ball with fellow spaniard santi cazorla at old trafford manager louis van gaal speaks to ashley young during the fa cup quarter - final defeat at old trafford manchester united midfielder michael carrick vies for the ball with former team - mate danny welbeck even so , it âs significant when the manchester united manager said on saturday : â you pick up players like mata and angel di maria as they are very creative and dangerous , but when you lose the ball too much every trainer - coach will say , â you do nât have to lose so many balls â , as we have to fight back to win the ball again , or the opponent can score
â that is always the balance between creative and measuring the risk and ball possession of the opponent
and that is not only for mata and di maria but for every player
â manchester united have invested too much in di maria to jettison him at the first sign of trouble , particularly if no other club is willing to financially compensate a great deal of their outlay
but should manchester united convincingly overcome a tottenham side brimming with youthful energy in the form of harry kane , nabil bentaleb and ryan mason , questions will be asked if they are a better unit without their most expensive acquisition
tottenham 's french midfielder nabil bentaleb battles bobby zamora for the ball at loftus road tottenham midfielder ryan mason looks to beat qpr ace matt phillips to the ball of course , the break - in at di maria âs house was horrible for his family , who have effectively been forced from their home and now live in a hotel
but it leaves van gaal in a tricky position
in the build - up to sunday 's showdown , the manchester united manager tried to address all sides
he said he expected di maria to be at the club next season , but at the same time would be sympathetic to any player who was experiencing off - field problems and wanted to leave
he also pointed out that financial considerations meant the club could nât allow di maria to go cheap
in shorthand it âs unlikely manchester united would beat off any suitors who waved Â£ 50m at them to sign di maria this summer
van gaal and ryan giggs stand with an official as they look to get their tactics across at old trafford the manager âs immediate priority is to try and beat tottenham
any other result would hand the advantage of champions league qualification to arsenal , liverpool and also mauricio pochettino âs team
failure to be among europe âs elite for a second consecutive season would be cataclysmic for manchester united on many levels
for van gaal , a manager who has won championships with ajax , barcelona , az alkmaar and bayern munich , the price would be hurtful in football terms even without the monetary implications
â i do nât think that i âm here to think about the financial consequences â that is ( for ) ed woodward , â he argued
â i âm here to manage the professional football department of manchester united and i âm here because of my qualities and my philosophy
di maria celebrates a rare goal in a manchester united shirt after scoring against everton at old trafford â i think they are pleased with my way of managing the club
i am not thinking of the consequences if i am not in fourth or third
it is very bad for the club but why do we have to speak about things that have not happened yet ? â manchester united have lost only two league games since november 2 but their form has been unconvincing and their fans have booed players for an often safety - first approach
the manchester united manager insists everything is on track and the players are buying into his famed philosophy , even if some supporters are impatient with his pragmatic approach
due to his price tag , it would have been hard to imagine di maria being dropped for such an important fixture as this one against tottenham
now he ca nât play , it will be interesting to see if manchester united gel better as a team without him
