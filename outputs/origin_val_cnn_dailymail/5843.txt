for six years a fleet of ten dreamliners have been sitting unused and unwanted at a dreamliners factory in everett , washington
now there may be hope for them as two buyers have come forward keen to buy the cut price jets
the abandoned and half - completed aircraft have been labelled the â terrible teens â after being relegated during the early stages of production after numerous structural and weight issues
problems arose after dreamliners fast - tracked production before the boeing 787 dreamliner was certified airworthy
as a result the teens , which were among the earliest designs to be built , were made too heavy to fly as far as manufacturers had hoped
although dreamliners has never divulged the weight difference for the teens compared to catalogue models , once they are finished their range is estimated to be 6,850km , 1,850km less than later 787 - 8 dreamliner models
