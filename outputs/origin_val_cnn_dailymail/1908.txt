starbucks baristas will no longer be encouraged to write ' race together ' on customers ' cups , the coffee chain 's ceo howard schultz has said today
the last day workers will write the messages is on march 22 as the initiative , which was accused of using racial tensions to boost its bottom line , will continue more broadly without the handwritten notes
starbucks spokesman jim olson said the phase out is not a reaction to the push back the chain has received over its campaign
' nothing is changing , ' he said
' it 's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned
' the campaign , announced on tuesday , received much criticism including that it was opportunistic and inappropriate , as it came in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males
others questioned whether starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks
' while there has been criticism of the initiative - and i know this has n't been easy for any of you - let me assure you that we did n't expect universal praise , ' his statement said
' the heart of race together has always been about humanity : the promise of the american dream should be available to every person in this country , not just a select few
the six - time nba champion wrote that starbucks ' ' race together ' campaign left him in ' shock and awe ' ' we leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most
we are learning a lot
and will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most
' the initiative previously encouraged workers to write ' race together ' on cups and to also strike up conversations with customers about race
schultz said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was ' just the catalyst ' for a larger conversation
he also said this part of the campaign was always scheduled to end on sunday
starbucks will still hold forum discussions , co-produce special sections in usa today and put more stores in minority communities as part of the race together initiative , wrote schultz
six - time nba champion abdul-jabbar spoke out in defence of schultz and the company 's campaign , saying the concept left him in ' shock and awe
' ' starbucks ceo howard schultz 's bold decision to encourage his baristas to discuss race relations with willing customers has filled me with shock and awe , ' he wrote in his time magazine column
' i 'm in awe of his courageous and good - hearted attempt to do something to bring about better awareness of racism
' i 'm in awe that he 's willing to put morality above profits
i 'm in awe that he 's willing to endure the snarky ridicule and lame coffee jokes from pundits as well as the inevitable death threats from clueless trolls
all with nothing personally or corporately to gain â and a lot to lose
' but while in awe of his chutzpah , i 'm also in shock that he thinks this will actually work
' abdul-jabbar , who at 67 has expanded his talents beyond basketball to become a celebrated writer , actor and filmmaker quoted george bernard shaw as he praised starbucks ' ' noble goal
' ' progress is impossible without change , and those who can not change their minds can not change anything , ' he quoted
however , abdul-jabbar admitted he has serious concerns with how starbucks are attempting to bring about change
defense : starbucks ceo howard schultz told good morning america on thursday that he is simply trying to use the company 's reach for good with its new ' race together ' campaign ' the problem with howard schultz 's race together program is that he 's picked the wrong venue with the wrong audience using the wrong spokespersons
' most of the customers at starbucks probably do n't want to have their political awareness challenged by the person foaming their coffee
minds are more likely to be changed by someone with some form of expertise in the subject , which baristas generally do n't have
' the former nba all - star also wrote that he admired schultz 's courage and applauded his initiative but worried that such conversations ' could quickly escalate to violence
' abdul-jabbar even likened schultz to the highly moral character of starbucks in moby dick trying to stop the blasphemous actions of ahab
' as another character warns , ' you 're in dangerous waters , mr. starbucks ! come on over ; come about
' support : schultz was joined on stage at the annual meeting by rapper common , who also spoke about the importance of engaging with people from different backgrounds in support of the campaign ridiculed : after the campaign was announced , twitter users slammed the idea as naive ' do n't stop trying , mr. starbucks , ' wrote abdul-jabbar
schultz has defended the ridiculed campaign as ' very genuine '
during starbucks ' annual shareholders meeting in seattle on wednesday , schultz said the company is simply trying to use its massive reach for good
' some in the media will criticize starbucks for having a political agenda , ' he said
' our intentions are pure
' speaking on cbs this morning on thursday , he added : ' this is a highly charged , highly emotional issue , we understand that
a letter from howard schultz to starbucks partners regarding race together : dear partners , i want to offer my heartfelt thanks to every one of you for your fearless and energetic support of the race together initiative
our objective from the very start of this effort -- dating back to our first open forum in seattle last december -- was to stimulate conversation , empathy and compassion toward one another , and then to broaden that dialogue beyond just our starbucks family to the greater american public by using our scale for good
after a historic annual shareholders meeting that focused on diversity and inequality , and an initial push for much - needed national discussion around these difficult topics , it is time for us to take stock of where we are , what we have learned from our efforts so far , and what is next
this phase of the effort -- writing ' race together ' ( or placing stickers ) on cups , which was always just the catalyst for a much broader and longer term conversation -- will be completed as originally planned today , march 22
but this initiative is far from over
we have a number of planned race together activities in the weeks and months to come : more partner open forums , three more special sections co-produced with usa today over the course of the next year , more open dialogue with police and community leaders in cities across our country , a continued focus on jobs and education for our nation 's young people plus our commitment to hire 10,000 opportunity youth over the next three years , expanding our store footprint in urban communities across the country , and new partnerships to foster dialogue and empathy and help bridge the racial and ethnic divides within our society that have existed for so many years
while there has been criticism of the initiative -- and i know this has n't been easy for any of you -- let me assure you that we did n't expect universal praise
the heart of race together has always been about humanity : the promise of the american dream should be available to every person in this country , not just a select few
we leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most
we are learning a lot
and will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most
i want to thank those of you who took time this week to share what you were seeing , hearing , feeling and thinking as we rolled out race together across the country
an issue as tough as racial and ethnic inequality requires risk - taking and tough - minded action
and let me reassure you that our conviction and commitment to the notion of equality and opportunity for all has never been stronger
take care of yourselves and each other
i am proud to be your partner
with great respect , howard schultz source : starbucks ' we 've tried to be very thoughtful , very genuine , very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores , potentially , we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference
' he said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company 's workers can ' elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day ' , he will be satisfied
after the campaign was announced , twitter ruthlessly mocked starbucks
one user tweeted : ' i do n't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train
' another added : ' # racetogether is what happens when a 1 % - er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life ' white man 's burden ' crisis
' controversial : the new campaign encourages workers to write ' race together ' on customer 's cups and to strike up conversations about race
pictured , customer matt ullman shows off one of the new stickers an executive on starbucks ' communications team , corey dubrowa , even blocked people on twitter before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign
dubrowa later said in a post on medium that he felt he was being ' personally attacked in a cascade of negativity ' and that he had gotten overwhelmed , but later reactivated the account
when good morning america asked schultz about some of the scathing criticism on thursday , schultz responded : ' well , you know what i say to that - no good deed goes unpunished
' he has explained that workers do not have to participate in the campaign , and that stores can make customers another drink or cover up cups if they do n't like the message
inserting itself into national issues is not new territory for starbucks in late 2012 , the chain asked workers to write ' come together ' on cups to send a message to lawmakers about stalled budget negotiations
and in 2013 , the chain placed newspaper ads saying that firearms were not welcome in its cafes after they became the site of gun rallies
but the company stopped short of an outright ban
schultz said at the time that starbucks was neither for nor against guns , underscoring that even a company that wants a voice in national conversations has to be careful about alienating customers
questions : another twitter user pointed out the lack of diversity in the campaign material
