islamic state is clamping down on caesarean operations in the latest attack on what it perceives to be decadent western practices
doctors working for isis have been ordered to charge 15,000 syrian pounds for a caesarean childbirth operation , the equivalent of two months salary for the average syrian worker
under the harsh new rules enforced by the terror group , doctors who carry out the operations without charging the fee will now face unspecified punishments
the islamic state order stipulates that the new charges are aimed at deterring hospitals from carrying out routine caesarean
jihadi brides like these , posing with a bmw in syrian , wo n't be allowed a caesarean operation if they need one to give birth unless they can afford 15,000 syrian pounds - two months salary for the average worker a surgical team performing a caesarean
some clerics consider the procedure too western and decadent but the high fees will force women who ca n't afford the operations to endure painful childbirth
a written order published in the northern syrian province of deir az-zor states : ' in order to assist the believers from the sons of islamic who are working in the medical corps to support their brothers from the poor and others besides them from the muslims populace , and with the desire to keep the course of medical work removed from arbitrary whim
' it adds : ' this is to be considered as tantamount to a written order and all who contravene it will be held accountable in the dar al-qaá¸a [ is judiciary ] with attendant consequence
' there is growing opposition among islamic clerics to western trends in gynaecology developments and in particular to mothers who wish to have a pain - free childbirth sometimes referred to as ' too posh to push '
one scholar has recently claimed that the rise in caesarean operations in the middle east is part of a plot against muslims mothers
the wives of isis fighters like these will struggle to get pregnant again if they have a caesarean , according to one cleric who calls the procedure a ' plot against muslims ' sheikh muhammad ibn saalih al uthaymeen has ruled that muslims mothers should n't need any decadent pain - relieving assistance in the delivery of their babies
in his ruling published on an islamic website he says : ' i would like to take this opportunity to point out a phenomenon that has been mentioned to us , which is that many obstetricians , male and female , in the hospitals are too keen for birth to take place by surgical means , which is known as a caesarean
' i am afraid that this may be a plot against the muslims , because the more births take place in this manner , the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman , and she becomes unable to get pregnant
' he adds : ' some of the people who work in private hospitals have told me that many women come to the hospitals and their specialists tell them that there is no alternative to a caesarean , then they go to this private hospital and give birth naturally
' isis is trying to build a modern health service , reportedly with help from these nine british medical students who have apparently travelled to syrian to work in hospitals in islamic state - held areas leaders of the islamic state have tried to build a modern health service and have appealed to doctors from all over the world to travel to syrian and iraq to join their medical teams
earlier this year the islamic state announced the opening of the faculty of medicine in raqqa , in northern syrian , where doctors are trained in just three years
is took control of raqqa more than one year ago , to become one of the group 's main strongholds in the region , imposing a so - called ' islamic curriculum ' on educational facilities in the city
many western jihadists have based themselves in this part of the region
last week it was reported that nine british medical students travelled to syrian to work in hospitals in islamic state - held areas
four women and five men entered the country , keeping their plans secret from relatives until shortly before they crossed the border from turkey .
