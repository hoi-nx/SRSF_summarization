this party was meant to be all about andy murray coming home to scotland , but the guest of honour turned out to be the 28 - year - old son of a london cabbie
andy murray responded to the earsplitting support from the people who love him the most by delivering a winning start for great britain against america in their davis cup first - round knockout
but the ex-wimbledon champion âs four - set win over donald young turned out to be a mere warm - up act , as glasgow 's emirates arena screamed on james ward as he battled john isner to a standstill to put the home side 2 - 0 up with three rubbers to play
james ward dug out a sensational fightback against john isner on friday night andy murray celebrates epic victory with team - mate ward james ward embraces great britain captain leon smith after near five - hour thriller an emotional james ward finally clinched his sixth match point to sensationally beat the world no 20 6 - 7 , 5 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 , 15 - 13
he is transformed when in national colours
andy murray seemed close to tears as he embraced him at the end of a career - best win that makes gb firm favourites to reach the quarter finals
james ward so often saves his best for davis cup , to the extent that it is fairly staggering to think that he has never cracked the world âs top 100
â this is by far the best atmosphere i âve ever been part of in the davis cup , â said james ward
â i âd prefer not to play five sets every time but the crowd was incredible and really helped
â against the america in san diego 13 months ago he put another tall man , sam querrey , to the sword with a comeback win to put great britain 2 - 0 up
john isner , though , is a tougher proposition altogether
america no 1 john isner let slip a two - set lead against james ward in glasgow world no 111 ward did little wrong in the first two sets , except for blowing the five points that followed him going 4 - 2 up in the opening tiebreak
one thing apparent in this match was how great britain have got the court surface right in making it relatively slow and low , and he fashioned his rebound by keeping the ball skidding and attacking the america âs weaker backhand side
the 111 - minute deciding set became a tug of war in which neither man would yield
john isner is , after all , the player who once won an 11 hour five minute match over nicolas mahut at wimbledon
james ward forced two match points at 5 - 4 , one at 10 - 9 and one at 11 - 10 , then needed to save two break points at 11 - 11 before breaking to love to clinch the match
gb captain leon smith said : â it âs really tough for the america now but they have jim courier as captain and he will not let them go down without a fight
â andy murray and jamie roared on james ward to victory in five - set thriller the question now is whether andy murray will put himself on the line in today âs doubles with brother jamie for what would be a highly charged encounter with the world champion bryan brothers
after james ward âs win he is surely much more likely to make way for dom inglot and save himself for tomorrow
andy murray completed the first leg of his task when he took down america no 2 donald young 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 2 in just under two hours
apart from an untimely dip at the end of the third set , andy murray was in imperious form against world no 47 young
by the time he had finished the warm - up the crowd had joined in a rousing singalong to runrig âs loch lomond , and for andy murray it was the perfect preparation
â i used that energy and emotion very well at the beginning of the match
i had a bit of a lull but i could nât maintain the intensity i had in the first two sets
â andy murray compared the feel of the occasion to what he experienced at the 2012 olympics , and he responded in much the same way
it was certainly different to the lacklustre defeat by croatian teenager borna coric in dubai last week
andy murray was ever so slightly more pumped up yesterday
it might still come down to james ward in a fifth and deciding rubber , but after yesterday evening âs heroics that that may not be necessary
andy murray had put great britain 1 - 0 up in tie by beating donald young 6 - 1 6 - 1 4 - 6 6 - 2
