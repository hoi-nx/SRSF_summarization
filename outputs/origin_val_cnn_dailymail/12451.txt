istanbul a prosecutor involved in a controversial case died tuesday after he was shot during a hostage siege in an istanbul courthouse
prosecutor mehmet selim kiraz died in the hospital from injuries he suffered during the attack , prime minister ahmet davutoglu said , speaking to reporters on turkish television
the two gunmen who took the prosecutor hostage were killed in a shootout with police after a standoff that lasted for hours
mehmet selim kiraz was assigned to the controversial case of berkin elvan , a 15 - year - old boy who was injured during the anti-government gezi park protests in june 2013
the teen died the following march after having spent nine months in a coma
the case , with its overtones of possible police overreaction , has been politically contentious , just as the protests themselves were
in an online post widely cited in turkish media , the left - wing revolutionary people 's liberation party-front claimed responsibility for the attack
the post said the gunmen were seeking to avenge elvan 's death
president erdogan described the gunmen as terrorists and said they were disguised as lawyers when they entered the courthouse
" this is not to be taken lightly , " he said
the gunmen took the prosecutor hostage around 12:30 p.m. in his office on the sixth floor of the caglayan district courthouse , the semiofficial anadolu agency reported
police evacuated that floor of the building , the agency reported , and snipers were deployed
an explosion , followed by sounds of more gunshots , could be heard coming from the courthouse tuesday evening , hours after the siege began
istanbul police chief selami altinok said mehmet selim kiraz had been shot before turkish security teams entered the room where the hostage crisis was unfolding
" there is nothing else to do but to pray at this moment , " erdogan said
the revolutionary people 's liberation party-front , known as the revolutionary people 's liberation party-front , is viscerally hostile to the turkish state , the united states and nato , and has had links with the far left in europe
the marxist-leninist group claimed responsibility for a 2013 suicide bombing at the u.s. embassy in ankara
among other attacks attributed to the revolutionary people 's liberation party-front was the assassination of a former justice minister , mehmet topac , in 1994 , as well as the murders of a number of senior police and military officials and , 1996 , a prominent businessman , ozdemir sabanci
