a nine - year - old boy found a message in a bottle while exploring a wooded beach of a small lake island on a family vacation - and then realized it was addressed to his grandfather
rogers had been on a fishing trip with his family on lake murray in south carolina
his mother , viki garrick noticed her childrens ' attention waning and stopped at a small island to explore
that 's when rogers came across a screw - top dr pepper bottle with a rolled - up letter inside sitting next to a log
the letter was written to rogers 's grandfather , mike rogers ( right ) rogers imagined it was a ' note from the pirates or something ' , and showed his parents who read the note first , according to the slate
garrick and her husband could only make out a few words on the yellowed paper towel , but were able to make out , ' i wish i could see you ... i love you so much ... i love you , diane bryant '
they could n't read who the letter was addressed to , but noticed the name started with the letter 'm '
garrick recognized the signature from an old friend of hers and immediately sent a picture of the letter to her friend diane bryant , who responded by saying she knew ' exactly where that came from '
in 1970 , when bryant , who 's now 58 , was about 13 years old , she was on an overnight church gathering on lake murray
the letter , found in the bottle pictured , had faded , but garrick could read , ' i wish i could see you ... i love you so much ... i love you , diane bryant bryant ( left ) hoped that rogers , righty , would find the letter when he was on vacation with his family later in the summer of 1970
he did n't discover the letter for another 45 years she was missing her then - boyfriend , mike rogers , who was n't allowed on the trip because he had gotten in some kind of trouble at the time
the couple had dated on and off when they were teenagers
' he had long hair
and my dad did not like him , so therefore , i liked him , ' bryant told the slate
' i was his church girlfriend
i knew he had other girlfriends
' she said that as a 13 - year - old , she was ' devastated ' that rogers could n't come on the trip
so she wrote a love note - as the couple often did - and stuffed it in a bottle before tossing it in a lake , hoping mike rogers would find it later in the summer when he vacationed with his family , according to abc
' with my whole heart , i just knew one day he would find it , ' bryant said
' i 've thought about it through the years , thinking , " i wonder if anyone ever found that bottle ? " ' bryant and rogers remain friends to this day , though they are no longer romantically involved
they both married different people and 45 years later , rogers did find it
rogers led him , now 58 , to the spot where he found the bottle , and his grandfather joked that he finally ' got it '
he had a good laugh and told abc that it was fun to reminisce about the ' good old times '
' the more you think about it , the more it blows your mind , ' rogers told the slate
' there 's got to be some more meaning to this
' bryant agreed , saying she did n't know what ' the hidden message ' was
though the pair remained friends over the years , they decided they ' would have killed each other a long time ago ' , bryant said
she and her husband ron have been married for nearly 40 years
ron was on the same church trip as bryant the day she wrote her love letter to rogers
rogers is also married with children and grandchildren .
