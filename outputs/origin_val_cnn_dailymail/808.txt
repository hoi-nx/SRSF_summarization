the 2015 cars are going to be evolutions of last year 's cars , so it 'll be the same people that we were racing with last year
red bull , williams , and then you 're hoping that it 's a bit of a better year for those like mclaren and ferrari , so that we have more people to race
' there was one year the first seven races were won by a different driver , a different team , that 's what people want to see
but , most importantly , if the cars are close you can have real races where you 're overtaking and battling and that 's what i love doing
that 's what racing 's about
