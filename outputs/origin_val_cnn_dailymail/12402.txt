new york the house is primitive , constructed of baked mud and stone
the landscape is sparse and mountainous , with snow cover in the winter
the terrain is rugged and challenging for the long walks the owner liked to take with his sons
photographs quietly introduced as evidence in the latest major terrorism trial in manhattan federal court offer a rare look inside bin laden 's lair -- years before al qaeda flew hijacked planes into buildings or bombed u.s. embassies in africa and even before the fbi placed bin laden on its most wanted list
still , bin laden was preparing , hiding out in a remote , mountainous area of afghanistan known as tora bora
a remarkable set of photos -- the first showing bin laden in the hideout where he would seek refuge after 9/11 -- came to light only last month in the terrorism conspiracy trial of bin laden lieutenant al-fawwaz , a communications conduit for al qaeda in london in the mid- 1990s
al-fawwaz would arrange bin laden 's first television interview for cnn 's arnett and peter bergen in 1997 and a sit - down for abc news ' john miller a year later
but before then , al-fawwaz called on a palestinian print journalist , whose 1996 journey to afghanistan yielded these photos
bin laden had declared war on the u.s. and wanted more people to know it , especially in the arab world
he reached out to atwan , the founder and then - editor - in - chief of al-quds , an independent arabic weekly published in london that had been critical of certain arab regimes and the 1991 persian gulf war
atwan had broken the story about bin laden 's first fatwa , or religious decree , stating his grievances against the u.s. , such as the presence of u.s. troops in saudi arabia
he published the entire screed in august 1996
the next month , al-fawwaz went to atwan 's office to offer him the first print interview with the emerging jihadist leader in afghanistan
" i was told that osama bin laden was fond of my writing , he liked my style , and he wanted to meet me personally , " atwan recalled in an interview for peter bergen 's 2006 book , " the osama bin laden
" " i was hesitant , because it was very dangerous
" danger aside , in november 1996 , atwan was airborne to afghanistan
the date - stamped photographs from his trip -- which scotland yard detectives discovered two years later in a search of al-fawwaz 's london home -- show a healthy , relaxed , sometimes smiling bin laden , not yet 40 , conversing , hiking , videotaping pronouncements , surrounded by children
the photos also show rare images of another man who has become an influential ideologue in the global jihadist movement -- abu musab al-suri , better known as abu musab al-suri , a syria now in his mid- 50s who has not been seen in public or heard from in a decade
still , abu musab al-suri is arguably the most influential strategic thinker in islamist militant circles today
" a generation of jihadis were influenced by his teachings , " said paul cruickshank , a cnn terrorism analyst who has written about abu musab al-suri
" he wanted a global jihadist intifada , where people rose up and fought as individuals
" his teachings have deeply influenced jihadis in syria -- how to build up an organization , how to win support for it , " he said
bin laden , from saudi arabia , first went to afghanistan in the 1980s to participate in the armed resistance to soviet invaders , one of thousands of arab fighters defending a muslim nation
as the anti-soviet jihad wound down , bin laden began organizing al qaeda , meaning " the base , " around the border city of peshawar , pakistan
by 1992 , pakistan forced him and his fighters to leave
bin laden relocated to khartoum , sudan , welcomed by a new islamist regime
but after four years headquartered there , in 1996 , under pressure from the u.s. , sudan made bin laden go
by then , the ideologically in sync taliban had taken control of afghanistan , and bin laden decided to move there
in may 1996 , bin laden settled in the eastern afghanistan city of jalalabad
his mountain fortress in tora bora was a long drive up a dirt road he had built
atwan was driven there in a red toyota pickup in a twisting seven - hour drive through the mountains
as a photo of him shows , atwan donned afghanistan - style baggy trousers and a turban to get past security checkpoints and fit in
atwan met bin laden in his cave
it was small , 13 by 20 feet in atwan 's estimation , and as the new photos show , it was lined with shelves of books about the koran and the prophet mohammed
bin laden liked to use the bookshelves as a backdrop for his videotaped edicts and interviews
the cave not only offered bin laden a hiding place but also street credibility in the muslim world , as the prophet is believed to have received the revelations of the koran while camped in his own mountain cave
after hours of conversation and an inedible dinner featuring salty cheese and sandy bread , atwan ended up bunking in the cave on a mattress that rested on boxes of grenades
" he wanted media exposure , " atwan recalled in the interview for peter bergen 's 2006 book
" he wants to say , ' now i am an international figure ; i 'm not just a saudi arabia
i am aggrieved at u.s. who are occupying saudi arabia who are desecrating the holy land
' " as seen in the photographs , bin laden always carried a russian - made kalashnikov rifle
his comrades addressed him as " abdullah , " for father of abdullah , his eldest son
two younger sons , saad and ali , then in their early teens , sometimes were at the compound
as one photo shows , atwan and bin laden took a two - hour walk around tora bora
" he loved that nature there
they were trying to have their own community , grow their foods , " atwan recalled
" it 's like an oasis in afghanistan
" bin laden 's three wives and more than a dozen children did not share bin laden 's joy in living the life of medieval peasants in the tora bora mountains , where the only light at night was from the moon and gas lanterns , and the only heat in a place where tremendous blizzards were common was a wood - burning metal stove
hunger was a frequent companion to the bin laden children who lived on a subsistence diet of rice , bread , eggs and that salty cheese
in december 2001 , with u.s. troops retaliating for 9/11 closing in , bin laden fled tora bora , eventually making his way to pakistan , where u.s. navy seals ended a decade - long manhunt by killing him in his abbottabad hideout , an hour north of islamabad
atwan stepped down from the helm of al-quds in 2013 and recapped his journey in a deposition for the al-fawwaz trial
al-fawwaz was convicted in manhattan federal court on february 26 and faces a possible life sentence
even in tora bora , atwan felt bin laden was vulnerable to intelligence agencies
" i thought this man would not last , " atwan said tuesday
" he was n't really well - protected
he was visible and moving freely
" in 1996 , bin laden knew but certainly did not disclose the lethal plots he had set in motion -- the embassy bombings , the planes plot that would become 9/11
atwan said , " he was very optimistic , and it never occurred to me that this would be the most be dangerous man in the world
" with his pale skin , short red hair and beard , and green wool hat , abu musab al-suri could pass for irish
but he is syria , originally from the ancient city of aleppo , fought in the anti-soviet afghanistan war , and lived in london in the 1990s
al-suri was close to bin laden , which explains his comfortable presence in the 1996 photos of tora bora , seated next to al qaeda 's leader in his cave or hiking with him , carrying his own cameras
( al-suri also accompanied peter bergen and arnett on their visit to bin laden in 1997
) the u.s. has since accused abu musab al-suri of training recruits at al qaeda 's pre- 9/11 al-ghuraba and derunta camps in afghanistan , where operatives such as ahmed ressam , who planned to bomb los angeles international airport in december 1999 , learned how to kill with poisons and chemicals
eventually , abu musab al-suri publicly criticized bin laden for making al qaeda so hierarchical , for courting publicity and being so controlling , even calling him a " pharoah " for his imperial leadership style
but abu musab al-suri was no less militant
he set up his own training camp in afghanistan and advocated a " leaderless jihad " featuring , as he put it , " spontaneous operations performed by individuals and cells all over the whole world without connection between them
" al-suri summarized his philosophy in his 1,600 - page treatise , " the call for global islamic resistance , " which he published on the internet in 2004
he coined the arabic slogan nizam , la tanzim , meaning " a system , not an organization , " to describe his belief that there should be no organizational bonds between " resistance fighters
" al-suri advocated terrorist cells of no more than 10 men and envisioned more " lone - wolf " attacks , such as the fort hood , texas , massacre carried out in 2009 by rogue u.s. army maj. nidal malik hasan , who was inspired by the radical yemeni - u.s. cleric anwar al-awlaki , himself an abu musab al-suri disciple
strategically , abu musab al-suri argued , a less centralized jihadist network would make operatives who were arrested less likely to expose fellow militants to intelligence or law enforcement agencies , because the fighters would not know who else was part of the movement
al-suri was forward thinking about al qaeda evolving into an international ideology more than a centrally controlled organization
after 9/11 , abu musab al-suri appeared on the u.s. most wanted terrorists list with a $ 5 million reward for information leading to his capture
in 2005 , abu musab al-suri was tracked down in quetta , pakistan , and sent to syria , where he was imprisoned
there were unconfirmed reports that he was released in 2012 , followed by al qaeda statements by leader ayman al-zawahiri and spokesman adam gadahn in 2014 saying , " may allah release him
" a decade after his arrest , abu musab al-suri 's whereabouts are a mystery
