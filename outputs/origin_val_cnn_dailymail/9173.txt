a big debate researchers have been having about how small life on earth can get may be over
scientists from the us department of energy 's lawrence berkeley national laboratory and the berkeley , captured photos of ' ultra-small bacteria ' for the first time
the photos may end a debate which has been raging for two decades.about whether the tiny bacteria exist or not
scientists from the us department of energy 's lawrence berkeley national laboratory and the berkeley , captured photos of ' ultra-small bacteria ' ( pictured ) scientists say that the ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns which means that almost 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an escherichia coli cell the comprehensive electron microscopy images and dna - based description of the microbes researchers were able to obtain seem to indicate the bacteria are very small - but very real
ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns [ one micron is one millionth of a meter ] , according to lawrence berkeley national laboratory close to 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an escherichia coli cell
more than 150,000 escherichia cells could fit onto the tip of a single human hair
the bacteria were found in groundwater and are believed to be rather common
in their abstract , the scientists wrote : ' ultrastructural features potentially related to cell and genome size minimization include tightly packed spirals inferred to be dna , few densely packed ribosomes and a variety of pili - like structures that might enable inter-organism interactions that compensate for biosynthetic capacities inferred to be missing from genomic data
' the results suggest that extremely small cell size is associated with these relatively common , yet little known organisms
' since it was founded in 1931 , lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( pictured above ) has been recognized with 13 nobel prizes findings about the bacteria were published in the nature communications journal
a berkeley professor in the departments of earth and planetary science and environmental science , policy and management , banfield , co-wrote the paper with luef , a reearchers at the norwegian university of science and technology
banfield said : ' these newly described ultra-small bacteria are an example of a subset of the microbial life on earth that we know almost nothing about
' these bacteria are detected in many environments and they probably play important roles in microbial communities and ecosystems
' but we do n't yet fully understand what these ultra-small bacteria do
' luef said their research was ' a significant step in characterizing the size , shape , and internal structure of ultra-small cells '
she added : ' there is n't a consensus over how small a free - living organism can be , and what the space optimization strategies may be for a cell at the lower size limit for life
' since it was founded in 1931 , lawrence berkeley national laboratory has been recognized with 13 nobel prizes .
