a bogus doctor who had ' more psychiatric qualifications than sigmund freud ' and used her husband and parents as fake references has been unmasked as a serial liar
sarah sims claimed she had a long list of qualifications from the university of london and said she had been given a ' ladyship ' by university of warwick
the three - times married ' doctor ' also claimed she had been an officer in the ministry of defence as she applied to be head of childcare services at a children 's home in folkestone , kent
but she was finally exposed as a fraud after the employers discovered her qualifications were completely made up
sarah sims claimed she had been given a doctorate by the university of london ( pictured ) , but it just was one of a long list of lies she told sims , 41 , claimed on her cv that she received a first class bachelor 's degree , master 's degree and philosophy doctorate from the university of london
she said her last job had been lead welfare officer at the ministry of defence , and included glowing testimonial from her line manager sergeant major pugh
three - times married sims , who lives in a Â£ 1million home near canterbury , also claimed to be a member of the ' british association ( bcap )
' she added that she had been awarded the title of ' ladyship ' from university of warwick for community ' good works '
the highly - qualified ' doctor ' seemed the perfect fit for the role as operations director at ferndearle child care services - until it was revealed that nearly her entire cv was a lie
a jury at canterbury crown court heard that sims did not receive any of the psychology degrees she claimed to own , and her university had no record of her ever being a student there
university of warwick said it never gives out the title of ' ladyship ' and the british association does not exist
sims ' glowing reference from her ' line manager ' sergeant major pugh turned out be be her 48 - year - old husband - pugh - who was himself cleared of fraud
the three - times married ' doctor ' also claimed she had been an officer in the ministry of defence as she applied to be head of child care services at a nursing home , canterbury crown court ( pictured ) heard the court also heard that two other references listed on sims ' cv as ' therapeutic supervisors ' were actually her parents
reed , prosecuting , told how sims applied for the folkestone post in february 2011 , saying she was considering leaving the army
mr reed said : ' she said she was a doctor of psychology and was interested in working for fearndale
she contacted the manager and part - owner of the home and arranged to visit
' ' mr pugh had been in the army , but not at that time
in her job application , she stated she had been a student at university of london and had obtained a ba in psychology , an ma and phd in behavioural psychology
' under the heading , she said she was a member of bcap and , under the awards heading , stated that , in may 1997 , she had been awarded a ladyship from university of warwick for services to the community
' but mr reed said that said sims appeared to have ' more psychiatric qualifications than sigmund freud ' , but there were no records of her attending university
mr reed added : ' bcap does n't exist
the british psychological society and the british association of counselling and psychotherapy do exist , but neither have ever heard of her
' and the university of warwick , while conferring awards , never confer titles such as ' ladyship '
' in her cv , she also claimed to have worked as a lead consultant director for a company called eis
there are no records of her ever working for eis
' mr reed told the court that sims obtained a mortgage on her property after telling halifax she was earning between Â£ 80,000 and Â£ 150,000
in fact , at the time , she was jobless
sims was found guilty of four counts of fraud and will be sentenced next month .
