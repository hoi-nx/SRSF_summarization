adorning a large section of a wall in the gym beneath twickenham âs west stand is a picture of the england team smiling for the cameras and showing off the triple crown
it was taken last year and the expressions worn by captain robshaw and his colleagues convey a genuine sense of pride
that silver shield has eluded the national team this year , following defeat in dublin , but it is not the precious metal they covet anyway
on head coach stuart lancaster âs watch , the trophy cabinet has been kept stocked
in the course of three years , in addition to the triple crown , england have lifted the calcutta cup ( annually ) , the millennium trophy , the cook cup and the hillary shield
the latter prize , for beating new zealand in december , 2012 , was received with special relish
luther burrell sets off on a run during training as england prepare to face france but what the coaches and players really crave is a cup that conveys meaningful achievement , and at last that is within their grasp
robshaw summed up the mood : â as a player you want to be picking up silverware
we 've collected the odd bit here and there , but to pick up the main trophy would be great
â the â main trophy â , newly commissioned , for winning the six nations is england âs for the taking
success would also end a generation of under - achievement
it is staggering that the world âs wealthiest rugby country has had so little to show for so much effort and investment in the modern era
england won three of the first four six nations titles ( 2000 , 2001 , 2003 ) but since then have finished top just once in 11 seasons
so near , but so far has been the story of many english campaigns , not least under the current regime
three times lancaster âs men have finished runners - up , with four wins out of five
wales ( twice ) , and france have derailed the sweet chariot on its route to a grand slam
everyone in the red rose camp has grown weary of the perennial talk about the need for â tangible â reward , to use lock geoff parling âs apt phrase
defeat by ireland shattered the latest quest for a clean sweep to propel the host nation into their world cup , but england are still in prime position in terms of the three - way title tussle
this year , four wins from five should be sufficient to clinch the trophy , which will be at twickenham in anticipation of a coronation at about 7pm
there is a replica at murrayfield , just in case ireland run amok and beat scotland with room to spare and leave england chasing a points - difference tally that proves beyond them
meanwhile , in rome , wales will expect to benefit from the enforced absence of italy captain sergio parisse but they would require french and scottish resistance on an epic scale to take the title
the made - for - tv staggered schedule affords lancaster âs side the luxury of a precise target but that could be a blessing or a curse
being aware of the bigger picture could be a distraction for some england players , hence the coaches â desire to burden only a select few with the main decision - making responsibilities
it will be up to robshaw and his half - backs , ben youngs and george ford , to set a patient tone once what is needed has been explained to the whole squad before their pre-match warm - up
the remarkable maturity of england no 10 ford , at just 22 , should be a telling asset on a day when the challenge is equal parts mental and physical
england 's players look on in disbelief as ireland clinch the 2014 six nations title by beating france george ford has shown a huge amount of maturity for some one who is just 22 philippe saint-andre âs france team do not boast glorious form , far from it , despite the emphatic 29 - 0 victory over italy in rome last weekend
crucially , that game took place 24 hours after england beat scotland and since then france have had to fly home , patch themselves up and catch the eurostar to london , while also dealing with the distraction of a club v country row over fly - half camille lopez
what the visitors will bring is physical presence
the french are massive but this english pack has dealt with all - comers in recent times , and the graduated return of courtney lawes and parling in the second row should add dynamism and line - out nous to the mix. nick easter could have a big role to play coming off the bench for england courtney lawes should add dynamism to england 's back row behind the packs , england are more settled and threatening
jonathan joseph âs match - up with gael fickou will be intriguing , but only if the french threequarters are let off the leash
ford can make holes in the gallic defence but england can not afford to be as wasteful as they were in beating scotland
replacements could also have a big say and england will look to the likes of tom youngs and nick easter to generate momentum , tom wood to provide physicality and leadership , and richard wigglesworth to make an impact with his astute kicking game
whether or not danny cipriani and billy twelvetrees play a part in a points chase , time will tell
amid the maelstrom , the primary demand from lancaster will be for cool english heads
robshaw should have plenty of leadership support , from parling and a raft of club captains in the ranks : joe marler and dylan hartley , james haskell and ben youngs
there may be several rookies in white , but there are also enough established players
together , they can ensure that the plot is not lost and that the â main trophy â is won .
