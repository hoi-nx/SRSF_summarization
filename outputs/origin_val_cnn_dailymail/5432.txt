now the health service is facing scores of claims relating to savile , after almost Â£ 60,000 was paid out in relation to the first three cases of people abused by the former dj. the department of health insists changes have been made to change the culture in the health service to encourage staff and patients to speak up and be listened to
the nhs is one of several public sector institutions rocked by revelations about savile 's reign of terror on wards across the country
a damning report ordered by health secretary jeremy hunt last month revealed the tv and radio personality was given unfettered access to the nhs where he raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals
the catalogue of abuse has raised serious questions about the nhs 's failure to protect patients , especially children , from the paedophile
kate lampard , who carried out a review into the way the nhs handles abuse claims , warned that ' most nhs organisations still do not have adequately explicit and robust processes for managing their relationships with celebrities , important visitors , fundraisers and donors '
the savile reports were dismissed as a ' cover up ' by victims after nhs chiefs were cleared of any wrongdoing
details of litigation claims obtained by mailonline reveal the scale of abuse carried out by nhs staff over several years
from 1996 to 2014 , there were a total of 407 claims of clinical staff abusing patients in the nhs
the nhs litigation authority paid out a total of Â£ 11.6million , which included Â£ 5.3million in damages and Â£ 4.2million in claimants ' costs
a further Â£ 2million was spent on defence costs
the number of claims varied markedly from year to year , from just a handful in the late 1990s , to 60 claims in 2001 - 02 , of which 19 were successful
from 2000 to 2014 , a total of 61 claims have been made about abuse carried out in the nhs by non-clinical staff
health secretary jeremy hunt has said the nhs litigation authority will pay compensation to victims of savile after the Â£ 2.9million in the disgraced star 's estate have run out more than half â some 37 â were submitted in 2013 - 14 , which reflects the impact of the so - called ' savile effect ' of people coming forward in the wake of revelations about his abuse which emerged in late 2012
one claim from 2013 - 14 was unsuccessful and the other 36 were classed as still open
in the 14 years covered , just Â£ 80,681 was paid out in damages for abuse by non-clinical staff , while Â£ 101,252 was spent defending claims
however , the department of health has revealed that the first payments have now been made to victims of savile
liz dux , from lawyers slater and gordon , is representing around 50 people making claims of abuse against the nhs the disgraced star died in 2011 , and his estate â estimated to be worth Â£ 2.9million â was liable for claims by the victims of his abuse
ministers said that if the funds do not cover all valid claims , then the nhs litigation authority would step in
the department of health said that so far Â£ 58,625 has been paid out to three claimants , including Â£ 18,125 in compensation and Â£ 40,500 costs
the payments were made in december 2014
lawyers acting for abuse victims expect more to follow , and accuse the nhs of being slow to react
liz dux , from lawyers slater and gordon , is representing around 50 people making claims of abuse against the nhs
' we have seen a big rise in cases against medical practitioners particularly locum gps , she said ' ' people who are abused sexually by doctors a lot of the time come out thinking , did that happen ? ' doctors or medical practitioners who sexually abuse are often quite clever about it
people come out thinking was that supposed to happen
they want to have faith in the doctor they are going to
' people are questioning much more what they had concerns about all along but not voiced them at the time
' she added : ' the department of health has been incredibly slow on savile which is causing people a lot of concern because they just want to put it behind them
' alison millar , from law firm leigh day , is representing some victims of savile but several others who have suffered abuse in the nhs more recently
' these claims do go on and sadly it is not just an historic problem , to do with savile
' when you talk about the savile effect , generally what you mean is people who have been living with the effects of abuse for many years
' what we are seeing in addition to people who were abused in childhood and are coming forward , now we are seeing claims coming forward in relation to the nhs and a number of cases involving children at schools with special educational needs
she suggested people were now more willing to speak out : ' there is a climate in which ill - treatment which in a rather british way we would have looked the other war and not done anything about it people are now ready to come forward
' a damning report ordered by health secretary jeremy hunt last month revealed how savile was given unfettered access to the nhs where he raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals the department of health stressed that extensive changes have been made in safeguarding patients over the past quarter of a century , including criminal records checks and key agencies working together better to safeguard children , young people and adults
health secretary jeremy hunt has accepted 13 recommendations from kate lampard 's report
all health trusts are to review their current practice in three months and report back on their progress
a department of health spokesman said : ' we have a responsibility to make sure that patients are safe
' all trusts have been asked to review their safeguarding practices and will report back with action plans for any improvement needed against kate lampard 's recommendations
' importantly we are also working to encourage a culture within the nhs where staff and patients feel supported to speak up , to challenge and be listened to
