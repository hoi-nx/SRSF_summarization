chaplow 's deep corner was nodded towards goal by berra and the league 's leading marksman was on hand to cleverly poke the ball home off the inside of the post
daryl murphy almost grabbed his second when he took advantage of dithering from liam moore and button to take the ball away from the brentford goalkeeper - but he could only find the side - netting from a near - impossible angle
the home side were on top with parr narrowly missing the far post with a fierce cross-cum - shot while , at the other end , ipswich keeper gerken did well to hold alex pritchard 's curling effort from the edge of the area
however , brentford were level when gerken did brilliantly to parry stuart dallas ' volley but jonathan douglas was on hand to head home the rebound

ipswich almost grabbed the lead just before the interval when a great breakaway saw chaplow 's shot well saved by button , before judge made a brave sliding block to deny parr the rebound
the home side should have been ahead less than a minute after the restart when parr broke into the box and perfectly crossed for daryl murphy who somehow slid the ball over the bar - and the gaping empty net - from five yards out

button remained the busier of the two keepers and he had to be alert to dive across his goal to save from tyrone mings
back came brentford with alex pritchard 's free - kick well held by gerken before daryl murphy missed another gilt - edged chance on 65 minutes when the striker raced clear but was denied by a brilliant save from the onrushing button
ipswich continued to create the better chances as the second half progressed , with daryl murphy 's shot at button lacking power and then sub chris wood heading wide under pressure
eight minutes before the end , teddy bishop tricked his way through the defence but his low left foot shot was brilliantly saved by man of the match button
