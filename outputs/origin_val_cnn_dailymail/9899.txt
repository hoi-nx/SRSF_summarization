seven days on from their grand slam - ruining wobble in cardiff , this was transmission impressively resumed by schmidt âs ireland
the proud performance was nât without imperfection but their way more direct , full of running approach was enough for them to surpass the points target set by wales earlier in the afternoon
then it was all eyes on england before the result at twickenham brought confirmation that schmidt âs side could party like it was 1949 all over again â the last time the country won back - to - back championships

with just four tries scored this term , this tricky away assignment had become even trickier in the hours before kick - off , as wales â runaway win in rome meant ireland required a 21 - point win to reclaim the top spot which they had initially lost to england last weekend with defeat at the millennium stadium
that would have considerably heightened the pressure to deliver but they were largely unfazed , throwing off the shackles and looking a side emboldened by finesse and hungry for scores
meddling scotland initially refused to go along with ireland âs best intentions
they may have offered up a dozen turnovers and bled on the penalty count by a rate of 12 to six , but they were still combative to a degree despite getting held scoreless in a second half where ireland dominated territory
they came close , mind , rallying well during cross â sin - binning and knocking on just metres short
even then they sent irish hearts a flutter , believing they had scored in the corner with only minutes left only for the tmo review to prove jamie heaslip had excellently shunted the ball from hogg âs hands before he grounded
it was superb scrambling , an appetite which epitomised ireland âs attitude in comprehensively winning an entertaining battle played out on a fast track vastly superior to the state of previous pitches laid at murrayfield stadium
ireland players celebrate at the end of the match at murrayfield stadium before later being crowned six nations champions scotland 's russell is tackled by ireland 's conor murray and rory best during their six nations rugby match at murrayfield stadium ireland rectified many of the issues that had affected them last weekend , buoyancy greatly helped by a tonic start
referee jerome garces turned a blind eye to a scrum collapse , telling conor murray to play the ball
he did , sexton looping with payne before sending tommy bowe haring through the gap , a linebreak that eventually resulted in oâconnell going over off the side of a rob kearney ruck
sexton added the conversion and a 10th minute penalty before scotland finally found their legs and a series of errors led to a laidlaw penalty riposte before the momentum swing was pierced by penalty - winning breakdown foraging by rory best
with fitzgerald , shining in his first start in four years , linking well with rob kearney , ireland pounced for their second try on 24 minutes after well - worked set - piece
rory best threw to the rear , devin toner gathered and his slick transfer before landing resulted in oâbrien stepping dougie fife to score
sexton converted for a 14 - point lead , just seven short of the all important wales target , but there was quickly a painful reminder that there was still much work to do to even win this game first
o'brien of ireland goes over to score the second try during the six nations match between scotland and ireland at murrayfield stadium rob kearney failed to deal with a grubber kick send his way and the spilled possession led to a three - on - one overlap numerous phases later where robbie henshaw could nât prevent russell nabbing the try converted by laidlaw
it was another example of ireland getting exposed on their righthand side off quick ruck ball , as france and wales scored this way and england nearly did so too in the final minute in dublin
they now needed to better mind themselves and a scrum collapse allowed sexton to grab the 20 - 10 advantage they took with them to the break
the out - half added another five minutes after the resumption and then ushered in payne under the posts on 50 minutes after another metre - eating maul had eaten away at the scottish defence
sexton added the extras , 20 points was now the margin and ireland were now level with wales â points difference but on tries scored

scotland 's gray wins line out ball during the six nations rugby match between scotland and ireland at murrayfield stadium in edinburgh ireland 's o'brien and devin toner get away from scotland 's gray during the 2015 six nations match at the murrayfield stadium ireland 's o'brien scores a try during the 2015 six nations match at murrayfield stadium despite their growing dominance , it was nât until the 62 minute that they managed the score that put them top of the pile
sexton inexplicably hit an upright with a close - in ruck penalty , a shocking aberration which indicated the high stakes involved
he then missed another , kicking wide to the right from the 10 - metre line after cross was yellow carded
however , with uncontested scrums now required during the replacement prop âs absence , fitzgerald probed off a set - piece to offer sexton another glimpse of the target and he was third time lucky
he then signed off with cramp after the kick - and - chase that closed down greig tonks to win the lineout that engineered oâbrien âs 72nd minute try , the back row demonstrating great agility to stretch out beyond alasdair dickinson and ground
hogg âs near - miss followed , as did a penalty miss from ian madigan , before all eyes switched to england .
