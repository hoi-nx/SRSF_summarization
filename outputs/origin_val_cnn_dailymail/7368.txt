scientists are listening in on earthquakes to create stunning marble - like simulations of earth 's interior
by recording seismic tremors , researchers are able to build a 3d picture of earth 's mantle - the layer between the crust and outer core
they do this by analysing the speed of the tremors , which travel rapidly through solid rock and slowly through molten magma
computer simulations use the speed of seismic waves from earthquakes to reveal the existence of subterranean structures
in this view of the mantle below the pacific ocean , slower waves are shown in red and orange while faster waves are shown in green and blue the princeton university team fed data from seismograms into a computer model , which then simulated each wave as it moves out from the epicenter
the resulting " synthetic seismograms " were compared to real seismograms , and the differences fed back into the model to improve it
the researchers do this repeatedly , comparing data with simulations and extracting differences
with each pass , they improve their model
in these images , slower waves are in red and orange , while faster vibrations are in green and blue
the 3d models were created by princeton university 's professor tromp who is aiming to create a map of the entire mantle - down to a depth of 1,865 miles ( 3,000km ) - by the end of the year
his team have been using the number - crunching capabilities of the titan computer at the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee , which can handle 20 quadrillion calculations per second
professor tromp has so far looked at seismic waves from 3,000 quakes of magnitude 5.5 and greater , which were recorded at thousands of seismographic stations worldwide
these stations make recordings , or seismograms , that detail the movement produced by seismic waves , which typically travel at speeds of several miles per second and last several minutes
' we are specifically interested in the structure of mantle upwellings and plumes , ' said professor tromp , ' but much of it will be investigating the images for unusual features
' the resulting map could reveal the precise locations of tectonic plates , which can cause earthquakes when they move against each other
the images were created by princeton university 's professor tromp who is aiming to create a 3d map of the entire mantle , down to a depth of 1,865 miles ( 3,000km ) , by the end of the year a three - dimensional image showing contours of locations where seismic wave speeds are faster than average the maps could also reveal the locations of magma that , if it comes to the surface , causes volcanic activity , the researchers said
previous research on this has only used three types of seismic waves : primary or compressional waves , secondary or shear waves , and surface waves
professor tromp technique uses both waves that travel from the quake epicentre to the detector as well as those that travel from the detector to the quake â described as adjoint waves
the titan computer simulates each wave as it propagates from the epicenter , and the resulting data is compared to real seismograms
the differences are then used by titan to improve its model
professor tromp said : ' you do n't know what it is you are looking for â¦ that is the wonderful part of this project - waiting to see what we will discover
' this map shows relative variations in seismic shear wave speed at a depth of 241 miles ( 389 km )
blue colours denote faster than average wave speeds , and red colors denote slower than average wave speeds the two panels on the right show a 746 miles ( 1,200 km ) deep slice of the earth taken from points b to b in europe as shown in the left panel
a computer program designed by tromp and his team compares real earthquake data to a computer - generated model , then uses any discrepancies to improve the model
