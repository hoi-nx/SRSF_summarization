as gareth bale guided a shot past israel goalkeeper ofir marciano in the 77th minute on saturday evening , wales fans could be forgiven for getting a little carried away
not only with their side 's impressive victory - a 3 - 0 win over the group b leaders away from home - but with the continuing brilliance of their two - goal talisman
gareth bale 's double in haifa and assist for ramsey sent coleman 's men top of their euro 2016 qualifying group to give supporters hope of a first appearance at a major finals since 1958
gareth bale celebrates scoring his first goal of the game during wales ' 3 - 0 victory against israel on saturday but as well as strengthening wales ' chances of a trip to france next summer , gareth bale 's performance served to further enhance his reputation as a dragons legend in the making
after months of criticism in spain , the real madrid forward reminded everyone of his ability with a clever header to set up ramsey , stunning free - kick to make it 2 - 0 and powerful finish to kill israel off
still only 25 , gareth bale already has more goals ( 16 ) than wales greats john charles ( 15 ) and ryan giggs ( 12 )
and with a place at the european championships at stake , the former tottenham man has the perfect opportunity to surpass both in the hearts of fans , too
ryan giggs celebrates during his playing days with wales team - mates having scored for his country wales legend john charles , firing in a header , helped guide wales to the 1958 world cup quarter - finals the wales talisman gets ready to sign a shirt for a fan during a training session with children in haifa john charles 38 caps ( 1950 â 65 ) , 15 goals world cup quarter - finals 1958 clubs : leeds united , juventus , roma , cardiff , hereford united , merthyr tydfil major honours : serie a ( juventus ) 1958 , 1960 , 1961 and coppa italia 1959 , 1960 ryan giggs 64 caps ( 1991 - 2007 ) , 12 goals club : manchester united ( 1990 - 2014 ) major honours : 13 premier league titles , 4 fa cups , 2 champions leagues , 3 league cups , 1 fifa club world cup , 1 uefa super cup gareth bale 49 caps ( 2006 - pres ) , 16 goals clubs : southampton , tottenham , real madrid major honours : champions league , copa del rey , fifa club world cup , uefa super cup ( all 2014 ) it was john charles who led wales to the world cup in sweden 57 years ago , giving the country an all - too - rare chance to test themselves against the best teams on the planet
they reached the quarter - finals on that occasion , losing narrowly to eventual winners brazil as pele grabbed the only goal of the game
john charles , who scored in a group stage draw with hungary , missed out on the last - eight clash after being injured against the same opponents in a play - off
gareth bale plays football with a group of children from arab and jewish communities in a training session in haifa gareth bale fires homes with a brilliant free - kick as wales won 3 - 0 in israel in the euro 2016 group b qualifier but such was his influence on the team that wales manager jim murphy remarked : ' with john charles in the side we might have won '
it was a view backed up by john charles ' former international team - mate terry medwin in an interview last year
he told bbc sport : ' had he ( john charles ) been fit enough to play , i 'm not saying we would have won , but he was such a great player
' similarly , it would be hard to imagine where wales might be without the injection of quality which gareth bale brings
former manchester united favourites ryan giggs ( right ) and david beckham ( left ) vie for possession gareth bale ( centre ) leads the celebrations after his second - half free kick put wales 2 - 0 up against rivals israel john charles won 38 caps for wales from 1950 - 1965 , helping them win the 1960 british home championship would they have beaten israel without him in the team ? possibly , but there 's no chance it would have been as comfortable a victory as we witnessed on saturday night
ryan giggs can also claim to be among wales ' finest players , having pulled on the famous red shirt on 64 occasions during his distinguished club career with manchester united
but he could never quite replicate john charles and drag his country to a major tournament
ryan giggs , in action for wales versus italy , never managed to qualify for a major tournament with his national side real madrid forward gareth bale celebrates with the 2014 champions league trophy next to luka modric john charles ( centre ) rises highest to out - jump england defenders during a world cup qualifier in cardiff in 1953 wales would have made it to the 1994 world cup had they beaten romania in their final qualifier in november , 1993 , but they lost 2 - 1 at adams park
and a decade later they missed out on a place at euro 2004 after losing 1 - 0 to russia in a two - legged play - off
speaking after watching his side go top of their group on saturday , wales boss coleman said : ' we nearly did it in 1994 and 2004 and now we have the opportunity to go a step further
' people say it 's a golden generation but we need to earn it
we 're doing it but we 've not done it yet
' we want the chance to prove since 1958 this team is as good as anything that 's gone before
' fire wales to euro 2016 and gareth bale may well be regarded as the greatest welsh player of all time
