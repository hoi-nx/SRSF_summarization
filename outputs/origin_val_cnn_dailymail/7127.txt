there is always a risk when buying clothes online - sometimes the fabric feels cheap , or the colour just does n't seem to match how it appeared on screen
or the fit could be far less flattering in real life than online - as one woman has just discovered
the china shopper bought a risquÃ© black dress - which featured a full length sheer panel - from ecommerce site taobao
online shopping fail ! a woman in china has been left disgruntled after the daring dress she bought online fell short of her expectations the gown , a copy of one worn by thor actress jaime alexander at the film 's premiere in 2013 , features features top - to - bottom see - through panels on the front and back of the dress , which mean concealing the wearer 's modesty is something of a challenge
while the customer was hoping to emulate the daring look shown online , the real deal turned out to be less glamorous than she hoped
from sexy to x-rated : the cut - out dress , purchased from ecommerce site taobao , revealed a lot more than the customer expected fully exposed : the full - length sheer panels show off plenty of skin front and back the unsatisfied shopper posted comparison pictures on the seller 's page , showing how the dress revealed far more than she intended
stretched across a less petite figure , the sheer panel shows off a lot more skin and covers less of her intimate regions , turning what was a daring look into a rather more x-rated one
the shopper 's pink slippers do little to help the sartorial situation as they stuck out obviously from underneath her dress , giving her a humorous look
couture copy : the dress is a copy of one worn by thor actress jaimie alexander at the film 's 2013 premiere jaimie alexander made headlines when she walked the red carpet in the designer version of the dress 18 months ago
the actress raised eyebrows as she risked wardrobe malfunctions in every direction , with her daring dress skirting dangerously close to her nipples , bikini line and bottom
however , her washboard stomach and statuesque figure did go some way in helping to pull off the shocking look
this is n't the first time though that disgruntled online shoppers have been let down
earlier this year many women took to the internet to lament the fact that the dresses they had ordered looked nothing like the pictures they had been shown
most of those duped were brides looking for an alternative to buying their wedding dress from an expensive bridal store
many websites offer cheap copies of designer gowns , made in the far east - but instead of using lace from chantilly , what arrives is polyester from china
