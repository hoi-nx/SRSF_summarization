a lawyer for a notorious dartmouth college fraternity accused of branding new members on their body compared it to a form of self - expression like piercing or tattooing
alpha delta - depicted in the 1978 film animal house - was suspended in october for various incidents including hazing , serving alcohol to minors and hosting unregistered parties
officials are now extending that punishment over new allegations that members were burned last fall , with one student reportedly having the skin on his buttocks seared
they are also considering closing the 46 - year - old club for good depending on the outcome of discussions
a pledge of alpha delta ( above ) reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014 attorney george ostler confirmed a small number of fraternity members voluntarily chose to get body brands , but the practice was never a condition of membership
he says no hazing occurred , no one was injured and members are cooperating fully with the college
news of the branding incident emerged this week via the website gawker
a sophomore pledge of alpha delta reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014 , according to a tipster
by agreeing to the branding , the pledge would theoretically be allowed to avoid ' more drinking - intensive pledge activities '
when the pledge went home for winter break , he realized something was wrong with his brand and went to the doctor , gawker reported
the fraternity at the hanover , new hampshire , school was famously depicted in the 1978 film animal house dartmouth college 's sitting president philip hanlon ( above ) - class of 1977 - is a member of the alpha delta fraternity he had to be hospitalized after it was determined the brand was infected
medical personnel alerted the college , which is in hanover , new hampshire , and the school handed down a suspension
this is not the first time alpha delta has been linked to branding
a 1992 rolling stone article reported that ' a few pledges were reportedly branded against their will this year '
alpha delta brothers did not deny that allegation at the time
the pledge whose brand became infected is now a brother in the fraternity
earlier this year , dartmouth college president philip hanlon - who was a member of alpha delta in the 1970s - announced a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were ' hijacking ' dartmouth college 's future that included high - risk drinking , sexual assault and a lack of inclusiveness on campus
the college is banning hard liquor on campus , ending pledge or probationary periods for all student groups to reduce hazing , developing a mandatory sexual violence prevention program and creating new residential communities
alpha delta was initially founded by members of the gamma sigma society but dissociated from its parent corporation and renamed itself the alpha delta fraternity in 1969 .
