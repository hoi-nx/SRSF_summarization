at a quick glance they could pass for identical twins
so it is no wonder retired priest neil richardson was greeted with waves and ' hello john ' greetings when he moved to braintree , essex , 18 months ago
for residents quickly mistook him to be 74 - year - old john jemison , a former head teacher who is well - known in the town
the pair had in fact never met up until a few days ago , leaving mr neil richardson , 69 , confused as to why people constantly confused him with mr john jemison
neil richardson , 69 ( right ) , was constantly mistaken for john jemison , 74 ( left ) , when he moved to braintree , essex , 18 months ago and had no idea why - until the pair met recently and realised they are almost identical mr neil richardson , a former priest ( right ) , was greeted with waves and ' hello john ' greetings as he went about his business in the essex town
he had no idea why until realising people thought he was ex-teacher mr john jemison the pair ( above ) met by chance during a coach trip to london earlier this month and have now met up several times
they have even introduced their wives to one another and claim to have formed quite a friendship however , upon meeting , the pair quickly realised why others had mistaken them for one another â since they look almost identical
the pair , who are both grandfathers - of - four , also realised that despite being doppelgangers , they also had an awful lot in common - having both attended the same college , both becoming re teachers and enjoying singing in choirs
they also both enjoy singing , writing poetry and have a keen interest in amateur dramatics
and now they live just 150 yards from each other
mr neil richardson , who worked as an re teacher before becoming the rector of greenford magna in middlesex in 1982 , said he was originally left stunned when he moved to the small town in september 2013 and everyone appeared to recgonise him
he said : ' complete strangers were coming up to me and saying hello
' on one occasion , in the quadrant cafe , someone actually came up to my table and said : " you are john jemison , are n't you ? " ' the manager was quite sure i was john
a couple of weeks ago , i asked if i could have a word with him after he greeted me with the words , " john "
he would n't believe that i was n't john
i had to show him my driving licence
' it made me very interested to meet this man , who i thought must be rather good - looking ! ' the pair finally came face - to - face last week when they coincidentally both boarded the same coach for a friends of braintree museum visit to the magna carta exhibition at the british library
mr john jemison said : ' i did n't instantly notice our resemblance but as i boarded the bus , neil richardson greeted me with " are you john jemison ? " neil richardson married his wife in 1968 ( left ) while mr john jemison also married wife jenny in the sixties ( right ) since meeting , mr neil richardson ( left ) and mr john jemison ( right ) have realised they have an awful lot in common and have had a similar life
they both went to the same college in chelsea and both trained to be re teachers ' i was distracted with the thought : " oh dear , it 's someone else who wants me to do something
" ' my wife , however , did a double - take and we began to look forward to the opportunity to meet at the end of our journey
' it was quite spooky the day we met
' mr john jemison , who has two children - elizabeth , 50 , and john , 48 - as well as four grandchildren - megan , 25 , joanna , 23 , sarah , 21 , and bethany , 21 , said he just ' could n't believe it ' when mr neil richardson explained it all to him
he said : ' i 've really been struck by all the coincidences as we do have so much in common - yet we have never met before
' my only worry is the number of people who probably think i 've been ignoring them when they 've been saying ' hello john ' to neil richardson all this time
' mr neil richardson said they ' hit it off immediately '
he added , jokingly : ' we 're thinking of a life of crime
' if one of us stays at home and the other robs a bank then we will always have an alibi
' asked if she could tell them apart , mr neil richardson âs wife marion , 70 , said : ' i certainly can - after 47 years together you do n't make that mistake
' people have asked if me and jenny look alike - i do n't think we do but i guess we must share a similar taste in men
' i just think it is lovely that they have met like this
' as well as looking alike , the two men have lived very similar lives
they both studied at the college of st mark and st john in chelsea in the sixties , but never met
mr john jemison ( pictured with his wife jenny and granddaughters ) had no idea mr neil richardson was getting mistaken for him in their hometown until he bumped into his look - a - like during a coach trip to london mr neil richardson ( pictured left aged three , and right as a schoolboy ) said the pair have become good friends
he said : ' we realised that we agreed on almost everything , from politics , to our theological views on the church ' and they both went on to become re teachers , with mr john jemison teaching at braintree 's alec hunter and john bunyan schools , before becoming head of silver end primary school , while mr neil richardson became a priest
the pair also both married their sweethearts in the sixties , soon after meeting them , and they both enjoy singing in choirs
when they met for lunch last week , they realised they even had accounts with the same bank
mr neil richardson said : ' there was an astounding moment when we put our cards on the desk to pay and we could almost have said " snap " ! ' when we finally met we immediately felt comfortable with each other and found we had so much in common
' other people say we 're like twins
i can see the likenesses , but he 's slightly taller , and i 'm slightly fatter
' ' we had lunch together on friday and realised that we agreed on almost everything , from politics , to our theological views on the church , education and what we think about mr gove , and the fact that we both write poetry
' the men are now firm friends and have enjoyed several lunches together , introducing their wives to one another .
