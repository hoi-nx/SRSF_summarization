iditarod winner : seavey beat his 55 - year - old father to the finish line in nome , alaska , early wednesday morning with a time of eight days , 18 hours , 13 minutes and six seconds zapped by the cold : apparently the musher had frost in his beard when he pulled up to the finish line , with a windburned face to match an exhausted seavey , who also won the iditarod in 2012 and 2014 , petted and hugged his dogs after their victory
' it takes a whole team to get any of us here , ' he told reporters at a finish line ceremony , which was broadcast and live - streamed
later , he hoisted two of his dogs onto his lap and officials draped the animals with garlands of yellow flowers
' as long as you take care of the dog team ( and ) make good decisions , good things will happen
wins are a result of doing what we love , ' seavey said , adding that he tried to keep the race fun
he said he and his father , mitch seavey , who won titles in 2013 and 2004 , encouraged each other along the way
the elder seavey was in second place
coming up with the goods : in reward for his win , the married father - of - one scored a check for $ 70,000 and a brand new dodge ram truck valued at $ 40,000 team effort : the younger seavey said he and his father , mitch ( pictured above ) , who won titles in 2013 and 2004 , encouraged each other along the way pit stop : seavey tends to his lead dogs shortly after arriving at the koyuk , alaska , checkpoint during the iditarod race on monday , march 16 seavey increasingly put distance between himself and the rest of the field during the latter part of the race
he held a 25 - mile advantage early tuesday - a far cry from how he won the race last year
he was running third in the 2014 iditarod when a freak snowstorm blew the leaders out of the race , and seavey did n't know he had won the race until a cameraman broke the news to him
the winner 's purse increased this year , and the top prize was $ 19,600 more than what he pocketed for last year 's race
' i 'm pretty tired right about now - it 's been a tough race , ' he said
' the cold zaps you
the dogs , they 're very lively , but it takes a lot of effort to keep them well - fed , keep them rocking and rolling
this is a hard dog team to keep up with
' aaron burmeister was running in third place , while jessie royer and aliy zirkle were battling for fourth
jessie royer and aliy zirkle each had attempted to become the first woman to win the race since the late susan butcher won her fourth title in 1990
poor weather south of the alaska range this year forced the official start farther north to fairbanks , on the northern side of the mountains
not much snow fell south of the range , and officials said the conditions in the normally treacherous dalzell gorge were made even more dangerous by a lack of snow
that 's the location where many mushers crashed their sleds in 2014 , causing many to scratch
dinner is served : seavey makes food for his dogs - the canines burn thousands of calories a day on the race close shave : seavey looks back at aaron burmeister , whom he had just passed , as they head into the koyuk , alaska , checkpoint other comptetitors : aaron burmeister was running in third place ( pictured ) , while jessie royer and aliy zirkle were battling for fourth a new race route also was created , with much of it run on river ice
the new route allowed new communities to serve as checkpoints , including the athabascan community of huslia , famed for its sprint sled dog races
the ceremonial start in anchorage went on as planned on march 7
snow had to be trucked in so mushers could navigate paved streets , but there was little snow elsewhere in the city
the snow brought in for the race barely lasted the few hours it was needed because of temperatures nearing 40 degrees and rain
a total of 78 mushers began the race march 9 in fairbanks
eight scratched , and one was disqualified
two dogs have died in this year 's race , including one that was hit by a car after getting loose during the ceremonial start
the other dog that died was on the team of four - time champion lance mackey .
