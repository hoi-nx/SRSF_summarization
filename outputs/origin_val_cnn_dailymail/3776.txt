the mother of a man who stands accused of murdering 12 people in a movie theater gun rampage has begged prosecutors to stop pursuing the death penalty , terming their legal case a ' quest for death '
holmes , whose son james , 27 , opened fire at a busy screening of batman film the dark knight rises in aurora , colorado , also insists that she and her husband robert ' were good parents '
the holmes family claim that mental illness is to blame for the murder spree , which left 70 injured as well as the 12 fatalities
mrs holmes begged the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty in an entry in her prayer book , which she published earlier this month and is selling for $ 15
her prayer for the prosecutor reads : ' i do not know what you have been through in life
i do not know why you want to pursue execution of a mentally ill man
' but i pray for you , so that you will find peace in your life
i pray you will change your mind
please stop this quest for death so you may focus on those who are alive
' she also also gave an interview on the book to the del mar times local newspaper from her home in rancho penasquitos , california , saying that offering her son a plea deal would prevent a painful trial
' good parents ' : holmes suggested that she and her husband robert , right in the above image , had not done anything wrong she said : ' this would all come to a grinding halt if [ james ] could plead guilty , and the da would accept the plea for life without parole
' mrs holmes also defended herself and her husband from charges that they contributed to the massacre
she said : ' because so many people like to blame the parents if a child is mentally ill , we have to reaffirm to ourselves every day that we were good parents and good people , and this still happened anyway
' mrs holmes did , however , say the couple feels guilt ' that we did nât recognize he was ill and needed treatment
' on sale : holmes published a book of prayers for people involved in the murder , which sells for $ 15 according to her , the killing was completely out of character , and the first time she was aware of her son having anything to do with guns
she told the del mar times : ' our kid was quiet , compliant , obeyed all the rules
he never bothered anyone , he never harmed anyone ... we never owned a gun and he showed no interest in guns
' this is the first time mrs holmes has been interviewed since the killings in july , 2012
the couple had remained entirely silent until last december , when they wrote a letter to the denver post newspaper , insisting that their son ' is not a monster '
other parts of holmes 's book deal with her feelings at each stage of discovering her son was responsible for the massacre
in an entry from jan. 12 , 2013 called preliminary hearing memories , she wrote : ' what were you thinking , jim ? and what are you thinking now ? praying for jim in jail ; please do n't commit suicide
' you lived so that we could understand you and others could study you and learn to prevent future tragedy
' in another from march 22 , 2013 , titled memories , she again defended her son
she wrote : ' my son never harmed anyone
people think he is a monster , but he has a disease that changed his brain
... praying for good men and women engulfed in psychosis and alone with their disease
' mrs holmes writes in the book that proceeds will be donated to mental health services , not to her son or his case
but victims ' families have questioned the timing , as defense attorneys have asked a judge to move the proceedings , saying pretrial publicity has made many prospective jurors biased against holmes
' i can only think this is some kind of ploy
this is some type of strategy cooked up by the defense to try to save someone 's life , ' said tom sullivan , whose son alex was killed in the shooting
' ploy ' : the father of victim alex sullivan , pictured , described holmes 's book as a ' strategy cooked up by the defense ' holmes ' mother 's thoughts and apologies mean little to him , he said
' as far as people i think about on a daily basis , they are so far down the list it 's not worth mentioning
' neither holmes ' parents nor an attorney representing them immediately responded to requests for comment
mrs holmes said her son 's defense team had no knowledge of the book
' this book is being published to raise awareness of the immorality of the death penalty and the futility of seeking justice through execution , ' she writes
a spokeswoman for district attorney george brauchler declined to comment on the book , citing a gag order that prevents those involved in the case from talking about it
but in court filings released monday , prosecutors , arguing against a change in venue , wrote that the one thing jurors remembered most clearly so far was their sympathetic letter to the denver post .
