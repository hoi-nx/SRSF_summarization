the women 's liberation movement did n't just change the role of women in society , it also helped transform what appeared on family dinner plates
food historian dr polly russell told today 's this morning that in the fifties , only 20 per cent of women worked , leaving the majority of wives to spend their time cooking , cleaning and managing their households
but in later decades as women swelled the workforce , convenient pre-prepared sandwiches , microwaves and ready meals transformed britain 's kitchens - and its diet
housewives had to feed the family with limited rations thanks to households being rationed to one egg per week , cakes like this one , right , had to be made with dried eggs , left , while they were topped with blancmange thanks to the lack of sugar available the robshaw family try making a fifties cake with limited ingredients on bbc show ' back in time for dinner ' , ably assisted by mary berry she told presenters phillip and amanda : ' we have this idea of the fifties being a domestic ideal - mad men , glamorous - this was not the case in britain , we were still in rationing , very austere
' it meant there was only one fresh egg a week per household so housewives had to feed the family with these limited rations
' it 's not surprising housewives became fed - up in the fifties - they spent 75 hours a week doing housework
' ' they had to cope with powdered eggs and a limited amount of variety to cook with
' a new bbc series called back in time for dinner challenged a modern family to try reliving what this was like
the robshaws - father brandon , mother rochelle and children miranda , 17 , rosalind , 15 , and fred - learnt that rations certainly made birthdays less indulgent
food historian dr polly russell , pictured , took phillip and amanda on a trip down memory lane for the taste buds on today 's this morning , showing what was typically eaten from the fifties to nineties the robshaw family took on a brave culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in every decade from the fifties to the nineties
pictured , from left to right , rosalind , 15 , mum rochelle , fred , 10 , dad brandon and miranda , 17 , in the fifties episode dr russell invited amanda and phillip to try a birthday cake the family made on the show based on a fifties recipe
she explained : ' a cake had to be made with dry eggs and icing with a blancmange topping because of the lack of sugar
' after a taste test , amanda admitted it was ' dry but not inedible '
bread and dripping ( often leftover fat from the sunday roast ) was a common reality at breakfast time while fresh vegetables were often taken from community allotments
in the sixties , this morning illustrated how a typical food spread would include cheese and pineapples on cocktails sticks and corned beef
dr russell revealed how this was the decade when kitchens were transformed by technology
she said : ' in the sixties there was a real rise in disposable incomes and an increase technology in the kitchen
in the sixties , food became more colourful and decorative , as shown by the cheese and pineapple sticks served on an orange and vibrant table cloth on today 's this morning the hairy bikers ' dave myers pictured with the robshaw family as they sample the food of the sixties ' the most iconic piece is the fridge but only 50 per cent of households had one by the end of the decade , everyone else used larders
the fridge changed what you could cook
' the food historian added that food at this time became ' more about display and what it looks like as well as what it tastes like
' so along with the decorative pineapple and cheese on sticks served attached to an orange , came colourful dishes like vegetable terrines
by the seventies , 40 per cent of women were working , leading to a rise in the number of convenience foods on offer
dr russell explained : ' now women have less time for cooking so the food industry starts offering help in terms of processed , convenience foods so there are things like pot noodles available
' there 's also more branding and colourful packaging to try and persuade people to buy them
' by the seventies , with more women going out to work , food is becoming more convenient with products like angel delight , back left , and ready - made cake mixtures , back right arctic rolls and pot noodles became popular in the seventies as people spent less time cooking children of the seventies loved angel delight , chocolate , strawberry and butterscotch flavours pictured iced fingers and ready - made arctic rolls were the desserts of choice during this decade but every child 's favourite sweet treat was angel delight
the product was purchased as a powder so could be whipped up in seconds by time - strapped working mothers
such convenience foods became even more popular in the eighties as the number of women working increased again
' there was a more disposable income and less time so the ready - meal industry steps up and we get the microwave , ' dr russell explained
in the eighties , the invention of the microwave led to a rise in ready - meals while pre-packed sandwiches , bottom right , appeared on shelves for the first time as workers wanted to grab lunch and go the robshaw family , pictured in their 1980s - style kitchen which was all about convenience , with gadgets aplenty helping them to make meals she added that the pre-packed sandwich we take for granted today only came in to fruition in 1981 ' marking our changing relationship with time and leisure ' as people would rather grab lunch and go than do a home - made packed lunch
the first flavours for pre-packed sandwiches included cheese and pickle and tinned salmon and tomato
following the rise of convenience foods came concerns for health in the nineties
but dr russell admits this was a contradictory time , when the nation had a ' schizophrenic relationship with food '
while families tried to be healthier by opting for organic foods and aiming for their ' five - a - day ' they were also bombarded with high sugar , processed foods like pop tarts and mr kipling snack cakes
in the nineties , people became more health conscious opting for salad and organic foods but at the same time , high sugar , processed foods like pop tarts were introduced ' back in time for dinner ' is on bbc2 tuesdays at 8pm
