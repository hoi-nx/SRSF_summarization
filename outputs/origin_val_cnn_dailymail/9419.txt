scholes has once again defended former man united team - mate evans following his spitting incident with newcastle 's cisse
the former england midfielder believes evans spat towards the floor in a ' reflex action ' after the senegal striker kicked out at him during wednesday night 's match at st james ' park
both players have been charged with spitting by the fa accepted the charge and will serve a seven - match ban , while evans has until 6pm on friday to respond
evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored newcastle striker evans 's former man united team - mate scholes has defended the player scholes also defended evans will working as a pundit on the match for bt sport on wednesday having leapt to the defence of evans while working as a pundit during bt sport 's coverage of the match , scholes has again backed the northern ireland defender
scholes writes in his independent column : ' i have watched the footage of evans and cisse 's spitting incident and i come to the same conclusion that was my instinct the first time i saw the replay : i do n't think evans ever intended to spit at fa
' as evans gets up and takes a step backwards , he spits
at the time his eyes are fixed on cisse ... and that is what makes it look bad
but my instinct is that evans is spitting to the floor
' it is a reflex
footballers , athletes in all sorts of sports , have a tendency to spit in the periods of respite after action
you can do it without even thinking
' i know that i did , as a player
on this occasion , i believes it was a reflex action from evans
not one aimed at cisse
' evans could face a ban of six matches if found guilty by the fa
cisse subsequently retaliates , and appears to aim spit of his own back at the man united man evans ( left ) and cisse clash near the half - way line at st james ' park following the unpleasant exchange everton ( a ) , march 15 arsenal ( h ) , march 21 sunderland ( a ) , april 5 liverpool ( a ) , april 13 spurs ( h ) , april 19 swansea ( h ) , april 25 leicester ( a ) , may 2 both cisse and evans released statements on thursday in which they disagreed on the intent behind the disgusting scenes
bizarrely , evans claimed he was shocked by the allegations and protested his innocence
cisse responded by apologising but said he was provoked when evans spat at him
indeed , sportsmail understands that cisse is furious that the northern ireland international has not admitted his guilt , and is adamant the defender spat at his leg
and cisse will inform fa disciplinary chiefs that evans intentionally spat at him when questioned about the incident
cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the fa on thursday this season , fa guidelines dictate that the punishment for spitting should be in line with fifa 's six game ban for the offence
cisse faces an additional one game ban because he has already been sent off for violent conduct after elbowing everton 's seamus coleman ( above ) in december
having conceded he was wrong to react by spitting in evans âs face , cisse will be fined a week âs wages of around Â£ 40,000 by newcastle , who will now be without their 11 - goal top scorer until may
fa rules were changed in the summer to bring them in line with fifa guidelines which state a player found guilty of spitting at an opponent will be suspended for six games
however , cisse has already served a three - match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing everton âs seamus coleman and as a result will be hit with an additional one - game suspension
he will not return until the final three matches of the campaign
evans , meanwhile , could miss crucial premier league fixtures against spurs , liverpool , manchester city and chelsea should he be found guilty
but the 27 - year - old will contest the charge , to which he must respond by 6pm on friday evening
the senegalese striker points the finger at man united defender evans after the ugly incident newcastle managing director lee charnley said : ' both ourselves and cisse agree that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable
' in life , when you do something wrong you have to front up , admit your mistakes and accept the punishment
cisse was proactive this morning in making a full and heartfelt apology , which he did in advance of any notification from the fa regarding this charge
' this was something he felt strongly about and we fully support him in quickly accepting the charge
' cisse is known to many of our region 's schools , community groups and junior football teams for his involvement in the work of the newcastle united foundation
' he has this evening expressed to us his strong desire to engage in additional community activities during the period of his ban
' he is particularly keen to use his position as a role model to encourage young and influential fans to engage in sport and learn lessons about the importance of fair play and personal conduct
' evans âs statement read : â having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night âs match
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at cisse
â i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor
â during the game cisse and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting
â it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do
it is certainly not something that i did last night
â tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from newcastle and man united gather on the pitch cisse was banned for an extra man after beinf sent off for elbowing everton 's seamus coleman in december the fa were waiting for referee anthony taylor 's report
as he missed the incident between evans and pappis cisse , and it was n't included in his report - the fa were within their right to retrospectively punish the pair
hull striker george boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at manchester city goalkeeper joe hart
however , the fa have issued new guidelines to move in line with new fifa guidelines meaning evans and cisse could now be banned for six games
cisse responded less than an hour later by saying : â i have apologies to make to a lot of people today
firstly to my team - mates and to our supporters , secondly to evans , and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and evans
â i reacted to something i found very unpleasant
sometimes it is hard not to react , particularly in the heat of the moment
i have always tried hard to be a positive role model , especially for our young fans , and yesterday i let you down
â i hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry
perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake , not copy it
