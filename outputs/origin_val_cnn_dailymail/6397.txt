the premier league has been the loudest opponent of the world cup in qatar switching to a winter tournament â staged from november 21 to december 18 â that will be rubber - stamped at the fifa exco meeting in zurich on friday
but the richest league in world football is not expected to kick off yet again when the dates become official this week
the premier league is resigned to that decision being a formality since the opinions of premier league chief executive richard scudamore and other european leagues chiefs were virtually ignored at the task force summit in qatar which recommended a november - december competition
the dates from the world cup in qatar are expected to be confirmed on friday in zurich qatar will host the world cup in the winter despite opposition from uefa 's big leagues instead , the premier league and their european counterparts will be concentrating on winning concessions for such a disruption to their calendar
the biggest confrontation is likely to be with their own uefa confederation over tightening the champions league programme
this not only spreads itself over a ridiculous four weeks for their last - 16 round but also forbids domestic fixtures taking place on those nights
the premier league will also be wanting talks about cutting international friendlies , fa replays and two - legged football league semi-finals in that season
but more conflict looks inevitable as the fa and football league will not want their broadcasting deals affected by losing fixtures
however , a december 18 finish would see the premier league restart on boxing day

if the beleaguered paul downton were to take any advice from hugh morris he would surely be told to do his work behind the scenes rather than at centre stage all the time
hugh morris ( left ) and paul downton ( right ) will both be at the global sporting director summit in april the football league are certainly in the right place if they were ever to be worthy of news at ten attention
having been evicted by the premier league , their new offices in london âs gray âs inn road are next door to the itv news studio in the itn building
and the complex production role of supplying content from all three lower league divisions in time for the 9pm channel five highlights show next season will be handled by itn
