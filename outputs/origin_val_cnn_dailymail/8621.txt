last year 's cheapest europe break , lisbon , dropped to eighth place this year

dining out costs as little as Â£ 23.94 for two people , while a bottle of beer is just Â£ 1.13
krakow , poland , and strasbourg , french , are two additional new entries to the list this year
proving that not all french cities must be needlessly expensive , strasbourg is noteworthy for being 35 per cent cheaper than paris
for the third consecutive year , stockholm is europe 's most expensive city with holidaymakers spending an average of Â£ 311.01 for a two - night getaway
london is the seventh most expensive city break , with costs averaging Â£ 266.65 , according to the study
while perennial favourite , paris , is a very expensive french destination , strasbourg offers good value if money is not a concern , stockholm has been named europe 's most expensive city for the third year in a row andrew brown of post office travel money said : ' it 's a win / win situation for uk holidaymakers this year in european cities because prices are down in the majority of cities we surveyed , thanks to the soaring value of sterling
' however , he does recommend that travellers do their homework before setting out , as prices do vary significantly across cities
' remember that the cost of meals and drinks will need to be added into the spending budget , as city breaks are never all - inclusive holidays , ' he explains
' over the course of a two - or three - night break , these can make a big difference to the cost of a city break and the low prices in prague , athens and budapest will make these cities strong contenders for a bargain break rival to the baltic states
