the progress liverpool have made since that defeat at old trafford in december has been nothing short of remarkable
they remain the only unbeaten team in the premier league this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal
clearly , it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager rodgers
not least in the way he tore up his own blueprint for life without suarez and came up with an entirely new strategy that has worked for the players who remain at anfield
that is no easy task , as roberto martinez and louis van gaal would probably testify

should they beat swansea on monday then they will be just two points off fourth place

yes , there is no doubt the decision to move emre can into a back three - when he was signed principally as a midfielder â was quite brilliant
can has been superb in the role alongside martin skrtel and mamadou sakho , who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence
the decision to drop simon mignolet earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by rodgers
how a player responds is of the utmost importance and liverpool âs goalkeeper , much like we saw with joe hart at manchester city , has returned with greater focus and determination
against swansea he made some marvellous saves , in particular to deny gomis and gylfi sigurdsson
that said , liverpool âs defence also demonstrated against swansea that they remain prone to the occasional mistake
there was a moment at the liberty stadium , which led to the mignolet save to deny gomis , when a neat exchange of passes between swansea âs french striker and wayne routledge left a gaping hole in liverpool âs back three
in the press box we do not have the benefit of jamie carragher and gary neville âs tactical analysis but i can imagine one of them might have highlighted that on their super-duper tactics board at half - time
this is where liverpool have also been riding their luck a little ; a luxury teams sometimes enjoy when they have a bit of momentum and something that was illustrated further by the nature of henderson âs winning goal
henderson ( right ) scored liveprool 's winning goal after a lucky deflection but football teams often make their own luck and the truth is their success in defending their own goal in recent weeks goes way beyond good organisation and some fine individual performances
it points to the fact that liverpool , having started the season so poorly , are working doubly hard to get back into contention for the champions league places
they are defending as a team , with players tracking back tirelessly from midfield to rescue their colleagues when mistakes are made
neil taylor tested can on swansea âs left flank but it was henderson who was there to make one important interception , even if the challenge was a little over-zealous and earned the england midfielder the first yellow card of the night
when gomis burst past martin skrtel later in the game , it was joe allen who was there to cut out the shot
desire and determination are important qualities at this stage of the season and rodgers declared his side âs ambition to finish second again this season in the knowledge that these players want it every bit as much as he does

yes , martin skrtel is proving himself a leader in the liverpool defence
against swansea he was outstanding , even producing the initial pass that led to henderson âs goal
and yes , mamadou sakho and can are now playing to the level we have long come to expect of liverpool defenders
but they are working as a team , and playing with more composure after rodgers realised the more cavalier approach they employed when suarez and sturridge were terrorising defenders just was nât working this season
the statistics make interesting reading
only five premier league goals conceded in 10 games in 2015 compared to 25 in the 19 they had played before the turn of the year
but it âs as much down to hard graft as the intelligence of rodgers
and while the deployment of gerrard as a holding midfielder , and with it a slight change to a diamond formation , gave henderson the freedom to get further forward last night , it was the mere fact that henderson was fit enough and determined enough to make that run in pursuit of sturridge âs flick - on that earned liverpool their goal
seriously motivated , liverpool are on the move again .
