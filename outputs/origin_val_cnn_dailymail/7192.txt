shadow health secretary andy burnham has demanded full details of the reports be published , after they were leaked to the the mail on sunday nhs bosses have been accused of covering up plans to close a&e units and cut hospital beds â after paying Â£ 10million for reports they are now refusing to publish
they have paid management consultants including kpmg a total of Â£ 10,282,593 for advice on â improving long - term affordability â across 11 regions that cover 13million people
the the mail on sunday has seen a leaked copy of one of the secret reports , recommending the closure of all emergency services at one hospital and the removal of potentially hundreds of beds , sparking fears of plans for widespread cuts in other areas
such concerns are stoked by an official , watered - down summary of the project , which mentions the need for â tough decisions â to balance the books in the 11 â challenged â areas , where budgets are being overspent
using business jargon , it speaks of â service reconfiguration â â which critics say is code for cuts â and â rationalising the [ nhs ] estate â , or selling off hospital buildings and land
but nowhere in the making local health economies work better for patients paper , partly commissioned by nhs england , are any details spelled out
shadow health secretary andy burnham last night demanded the full details be published before the election , saying : â the public , who have paid for these reports , have a right to see them before they go to vote
health secretary jeremy hunt likes to lecture the nhs about transparency , but it is clear he does nât put his money where his mouth is
he must make immediate arrangements to publish all of these reports or people will conclude he âs a hypocrite
â kpmg , whose advisers include former nhs chief executive sir david nicholson , was paid to produce two of the 11 reports last year
the the mail on sunday has seen the one covering staffordshire , which was leaked to a labour mp
it said nhs managers should â investigate the feasibility â of stripping stafford hospital of all its emergency services â including the a&e department â and turning it into â an elective and rehabilitation centre â
kpmg also recommended closing hospital beds there and in stoke , tamworth and burton to plug a potential Â£ 217million black hole
if similar suggestions have been made for the other ten areas , nhs managers will be considering plans to close numerous a&es and potentially thousands of hospital beds
however , nhs england has refused to publish the 11 reports , despite admitting there is â in general a strong public interest in information being made as freely available as possible â
a leaked copy of one of 11 secret reports recommended the closure of all emergency services at one hospital and the removal of potentially hundreds of beds instead , it has answered a freedom of information request from the mail on sunday , which has campaigned for more than two years to save casualty departments , by arguing that releasing them now would â prejudice the outcome â of work to draw up five - year plans for the areas
â for these reasons , we believe withholding the information outweighs the public interest in releasing the information
â in the same response , nhs england admitted how much it spent
stafford hospital supporter richard duffy believed it highly likely that management consultants had recommended closures elsewhere too
â that seems to be the remit they were given , â he said
despite the terrible history of stafford hospital , where hundreds are thought to have died in the 2000s due to poor care , the town has rallied to save its departments from the axe
the other ten areas are : cumbria , eastern cheshire , leicestershire , northamptonshire , cambridge & peterborough , mid essex , north-east london , south-west london , east sussex , and devon
kpmg confirmed it worked on two reports
a spokeswoman added : â any further enquiries on the recommendations should be directed to the client
