a woman shed an incredible nine stone after posting pictures of all of her meals on instagram - and getting people to rate how healthy they are
jess semmens , 22 , takes a series of pictures of what she is about to eat , posts them on her page and waits to see what her followers think of her food
it may sound like a bizarre routine but uploading hundreds of such snaps online has helped jess semmens lose nine stone and six dress sizes in two years
the positive comments were the confidence boost she needed to carry on after binge - eating and fad diets jess semmens found motivation to slim by publicly sharing details of her meals , their calorie count and her weight - loss progress
inspired by the online feedback she received - mostly from strangers - she shrank from 22st and a dress size 24 , to 13st and size 12
research unit manager jess semmens says : ' like most women , i had tried every diet under the sun but none worked for me
' i thought i was doomed to be overweight for ever but when i started counting calories on a phone app and sharing pictures of my meals i was amazed at how many comments i received
' i started documenting the change in my figure as i lost weight and it was a great way to see my progress and keep me on track whenever i felt like reaching for the biscuit tin
' if i did n't stick to the diet i was n't just letting myself down , i 'd be letting down all my followers too
jess semmens began focusing on losing weight by sharing her healthy meals when her doctor told her that she would be dead before she was 25 jess semmens began cooking meals from scratch and eventually sharing her own recipes or ingredients on instagram 22 - stone jess semmens had tried ' every diet under the sun ' but nothing had worked for her the pressure kept me motivated , as did all the lovely comments i got - and now i feel amazing
you could say that i have instagrammed myself thin
' at just seven , a gym accident left jess semmens struggling to carry on with the sport and she ballooned in size
jess semmens , of exeter , devon , says : ' i hated not being able to do my gymnastics so comfort - ate and soon started to pile on the pounds
' i then started getting bullied at school
the other children would say really nasty things to me
my school days became a nightmare
i 'd hide myself away in the toilets
' ashamed of her growing belly , from the age of ten , jess semmens began raiding stashes of food from her parents ' kitchen and hiding it to later gorge on in secret
she says : ' i 'd grab anything i could get my hands on and would hide it from my mum and dad
when i was feeling sad , i turned to the snacks for some comfort
' but the cruel playground taunts went on and jess semmens 's weight continued to climb
bullied at school , jess semmens began to hide herself away and gorge on food in secret at just the age of seven , jess semmens , from exeter , devon , had a gym accident which left her unable to continue with sports
at this point , her weight began to balloon by the time she sat her gcses in 2008 , age 15 , jess semmens was 14st and a dress size 16
a year later , in the summer of 2009 , jess semmens was given a confidence boost when she met her now ex-boyfriend
she says : ' he did n't care about my body and used to compliment me all the time
all my body hang - ups were suddenly washed away and i felt happier
' but the nights spent cuddled up on the sofa , still eating the comfort food , only served to worsen jess semmens 's weight problem
jess semmens says : ' we settled into a really unhealthy routine
i was happy because i was in love but this had such an awful effect on my health
' we spent every night slumped on the sofa
we 'd have a huge bag of crisps each and a whole tub of ice cream to ourselves
looking back , i 'm disgusted by how much we ate
' over the course of just two and half years , jess semmens ballooned to a size 24 , putting on another 7st to reach 22st
her office job meant she spent most of her day sat at her desk - and she took no exercise
she says : ' it got to the point where i was getting out of breath just from walking
when jess semmens began sharing her meals on instagram and counting calories , she began to get positive comments , which motivated her even more ' i was even afraid to go out dancing with my friends because i 'd get so hot and tired - i would be dripping with sweat before i had even walked into the club
' in 2011 , jess semmens visited her gp for a check - up and was given a devastating wake - up call - either she turned around her lifestyle or she would be dead before she was 35
shortly after , she split with her boyfriend and moved back home with her parents
she recalls : ' i wanted to lose weight and was a sucker for a fad diet
' first i tried cutting out sugar , then i tried a low - carb diet
' i tried the paleo and atkins diets but never managed to stick to anything for more than a few weeks and nothing seemed to shift the weight
' by the summer of 2012 , jess semmens was feeling helpless - but then she heard about app my fitness pal
she says : ' a friend told me about it and i thought i would give it a go
it allowed me to put in my height , weight and goal weight and it told me to eat no more than 1,600 calories a day
' the app outlined her new diet - to eat 50 per cent carbs , 30 per cent fat and 20 per cent protein - and although she stuck to the plan at first , she began to struggle to keep herself motivated
then instagram came into play
jess semmens found that looking at other people 's weight - loss journeys helped her motivate her on her own she says : ' a friend had told me about all the healthy - eating accounts on instagram , so at first i used the search function to look for ideas
it really helped to see other people 's weight - loss journeys and it made me realise i could share mine
' motivated to ditch chocolate and crisps , jess semmens started cooking instagram - inspired meals from scratch and sharing them
she received many likes from other healthy eaters and , once her cooking skills got up to scratch , began creating her own healthy recipes and sharing them
only two months later , jess semmens had lost three stone and gained hundreds of followers
she says : ' once i plucked up confidence i joined the gym when i 'd lost about 4st
this is when i started taking post-workout pictures
' i started to post almost everything i ate and uploaded post-workout photos to show my followers how much i 'd worked out
i did mostly cardio as i was too scared to use the weights
' people commented on how good i looked and it was just the confidence boost i needed to carry on
' by last december , two and a half years into her regime , jess semmens had lost a mighty nine stone
she says : ' if it was n't for instagram , i 'd still weigh 22st
you can try all the fad diets but all you need is to eat healthily and to have some encouragement
i 've never been happier
