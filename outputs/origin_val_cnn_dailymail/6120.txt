the 37 - year - old , who has three children , first met the man she knows as jr , in april 2012 through facebook as she was friends with his older brother
mel alford said she had no idea her husband jonathan was a paedophile until he was in court ms alford said she agreed to go on a date with him after he â kept sending nice messages â
she revealed : â we ended up getting engaged in august and brought the wedding forward to november that year when i found out my dad was dying from cancer
' we were together most of the time and the start of our marriage was really good
he was great with my kids and treated me like a queen
' i had no idea what he was really like until a social worker visited me and told me he was on bail for sleeping with an underage girl
' that girl had come to my children 's dad 's house and told him and he contacted social services
' ms alford said that her husband denied it and pulled up what he told her was the girl 's facebook page which had a message to him saying ' sorry i lied â
mel alford - pictured with jonathan on their wedding day - said he treated her ' like a queen ' she said : ' it turns out he had set up a fake account to send that message
' myself and the kids believed him so we just carried on
but he became so jealous after we got married and i could not answer the door in case it was a man and he would sleep outside in his car if we had a row
' in september 2013 i kicked him out
but i did n't know the allegations were true until i saw he was in court
â at exeter crown court , jonathan alford admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child , seven of making or possessing indecent images of children , three of having extreme pornography and one of perverting the course of justice
alford was also caught with child abuse and bestiality images on his computer and was jailed for seven years and three months in july last year
ms alford said she was totally unaware of his charges until he appeared in court and said struggled to believe that the man she loved and brought into her family was capable of such crimes
jonathan alford was jailed for more than seven years after he admitted admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child and other related offences ' i went along to the court and shouted and screamed on every plea
i heard all about his sickening crimes , â ms alford said
' it was so disturbing i do n't think it was really sinking in on the day
' i walked into the middle of the court and called him a â dirty bastard â
he smiled at me and i just wanted to kill him
' he had been brought into my family and been around my kids
still all i know is what i heard in court that day
i still do n't really know the full story
' i never saw him again after that
i wanted to go to his sentencing hearing but because i had kicked off at the previous hearing the police would n't let me in
' i have asked my kids if he ever tried it on with them and they have said no. but he should not have been allowed anywhere near me and my three children while he was on bail
' there should have been checks done
' ms alford said she is now awaiting her final divorce papers to come through , and has set up an unofficial website to â name and shame â offenders â which the police have told her to take down
she said : ' it has certainly made me a lot more cautious about people and i am passionate about what i am doing
' i am proud to have met so many people and victims
i am not a counsellor but they tell me their story and i try and help them
â she added : ' you have no idea who is a paedophile
i was married to one and did not know
' i hear so many stories - many of them extremely heart - breaking
i just want people to be more aware of who they are dating and allowing to be around their children
â she said : ' i carry a lot of guilt that i put my children in danger by having this man around them
i do n't think i will ever get over that
