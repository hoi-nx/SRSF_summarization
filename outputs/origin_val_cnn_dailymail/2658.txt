for just under $ 200 mothers can now get 3-d ' keepsake ultrasounds ' of their unborn children but the fda warns that they should avoid the potentially harmful scans
a consumer update revised by the fda on tuesday said that the tests should be used for medical reasons only and only be performed by licensed staff
ultrasounds are used to help doctors determine the health , size , and age of the child and can detect birth defects
' although there is a lack of evidence of any harm due to ultrasound imaging and heartbeat monitors , prudent use of these devices by trained health care providers is important , ' says shahram vaezy , ph.d. , an fda biomedical engineer in the update
' ultrasound can heat tissues slightly , and in some cases , it can also produce very small bubbles ( cavitation ) in some tissues , ' she adds
doctors do n't yet know the long term effects of these scans on the child and fear that non-medical imaging centers aimed at giving mothers photos and videos for sentimental reasons do not take the baby 's health into consideration
the fda says that at such places the fetus could be exposed to up to an hour of ultrasound technology which is longer than most doctors spend
mothers are seeking out the unnecessary medical to get renderings of their child so they can share them on social media or feel an emotional connection to their child

' these are going to go in my photo album
i get to actually see him ... so i 'm excited and everything , ' williams said
' we use the same machine as the doctor , ' owner michael horan said
' our techs spend a little more time to get a more enjoyable session out of it
