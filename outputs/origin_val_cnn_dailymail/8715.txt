an army of feral cats rules a remote island in southern japan , curling up in abandoned houses or strutting about in a fishing village that is overrun with felines outnumbering humans six to one
originally introduced to the mile - long island of aoshima to deal with mice that plagued fishermen 's boats , the cats stayed on - and multiplied
more than 120 cats swarm the island with only a handful of humans for company - mostly pensioners who did n't join the waves of migrants seeking work in the cities on mainland japan after the second world war
the only sign of human activity now is the boatload of day - trippers from the mainland , visiting what is locally known as cat island
with no restaurants , cars , shops or kiosks selling snacks , aoshima is no tourist haven
but cat lovers are not complaining
' there is a ton of cats here , then there was this sort of cat witch who came out to feed the cats which was quite fun , ' said 27 - year - old makiko yamasaki
' so i 'd want to come again
