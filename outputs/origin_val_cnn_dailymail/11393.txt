columbia university ( us ) rankings editor phil baty said over the past 5 years we have seen a fairly stable ranking for australian universities , ignoring a slight dip last year
he argued last year âs poor performance could have been partly due to the announcement of budget cuts that could have directly influenced universities research capabilities
although he claims the current deregulation debate may have boosted the country âs position in 2015
â talking about the kind of fees they could potentially charge may have raised awareness of the top australian universities , â he said
australian institutions also work closely with asian universities which he claims are less well known by european and us academics
china gained ground in the 2015 reputation rankings , with tsinghua university rising ten places to 26 and peking rising from 41 to 32 .
