a crocodile - like amphibian that was the size of a small car dominated prehistoric lakes more than 200 million years ago , a new study has found
palaeontologists discovered the fossilised remains of the ' super salamander ' while excavating on the site of an ancient lake in southern portugal
the predator , which grew to be around two metres ( 6.5 ft ) in length and lived in lakes and rivers during the late triassic period , has been named metoposaurus algarvensis
the researchers behind the discovery , which was made in mudstone flats close to loulã© , in the algarve of southern portugal , say that the new species was similar to other primitive amphibian that were widespread at the time
the rare giant salamander is thought to be one of the world 's oldest species
it first appeared on the planet around 170 million years ago but there are now just a handful of surviving populations left in the wild
the china giant salamander are now the largest living amphibians and can grow to be up to 1.8 metres ( 5.9 feet ) in length
a park ranger holds the giant china salamander found in heyuan city , guangdong province , china however , pollution of the rivers and streams where they live has put the species under threat
a park ranger in southern china recently caught a giant salamander weighing 5.5kg and measufing 83cm in length in heyuan city in southern china 's guangdong province , the first of its kind to be found in the area
after keeping it in a temporary tank , officials released the creature back into the river , watched by a crowd of fascinated tourists
they say they were probably the forerunners of modern amphibians such as frogs , newts and salamanders
dr steve brusatte , a vertebrate palaeontologist at the university of edinburgh who led the study , said : ' this new amphibian looks like something out of a bad monster movie
' it was as long as a small car and had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head , which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut
' it was the type of fierce predator that the very first dinosaurs had to put up with if they strayed too close to the water , long before the glory days of t. rex and brachiosaurus
' scientists said the giant creature ( illustrated ) would have terrorised lakes during the rise of the dinosaurs the researchers , whose work is published in the journal of vertebrate paleontology , discovered the remains of metoposaurs algarvensis on the bed of an ancient lake
it was found within a large bed of bones where several hundred of the creatures may have died when the lake dried up
the image above shows the fossilised skulls of metoposaurus algarvensis excavated in portugal 's algarve so far the researchers have excavated just four square meters of the lake and say they could find hundreds of creatures preserved in the mudstone
most species of giant salamander - like amphibians were wiped out during a mass extinction 201 million years ago which marked the end of the triassic period
this was when the supercontinent of pangea began to break apart and paved the way for the dominance of the dinosaurs
other species of metoposaurus have been found in parts of africa , europe , india and north america
dr richard butler , another researcher involved in the study and a palaeontologist at the university of birmingham , said : ' most modern amphibians are pretty tiny and harmless
' back in the triassic these giant predators would have made lakes and rivers pretty scary places to be
