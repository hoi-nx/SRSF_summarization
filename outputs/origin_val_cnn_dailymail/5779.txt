it was a memorable night for interstellar and kingsman : the secret service as the 20th empire celebrated another 12 months of cinema in london on sunday evening
helmed by british director nolan and starring jessica chastain , interstellar walked away with two of the night âs biggest prizes â best film and best director for nolan
both were in attendance at park lane âs grosvenor house , but their overwhelming success on the night was matched by that of the british spy - caper
the latter went to rising star egerton , whose filming commitments as eddie â the eagle â edwards in a biopic about the former skier saw him miss the event
but while the actor was unable to collect his award in person , co-star mark strong was on hand to bestow the best thriller â won by the imitation game â to alex lawther
