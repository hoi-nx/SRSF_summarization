it 's been a long journey from australian to bradford and the brink of the fa cup semi-finals for james meredith
at one point , during a break between his seven english â and one irish â clubs , the defender found himself training alone in a park in derby â like rocky balboa â
amazingly , meredith will be looking forward to his fifth wembley appearance if league one giantkillers bradford can deliver another knockout blow to reading in saturday âs quarter - final tie at valley parade
james meredith holds of then - chelsea winger mohamed salah during their fa cup clash in west london jon stead scores in a remarkable performance as the bantams beat chelsea 4 - 2 at stamford bridge the 26 - year - old australian played at the national stadium three times with york â twice in the fa trophy final and once in the conference play - off final â as well as bradford âs 2013 league two play - off final win over northampton town in 2013
but reaching wembley in the fa cup after beating chelsea and sunderland in the earlier rounds would top the lot
â i âve been to wembley six times now and played in four of them and they âre all fantastic occasions , but this would be even more special because it is the fa cup , â said meredith
â we do nât get the coverage in australian like you do over here obviously , but everyone follows the fa cup
everyone knows it âs the biggest domestic cup in the world and the great stories that came out of it , my favourite being the crazy gang
â now it âs the quarter - finals , people are starting to get excited
i think it âs being shown on setanta
i know all my family and friends are going to watch it , they âve worked out a way to stream it
they âre excited about the game and they â re all getting together to have some food and drinks
meredith , who has played for seven different english sides since moving from australian , against sunderland â one of my best mates flew over for the chelsea game and it was fantastic because when we scored that fourth goal , somehow i managed to spot him in the away fans and we were cheering really hard at each other
â my dad said if we get to the semi-finals , he âll fly over
it âll probably just be my dad and my brother or sister
the plane tickets are nât cheap
â meredith left his family home in australian where he lived with his parents , two younger brothers and sister , to travel to english at the age of 16 and sign as an apprentice at derby after being spotted at the club âs academy in melbourne
after loan spells at cambridge united and chesterfield , it did nât work out at derby and he went on to have brief spells at sligo rovers , shrewsbury town and telford united before joining york
â i signed pro at derby but then i was released , â meredith recalled
â at that time i really struggled to get a club , like a lot of players do when they have no experience as a professional
the 26 - year - old has been to wembley stadium six times and played on four of those occasions meredith holds off lukas podolski during bradford 's win against arsenal in the 2012 capital one cup â i was in the country on my own
at one point i was without a club for six months
i was running in a park in derby every day on my own like rocky balboa
â i found it really difficult and i was faced with the decision : do i go back home to australian or do i really give it a good go and try to make something of myself ? â i decided to give it a good go and i ended up going all the way down to the conference north
from there , i âve had to work as hard as i can to build my career to get to a notable league to do the best i can for myself
â meredith is not the only one among a bradford squad that has exceeded all expectations under manager phil parkinson
he added : â it âs the whole ethos of the club
it âs what is bred into us by the management staff
they are tough and hard and they want workers
we âre in a working - class city
we have to work hard , do the right thing and look after ourselves properly
that âs what has built this team spirit and enthusiasm
â there are no big - time charlies at the club , we all work hard for each other
