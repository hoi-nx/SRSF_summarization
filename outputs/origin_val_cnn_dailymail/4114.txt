mcnamara rounded on the hampden officials for costing his side the chance of league cup glory against celtic
referee bobby madden made two huge calls against dundee united when , first of all , he denied ryan dow a first - half penalty following a nudge in the back by parkhead skipper scott brown
the whistler then instantly dismissed tannadice captain sean dillon for a dangerous tackle on emilio izaguirre in 56 minutes , thus ending any hopes of a dundee united comeback
dundee united manager mcnamara was furious that his side were not awarded a penalty on sunday â i feel frustrated and disappointed , â said mcnamara
â but i âm proud of how the players responded
â i thought a lot of things went against us today
we stuck to the task and went right to the end , despite the disappointments and setbacks in the game
â decisions did nât go for us and certain other things did nât go for us
i ca nât fault the lads for their effort and commitment
â i feel we should have had a penalty
it looked like a penalty , i âd like to see it again
the referee was very slow to make a decision , or not make a decision
but in celtic âs case , he was very quick to point to the spot
â i âd like to see the challenge again that caused the damage to sean dillon âs leg
celtic ended up getting a throw - in from it
sean dillon has got a bad gash on his shin
i âd like to see the incident again , to see if it was a fair one
dundee united 's captain sean dillon is sent off by referee bobby madden for a tackle on emilio izaguirre â for the red card , sean dillon has given the referee a real decision to make
it was his momentum and pace , i do nât think he has gone in to cause damage
but he âs given the ref a decision to make and we know what happened
â dundee united midfielder rankin , meanwhile , accused celtic of piling pressure on to bobby madden ahead of sunday âs showpiece occasion
following the stormy scottish cup draw at tannadice , celtic manager ronny deila had accused dundee united youngster connolly of a â blatant â dive to win a spot - kick
that was then repeated by scott brown , who also pointed the finger at nadir ciftci over a kick that struck him on the head
anthony stokes further spoke out by expressing his bemusement that connolly had nât been retrospectively punished
â i think it did influence things , â said rankin
â it put pressure on the officials and i do nât think it âs merited
ryan dow was denied a first - half penalty following a nudge in the back by parkhead skipper scott brown â the officials â jobs are hard enough without putting pressure on them
â you saw it last week with us going down to nine men and people questioning the decisions made then
â there has been a lot of pressure put on bobby madden and his three officials this weekend with what they âve been saying in the press this week
â i do nât think that âs merited and it does nât help
but at the end of the day we â ve got to deal with it
we âre bitterly disappointed but we need to look forward to the scottish cup replay on wednesday and bounce back
â tensions sure to be raised once again when the sides meet for the third act in what has become a four - match saga
for dundee united , keeping 11 players on the park will be a priority
â it will be easy to lift the players for wednesday , â said mcnamara
â that âs what we are in it for
dundee united captain sean dillon ( right ) is sent off for this late challenge on celtic defender emilio izaguirre â had we won today , we would have got back up for wednesday
so we will dust them down and see who is available
paul dixon and sean dillon will both be missing
â but the lads have another opportunity to put everything behind them
hopefully there will be a bit of consistency in everything on wednesday
â we defended well with both 11 and 10 players today
last week , we defended well with nine players , as well
hopefully we keep 11 men on the pitch on wednesday night
it âs imperative that we do
â up until the last third of the pitch , we competed well with celtic
but our last pass just was nât there , although we had opportunities to create something
it âs just that little bit of quality we were lacking
â but they gave us everything and that âs all you ask as a manager
we can take lots of positives from it - they way the players stuck together , how they worked and did nât give up right until the final whistle
