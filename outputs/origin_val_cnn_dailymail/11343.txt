we 've all been tightening our belts for a few years and judging by the chancellor âs trousers , so has he
but now things are looking up , perhaps mr osborne could afford to pop out and buy a pair of suit trousers that actually reach his shoes
while he undoubtedly hoped the country would be listening to what he had to say , many seemed more interested in what he was wearing
we 've all been tightening our belts for a few years and judging by the chancellor âs trousers , so has he in fact , his half - mast turn - ups attracted almost as many comments among twitter users as some of his budget measures
some accused him of looking like a schoolboy while others pointed to the fact that his navy blue suit , unusually , had three buttons rather than the standard two and curiously high lapels
the budget suit â accessorised with a sombre , pale grey tie - provoked the strongest reaction on twitter yesterday
while some users complimented him on the cut , many more questioned his â strange â choice
it is not known from where mr osborne bought his unorthodox suit
his father , sir osborne , is said to favour savile row tailors richard james where a navy â 160s â suit costs Â£ 1,150 and turnbull and asser shirts Â£ 145
george osborne 's half - mast turn - ups attracted almost as many comments on twitter as his budget measures some even accused mr osborne , 43 , of wearing make - up , pointing to what appeared to be a tell - tale foundation line along his jaw , while his hair was compared to that of hollywood star antonio banderas
it is not the first time his appearance has attracted comments
by 2014 his rather full figure of the year before had been replaced by his current slim look thanks to him adopting the fashionable 5:2 diet
in an interview last year , he said he had lost two stone on the diet , popular with celebrities , after seeking advice from his doctor
it involved him limiting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week but eating normally on the other five
he was also seen jogging around st james âs park , across the road from the treasury and changed his haircut , favouring a shorter crop , part of an apparent bid to appear more youthful
his new look is said to be down to one of his senior government aides , thea rogers
she used to work as a producer for bbc political editor nick robinson before mr osborne hired her to overhaul his image
his look yesterday was a far cry from his appearance back in 2010 , when he first took up the government post and favoured a slightly more old fashioned hair - cut and suit .
