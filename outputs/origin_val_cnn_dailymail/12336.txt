iraq forces say they 've captured key areas in their offensive to take back tikrit , which has been under isis control since june
the security forces , backed by shiite militias , raised the iraq flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city monday night , a security official with the forces in tikrit told cnn
the gains , according to the official , came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city 's streets
at least 26 militants were killed in the operation , the official said
earlier monday , iraq federal police said in a statement aired on iraq television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern tikrit
the renewed push into tikrit comes days after a series of u.s. - led airstrikes aimed at isis targets around the city
the goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for iraq forces to go in
now security forces and fighters from hashd al-shaabi , a predominantly shiite paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take tikrit back from isis , say they 're gaining ground
iraq forces have tried multiple times to win back tikrit since isis , which calls itself the islamic state , conquered the city in june as part of its campaign to amass an expansive islamic caliphate
and each time , so far , they 've failed
the latest push began after iraq prime minister al-abadi on march 1 ordered iraq forces to retake tikrit and salahuddin province
militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city , which is the birthplace of former iraq dictator saddam hussein and located about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) north of baghdad
isis responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city , hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure , said saad al-hadithi , a spokesman for al-abadi
this movement led iraq 's military to pause its operation , out of growing worries that a full - on invasion could produce heavy iraq military and some civilian casualties
the situation spurred the iraq prime minister to request help from the u.s. - led coalition , which conducted airstrikes around tikrit last week
