it was created by alice harding , from dartmouth , england , who described hunting as ' despicable '
she said : ' it 's repulsive to glorify trophy hunting and sadistic practices such as bow hunting and posing with dead bodies of animals as if hunting is an appealing and desirable thing to do
' killing animals for fun is just plain wrong and must be stopped

it reads : ' it 's despicable and repulsive to glorify trophy hunting and sadistic practices such as bow hunting ' ms fialova , posing above with a boar in slovakia , has vowed she will never stop hunting and refers to those against it as ' antis ' but despite criticism ms fialova , who refers to those against hunting as ' antis ' , wrote on facebook on february 24 : ' hey antis , do you really think this will stop me ? i will never stop hunting
' and in a video posted at the beginning of march , she explained : ' the difference between this meat and your meat is your meat is usually from slaughterhouses
' the animal has a right to live a proper life and until its end it does n't know about being hunted ' ( sic )
the petition was started on february 18 and has been signed by nearly 6,000 supporters .
