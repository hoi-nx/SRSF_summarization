he told mailonline : ' he may have known that his career was already over
he may have known that the end was in sight
' mr rosenschein said that , in britain , pilots under 40 face annual or bi-annual medicals and , as well as testing physical health , doctors often ask questions to assess pilots ' mental health

' we have at lufthansa , a reporting system where crew can report â without being punished â their own problems , or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment
' all the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case
â german investigators removed dozens of boxes from the dusseldorf apartment andreas lubitz shared with his girlfriend yesterday , as they continue to search for clues which could explain the reasons behind the air crash investigators found a torn up sicknote which was valid on the day of the crash among other evidence other possible explanations for andreas lubitz 's actions are that he may have stopped taking his medication so it would not be detected in any medical tests or slipped into desperation during a crisis in his relationship
he is said to have recently split from his on / off girlfriend , who he lived with in a smart flat on the outskirts of dusseldorf
some media reports claim the pair were together for seven years and were engaged to be married next year
however , a former lover of andreas lubitz came forward today to claim she had dated the troubled co-pilot for five months last year
the 26 - year - old air germanwings stewardess said she met andreas lubitz while the pair flew across europe together and said they would often stay in hotels together
she said he even warned her that he was going to commit an act so heinous that his name would be remembered for ever
the woman , known only as maria w , revealed to german newspaper bild how he ominously told her last year : â one day i will do something that will change the whole system , and then all will know my name and remember it

â i never knew what he meant , but now it makes sense , â she said
earlier today , a passenger on the outbound flight from dusseldorf to barcelona , which is believed to have had andreas lubitz on board , questioned why the co-pilot did n't down that flight instead
michael , 45 , said he saw the pilot leave the cockpit during the 6.45am flight for a toilet break
he told bild : ' i sat in the fifth row
i could see the front of the plane
the toilet behind the cockpit was apparently out of order , i could see the red light flashing throughout the flight
' a man over 40 , probably the pilot , in a grey v neck sweater came through the curtain
he went through the plane probably to the rear toilet
' after an estimated three to five minutes he came back and again opened the cockpit door
' he said he did n't see the co-pilot during the flight but described the journey as ' unobtrusive and ' normal ' .
