o'neill , 26 , was caught at his home in hyde , manchester , with his victim after her parents tracked him down through facebook
police also discovered a vile collection of indecent images of children and extreme pornography on his home computer
o'neill was jailed for four years after he pleaded guilty to a series of charges including child abduction at manchester 's minshull street crown court , yesterday
there was no evidence that there was any sexual contact between the pair , but judge potter said that o'neill was ' very close to getting what he desired ... sexual gratification '
he said : ' i have no doubt that what you were doing that night were acts that were designed by you to encourage her
' o'neill , a former chimney sweep , first connected with the girl on facebook and the pair met twice in june 2013
he gave her Â£ 400 in cash on the first occasion then bought her clothing , pyjamas and Â£ 100 ugg boots in manchester
the girl , who can not be named , had told her mother that she was meeting a friend at mcdonald 's but went to o'neill 's house that night where they drank vodka and he smoked cannabis
smith , prosecuting , said her mother became anxious after she said she wanted to stay out and then turned her phone off
her mother alerted her friends and a message she had sent to one of them on facebook revealed her location to be on o'neill 's street
police officers attended with her mother , but they did n't know his exact address
the girl 's parents returned shortly after 6am the next morning and knocked on doors until a neighbour pointed them in the right direction
found : the schoolgirl 's parents used facebook to track her to o'neill 's home on this manchester street mr smith said o'neill answered the door in shorts and a t - shirt and that the girl 's parents recognised him from their daughter 's facebook account
he said : ' o'neill said he had not touched her
her dad ran upstairs and pushed the bedroom door open
she was wearing the pyjamas he had bought her
' the police were alerted and o'neill was arrested
the court heard that in interviews , he accepted that he knew she was 14
analysis of his computer revealed a collection of indecent images of children and extreme pornography had been downloaded
following the conviction yesterday , the girl 's mother spoke of her terror and issued a chilling warning to parents over the dangers of facebook
she said : ' she knows now how dangerous the situation was
you never know who people really are on facebook
parents should never take their eyes off their children 's computer use
' my daughter is quiet and sensible but not very streetwise
i just can not understand how this happened under my nose
i can not forgive myself really
' i now have control over my daughter 's facebook password
' i can honestly say i had some sort of guardian angel because i had never seen the guy and i did n't know where he lived but we managed to find him
' she is a good girl and feels a bit silly by what has happened
she has learned her lesson
she now knows how dangerous it can be to meet people through facebook
' she is now going to college and to work in healthcare
the one thing i would say to any parent is to install the gps software on your children 's phone and to make sure they know about the dangers
' lewis bretts , defending o'neill , said : ' he has shown his remorse
he understands how serious these offences are
' o'neill was ordered to sign the sex offenders ' register for life and subjected to a sexual offences prevention order to monitor his activity on release .
