paranoid : pettitt attacked dr davis so viciously in may 2012 that paramedics were initially unable to tell if he was still alive - because there was so much blood a patient turned into ' little less than an animal ' by a cocktail of drugs beat a doctor with a baseball bat before trying to gauge out his eyes after his worried grandmother called for medical help
pettitt beat dr davis so badly after he attended his home in tewkesbury , gloucester , that police called to the scene were unable to see if the doctor was still alive , because he was covered in so much blood
the 33 - year - old began attacking the doctor with a baseball bat , before the frenzied assault escalated and pettitt began trying to ' bite chunks ' out of his victim 's face
pettittt then grabbed a knife to inflict numerous lacerations , as his horrified relatives called paramedics and police - who were forced to taser pettitt
dr davis survived , but the vicious attack has forced him to quit the medical profession because he was left unable to trust patients
gloucester crown court heard how , in the days leading up to the may 2012 attack , pettitt had taken heroin and cocaine
pettitt became paranoid , convinced a number of frenchmen men wanted to kill him
on the morning of the attack , he is understood to have taken an heavy cocktail of prescribed anti-depressants
his grandmother had grown concerned with his paranoia as pettitt was convinced that a number of frenchmen men wanted to kill him
the morning of the attack he is also understood to have taken an heavy cocktail of prescribed anti-depressants
his grandmother had become so concerned she had called for a doctor - and it was dr davis who attended
prosecuting , anna vigars said : ' after about 15 minutes of rational conversation it suddenly turned
' pettitt shouted , " bastards like you are only in it for yourselves "
' he took a baseball bat and started to swing it at dr davis , he hit his arms , his shoulders and his nose
he hit him a number of times , including one very painful blow to his head
' then mr pettitt was on top of him , trying to gouge his eyes out
mr davis was trying to take hold of his arms
call for help : the medic had been called to the house in cotteswold road , tewkesbury , gloucester , after pettitt 's grandmother became concerned about his increasing parnoia
pictured : cotteswold road ' as his hands were moved away , ( pettitt ) leaned forward and tried to bite mr davis ' face - he tried to bite a chunk from his nose
' he then began shouting , he shouted : ' i really want to kill you , it would be a huge adrenaline rush '
in terror mr davis was crying which he was mocked for by mr pettitt
' mr pettitt then managed to get hold of knife
that caused the top part of his thumb to be sliced
' thereafter he described how he was punched a number of times , but when ambulance staff arrived it became clear they were actually stab wounds to his left shoulder and the left side of his head
' at that stage they did n't know whether or not mr davis was alive simply because of the amount of blood
' in a police interview he told officers it had felt like a dream and he had woken up remorseful for what had happened
' the doctor , who had been practising for 27 years , was left with a number of lacerations to his head , thumb and shoulder , as well as a fractured nose and bruising
the damage to his thumb was so bad , he required plastic surgery
but it was the mental scars dr davis was left with which have refused to heal
mental scars : dr davis has since quit medicine , saying his is unable to trust patients anymore in a victim impact statement read in court , dr davis revealed : ' by july this year ( 2013 ) i have very little left in the was of physical injuries - i do consider myself very lucky
' but mentally the affect this has had on me has been far harder to come to terms with
' in the first four weeks i was bursting into tears very often and my emotions were up and down
' i found myself waking in the middle of the night thinking about what had happened - i struggled to sleep
' it seemed incomprehensible that this could happened to me
' i feel no malice towards him
i feel more anger to the nhs for putting me in the situation where my safety was at risk
' due to this attack i feel no desire towards returning to work
i 'm not sure i could sit there and try to help patients again in case i am in a similar situation
' overall this has had a huge impact on my life
this is probably a career ending event for me
' the memory of this ordeal will stay with me for a very long time
' psychiatric expert dr tim amos told the court that pettitt suffered from a number of drug induced mental health problems
brendan moorhouse , defending , said his client had ' expressed genuine remorse ' for the attack
he added : ' he understands the consequences to the doctor and he lives with the results of his actions every day
' judge jamie tabor qc ordered that he was hospitalised under section 45 of the mental health act
he also imposed a minimum prison sentence of nine years , meaning if pettitt is released from hospital within that time frame he must serve the remainder of the nine years in prison
on sentence the judge told him : ' this cocktail of drugs turned you into quite frankly little less than an animal - causing you to shout out you wanted to kill that man and that you would get an adrenaline rush from it
' you would n't recognise that man if you saw him
