a deadly strain of bird flu has been found in a minnesota commercial turkey flock
the virus devastated a flock of 15,000 turkeys in western minnesota 's pope county
it 's the same highly pathogenic h5n2 strain of avian influenza that 's been confirmed in backyard and wild birds in washington , oregon and idaho
however , it 's the first appearance of the strain in the mississippi flyway [ states around the mississippi river ] said dr. hartmann , minnesota 's state veterinarian
fewer than 100 of the turkeys were still alive by thursday , hartmann said
the flock has been quarantined and the remaining birds were being killed
a flock of 15,000 turkeys was wiped out on a farm in minnesota in a week by a deadly strain of bird flu carried by wild waterfowl that are not sickened by it
the strain has already been found in the pacific northwest dr. hartmann ( left ) said that this is the first appearance of the strain in the area
minnesota agriculture commissioner frederickson ( right ) said : ' we can only prepare for the worst and hope for the best ' no other commercial flocks are nearby , he said , but ' backyard flocks ' within a 10 - kilometer area ( approximately six miles ) were being tested for the disease
the virus is carried by wild waterfowl that are n't sickened by it
the incubation period is approximately 21 days
' we 're encouraged that we 'll be able to prevent the spread of the disease , ' hartmann said
' we should be able to contain this without much difficulty
' ' if we can get through the next 21 days without finding anything , we should be in good shape , ' agriculture commissioner frederickson added
minnesota is the nation 's top turkey producer , with industry groups claiming to produce some 46 million turkeys each year worth around $ 750 million
frederickson said about 8 per cent of that production , or $ 92 million worth , was exported in 2013
he acknowledged that those exports could take a hit , as poultry exports from states in the northwest already have
' we 're very cognizant of that , ' frederickson said
' we can only prepare for the worst and hope for the best
' the risk to humans is low , state and federal officials announced on thursday
minnesota health commissioner ehlinger stressed there is no danger to the general public health commissioner ehlinger said the only humans at risk were four people who worked directly with the infected flock and they will be monitored
however , no human infections from this strain have been detected anywhere , he said
' there are no food safety concerns at this time , ' ehlinger said
' this is not a threat to the general public
' hartmann said he was prohibited by law from identifying the farm or saying where it 's located in pope county
nearly all commercial turkey operations keep their birds inside large barns and they never go outside
hartmann said that was the true for the affected farm , too
he said turkeys in only one of the farm 's four barns got sick
farm workers found 70 dead turkeys on february 26 and notified the state the next day when hundreds died
the state got confirmation of the virus from a u.s. department of agriculture lab on wednesday night
the state veterinarian said it was possible the virus may have been tracked into the barns from fecal material left by infected wild birds
it 's also possible for infected waterfowl to transmit the virus to shore birds that might then get into a turkey barn , he added .
