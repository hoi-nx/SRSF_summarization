cook has slammed the ecb for the timing of his dismissal as one - day captain , claiming the world cup shambles which followed has shattered the players ' confidence
cook 's forthright views increase the pressure on head coach peter moores and managing director paul downton on the day the test squad to tour west indies was announced
speaking in abu dhabi , where he is preparing to play for the mcc , cook said defeats by australia and new zealand proved that the decision to axe him was , with hindsight , incorrect
cook was removed as england one - day captain in december , before the cricket world cup england 's cricketers were eliminated from the world cup at the group stage by bangladesh cook believes hindsight has proved the ecb wrong to remove him as captain before the tournament cook told the daily telegraph : ' i ca n't speak about what 's gone on there in depth , but you always back yourself , and i would have loved to have had the opportunity that was taken away from me
' the selectors made that decision because they thought it was the best for english cricket
hindsight has probably proved them wrong , but now it 's very easy to say that
' he added : ' i would n't say all of it [ confidence ] has been [ shattered ] , but a hell of a lot of it has been
you have to remember that it is a different format and you get a change , but all teams are grouped under the same english cricket umbrella , and we ca n't be naive enough to think that it 's not
' we have a repairing job to do , and the only way of doing that is by playing some good cricket and start winning
' we built that momentum a little bit after the ashes 14 or 15 months ago with a slightly younger side , including the likes of gary ballance and joe root
there was a feel - good factor about the english game in the middle of august after the test matches
since then , it 's been tough going
we 've got to rebuild again

' i was there for three - and - a - half years trying to do a job , ' he said
' we got to no 1 in the world with a full - strength side and got to the final of the champions trophy
there were things i can be very proud of
' as any captain will tell you , leading your country in a world cup is a huge honour and one that can never be taken lightly
i was very much looking forward to that
' i understand the pressure i was under
i was n't scoring the runs i should , or could have been scoring so i understand that my position was in jeopardy
' but i think you saw in australia the dangers of making such a big decision so close to the tournament
cook ( left ) was struggling for runs in one - day cricket when the ecb decided to remove him as captain cook believes that england would have made it out of their group at the world cup if he had been there ' i do n't know what 's gone on on that tour ... but it did look like the lads were shell - shocked from the first two games
' whether i would have made a difference , i do n't know
' but i was fully confident we would get out of our group
