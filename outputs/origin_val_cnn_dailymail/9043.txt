plus - size fashion is a hard market to crack but with the average uk dress size hitting 16 , many women are left frustrated by designers that seemingly have little knowledge of the female form or how women want to dress
and that is exactly why evans , who pioneered the first - ever plus - size fashion week , want to change that
the high street store , which falls under sir philip green 's arcadia umbrella , set up an initiative last year with universities to teach students how to design plus - size clothes for the brand 's evans range

so , she asked students from nottingham trent university and kingston university to design a six - piece collection that was fashion forward but not limited by size
