barcelona will have home advantage for its copa del rey final against bilbao after spain 's football federation voted on wednesday for the camp nou as the venue
both finalists had originally asked to play the may 30 decider at real madrid 's 81,000 - seater santiago bernabeu
the camp nou will host this year 's copa del rey final between barcelona and bilbao on may 30 however , the venue for copa del rey finals must be offered voluntarily and real madrid made no such offer
after two hours of talks failed to resolve the issue , the federation 's executive committee took a vote from four stadium options : barcelona , bilbao , valencia and sevilla
the camp nou , with its maximum capacity of 98,700 , was chosen ahead of bilbao 's 53,300 - capacity san mames stadium in the final round of voting
both finalists wanted to play at the santiago bernabeu - but real madrid never volunteered their venue
