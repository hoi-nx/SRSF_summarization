senese now faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of wire fraud
according to the fbi , peter senese , 49 , ( pictured ) ran a sham non-profit called the i care foundation where he purported he could reunite families with their children he was arrested on tuesday morning near his home in brooklyn with his first court appearance due later that day
according to a facebook fan page , senese established the i care foundation in 2011
however , a tampa bay times article , alleges that senese was already active in the child abduction business and operating as a ' master con ' in may 2010
he went on to promote his group through the websites www.stopchildabduction.org and www.petersenese.com
he also built a presence on social media via twitter and youtube
according to the complaint , peter senese told potential clients that he could recover children using former soldiers he knew from his days as a member of the u.s. army 's delta force
' in fact , he could do no such thing , but that did n't stop him from allegedly repeatedly reaching out to the parents for more money to fund his non-existent rescue mission , ' u.s. attorney preet bharara said in a statement
in the india case , which took place in november 2013 , senese apparently claimed he had traveled to the country to seek out the perpetrators
he then sent several emails and text messages falsely assuring the family that the child 's rescue was only days or even hours away
documents also say he demanded more money to cover expenses - usually $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 a month
but investigators found that when senese claimed he was overseas , he was really in new york , miami or los angeles and had n't traveled outside of the u.s. since 2007
they also found no records showing he was ever in the military and that i care was registered as a non-profit
there was also a second victim allegedly swindled out of $ 5,000 but senese dropped the client after they wanted to arrange a meeting with an attorney
the name of senese 's attorney was n't immediately available .
