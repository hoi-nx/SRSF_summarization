cotter fears alex dunbar âs season - ending injury may also rule the star centre out of scotland âs world cup campaign
the glasgow warriors back suffered a major blow ahead of saturday 's six nations clash at twickenham when he damaged the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during thursday morning âs training session
the sru confirmed that he is â out for the rest of the season â but , speaking before the result of scans on alex dunbar âs freak injury were released , cotter said acl damage could mean up to six months on the sidelines and remove the 24 - year - old from his world cup plans
alex dunbar faces a race against time to be fit for the world cup after injuring his knee at training scotland coach cotter fears alex dunbar may not recover in time for the world cup , starting in september how england and scotland will line up for saturday 's calcutta cup clash visibly shaken by an incident that happened just a few hours before the team flew to london , cotter now hopes his squad will be galvanised in the face of fresh adversity for saturday 's calcutta cup clash
explaining that alex dunbar had been a key figure in his starting xv , cotter said : â we had named alex dunbar to start at centre but he has perhaps done his acl this morning
â alex dunbar did it on his own
a change of direction and his knee went out from underneath him
if it âs the acl , that would be the world cup as well
â we âll miss him in attack and defence
he âs one of our best line breakers and has been playing very well up to now
â he is with some competent surgeons at the moment , he âs getting scanned
he âs understandably very upset about it
â we âve seen guys come back from an acl before , so it âs just about when we get him back
but , if it âs the acl , he âll be six months
â he was getting tested this morning
i went to see him during a break in training and he âs been whisked off with the pros
i will obviously talk to him again
â alex dunbar , here showing his disappointment after scotland 's loss to wales , awaits results of scans on his knee scott has now taken alex dunbar âs slot for the england game
â it âs an opportunity for scott , who was initially named on the bench , â said cotter
â you saw his two tries for edinburgh last weekend , he is ready to step up
we âve got an able replacement who has played well recently
â we would dearly love to have alex dunbar starting and then have someone like scott come in and keep pace , bring physical intensity and presence to the game
but scott has stepped straight in , and it means we âll have to juggle the bench if we get injuries
â i think it has tightened the group up â and that will be important when we play this weekend
we are playing what is probably one of the best teams in the world as they are preparing for the world cup
the group adapts and moves on
â coach cotter said the 24 - year - old centre had played a key role in the scotland xv alex dunbar âs withdrawal is one of five changes cotter has made to his starting xv
along with scott , david denton , jim hamilton and dougie fife all come in for their first starts of this six nations , while finn russell returns after serving his ban
scott âs promotion sees greig tonks move on to a bench that boasts six forwards to only two backs â although no. 8 beattie has been told to prepare for playing a part in either unit
cotter revealed : â beattie is a midfield replacement , emergency cover
he knows he could be marking ( england centre ) billy twelvetrees or he could be marking ( no.8 ) billy vunipola
â i know he âs got a good boot on him
we know he âs a very skilful player
we want to have some physical density and some experience at the end of this match
â so he and adam ashe , who has come back and has aggressive defence and is good on the ball , are there to put pressure on england
we want to stay close and finish this game with strength and experience
