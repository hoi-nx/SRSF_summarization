a man who has not been in italian is always conscious of an inferiority , from not having seen what it is expected a man should see
so said johnson , who was forever ready with a suitable aphorism
suitable , that is , if you were living in the 18th century , when the rich and titled minority wafted around florence and rome as part of their grand tour , allowing travel to broaden their minds before bringing back new ideas to influence our architecture , landscape and gardening
the cities they visited overflowed with statues and art , some of which they bought on the cheap , or pinched when the italian were looking the other way
though tuscany can sometimes seem overcrowded , it âs still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories ( pictured : san gimignano and its towers ) johnson would be surprised to see how popular italian cities have become nowadays : visitors are well advised to arrive outside the summer peak when sightseeing can be hard ( and sometimes positively dangerous given the rise of the selfie - stick â the ultimate stupidity of modern - day tourism )
forster took a wry look at the early days of mass tourism to italian at the end of the 19th century in lucy honeychurch
when the young heroine lucy honeychurch finds herself in the church of santa croce without her baedeker guidebook , forster is expressing the horror of the intellectual at the worrying rise of the â uneducated â tourist
he went so far as to wonder whether there ought to be some sort of intelligence test imposed at dover to weed out the truly stupid traveller
but today âs tourists do nât come to tuscany so much to learn as to â experience â
the treasures of the uffizi or an up - close sight of david in florence âs accademia gallery are stirring in their own right â you do nât really need to know their place in the history of renaissance in order to enjoy them
chianciano terme was called fontes clusinae by the romans , and they made use of its thermal springs in florence you can assimilate the art and savour it , just as you might imbibe a glass of fine italian wine
the problem is that at busy times , it âs hard to find the space to enjoy either the art or the wine
but though tuscany can sometimes seem overcrowded , it âs still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories
mine are of a pleasant three - star hotel in a place named chianciano terme , about 50 miles south - east of siena , which was our base
the romans called it fontes clusinae , and made use of its thermal springs , as visitors still do
i have good memories , too , of the tuscany landscape , with its well - tended fields and vineyards , its olive groves and cypress trees
i like being in a countryside that has not been neglected , or turned into a theme park for townies
in this regard , tuscany is rewarding
the â chianti classico â area , which lies between florence and siena , still looks much as it was when it was painted by the great renaissance artists who assumed that the holy land must have looked a lot like tuscany â so this is what you see in the background of various scenes of holy birth and crucifixion
as you pass through this land , you enjoy divine views across glorious sprawling vineyards ; a view occasionally interrupted by stunningly picturesque castles
writer john carter 's tour leader called tuscany 's sam gimignano ' a medieval manhattan ' of course , other countries have beautiful landscapes , but few can match tuscany for its sublime , gentle sweetness
leonardo was born in the small town of vinci which lies in this magnificent scenery â a final confirmation that the area is touched by genius
we ate well , naturally , and drank moderately well , too
some of my fellow travellers discovered a red wine named montepulciano , which they found most acceptable
our base was just five miles or so from montepulciano , so supplies were guaranteed
we went to san gimignano , which our tour leader called â a medieval manhattan â â and it was nât the first time i âd heard it described that way , unfortunately
its towers are most impressive , though it seems to take a greater pride in its ice cream
we liked san gimignano , mainly because there were nât so many people , but also because we were left to our own devices and could make up our own minds about the place without being told all sorts of stuff by a local guide
i âm in two minds about local guides
they do tell you lots of useful things , but have a tendency to tell you too much , so everything blurs

florence provided a good example of this
the guide there told us about artists and sculptors and architects and the ruling families of medieval times
she gave the names of the buildings and their histories
and dates ; masses of dates
at the end of it all , i was most confused
but the guide never mentioned the florence that might have made english visitors prick up their ears
indeed , she had never even heard of nightingale who was born in that city and was given its name
the nightingale family had a penchant for strange first names : florence âs elder sister parthenope was called after an ancient name for naples , where the family was living at the time of her birth
i suppose that both girls were glad that at the time of their births , the family had not been living in croydon â¦
