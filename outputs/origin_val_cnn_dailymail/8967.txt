cctv footage of a ' brutal ' arrest that shows one officer repeatedly kneeing a man in the back and punching his upper body has been uploaded to social media and viewed almost 30,000 times
the footage , from 2013 , captures the dramatic arrest of the couple after a night out in stockton
the incident allegedly left music fan dunford unconscious and urinating blood for a week while his former partner , leach , was left traumatised by her rough treatment at the hands of officers
while cleveland police insisted its officers acted in accordance with protocol during the arrest , the couple involved have now had their complaints upheld by the independent police complaints commission
the report says there is a case for disciplinary proceedings against the three officers involved and recommends they face a misconduct hearing over the arrest
it comes despite an initial investigation by the independent police complaints commission and north yorkshire police which found cleveland police had no case to answer over the incident in august , 2013 - a decision mr dunford appealed
the incident , captured on cctv , shows one officer attending to the injured policeman while other officers restrain mr dunford and one repeatedly knees him in the back the 45 - year - old contractor from thornaby said : ' i tried to shrug it off but it really affects me - if i see a police van i think something 's going to happen and leach was a nervous wreck afterwards
' it 's destroyed my life as it was and the whole violent affair has changed me hugely
' he said the incident had placed a great strain on his relationship with ms leach and that the couple have since split
one of the officers admitted punched mr dunford in the face and kneeing him nine times during the incident mr dunford called for the officers responsible to be removed from the force , adding : ' the police are not judges or punishers , that 's what the courts do and the police ca n't go around acting like this
' cleveland police have already responded to the latest report - which will now be considered by the independent police complaints commission before a final decision is made
the couple had been making their way home from a folk festival in stockton when mr dunford was stopped by officers on stockton high street responding to reports of a man being drunk and disorderly in a nearby pub. he was arrested after assaulting police officers as they tried to place him in a police car
however , cleveland police said mr dunford headbutted the officers , sparking an arrest which ms leach went on to describe as ' brutal ' and ' thuggish '
the footage shows several officers pinning mr dunford to the road before pc darren keeley presses his head to the ground - a manoeuvre he says which left him unconscious
dunford was arrested after assaulting police officers as they tried to place him in a police car pc michael wilson is captured repeatedly kneeing him in the back before delivering a series of blows to his upper body
in a police statement seen by reporters pc wilson also admitted to punching mr dunford in the face
he said : ' ... to distract him from his attempts to bite and resist i have punched dunford with my right fist clenched , in the left side of his face
' i used nine knee strikes during the struggle , which lasted a considerable amount of time
' when the matter was first reported in december 2013 , cleveland police said the tactics were approved and necessary as mr dunford was resisting arrest
however , the independent police complaints commission report said : ' from the cctv footage it does appear that mr dunford is at stages non-compliant with the police
' however , it appears that pc wilson continues to deliver knee strikes to mr dunford 's back even when he has stopped resisting and is laying still
' also , pc keeley states that he delivered punches to mr dunford to stop him from scratching him , however , pc keeley appears to have moved his leg out of the reach of mr dunford when he delivers the strikes
' in my view , a disciplinary tribunal could take the view that pc wilson and pc keeley both have used excessive force and have a case to answer for gross misconduct
' the report also recommends a misconduct hearing for a third officer , pc pc , in relation to the arrest of leach
footage shows her being approached by pc humphrey before being forcibly taken to the ground and arrested for being drunk and disorderly
in an earlier interview , ms leach said : ' the level of aggression was awful
when they arrested me , my dress was pulled up showing my underwear
i asked them to pull it down but even the wpc refused to touch me
' it was humiliating and degrading , i 'm a size 8 , 45 - year - old mother and was no threat
' pc humphrey initially said ms leach was abusive but , following a court hearing , charges against her were dropped when the crown prosecution service found the cctv footage contradicted the pc 's evidence
dunford pleaded guilty to assaulting a male officer , assaulting a female officer , and possession of cannabis following the incident involving the cctv
a spokeswoman for cleveland police said : ' no determination has been made yet and the matter is currently still with the independent police complaints commission commissioner
' only when this is complete will we consider what - if any - action needs to be taken by the force
