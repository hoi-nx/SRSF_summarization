vonn may have missed out on gold at last month 's world championships , but the american skier has set her sights on end - of - season glory after claiming a record - extending 65th world cup win on sunday
vonn 's victory in the super-g event at garmisch-partenkirchen in germany gave her the outright lead in the speed discipline ahead of this month 's finals in france
having finished seventh in saturday 's downhill , the 30 - year - old rebounded by coming home 0.2 seconds ahead of overall world cup leader tina maze , whose coach set up the course
it put vonn eight points ahead of super-g world champion anna fenninger , who placed third to give back the 20 points she 'd earned over tina maze the day before -- when their positions were reversed
" i think it was set probably against anna fenninger , " said vonn , who took bronze behind tina maze at last month 's world championships in colorado
" that was a wise choice by tina maze 's coach
but it also really suited me and i liked it
" " it 's going to be a close fight in downhill and super-g , so i will really have to ski my best at the finals in meribel
hopefully i can get two titles , " added vonn , who is 35 points ahead of anna fenninger in the downhill standings
but vonn is well off the pace in the fight for the overall crown -- which she last won in 2012 , her fourth success -- in third place almost 200 points behind the austrian
tina maze is another 44 points ahead of anna fenninger , with just two slalom events in sweden next week before the march 16 - 22 finale
" of course it 's a great result but i prefer to win , " the slovenia said
" vonn was simply better today and she deserves this win
" my whole team stands behind me and supports me and i am really thankful to them
valerio did a great job setting the course
it was a fast and nice course set with not too many turns
" anna fenninger , who also won the world giant slalom title at beaver creek , said she will focus on her strengths after claiming a 12th podium this season
" it was a fast super-g and that 's maybe not what i am the best at , " said the 25 - year - old
" overall it 's been a good weekend
honestly i thought tina maze was going to be better than me in the downhill and that i would catch up in the super- g. it turned out to be different
" i am focusing on my strengths , this is why i am not going to race slalom next week
now i have to train giant slalom in order to show my best skiing and maximize my chances to win the giant slalom globe
" meanwhile , jansrud clinched the men 's super-g title with victory on home snow in in kvitfjell on sunday
the norwegian , who missed out on securing the downhill crystal globe when he finished seventh on saturday , opened up an unassailable 123 - point lead over italian dominik paris
" this is the first globe of my career , " said the 29 - year - old
" it 's good to not have to go into the final weekend feeling like there are two guys pushing me on the cup and i have to fend off both of them
that 's a big thing because i can leave the super-g and focus on the downhill
" jansrud has a 20 - point lead over hannes reichelt in the downhill , but is less confident of overhauling his 52 - point deficit on another austrian , three - time defending champion hirscher , in the overall standings
the men next travel to slovenia for slalom events next weekend
" i think he will gain some extra points in kranjska gora , so i 'm not very concerned about the overall , " jansrud said of hirscher
" i think he 'll pull through
but it might get exciting
he has no room for error and anything can happen
