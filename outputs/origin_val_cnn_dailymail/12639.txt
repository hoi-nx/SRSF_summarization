the gift of an inquiring mind can be both exhilarating and torturous
my job is to ask tough questions , but when it comes to faith , god , and religion , the more questions i ask in my quest for truth and understanding , the more complex the answers become
i was a bit of a rebellious child
my mom might tell you differently , but i never saw that as a bad trait
i felt that if i questioned authority , fought for the underdog , battled for the things that people told me were impossible , i would be different
that same rebellious spirit also led to things that definitely were not good for me , like hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into the type of trouble that i would rather not put in print
that 's when i " found god
" i became a " born - again " christian when i attended a young life camp in high school
my home life was n't exactly going swimmingly , and this group really embraced me
i loved the christian notion of community , giving back , praying for others and making friends that cared more about doing good than getting drunk , smoking pot and having sex
i opened my arms to jesus and fully embraced christian morals and principles
i decided that i was going to be " that good girl " and go on to do great things
i started off at westmont , a beautiful christian college nestled in the heart of santa barbara , california
what a safe place that was
it was also extremely nurturing
the professors dedicated bountiful amounts of time to our individual spiritual development , and regularly prayed with us
my peer group was all about what ministry you signed up for , not what sorority you were rushing
we lifted each other up , had intimate sunrise bible studies on the beach and spent hours hanging out with friends , talking about how to lead a godly life
as glorious and fulfilling as all that appeared , two years into college , the world became much larger to me
more complex , diverse , intellectually and spiritually challenging
it became the world of church , religion and faith versus the world of ideas , cultures , and philosophies
i found myself more drawn to carl jung than the book of corinthians
a good friend gave me a book , the myth of certainty
it posed these questions : " do you ever feel somewhat schizophrenic about the relationship of your faith to the rest of your life ? do you find yourself compartmentalizing different aspects so that tensions between them are minimized ? " the answer to all of these for me was : yes
i started to read a lot
i wanted to mesh with a myriad of thinkers , and religious scholars
i needed to make a change
i left westmont after my sophomore year and transferred to usc 's school of journalism
i discovered i had too many questions about faith to pursue a life of ministry , but i felt good about this transition
to me , it made perfect sense , because like ministers , true journalists love people , listen well and want to make a difference within this universe
meet the friendly atheists next door the key difference is , in journalism , if we gather the " facts , " we can usually find the answers to what we 're looking for
when it comes to god , jesus and the holy spirit , those answers rest in faith
as a journalist , i seek intellectual certainty
when it came to my faith , i felt intellectually embarrassed
there was so much i just could n't explain
when i started working on a documentary about the growth of atheism , i found myself in a profound place of reflection
in the days when i thought i was going to pursue a life of ministry , i experienced and felt many things that were unexplainable
what was that ? god ? a higher power ? energy ? or just good karma for trying to lead such a generous and selfless life ? there is no way to know
my stepfather , who grew up in -- but later left -- the mormon church has a perspective on religion that i find intriguing
he does n't believe in a god with a long white beard and flowing robes who sits upon a cloud guiding our daily lives
that concept is too abstract
but while he may not embrace " god - liness , " he does believe in " good - liness
" god , he told me in one of our many colorful spiritual discussions , is the " good " in humankind
he and i definitely agree that the concept of god should not be dismissed as having no meaning
to the contrary , it has a very important meaning , for it refers in symbolic language to the highest dimension of human existence , our spirituality
after years of spiritual reflection and inquiry , i am at a place where i do n't want to feel guilty , hypocritical , judgmental , closed - minded or arrogant
so , where do i stand now -- 30 years after " finding god , " questioning my faith , committing sins , seeking hazardous adventure and trying to love life and people to the best of my ability ? i am a " seeker
" a constant seeker within this world , among people and , of course , for spiritual enlightenment of all kind
because if i did possess the truth -- the " final answer " -- i am convinced i would spend the rest of my years missing out on the enrichment and surprise of seeking it
i guess i just love my exhilarating and torturous life .
