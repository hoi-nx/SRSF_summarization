this is the hair - raising moment two motorcyclists narrowly avoid a road accident mid-ride
a body camera attached to one of the bikers shows them winding through the california hills
but all of a sudden as they turn a blind corner , they come across a stationary bmw car
the duo are forced to swerve out of the way to avoid hitting the parked vehicle
one ventures over to the wrong side of the road while the other veers into the hard shoulder with a steep drop just inches away
luckily the two cyclists manage to navigate the bmw safely
after the near - crash the motorbiker wearing the camera is seen pulling over into the driveway of a house
