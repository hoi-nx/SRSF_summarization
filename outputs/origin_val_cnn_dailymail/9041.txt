tucked away in dense woodland , this home may just be the perfect place for some quiet reflection - even if its design does make it tricky to find
the walls around the base of this property , just outside the polish capital of warsaw , are clad with mirrors - giving the impression that the top floor of the building is floating
described as a country retreat for a single family , the mirror house has been deliberately designed to minimise its impact on the stunning forest surroundings
marcin tomaszewski , of polish architects reform , said : ' it is a two - storey mirror house concept that is formed of two horizontally configured blocks
the house 's lower storey is clad with reflective paneling
these mirrored surfaces appear as an extension of the forest floor , with opaque areas stacked above
' the bottom level includes also a sheltered terrace in a shade of dark brown wood that matches the surrounding earth
the second floor appears to float above its mirrored base , a levitating box that will hover in the thick forest
