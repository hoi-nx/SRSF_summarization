the bbc has boasted of making â vast â cuts to its celebrity wage bill â but still paid stars a total of nearly Â£ 188million last year
its 14 highest - paid presenters , thought to include graham norton , chris evans and john humphrys , took home nearly Â£ 12million between them , figures show
a further 230 were paid between Â£ 100,000 and Â£ 500,000
the figures appear in a report commissioned by its governing body , the bbc trust , which congratulated the corporation on the â great â progress it has made in cutting its celebrity wage bill
some of the bbc 's highest paid presenters , who are thought to include graham norton , left , and chris evans , right , took home nearly Â£ 12million in pay between them the corporation has reduced the amount it spends on talent by 15 per cent over the past six financial years , and cut its spend on so - called â top talent â â those earning Â£ 100,000 a year or more â by 29 per cent
however , it also slashed the number of presenters on screen or radio by around a third over the same period
in the report , seen by the daily mail , the bbc congratulated itself on the â vast improvements â it has made since 2008 , and the â cultural shift â the bbc has made in allowing itself to lose certain presenters to other channels
it said : â there has been a considerable and important internal cultural shift towards greater ownership and scrutiny of talent costs â¦ and a willingness to be more flexible in its approach to talent , including allowing talent to leave where appropriate
â john humphrys , left , is thought to another one of the bbc 's top earners
the report also highlighted presenters who had left the bbc such as susanna reid , right the report highlighted jake humphrey , who moved to bt vision , and susanna reid , the former bbc breakfast presenter who now co-hosts good morning britain for itv
but the scale of the salaries the bbc continues to pay out to presenters is unlikely to ease concerns that the bbc is â profligate â with licence fee payers â money
last week , the influential culture , media and sport select committee slammed the bbc , painting a portrait of an organisation that was inept with public funds , and had blown billions on vanity projects and staff pay - offs
john whittingdale , chairman of the committee , said last night that the salaries the bbc was awarding talent needed close scrutiny
he explained : â the bbc should think long and hard before paying anybody a six - figure - plus salary
it is very hard to justify these sorts of sums
' if the argument is that [ the presenters ] would go elsewhere - well , then perhaps the bbc should let them
new bbc trust chairman fairhead is to make a speech in oxford today , where she is expected to reinforce concerns that the bbc wage bill was too high ' if somebody becomes so successful that they command a very large salary , the bbc is not there to stop them
it is there as an incubator of talent
' the committee 's report , future of the bbc , also called for the abolition of the bbc trust , saying that the governing body was too close to the corporation and needed to be replaced with a more rigorous body
a speech by fairhead , in oxford today is likely to reinforce some of their concerns
â the trust recognises that the outstanding people on screen and on air are at the heart of the bbc , at the same time we are clear that the bbc has a responsibility to spend money wisely in its approach to talent pay , â she will say
mrs fairhead is also at the centre of another controversy about pay , after it emerged that she received more than Â£ 500,000 last year for just 50 days work in non-executive roles at the embattled bank , hsbc .
