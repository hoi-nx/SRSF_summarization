â catherine hughes told mamamia that her whole family is immunised and that they had also asked their friends and families to have boosters
the department of health says it does not know how the child contracted the respiratory disease , also known as pertussis
whooping cough is part of the routine vaccination schedule for babies at two months , four months and six months of age
booster doses are given at 4 years and 10 - 15 years
infectious diseases expert at anu medical school canberra , senanayake , told daily mail australia : ' from my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough
' whooping cough ( also known as â pertussis â ) is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways
the government health website says the disease is ' highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months '
babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine ( minimum 4 months old ) as the mother âs antibodies do not provide reliable protection
it âs very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease â and if they do , it âs usually not as serious
symptoms the condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing
these are followed by a distinctive â whooping â noise , which is how the condition gets its name
the early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include : these early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks , before becoming more severe
the second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing
each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes
infants younger than six months may not make the â whoop â sound after coughing , but they may start gagging or gasping , and may temporarily stop breathing
information supplied by healthdirect.gov.au the devastated parents have set up a facebook page that already has over 25,000 likes he explained infants are ' at a high risk of dying if they get infected ' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent
' it 's important to listen to the experts , ' mr senanayake said
' whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough , it 's a nasty infection
' according to the department 's notifiable disease report , there have been 244 cases of whooping cough in wa in the year to date , compared to 292 cases for the corresponding period last year and 232 cases in the first 10 weeks of 2013
data recorded on immunisation rates across australia on the department of health 's website shows , in 2012 , wa had the lowest vaccination rates for whooping cough and for immunisation overall
in wa 91 per cent of children were immunised against diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis by 12 months of age and 90.2 per cent were fully immunised
in 2013 , the department of health report said that despite a long - standing immunisation program , ' pertussis remains highly prevalent in australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine - preventable diseases '
' epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years
in unvaccinated populations , these outbreaks can be very large
in vaccinated populations , outbreaks are smaller , with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity , and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced , ' the report said .
