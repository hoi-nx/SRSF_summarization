billionaire entrepreneur richard branson 's virgin may take on tesla and other companies in developing electric cars
richard branson , whose empire ranges from airlines to music stores , mobile phones and spaceships , said electric cars may be next
' we have teams of people working on electric cars , ' richard branson told bloomberg tv in miami where his virgin racing team competed in the all - electric formula e race that involves battery - powered cars
' so you never know , you may find virgin competing with the tesla in the car business as we do in the space business
' we will see what happens
' richard branson 's virgin galactic is a commercial spaceflight company that competes with spacex , which was founded by tesla ceo elon musk
' we are working with the virgin formula e team to develop the plan for next season 's cars , ' virgin spokesman nick fox told reuters
' our aim is to build a leading engine and car for next season
' maybe ultimately that could be used in the broader car market in the future
' in addition to tesla , most of the world 's automakers sell or are developing electric cars
the virgin firm could take on elon musk 's tesla electric car firm , according to richard branson
there are also signs apple may be working on an electric car and google is developing a car that can drive itself
however , broader acceptance of electric cars has been held back by the premium consumers must pay for the technology and fears about the driving range of an all - electric vehicle
richard branson told bloomberg tv , ' tesla is as sexy as any other car on the road today
' the streets snaking through downtown miami 's high rises will be buzzing this saturday as commuters make way for dart - shaped racing cars zooming by at breakneck speeds - and little noise
the race drivers will be competing in the first formula e race in the united states since the all - electric series was launched in beijing in september 2014
halfway through its inaugural season , formula e has offered the same , albeit quieter , thrills as the popular formula one events , with low - slung , opened - wheeled cars capable of speeds up to 136 miles per hour ( 220 kilometers per hour )
the beijing race ended with a spectacular crash that sent one of the $ 500,000 renault sa cars flying
danger and adrenaline are not all that you find on the track , however
' it 's really something to see how racing has evolved to fully electric motors
it could revolutionize racing and transportation in general , ' said daniel fernandez , 17 , who bought tickets with several high school friends to attend the race , which is expected to attract more than 50,000 spectators
the series was launched by jean todt , a french racing icon and former ferrari chief executive who heads of the fia ( fia ) that oversees formula one
it is backed by environmentalist and actor leonardo dicaprio and entrepreneur richard branson , whose virgin sponsors a two - car team
developing a so - called green racing series has meant overhauling how the races are run
car batteries can not be charged mid-race , forcing drivers at some point to rush into a second , fully charged car
the cars give off a high - pitched whistling sound , a bit like a dentist 's drill
drivers also must carefully manage their power , a challenge for race cars with a limited battery life
' we have a target ( power ) consumption per lap and we need to respect that like the bible , ' said jaime alguersuari , a 24 - year - old spanish driver with virgin
' you want to win , but if you burn up all your energy you wo n't finish
