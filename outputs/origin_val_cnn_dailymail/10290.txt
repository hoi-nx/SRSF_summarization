platini has raised the spectre of the heysel disaster and warned of a growing issue of hooligans and political fanatics taking control in football stadiums in uefa
the uefa president , who was on the pitch for juventus at the european cup final in brussels 30 years ago when 39 people - mainly from the italian club - died after rioting liverpool fans charged juventus supporters causing a wall to collapse
platini has called for tougher stadium bans and a european - wide sports police force
speaking at the congress in vienna , platini said : ' uefa is seeing a rise in nationalism and extremism the like of which we have not witnessed for a very long time
platini wants to see a european sports police force introduced to prevent football hooliganism ' this insidious trend can also be observed in our stadiums , as football is a reflection of society
given its popularity , our sport is a barometer for the ills of our continent
and that barometer is pointing to some worrying developments
' i therefore renew my call for greater awareness of this issue among the public authorities , so that we can avoid reliving the dark days of a not - so - distant past - a past where hooligans and all manner of fanatics called the shots in certain european stadiums
' in recent months , we have all been struck by certain images that i thought were a thing of the past
some of us experienced that past at first hand
in my case , it was exactly 30 years ago ... nobody wants a repeat of such events
the heysel disaster took place in 1985 during european cup final between juventus and liverpool 39 fans were killed when they were crushed to death when liverpool fans breached the neutral area most of the fatalities were juventus fans and platini wants to avoid any future incidents like this ' we need tougher stadium bans at european level and - i will say it again - the creation of a european sports police force
' platini also appeared to have a veiled dig at blatter for deciding to run for a fifth term as fifa president despite having said at the congress four years ago that his fourth term would be his last
blatter then described himself as the ' captain of the ship in troubled waters bringing in back on the right route '
the italian , who is himself being re-elected unopposed for a third term , told uefa delegates : ' i regard myself as a simple team - mate - at most your captain
but not the captain of a ship that is being battered by a storm
' dynamo kiev fans clash with riot police during mass fighting in the olympiyski stadium in the europa league kiev 's players were forced to step in and try to calm their fans down which forced the match to be halted sept blatter is preparing to run for a fifth term despite saying that his current one would be his last platini 's printed speech included the words ' clinging to the helm for dear life ' but he dropped that line when he delivered the speech , saying only : ' no. i am simply the captain of a winning team - one that wins because it boasts 54 talented presidents and general secretaries who are prepared to play for each other
' in his speech to the congress on tuesday , blatter made no reference to standing again for fifa president but once again urged football to resist calls to boycott to the 2018 world cup in russia due to its involvement in the civil war in ukraine
blatter said : ' football shall be united , sport shall be united when it comes to boycotts because boycott has never given any results
we have to pay attention to political interference 's
the autonomy of sport must be guaranteed
' platini has experienced first hand football hooliganism when he was on the pitch for the heysel disaster
