one in five homes has ' earned ' more than its owner over the past two years , a study shows
house prices have increased by as much as 40 per cent in some areas in the past two years as the market has recovered , while pay rises have stagnated
now research shows that in a fifth of local council areas , the average rise in property prices in 2013 and 2014 exceeded the take - home pay of an average employee
halifax , part of lloyds banking group , found that homes had earned more than the people living in them in 73 out of 384 local authorities
sixty - eight of these council areas were in london , the south east , and the east of england
there were only five examples of homes ' out - performing ' earnings in wales , the south west and the east midlands , and none in the north east , the north west , the west midlands , or scotland
the most dramatic example was in hammersmith and fulham , where house prices rose by Â£ 143,232 more than their owners earned over the two - year period
homes in the london borough went up by Â£ 199,930 â or 40 per cent â in 2013 and 2014 , easily exceeding average take - home earnings in the area of Â£ 56,698 for the two years
this was closely followed by three other london boroughs : wandsworth , where houses earned Â£ 102,760 more than their owners over the two years ; ealing ( Â£ 90,401 ) ; kensington and chelsea ( Â£ 89,642 )

martin ellis , housing economist at halifax , said : ' this is good news for some homeowners
at the same time , it is challenging news for those looking to buy their first home in such areas , with prices being pushed out of range for many young people
' campbell robb , of housing charity shelter , said : ' this will come as no surprise to the millions of young people and families struggling to scrape together enough to afford a home of their own
' with the government 's own figures showing the cost of a home is now ten times the average wage , it 's no wonder that having a place to put down roots is becoming a fantasy for many
