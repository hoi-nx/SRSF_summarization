a man who shot and killed a pregnant woman claims he should not be punished
dehayes fired a bullet into the head of 25 - year - old katherine hoover as he showed her family his gun collection at his home in florida
witnesses said dehayes spun the .22 caliber revolver around on his forefinger , ' gunslinger - style ' , when it went off , hitting mrs katherine hoover in the head
the state has refused to prosecute because the incident was deemed accidental
and though the victim 's family has launched an appeal to see him tried for manslaughter , dehayes insists he has already been punished enough
' do you know what it âs like to accidentally shoot someone in the head ? ' he said to the daily beast
defending himself : dehayes ( left ) claims he has been punished enough by having to live with the fact that he shot katherine hoover ( right ) in the head as he showed off his gun collection last july ' i have lived through hell ever since
i âve damn near committed suicide several times
i âve been seeing doctors and shrinks
' now everybody âs pegging me as a killer and a murderer or whatever else they want to say about me
i âm not , ok ? ' he added : ' i relive that day , july 26 , 6:30 p.m. , every day , every hour of my life
i hear pops , backfires , people shooting behind me , and i âm scared shitless
' tragic : mrs katherine hoover died hours later , as died her unborn baby
she is survived by her husband and son mrs katherine hoover , whose baby did not survive , was invited over to dehayes 's home with a group of people including her husband carson last summer
after she was hit , she was taken by ambulance to bayfront health brooksville and from there was airlifted to regional medical center bayonet point
once she was there , doctors operated and removed her baby slightly before 8pm , but tragically he was pronounced dead at just after 8.30pm she is survived by her husband and her seven - year - old son nicholas
dehayes concedes that he should have treated every gun as if it were loaded
however , in his opinion , he has learned his lesson - and has since sold his entire gun collection
visit : mr and mrs katherine hoover were invited to see dehayes 's guns on july 26 , 2014
he has since sold them all ' i am very familiar with gun safety and i preach it to my wife and everybody
i âve got no excuses
' that âs part of my nightmare everyday â knowing that i should have checked it and i did nât and somebody had to pay the price â not just me
' mrs katherine hoover 's family insists they will not back down and demand to see justice
but dehayes says nobody understands his position
' there âs a difference between an accident and someone knowingly hurting someone else , ' he told the daily beast
' i âve learned a lesson
for me not to allow any guns in this house whatsoever , for me to almost commit suicide several times because i knew better â no one has a clue what it âs like to live like that every day
