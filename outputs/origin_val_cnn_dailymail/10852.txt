laura robson is set to begin her comeback after spending more than a year out through injury at the miami open later this month
the former british no 1 last played a match at the australian open in january 2014 before undergoing surgery on her left wrist
robson had hoped to be fit for this year 's first grand slam but did not make it and a subsequent plan to return at low - key events in the us , where she has been training , had to be shelved as well
laura robson is set to begin her comeback from a 14 - month injury lay - off by playing in the miami open the 21 - year - old 's name also no longer appears on the entry list for next week 's wta tour event in indian wells but she has been given a wild card into qualifying in miami in a fortnight 's time
