the execution of the only woman on georgia 's death row , kelly gissendaner , was delayed for a second time on monday because the lethal injection was ' cloudy ' georgia has taken the decision to temporarily halt executions after the drug used for lethal injections appeared faulty , authorities said
tuesday 's decision came a day after the execution of kelly gissendaner was delayed for a second time when the execution team found that the lethal pentobarbital dose appeared cloudy
kelly gissendaner , who was convicted of murder in the february 1997 slaying of her husband , had originally been set for execution last week on february 25 , but it was postponed because of a threat of bad weather
the cloudy drug bolstered death penalty opponents , who have been vocal in their opposition after three botched executions in other parts of the country
attorneys for kelly gissendaner said in a filing with the united states supreme court that a lawyer for the state called them around 10:25 p.m. on monday to say the execution would be postponed for several days because the state 's pharmacist had looked at the drug an hour earlier and determined it was cloudy
the state 's lawyer called back about five minutes later to say the prison was n't sure which drugs they had checked , ' this week 's or last week 's , ' and that they were considering going forward , the filing says
the lawyer called a third time , saying ' this particular batch ( of drugs ) just did n't come out like it was supposed to ' and they were n't going to proceed , according to the court filing
the cloudy drug bolstered death penalty opponents , who have been vocal in their opposition after three botched executions in other parts of the country about 11 p.m. , the state told reporters an independent lab checked its potency and it was acceptable , but it later appeared cloudy and the execution was postponed ' out of an abundance of caution
' the back and forth was detailed in kelly gissendaner 's emergency motion for a stay
corrections spokeswoman gwendolyn hogan said ' there was never any confusion within the department about the drugs which were to be used , ' but also indicated the department was not part of the conversations between the attorney general 's office and defense attorneys
georgia attorney general sam olens said in a statement it is ' essential that executions are carried out in a constitutional manner ' and that he approved of the decision to temporarily suspend executions
the cloudiness could be contamination by bacteria or some impurity , said jay , a professor at the university of north carolina 's eshelman school of pharmacy
if the particles were big enough , they could clog blood vessels when injected or could lodge in the lungs , jay said
it could also make the drug less potent , making an inmate very sleepy but not kill them , he said
locked away : kelly gissendaner ( pictured in 2004 ) would have become the 16th female prisoner to be executed in the united states since the death penalty was reinstated nationwide in 1976 ' if it 's a solution that 's supposed to be clear and it 's not clear , it should never be injected , ' jay said
' so they did the right thing by not injecting it
' compounded drugs have a shelf life of 30 days , jay said
corrections officials declined to say when the department obtained the drug or when it was set to expire
georgia and other death penalty states have bought execution drugs from compounding pharmacies in recent years after pharmaceutical companies stopped selling to united states prisons
and many of them have adopted laws to hide the identity of their drug providers , saying those laws are necessary to protect their suppliers and maintain a source of the drugs
critics say executions should be as transparent as possible
the cloudy drug ' raises significant concerns about georgia 's ability to carry out executions in compliance with the constitution , but we do n't know what really happened , ' said mccracken of the university of california , berkeley , school of law 's death penalty clinic
' because of the secrecy surrounding georgia 's procedures , it is impossible to say if this is indicative of a larger problem , ' she said
richard dieter , executive director of the death penalty information center , which tracks data on executions , said he 's never heard of an execution being halted at the last minute because of a problem with the drug itself
murder : kelly gissendaner ( pictured , left , in her arrest mugshot from 1997 ) had been due to be executed for plotting the murder of her husband , douglas
however , it was her boyfriend owen ( right ) who carried out the deed
he will be eligible for parole in eight years after accepting a life sentence and testifying against kelly gissendaner missouri and texas are also actively using compounded pentobarbital in a one - drug formula for executions , and south dakota has also used this method , mccracken said
other states have been using a three - drug combination starting with the sedative midazolam
but executions in those states are mostly on hold pending a united states supreme court ruling in an oklahoma case sparked by a botched execution there
prosecutors said kelly gissendaner repeatedly pushed her on - again , off - again lover owen to kill her husband , douglas gissendaner
owen ambushed her husband while she went out with friends , forced him to drive to a remote area and stabbed him multiple times
owen and kelly gissendaner then met up and set fire to the dead man 's car
both initially denied involvement , but owen eventually confessed and testified against his former girlfriend
owen is serving a life prison sentence and is eligible for parole in eight years
monster meal : kelly gissendaner ( pictured , above , eating a regular prison meal ) had just finished eating the enormous spread she had requested for her last meal - including two cheeseburger meals , two large orders of fries , cornbread , popcorn and ice cream - when it was announced that the execution was n't going ahead georgia houses one of the country 's biggest prison systems , supervising nearly 55,000 state prisoners and more than 160,000 people on probation
gissandaner would have become the 16th female prisoner to be executed in the united states since the death penalty was reinstated nationwide in 1976 , compared with 1,387 men who have been put to death during that period , according to the death penalty information center
georgia has executed 57 prisoners since 1976 , including two so far this year
prisoner complaints from the southern state had led to the 1972 moratorium on the death penalty , before it was re-established four years later .
