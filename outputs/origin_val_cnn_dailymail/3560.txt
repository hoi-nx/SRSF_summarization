from peacocks to birds of paradise , male birds are well known for showing off their brightly coloured plumage as a way of attracting a mate
however , new research has suggested that males birds may actually be growing less distinct from their female counterparts over time
the findings challenge a key element of the evolutionary theory that was first proposed by charles darwin 156 years ago
male and female choco toucan 's ( pictured above ) both share the same brightly coloured plumage , suggesting another force other than sexual selection is driving the evolution of bright colours in feathers of some birds rather than the bright colours of male birds appearing because of sexual selection - where a trait evolves over time because it is seen as attractive or a signal of fitness by the opposite sex - other forces of natural selection are at work
the researchers say that the environment a species lives in , how it cares of its young and migratory behaviour appear to influence a species plumage
peacock tails may be hard to miss , but humans are unaware of the noise created by the bird 's pretty plumage
scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear
male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate
researchers at the university of manitoba in winnipeg , canada , have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them
most humans hear noises between 20 and 20,000 hertz
when peacocks shake their tale feathers , most humans hear a rustling sound
but the scienitsts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels , according to the study published in the journal animal behaviour
male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers , with males shrieking out in response
experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound , but know that some can feel vibration through their legs
professor dunn , a biologist at the university of wisconsin-milwaukee , said : ' a lot of research has focused on how plumage color is related to mating success , especially in males
' so this should hopefully get researchers to think more about how color affects survival , especially predation and foraging success , in both sexes
' the debate over the differences in colour between species of birds has raged ever since the time of charles darwin and wallace
while charles darwin based his theory of sexual selection on the idea that brightly coloured males were preferred by females , giving them a competitive advantage , wallace pointed out that in many species females are as brilliantly coloured as the male
he suggested instead that the differences between the sexes - known as sexual dichromatism - were the result of females needing better camouflage to prevent their nests from being raided by predators
some scientists have also puzzled at how bright plumage in males can have evolved when it potentially makes them a more visible target for predators
this would suggest that sexual preference for bright colours plays a more powerful role in determining the evolution of a species than other pressures
in an attempt to test these ideas , professor dunn and his colleagues decided to analyse the plumage of 977 species of bird - around 10 per cent of all known species
using museum specimens , they measured the spectrum of light reflected from the plumage of both male and female birds
they found that on the whole males tended to have brighter feathers than females
male northern cardinals usually have bright red plumage ( left ) while females are a drab grey or brown ( right ) this male gouldian finch has bright and vibrant plumage
females have similar colours but are not as bright but in about 45 per cent of bird species both sexes had plumage that the same level of brightness
by looking at where the birds sat in the phylogenetic tree , however , they were able to conclude that over evolutionary time the colour difference between species appears to have declined
in some cases males have become duller in their colours while in others females have evolved brighter plumage
they found both sexes would have duller plumage when the birds tended have more sedentary behaviour or bred in the tropics or had young that needed more care , and in species where males played little role in caring for young
peacocks have brightly coloured plumage that they shake to attract the much duller coloured peahens to mate writing in the journal science advances , professor dunn and his colleagues said : ' although most studies of bird plumage focus on dichromatism , evolutionary change has most often led to similar , rather than different , plumage in males and females
' overall , both natural and sexual selection have influenced the evolution of bird coloration , but in many respects , they have acted on two different axes : sexual selection on an axis of sexual differences and natural selection on an axis of color ( for example , dull or bright ) in both sexes
' thus , debate about the causes of variation in bird coloration may be resolved by recognizing that natural and sexual selection have generally acted on two different axes
' biologists have been baffled as to how male iberian emerald lizards have evolved their vivid blue and green colouring
while the brightly coloured skin it useful for attracting a mate , it should also make them easy for predators to spot
however , researchers from the university of valencia in spain and the unviersity of porto , portugal , have found that these 15 inch long lizards have a secret weapon against hungry birds of prey - their own cloaking device
they discovered that the lizards ' skin is iridescent and reflects light in different ways depending on the angle it is viewed from
when viewed from above , the creatures blend into their background and become almost invisible to birds
however , when viewed from ground level , the lizards still stand out brightly - meaning fellow lizards can easily spot those looking for mate
iberian emerald lizard 's skin makes the invisible from above but gives them bright colours at ground level
