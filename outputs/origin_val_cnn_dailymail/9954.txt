most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient 's skin entering the surgical wound scientists in the u.s. have devised an implant in a tiny silk ' purse ' that kills infections after surgery and then dissolves in the body
up to four in 100 people undergoing surgery in the uk will develop an infection , and this can prolong hospital stays by as much as nine days
surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions after operations , according to a study published last month
most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient 's skin entering the surgical wound
the most common culprits are staphylococcus aureus bacteria , responsible for 20 per cent of surgical site infections , coagulase negative staphylococcus , and enterococcus bacteria
the infection can usually be treated with antibiotics but sometimes patients need more complex treatment , including further surgery
the new implant uses heat to kill off bacteria
it consists of a tiny , magnesium coil wrapped in a pocket of silk protein , and is implanted during surgery - if the patient later shows sign of infection , the implant can be switched on using a remote control
this raises the temperature of the coil
the silk protein protects the coil - both harmlessly dissolve in the body over the next fortnight
this is an improvement on previous medical implant devices , which are made from non-degradable materials that need to be removed
researchers at tufts university have used the implant in mice infected with staphylococcus aureus , raising its temperature for two periods of ten minutes
within 24 hours the tissue was infection - free
the device , including the coil , completely dissolved after 15 days
' this is an important step forward for the development of on - demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely , ' the researchers said
' these wireless strategies could help manage post-surgical infection , for example , or pave the way for eventual " wi-fi " drug delivery
' the team has also carried out experiments using remote control to deliver antibiotics to treat e.coli and staphylococcus aureus
stella vig , consultant vascular and general surgeon at croydon university hospital , said : ' this is an exciting new concept and an innovative tool against the war of surgical site infection
this new purse could allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device the concept of reducing bacterium within the tissues and thereby reducing risk of infections is not new , and was previously achieved by deploying antibiotic beads within the tissues
these required retrieval and therefore are not used routinely
' this new device would allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device , which then disappears without the need for surgery to remove it
' surgical site infections are costly as they increase the length of stay for patients and can lead to further surgery
' meanwhile , a team at the university of south florida has developed a new antibiotic to fight the superbug methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa , which kills thousands of people worldwide each year
the bug is a form of staphylococcus aureus which does not respond to the usual antibiotics
the new treatment is based on a class of drugs called quinazolines , which have been used in treating malaria and cancer
they have recently been shown to act on bacteria , too
' in recent years , mrsa has become resistant to vancomycin , our most valuable treatment option against staphylococcal infections , ' said dr lindsey n. shaw , whose team developed the new drugs
' bacterial disease remains the second - leading cause of death globally , especially among children and the elderly
' we need new drugs to fight these infections
