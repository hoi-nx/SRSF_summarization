weighing in at three times the average cat , most would presume ludo the maine coon cat was fully grown
but the super-sized feline , who tips the scales at 24.5lbs ( 11kg ) and is 45 inches long , is only 17 months old and is set to continue growing
ludo belongs to kelsey and matthew gill from ryhill , west yorkshire , who bought him from a breeder around a year ago
â but as the months went on , we noticed he quickly overtook our other cats , who are a few years older than him , and he âs now double the size of them
â he âs a lovely cat - he âs very friendly and affectionate but some people who visit are scared of him as they âre used to seeing dogs that size , not cats
â when i pick him up , it âs like picking up a baby â he âs huge â the maine coon belongs to kelsey and matthew gill from ryhill , west yorkshire , who bought him from a breeder around a year ago she said : â i âm not sure if he âs the biggest in britain yet , but he âs definitely close
â we realised he could be one of the biggest when my husband looked it up on the internet and found ludo was slightly above all the other cats , â there âs a debate about when they stop growing , but he âs only 17 months so i think he âs still got a lot of growing to do
i ca nât imagine how big he will get
â it âs strange as our other cats are much smaller but they eat so much more than he does
â the breeder we got him from told us his relative was the longest cat
â â we âve had maine coon âs for a while , but never one this big
the other two maine coon âs that we have at the moment are much smaller than ludo and they âre about four years old
he overtook them in weight and size when he was five months old and he was 18 pounds at nine months
â even though he âs huge , he âs so friendly and lovable
he âll often come over and lay on the bed or flop out on the floor to be stroked
â he does nât cost us anymore than the other two as he does nât eat that much - the smallest one eats the most
he just has a standard amount of the maine coon royal canin cat food
mrs kelsey gill , 28 , who runs a chip shop with her husband , said : â when we bought ludo , he was no bigger than any of the other kittens in his litter as maine coon âs are quite chunky as kittens ' â although he âs big , we âre still able to pick him up and take him places if we want , but he is very heavy
