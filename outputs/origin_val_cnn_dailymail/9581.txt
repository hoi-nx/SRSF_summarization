nike appears to have missed the mark with its new women 's sportswear collection which many female athletes claim is incredibly insulting because of the overtly girly designs
the iconic sportswear company teamed up with japanese fashion label sacai for the eight - piece nikelab x sacai capsule collection , which the brand debuted last month , but many women were left outraged by the impractical pieces , a majority of which retail for $ 200 or more
' nike called it a â bold expression of femininity "
in reality , it âs comical and insulting to female athletes everywhere , ' writer megan wiegand said in a piece for slate
' others have taken to social media to air their grievances with pieces featuring excessive amounts of pleated , billowy fabric that is sure to get in any athletes way - no matter what the activity
' seriously , that nike women 's line is hideous
women 's athletic wear needs improving , but this is not an improvement
capes ? dresses ? wtf ! ( sic ) ' one commenter wrote on twitter
new wings : the billowy fabric on these pieces from the line can be seen flowing in the as the model runs forward not a fan : this commenter tweeted that the entire collection was ' horrifying ' party out back : this jacket looks normal in the front but features plenty of pleated fabric from behind bizarre pairing : this royal blue sweatshirt and skirt combination features matching transparent pleats and a hint of hunter green another woman tweeted : ' ew
yeah , that new nike women 's fashion line is a miss. ' someone else joked that the skirt - filled collection : ' looks very practical
' however , sacai âs founder abe explained on nike 's website that wearability was a significant consideration in her designs
surprise detail : this sweatshirt has a cut - out in the back that showcases a transparent camisole - like top impractical design : this twitter user joked that the nikelab x sacai collection is perfect as long as you are not trying to work out high - tech : the back of this sweatshirt is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges , and according to the nike website , the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed not a fan : this commenter simply said ' ew ' after seeing the brand 's latest designs proud artist : sacai âs founder abe posed next a model who was wearing her designs for nike ' the idea of functionality is important to me , as is fabric innovation , which has always been at the heart of sacai , ' ms abe said
' for me , nike is an original icon with performance and innovation at its core
it has been inspiring to work together
' indeed , ms abe claims that the flamboyant - looking fabrics and over-the - top embellishments on each of the designs has been added in order to enhance the performance of the athlete
the back of one sweatshirt , for example , is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges , and according to the nike website , the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed by abe and the brand
' the garments come to life as the wearer walks and moves , expressing both beauty and strength
we feel it âs a perfect marriage between sport and style , ' kurt parker , vp / creative director , nike sportswear , said on the site
pricey sweats : many of the pieces in the collection , including this sweatshirt and skirt , retail for $ 200 or more pants free : this critic joked that the collection 's many pleated skirts looked ' very practical ' interesting accessories : the line 's pleated skirts were paired with fishnet knee high socks that are not for sale odd couple : this simple black nike t - shirt was pairs with this tearaway skirt design and not everyone is disgusted by the collection
when sacai shared photos of the designs on its instagram page earlier this week , many of the label 's fashion fans had positive comments about the collaboration
' sporty clothes i can get into , ' one person wrote
another commenter wrote : ' love the skirt ! ' not quite right : this looks like a normal sweatshirt dress until you see the extra white fabric and lace detailing that extends from behind added details : a grey sweatshirt from the line features a feminine touch of white peplum in the back new shoes : the nikelab x sacai partnership also debuted a new interpretation of the iconic air max , which turned the classic kicks into a slip - on sneakers
