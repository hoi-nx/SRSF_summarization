with his kiss makeup on , frontman gene simmons always looked a little scary
so maybe this new venture makes sense
the rocker and reality - show star is teaming with wwe studios to launch erebus pictures , a label that will finance and produce horror movies
the joint venture kicks off with a three - picture deal starting with " temple , " expected to begin shooting this summer
" the horror genre continues to fascinate me as it proves to be endlessly thrilling and engaging for audiences , " said gene simmons , who with kiss has sold more than 100 million albums worldwide
erebus pictures is named after the greek mythological deity that personifies darkness
it has a logical marketing platform in the wwe network , a subscription - based streaming service known for pro-wrestling shows such as " monday night raw " and " smackdown " that appeal to primarily young male fans , arguably the core of the horror - movie audience
wwe studios says " temple " is about a team of highly trained operatives who find themselves trapped inside an isolated military compound after its artificial intelligence is suddenly shut down
while investigating the source of the malfunction , the crew begins to experience strange and horrific phenomena as they try to uncover who or what killed the team previously stationed at the compound
the studio says a director for " temple " will be announced shortly
erebus pictures ' second feature will go into production later this year
wwe studios ' most lucrative film has been " the call , " a 2013 thriller starring halle berry , which earned $ 68 million worldwide .
