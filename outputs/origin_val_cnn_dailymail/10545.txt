a religious cult that isolates followers from the ' evil ' outside world has defended its practices after a family of 14 fled declaring they had been living in a ' false system '
james walked out on the gloriavale christian community , located in haupiri on new zealand 's west coast , suddenly at the weekend with his wife hope and 12 children

we only want people who want to be here , ' fervent stedfast , a gloriavale member since 1970 , said

' it comes as the daughter of gloriavale 's leader , neville cooper , spoke out for the first time since leaving the remote community about her struggles to reintegrate in the ' outside world '
miracle left the cult , which forces people to wear the same uniform and bans birth control , five years ago with her husband and 10 children , 3news reports
miracle said there was no doubt the james family would struggle like she did to integrate into society
' making a decision to come on the outside you leave with basically the clothes on your back , ' she said
' i think the biggest struggle is at our age - i was 45 - and to start life from scratch , normally you would have built up a life from a young age
' the struggle is just so hard
' you do nât know any obligations to renting a home , opening bank accounts
you do nât even have a birth certificate or driver âs licence â or any identity to even be able to do those things
