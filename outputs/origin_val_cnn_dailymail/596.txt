in 2001 , then - new york city mayor giuliani said kerik was like a brother to him , at the police commissioner 's nypd retirement ceremony
but just five years later , as he was accused of ethics violations and conspiracy charges , kerik learned that giuliani 's friendship was anything but as strong as blood
in his new memoir from jailer to jailed , due out tuesday and excerpted in the new york daily news , kerik details his fall from grace and how giuliani cut ties not only with him , but with his wife and daughters - one of whom is giuliani 's goddaughter
from friends to strangers : disgraced for new york city police commissioner kerik says ex-nyc mayor giuliani abandoned him and his family once he was hit with legal woes in the mid- 2000s
the two pictured above on saturday night live following 9/11 ( kerik on the left , giuliani on the right ) abandoning his own goddaughter : kerik says giuliani completely cut ties not only with him but with his family , including his daughter celine who is giuliani 's goddaughter

but in june of that year , kerik went from being a 9/11 hero to a corrupt city official on the cover of tabloids when the bronx district attorney 's office hit him with two ethics code violations - one for not disclosing a personal loan on his conflict - of - interest report and the other for accepting renovations on his home from a new jersey company vying for city work
it was in november that kerik first started to feel the cold shoulder from the giuliani camp
writer : in his memoir from jailer to jailed ( cover , left ) , due out tuesday , kerik details how he sent giuliani a bronco buster statue ( stock image right ) for christmas in 2006 and had the gift sent back with no explanation kerik says he was sitting in his office one day when his then 6 - year - old daughter celine came in and asked to send her godfather a present - one befitting a possible future president of the u.s.
' given that my daughter celine was only six years old at the time , she had no idea of the difference between a democrat and a republican
all she knew was that people were saying that her godfather was going to be the next president of the u.s.
disgraced : kerik was sent to prison in 2010 after pleading guilty to felony tax and false statement charges
pictured above at a press conference in november 2007 ' she was talking about it twenty - four hours a day , as if that were the only thing going on in her little world
she had no idea of what this really meant , of course , but she was convinced that giuliani was going to be president , ' kerik writes
remembering a previous visit to the white house to meet president george w bush , celine asked to give her godfather a bronco buster statue - just like the one she saw in oval office during her visit
the two picked out a statuette and sent it to giuliani with a handmade card from celine ahead of kerik 's out - of - town trip to london
by the time he returned though , kerik was having a hard time getting in contact with giuliani
kerik had promised his daughter that they could see her godfather during their annual holiday - time stay in new york city and when giuliani did n't return his calls , kerik ' did n't have the hard to tell celine '
kerik fully got the message when soon after he found a box containing the statue returned to his front step
' i just did nât understand it
what bothered me more than anything was that whoever sent it back took the girls â card and did nât have the courtesy to send a note back with the box , ' kerik recalls
what 's more - giuliani failed to send his daughters birthday or christmas cards like he did every year - and they have n't received one since
the next year , kerik was hit with even more allegations - this time for conspiracy , tax fraud and making false statements during his department of homeland security appointment
in 2009 , he pleaded guilty to eight felony tax and false statement charges and was sent to the minimum - security prison camp in cumberland , maryland on may 17 , 2010 - where he spent the next nearly three years
kerik says what bothers him most about his sudden estrangement from giuliani , is the fact that the former new york city mayor abandoned his wife and daughter when they needed his support the most
' during my time in cumberland , giuliani never once called hala [ kerik 's wife ] to speak with the girls
he never tried calling any mutual friend of ours to check up on them , ask how they were doing
there were no christmas or birthday cards
' my safe guess is that as a former u.s. attorney giuliani had a sense of what the separation of incarceration does to families â yet not once did he call to help in any way , ' kerik writes
before he was jailed , kerik held positions as the corrections commissioner of new york city , new york city police commissioner and interim iraqi minister of the interior
giuliani ran as a republican in the 2008 presidential primary but lost the party nomination to arizona senator john mccain .
