rihanna , madonna , beyonce , usher , daft punk , arcade fire , jack white and kanye west joined a host of other stars as they were revealed as co-owners of the subscription service , which is the brainchild of jay z unlike rivals spotify , the service will not have a free tier - meaning the musicians stand to make more money from it
unlike spotify there is n't a free service
it is being offered to u.s. users at two price points : about $ 9.95 for standard sound quality and $ 19.99 for ' lossless high fidelity sound quality
' tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of spotify , which offers lower levels for free users
alicia keys said the artists hope tidal will ' forever change the course of music history ' and ensure the viability of the industry at monday 's launch event in new york city
the celebrities - which also included nicki minaj , jason aldean , usher , arcade fire and deadmau5 - stood in a line , and in solidarity by mostly wearing black onstage as keys spoke to the audience at skylight at moynihan station in manhattan
keys called the event ' a graduation
' ' so we come together before you on this day , march 30th , 2015 , with one voice in unity in the hopes that today will be another one of those moments in time , a moment that will forever change the course of music history
' for today we announce of tidal , the first ever artist - owned , global music and entertainment platform , ' keys said

tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of spotify , which offers lower levels for free users
earlier claims were made that tidal offers artists double the streaming rates of its rival
however , the firm has confirmed if this is still the case
signing on : madonna climbs on the table as she signs a document as one of the high profile co-owners of the new service the difference means that tidal offers higher sound quality for audiophiles with advanced sound systems - but that casual listeners using simple laptops or smartphones may face slower connections
the venue for the event was transformed to display a walkway paying tribute to the different decades in music , starting with the 1950s
coldplay 's chris martin and calvin harris , who both appeared via video , are also co-owners
' our mission goes beyond commerce , it goes beyond technology
' our intent is to preserve music 's importance in our lives , ' keys said
' music is the language of love , of laughter , of heartbreak , of mystery
it 's the world 's true , true , without question , universal language

the artists hope the service can compete with platforms including spotify and apple 's soon - to - be revamped music service involving beats music
streaming - which allows users to play unlimited on - demand music online - has quickly shaken up the industry , narrowly edging out cd sales in revenues last year in the u.s.
industry leader spotify says it has 60 million users with 15 million of them paying - generally $ 10 a month
spotify already has a range of rivals including u.s. - based rhapsody and google play
paris - based deezer is the second larger service with 6 million customers
it is strong in europe and last year entered the u.s. as a high - end - only service
the most recent numbers for tidal are at 540,000 , according to the company
like tidal , deezer 's elite service uses flac files which are larger than mp3s , which are most common for music
all onboard : rihanna , nicki minaj and madonna hope to profit from the new service apple - which pioneered digital music through itunes in 2001 - is reportedly also looking to launch a new streaming service as the market shifts away from permanent downloads
apple earlier made a bid for streaming customers by buying beats electronics , run by another rap mogul , dr. dre
along with the u.s. , tidal runs in major markets including united kingdom and france and plans to launch later this year in australia and germany
alicia keys asked the crowd to : ' think about how many times music has personally picked you up and reminded you that you can do it again
' ' music speaks to all of us , ' she said
' music brings us together , it connects us all
' music is so powerful - that is what tidal will be
a place for connection between artists and fans
