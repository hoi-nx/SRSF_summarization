leicester , english richard iii , the king found beneath a car parking lot , has been reburied in a solemn but celebratory service , 530 years after his death in battle
the remains of the medieval monarch were sensationally rediscovered beneath a blanket of tarmac in the center of leicester in august 2012
they have been pored over by scientists at the city 's university ever since , but after more than two years of legal wranglings , the bones were finally laid to rest thursday in a coffin built by richard iii 's distant relative , ibsen , whose dna helped prove their identity
it was standing room - only at leicester cathedral -- which had been partially rebuilt for the occasion -- as archbishop of canterbury justin welby led prayers for the long - dead king , swinging incense and sprinkling holy water over the casket , before scattering it with earth from key locations marking his birth , life and death
oscar - nominated actor benedict cumberbatch , a distant cousin of english 's last king , read a poem dedicated to richard iii , written by poet laureate carol ann duffy
" my bones , scripted in light , upon cold soil , a human braille
my skull , scarred by a crown , emptied of history
describe my soul as incense , votive , vanishing ; your ownthe same
grant me the carving of my name
" queen elizabeth , represented at the ceremony by the countess of wessex , sent a special message to mark the reinterment , which she hailed as " an event of great national and international significance
" " today we recognize a king who lived through turbulent times and whose christan faith sustained him in life and death , " it read
but though it bore many of the hallmarks of grief -- polished coffin , empty tomb , relatives clad in gloomy , pitch - dark suits -- this was not , the organizers insisted , a sad occasion
" this is not a funeral at which we mourn , " said professor campbell , of the university of leicester , welcoming the congregation to the cathedral , just yards from that famous parking lot
instead , the aim of the service was to offer richard iii a fitting farewell , and a lasting memorial -- neither of which he was granted following his death at bosworth in 1485
back then , his body was slung over a horse and carried back to leicester -- legend has it that his head struck bow bridge on the way -- before being put on display for three days , to prove to friends and foes alike that he really was dead , before being slung into a hastily - dug grave at the church of the grey friars
now richard iii 's bones , accompanied by a specially - crafted rosary , recognizing his catholic faith , rest in a lead - lined coffin of english oak , his grave marked by a 2.3 ton block of pale swaledale fossil limestone resting on a plinth of black kilkenny marble carved with his name , dates , coat of arms , and his symbol : a white boar
speaking before the commemorations , philippa langley , founder of the " looking for richard " project , said she did not expect to feel upset at the reinterment : " richard iii died over 500 years ago , so i do n't think there will be a sense of sadness there at all
i hope there 's perhaps some joy , that something has been done well and right and that we 've made peace with the past
" but ibsen admitted he found sunday 's service at which the remains were carried in to the cathedral surprisingly moving : " there was a slight dampening of the eyeballs , which caught me completely unawares , " he said phlegmatically
" leicester born and bred " sisters foster and sharon stirling were among the crowds waiting outside the cathedral to listen in on the service and catch a glimpse of the guests arriving
" this is history , is n't it , it 's never going to happen again , " said foster
" we grew up with all the stories of richard iii we lived close to bow bridge , so we know all the legends about him
" stirling said she thought the richard iii story would be a big bonus for the city : " i think it will boost the economy and bring visitors in -- he 's got quite a fan club , after all
" leicester has always been proud of its links to richard iii ; the city boasts pubs and schools named in his honor , there 's a walking tour and a brand new visitor center built over his original grave
but in recent days , interest has risen to fever pitch : shop windows are full of richard iii - themed displays offering everything from wooden toy castles to chain mail jewelery
the florist around the corner from the cathedral is doing a roaring trade in white roses , which people have been leaving at richard iii 's statue , and his face is emblazoned on all manner of souvenirs , from paperweights and pens to mugs and bars of chocolate
there 's even a " return of the king " beer -- locally brewed and promising " a distinctive regal flavor
" some 35,000 people lined the bunting - and - flag - draped streets of leicester and its surrounding villages on sunday to watch as the king 's coffin was carried in a procession out to the scene of his death and back again
another 20,000 lined up for hours to file past the casket and pay their respects as it lay " in repose " at the cathedral in the days since , watched over by an honor guard of veterans
among them was jane gregory , who traveled two hours by bus from her home in south derbyshire twice in a week to be there
" it was just something i had to see and experience -- it 's part of history , " she told cnn outside the reburial service on thursday
" i came on monday too , to view the coffin -- it was a great experience
i queued for two and a half hours and it was worth every minute
" history enthusiast paul eames stood in the drizzle and watched the service on his ipad after missing out on a ticket -- to his wife karen : " i applied for tickets for both of us ; i could have cried when i saw the envelope with her name on it
" " i did n't originally want to go , " karen admitted , smiling
" but he told me ' you 'll be part of history , you do n't realize ! ' the service was amazing , really lovely
" not everyone was there just to celebrate richard iii , though
leicester student sherry xie said she was " proud " of her university 's role in the discovery of his bones , but she and her classmate wendy jiang admitted they 'd come along with an ulterior motive : " to see benedict cumberbatch ! " in his sermon , the bishop of leicester , stevens said those who had joined the commemorations " ( came ) not to judge , condemn or praise , but to stand in silent , humble and reverent attentiveness at the meeting place of time and eternity
" stevens said the search for richard iii had " broken open not just a car park , but a nation 's story
" it also provoked bitter quarrels between rival factions over where and how he should be buried , and how much scientific testing he should be subjected to
but campbell insisted that the service was held in a " spirit of reconciliation , " a thought echoed by stevens : " whether we bear a white or a red rose , whether for richard iii or henry ... whether for leicester or york , we recognize at the graveside that all our journeys lead us to this place , where reputation counts for nothing and all human striving turns to dust
" langley , the driving force behind the search for the king , said thursday 's service would mark the end of one chapter in the long - running saga ; but she said work to re-examine richard iii 's life and legacy would go on
" it 's the conclusion to his story in that he 's been found ... and we 're laying his physical remains to rest
but in terms of richard iii 's story , that is only just beginning
