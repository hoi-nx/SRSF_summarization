across the under 18 , under 19 and under 21 age groups , the three lions youth international has found the net 22 times this campaign
chelsea , the defending champions in the under 21 league , were hoping to leapfrog a cluster of clubs and claim top spot as they headed to the deva stadium in chester on monday night
but sinclair and liverpool had other ideas
after just eight minutes , sinclair used his abundant pace to get in behind the blues defence and was wrestled to the ground by tomori
harry wilson , another highly - rated player , converted the spot - kick
sinclair 's unpredictable movement had been a headache all night and , shortly after half - time , he again burst past tomori and finished high into the net from an acute angle
sinclair gets away from the chelsea back line during liverpool 's 2 - 0 win on monday night sinclair scored twice as liverpool 's under 19s beat ludogorets razgrad in the uefa youth league it was the assured finish of a player in the best form of his life and someone well on the way to achieving his obvious potential
this was just one example of the many types of goal sinclair is capable of and a small glimpse into the buzz around a 18 - year - old coaches at anfield believe can become the next raheem sterling
sinclair already holds the distinction of being the youngest player to turn out for liverpool , making his senior debut with a nine - minute cameo in a league cup tie at west brom in september 2012
he was a tender 16 years and six days old
although that remains sinclair 's one and only senior outing , he has been making great strides at youth team and under 21 level
born in birmingham in september 1996 , sinclair was a member of the west brom academy between the ages of 10 and 14 before being spotted by former liverpool club scout stuart webber
sinclair gets beyond manchester united 's joe riley in an under 18 premier league match last season he spent the 2011 - 2012 campaign mainly with the under 16 side but made a handful of appearances for the under 18 team towards the end
his coach mike marsh was impressed by his talent and a 15 - year - old sinclair was even invited to rub shoulders with the likes of jamie carragher and steven gerrard at melwood , something he later described as a ' great learning curve
' it was n't long before sinclair found his scoring boots , with a prolific pre-season in 2012 leading to a call up into the squad rodolfo borrell was about to lead into the nextgen series
sinclair impressed in the first group match away to inter milan , winning a penalty that krisztian adorjan converted and going close himself on a number of occasions
liverpool were narrowly beaten 3 - 2 in that game but went on to advance from the group , sinclair scoring his first goal in continental competition in a 4 - 1 win over rosenborg
sinclair is challenged by alex davey of chelsea in a fa youth cup semi-final in april 2013 these appearances came either side of that first team run - out at the hawthorns , a moment sinclair described as a ' dream come true ' in a later interview
but things have really taken off for sinclair this season , with six goals in the group phase of the under 19 uefa youth league amongst his haul
the youngster has credited another club legend , robbie , as a massive influence on his development with his coaching sessions at the club 's melwood training ground
sinclair told the liverpool echo last week : ' robbie is a legend at this club so to get a few helpful tips from him and some advice is brilliant for me
sinclair takes on ro-shaun williams during an under 18 match with manchester united this season ' this is a guy who has been there and done it and played at the pinnacle of the game
it 's fantastic for me to get the chance to work with him and it can only improve my game
' he has given me a few little tips on my first touch , and worked with me on different types of finishing
he is always there to help me in any way he can
' internationally , sinclair has represented three lions at under 16 and under 17 level
his debut came in the victory shield in october 2011 , when wales were beaten 4 - 0
his first goals for the three lions came at the 2012 montaigu tournament in france , helping to secure wins against the hosts and also morocco
sinclair breaks through the italy defence during an under 17s international in burton back in 2012 as shown of late , sinclair is already a good finisher and has a knack of getting into the right place at the right time to gobble up loose balls
he seems strong on both feet when in and around the penalty area and has good placement
at 5ft 8in , sinclair wo n't win a great deal in their air but he has tricky feet and good acceleration too , so he fits in with the fluid passing game the liverpool academy try to foster
and the signs look promising that sinclair will be the next bright youngster to come through liverpool 's academy ranks .
