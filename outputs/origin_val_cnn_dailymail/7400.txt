the first wife of professor stephen has said the government needs a ' big overhaul ' of its policy towards disabled people and has also called for a ' stronger tax policy ' to enable more funding
hawking said money from ' firms who make millions in this country and yet do not pay any tax ' should go towards those who need it
but speaking at a mnda ( mnda ) reception at buckingham palace , ms hawking said she is not optimistic that anything will change
prof hawking was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease ( mnd ) in 1964 at the age of 22 and given just a few years to live
now aged 73 and despite his illness leaving him almost completely paralysed , he is celebrated as one of the most brilliant scientists of the modern age

' asked if enough is being done to support patients with the disease and what needs to change , she said : ' i think they 're doing very well considering that there 's very little support for disabled people and their families from the government
' i think the government needs to do a big overhaul of its policy towards disabled people , towards people with degenerative illnesses and it needs to provide much better support and it needs to have a system for vetting carers who go into people 's homes
' asked if she sees that changing , ms hawking , who is played by felicity jones in the theory of everything , said : ' no , not at the moment , but i do think that a stronger tax policy , taxing firms who make millions in this country and yet do not pay any tax ... the money should go towards this very particular cause
' ms hawking said she does not think the result of the general election will change anything either
the theory of everything is based on the memoir travelling to infinity : my life with stephen , which was written by ms hawking
it looks back to their days as cambridge students in the early 1960s , when the then - cosmology undergraduate was first diagnosed with motor neurone disease , which went on to rob him of most physical movements
cumberbatch played professor hawking in 2003 bbc drama ' hawking ' and has been a patron of the mnda charity for 11 years reflecting on how she has been thrust into the limelight following the success of the film - for which eddie redmayne won an oscar for playing prof hawking - she said : ' it 's been very exciting and it 's a once in a lifetime opportunity so i think i can cope with it
it has meant that life has been very , very busy , very full , not a moment to spare
' asked if she had any concerns about the film being made , she said : ' of course i did , but i would not allow the film to go ahead
each time anthony mccarten , the producer , came to see me from 2004 onwards i said no every year
no , no , no. ' until in 2013 he said well we 've got an invitation to go to working title , the best british film company , so i said right we go
and i was so impressed with the sensitivity that they were bringing to bear on the project that i said yes we 'll go ahead
' previously the time was n't right for the family , for stephen , for me , but then the time was right
' and how did she feel the first time she watched the film ? ' overwhelmed
it was beautiful , ' she said
other guests at the event included victoria wood ( far left ) and michael ball ms hawking greeted her ex-husband in the buckingham palace 's white drawing room where the 41 guests , including the princess royal , mingled before dinner

he stayed close to the side of new wife hunter for most of the event and also put his arm around her
in 2014 cumberbatch took part in six ice bucket challenges to help raise money the actor said : ' i 'm very proud to still be involved - alongside stephen - with the mnd association today , ' hunter was wearing a full - length navy gown - complete with patterned top and feather embellishment - which skimmed over her visible baby bump
cumberbatch has been a patron of mnda for 11 years
he said he first became aware of mnd back in 2003 when he played prof hawking in the bbc 's hawking , and as part of his research into ' this brilliant man ' he worked with the charity which introduced him to two people who had mnd at different stages
' i 'm very proud to still be involved - alongside stephen - with the mnd association today , ' he said .
