labour leader ed miliband used a speech in birmingham to warn the election was a choice between a party working for the ' good of some or the good of all ' he unveiled labour 's election pledge card setting out five priorities to voters ahead of polling day on may 7 labour has seized on figures which show that under the conservatives plan to eradicate the deficit , by 2020 public spending as a share of national income will fall to around 35 per cent , the same level seen in the 1930s
the government insists that according to the independent office for budget responsibility , by 2019 - 20 , day - to - day spending would only be at its lowest level since 2002 - 03 in real terms
mr ed miliband was expected to say : ' the tories will carry on putting in place their vision of how our country succeeds by stripping public services to the very bone so they hit their target of spending back to levels not seen since the 1930s , before there was a nhs and children left school at 14
' be in no doubt what that means : education cut , the nhs undermined , social care devastated , crumbling infrastructure , lower living standards
this is not the future that our great country deserves
this is not the future the great people of our country deserve
britain can do better than this
' mr ed miliband unveiled labour 's election pledge card , in an echo of the five - point card used by tony blair before the 1997 election
deputy leader harriet harman , shadow chancellor ed balls and shadow work and pensions secretary rachel reeves listen to the speech at the icc in birmingham he argued that britain 's economic prosperity rests on the success of the many
he said : ' today we set out how we can replace a failed , tired , government for the few with a government that is truly for all the people of britain
today i tell you how we will change the way our country is run when i am prime minister
' it is based on a different idea of how we succeed , a different idea of how we live together , a different idea of the kind of country we can become - because the choice at this election is not simply between parties and leaders , but between different visions of our country
labour 's election pledge card sets out five promises to voters : ' the choice is between the pessimists or the optimists , fear or hope , the few or the many , the good of some or the good of all
' today i urge the britain people to choose optimism , to choose a country for the many , to choose the good of all , to choose hope - and to recognise that when working people succeed , nothing can stop us as a country
' the pledges include repairing the economy , raising living standards , investment in the nhs , some controls on immigration and more help for young people
mr ed miliband said : ' i do not simply say that we should judge our nation 's success by the success of working people
i say that only by working people succeeding can we succeed as a country
and it is an idea embodied in our pledges , written through each like a stick of rock , ' he will add
but conservative party chairman grant shapps said : ' the real choice at this election is between the stability and strong leadership of david cameron and the conservatives working to a long - term economic plan , securing a better future for britain
' or ed miliband carried into downing street in the pocket of alex salmond and the snp - meaning more borrowing , more debt , higher taxes and weaker defences
that 's the choice on 7th may
