assuming northern ireland do nât now stumble on the road to france , they will owe a big debt of thanks to their big no 10 for firing his country to a major championships for the first time in 30 years
not since the 1986 world cup have the northern irish graced a big stage
indeed , they have never qualified for the finals of the european championships
but after kyle lafferty scored twice against finland at windsor park to take his total in qualifying to five goals in five games , oâneill âs side will never have a better chance as they remain one point behind leaders romania following their fourth win of the campaign

even if it all goes wrong , this result puts them eight points clear of fourth - placed finland and almost guaranteed of at least a playoff place
â we âre in a really strong position , there âs no doubt about that , â said oâneill
â will 18 points be enough ? possibly
but belfast in june is as far as we âre looking ahead
â finland simply could nât handle kyle lafferty , the 6ft 4in striker on loan to turkish club caykur rizespor from norwich after a frustrating spell at carrow road , who made life as difficult for them as possible in the blustery conditions
he had already caused central defenders toivio and niklas moisander plenty of problems before putting northern ireland in command with two classy finishes in the space of six minutes
the first goal came from a freekick after kyle lafferty was fouled by an exasperated niklas moisander in the 33rd minute
finland cleared oliver norwood âs inswinging free - kick but niall mcginn nodded the ball back to kyle lafferty 15 yards from goal and he showed fantastic technique to turn and volley it beyond goalkeeper lukas hradecky and into the far corner
ireland looked most dangerous down their right - hand side and when jamie ward and conor mclaughlin combined once again in the 38th minute , kyle lafferty met conor mclaughlin âs pin - point cross with a glancing header into the bottom corner

he is now second only to david healy in the list of northern ireland âs all - time leading goalscorers
â kyle lafferty was outstanding again and he scored two fantastic goals , â added oâneill
â he âs going on the pitch believing he âs capable of scoring every time he plays
â it âs a little bit like the david healy situation where things at club level are nât going as well as he would like
but he âs showing what he âs capable of against top - class european defenders
â finland substitute berat sadik pulled a goal back in the first of three minutes of added time to set up an unnecessarily nervy finish , but ireland held on and the celebrations told their own story
