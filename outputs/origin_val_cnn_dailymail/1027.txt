norwegian killer breivik may have been driven to carry out his massacre because of an incestuous relationship with his own mother , a new book claims
the 36 - year - old murdered 77 people and injured more than 300 - many of them teenagers - in 2011 after detonating a bomb in oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on utoya
at his trial , breivik sought to rationalise his actions by saying he wanted to recreate the dominant aryan race , claiming the killings were ' necessary ' to protect norwegian from muslims
but a new book suggests that breivik 's shockingly warped mindset was forged by his abusive relationship with his mother behring , perhaps even before birth
a new book claims his killing spree was driven by frustrated sexual feelings towards his mother corrupted from birth ? breivik salutes during his trial
a new book suggests that breivik 's shockingly warped mindset was forged by his abusive relationship with his mother behring , perhaps even in the womb she is said to have sexualised her son from the age of just four and slept in the same bed with him with ' very close bodily contact ' , according to psychiatric reports compiled before his trial
mrs behring also revealed to police that he once bought her a sex toy to console her after she broke up with a boyfriend
breivik , who was then in his 20s , proceeded to ask her a number of times whether she had used it , an interest she described as ' weird '
in one of us , the story of breivik and the massacre in norwegian , author seierstad even suggests that his dysfunctional relationship began in the womb
â it âs as if he kicks me almost on purpose , to torment , â complains mrs behring , who admitted that she had considered having an abortion
she was later heard telling her young son that ' i wish you were dead ' in a relationship that was described by social services as ' profoundly pathological '
it was recommended that he be taken into care , but that never happened
warped : breivik at a party aged around five
his mother is said to have sexualised him from the age of four and slept in the same bed with ' very close bodily contact ' , according to psychiatric reports before his trial mrs seierstad , who interviewed mrs behring in march 2013 , six months after his conviction , said : ' among many other things , he resented his mother
there 's an aspect of revenge
' mrs behring died of breast cancer shortly afterwards
when mrs behring was informed of her son 's atrocity , she replied coldly : ' how could he do this to me ? ' mrs seierstad believes that response suggested his mother felt she may in some way be to blame
' it was clear their relationship was dysfunctional , ' the author told grazia magazine , explaining that mrs behring had traits of an abused child herself from her own mother
breivik âs mother was a paranoid schizophrenic as was her mother , while his father was a cold and distant norwegian diplomat , offering breivik little comfort or protection
when breivik was six months old , the family moved to the embassy in london
but after another six months mrs behring had had enough of their lifestyle and returned to oslo with her baby and his half - sister
breivik âs childhood might have been specially designed to create an adult monster
deciding that she could nât handle her child seven days a week , mrs behring farmed him out to a young couple at weekends
mass killer : the 36 - year - old murdered 77 people and injured more than 300 - many of them teenagers - in 2011 after detonating a bomb in oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on utoya â she asked if breivik could occasionally touch his weekend dad âs penis
it was important for the boy âs sexuality , ' the book says
' he had no father figure in his life and wenche wanted the young man to assume that role ... the young couple were speechless
â aged 13 , he took up graffiti , and briefly became part of a gang
the name he gave himself â and which he spray - painted on every available wall â was morg , after an executioner in a marvel comic who murders his own people
but breivik soon fell out with the rest of the gang and switched his allegiance to norwegian âs progress party , a more strident version of our own ukip â anti-immigrant , anti-socialist , anti-tax
by the age of 18 he had risen to the post of deputy chairman of the oslo west youth wing
after five years , he graduated to anti-muslim websites , full of conspiracy theories about muslims taking over norwegian , raping and murdering scandinavian women
lives destroyed : mourners leave tributes to teenagers shot by breivik on his gun rampage on utoya in his blogs , he awarded himself increasingly grand titles , all of them fostering the illusion that he had friends and followers : knight commander of the knights templar , distinguished destroyer of cultural marxism , commander of the norwegian anti-communist resistance movement
he also posted tips for murdering socialists , such as acquiring a police uniform so you can move around unchallenged with weapons , and getting a job at a political youth camp
on july 22 , 2011 , he first killed eight people after setting off a bomb outside government buildings in central oslo
he then shot dead 69 teenagers attending at workers ' youth league summer camp on the island of utoya , indiscriminately shooting students at point - blank range as he trampled over corpses it was to became the largest killing spree by a single person in history
later , awaiting trial , he was to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder
breivik , a right - wing , anti-muslim extremist , was sentenced to 21 years ' imprisonment with preventive detention in 2012
since his incarceration , breivik has made increasingly desperate attempts to receive publicity , as well as issuing a number of bizarre demands
in february , he threatened to go on hunger strike unless prison authorities cave in to a list of demands for better conditions - including giving him a playstation 3
despite the finite prison term , he is expected to remain in jail for the rest of his life .
