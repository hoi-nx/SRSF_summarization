many people turn to sport when times get tough and pretty amy brown is no exception
when the 21 - year - old suffered cruel taunts at school for gaining good grades and wearing boy 's clothes , she took her frustrations out on the rugby field
from the age of 12 , amy brown , who lives in the forest of dean , played at least twice a week for her local club
last month she was crowned miss forest of dean , just in time for the six nations
amy brown , who stands 5ft 8ins tall , will swap her muddy boots for high heels when she competes in the semi-finals of miss miss england in june
amy brown , who is studying criminology at the university of gloucester , said : ' i never expected to come this far
i 've never been into high heels and dresses
' for me , it was always rugby and drinking with the lads in the bar afterwards
the closest i ever had to having a picture taken was doing a selfie
' i never ever thought of myself as being particularly glam
before i got into rugby i was bullied at school
try ! amy brown turned out twice a week for her local side from the age of 12 the ' boffin ' has grown up : amy brown now has a boyfriend , 22 - year - old gym instructor ben jones more comfortable in boots : amy brown says that she had to practice ' loads ' to walk properly wearing heels ' i was n't very popular and worked hard so the bullies called me ' boffin ' and ' ugly '
even in my teens i did n't wear makeup and played rugby to deal with the name calling
' it was a way i could get my frustration out but i really enjoy it
i 'm in the second row so i 'm in the thick of the action
' i always get stuck in and i 've got knocked out twice
i have n't got any cauliflower ears thankfully
' amy brown , who has a long term boyfriend , gym instructor ben jones , 22 , has beaten thousands of hopefuls to reach the semi-finals of miss england
she added : ' i never thought i 'd make it to the semi-finals of miss england
it 's been an amazing journey
' before the competition i 'd never been on a cat walk
the first time i put on high heels i tottered about and almost lost my balance so i 've had to practice loads
' it 's a great feeling to get glammed up now , especially when i think back to the abuse i got from the bullies
i do feel like i 've had the last laugh
