yesterday , as she dazzled in diamonds and a crimson floor - length dress , mexican first lady rivera looked regal enough to rival the queen
but while the 45 - year - old might look like the consummate political wife , her telenovela acting career has repeatedly come back to haunt her
most recently , her embattled husband , president peã±a nieto , has been derided for indulging in ' soap opera politics ' as scandal after scandal has engulfed him - and his first lady
first reported by local journalist carmen aristegui late last year , the purchase allegedly came about after a murky deal was struck between the first lady and a government contractor
ms rivera , who initially counteracted the claims by insisting that the reason the title deeds were not in her name was because she had n't finished paying for it , was forced onto the back foot as more revelations came to light
most concerned the involvement of ingenierã­a inmobiliaria del centro , a subsidiary of grupo higa , a key government contractor
the business , in whose name the property is held , had been granted more than $ 8bn pesos ( Â£ 377m ) in construction projects during peã±a nieto 's tenure as governor of mexico state
all change : yesterday saw ms rivera , resplendent in a cream ensemble , meet the queen in london honour : she later attended a state dinner at buckingham palace with the queen and prince philip chic : ms rivera won plaudits from critics for her striking choice of outfit , including serious jewels interestingly , days before the report emerged , a high speed rail contract handed to constructora teya , an affiliate of grupo higa , was mysteriously cancelled
with suspicions mounting and peã±a nieto being accused of fostering the sort of corruption he had campaigned to put an end to during the 2012 presidential campaign , a chastened rivera appeared on national television to announce she intended to sell the house and had ' nothing to hide '
' i have taken the decision to sell my interest in the purchase contract of the house , ' she announced
' i have nothing to hide
' i do nât want this to continue to be a pretext to offend and defame my family
today , i am here to defend my integrity , that of my children and of my husband
' whatever the truth of the matter , there is no doubt that the scandal , coming hot on the heels of the disappearance of 43 student teachers , was a disaster for the peã±a nieto regime
considered handsome but dim by most voters during the 2012 presidential campaign , tough economic reforms sent his popularity ratings tumbling , while the furore over the students could prove terminal
peã±a nieto , who had come to power pledging to end the bloody rule of the drug cartels , mishandled the situation , say critics , when in september last year , 43 students were kidnapped in iguala
while the precise details of what happened remain unclear , what is known is that the men were handed over to the guerreros unidos crime syndicate and , according to the mexican government , murdered and their bodies burned
expenses : the latest scandal is about a 2010 house purchase , while ms rivera was still a soap actress soap star : ms rivera was once a familiar face on mexican tv thanks to her soap acting career performer : ms rivera in destilando amor ( left ) and dressed up for the red carpet at a press event ( right ) the crime immediately sparked nationwide protests which intensified when iguala 's mayor , josã© luis abarca velã¡zquez , and his wife marã­a de los ãngeles pineda villa , were accused of masterminding the massacre
worse still , a number of police officers were also implicated - putting paid , in the process , to peã±a nieto 's claims that his anti-cartel war was being won
and the controversy is still not over - even as the embattled peã±a nieto and ms rivera flew into london on monday , critics were questioning whether the visit should go ahead
david cameron , who will meet peã±a nieto at downing street today , has also said that he plans to raise the issue of human rights abuses with the mexican president
such controversy is all a far cry from the early days of ms rivera 's career when , as a fresh - faced 17 - year - old in mexico , she entered a newspaper modelling competition and won
risque : her sometimes racy soap career has made ms rivera one of mexico 's most colourful public figures clinch : since becoming first lady , she has toned down her look and given up her telenovela career romance : the couple were pictured in 2008 at a football match
ms rivera was still married at the time that early success launched a career that would go on to include a brief spell as a swimwear model followed by a move into acting , starting in 1989 when she won a small part in telenovela dulce desafã­o
a long - and apparently lucrative - career , most of it spent at mexico 's largest broadcaster televisa , was born , with ms rivera going on to star in succession of low - budget soaps , among them alcanzar una estrella ii and , most recently , destilando amor
but her biggest coup came in 2008 when she was hired by peã±a nieto to help publicise his work as state governor
ms rivera , then still married to her ex-husband , tv producer josã© alberto castro , with whom she has three daughters , was smitten by the charismatic peã±a nieto
the pair swiftly became an item and in 2010 , she married the widowed peã±a nieto in a ceremony attended by her daughters and his three children , paulina , alejandro and nicole
even then , however , the marriage was n't without controversy , with critics pointing to rumours of affairs during his first marriage to mã³nica pretelini
lucky break : ms rivera in bridal white at her wedding to president peã±a nieto in 2010 support : during the 2012 presidential election , ms rivera was a constant presence at peã±a nieto 's side first lady : since peã±a nieto took office , ms rivera has embraced a more conservative style of dressing following peã±a nieto 's election in 2012 , the washington post noted of his marriage to ms pretelli , who died in 2007 , that : ' women love him and he had extramarital affairs
' presumably , those ' extramarital affairs ' are now a thing of the past , with ms rivera now in charge of an increasingly public portfolio , not least her installation as president of national system for integral family development ( national system for integral family development ) in 2013
she is also a constant presence at the president 's side , always immaculately , if conservatively , dressed - a far cry from the racy outfits she favoured during her soap star days
the acting career is also gone , with ms rivera declaring her intention to focus on ' this great responsibility by his side ' shortly after her husband was elected
but with scandal after scandal hitting the peã±a nieto regime , it seems the days of starring in soap operas are n't quite over yet
all smiles : but while ms rivera smiled and chatted to prince philip , she is mired in scandal at home controversial : ms rivera , seen with charles and camilla yesterday , has been accused of corruption
