as many as 200,000 boys and girls are kidnapped in china every year and sold openly online , it âs been reported
child trafficking has been a long - standing problem in china , but despite the efforts of the authorities , the sinister practice is thriving , leading to thousands of families being torn apart
the us state department believes that 20,000 children are snatched every year â that âs 400 a week
baby boys , who are preferred in china because they âll ensure the family name remains intact , can sell for as much as Â£ 10,500
in a bid to evade the spotlight of the police , child traffickers in recent years have turned to the internet to do their selling
last year hundreds of babies were rescued by police in china after a crackdown was launched on trafficking infants
the nationwide bust saw 1,094 people arrested as officers acted on information relating to four major internet - based baby trafficking rings
china 's public security ministry said 382 babies were rescued after four websites were found to be selling children under the guise of adoption
baby boys , who are preferred in china because they âll ensure the family name remains intact , can sell for as much as Â£ 10,500 some critics say the trade is fuelled by the country âs one - child policy
the strict laws limit many families to one child , and with boys being favoured as heirs to the family name , many female babies are sold - typically fetching half the amount boys do - aborted or abandoned
poverty fuels the trade , while illicit profits tempts traffickers , resulting in a thriving market for babies and toddlers
an investigation by the bbc revealed the plight of one father , chaohua , who has not seen his son since february 2007 after he disappeared from their home in huizhou , aged five
since then mr chaohua has scoured the nation and even taken out tv adverts in an effort to find him , but to no avail
he claims that the problem of trafficking can only be eradicated if tougher laws are brought in to punish those to buy kidnapped children
presently , they face a three - year jail term if caught , but it âs claimed that many never find themselves in trouble over their actions .
