' morgan jensen is a model and graphic designer from flagstaff , arizona , who regularly gets mistaken for the singer
taylor swift ( right ) brought untold joy to her newly discovered doppelganger when she re-blogged this snap of her to her own tumblr page ( left ) something which she sometimes capitalises on , as she has been previously spotted pretending to be her outside her concerts
