while the days of turning up to the qantas lounge in thongs and a singlet may be over for some , other australia will be exempt from the newly enforced dress codes
last month it was announced that visitors to the lounge ' meet the appropriate standard ' of attire , and while the rules have been in place for many years would actually be enforced from april 1 this year
however travellers in darwin , cairns and the gold coast will still be able to don their weekend barbeque best for the lounges
qantas head of domestic product and service helen gray told the nt news the rule would be ' a friendly Â­ reminder ' at lounges in perth , sydney , brisbane , melbourne and adelaide
qantas lounges have always had dress codes but they have not been strictly enforced before now the airline will enforce it , except in darwin , cairns and the gold coast darwin travellers told the publication they did not think qantas would be able to enforce the dress code in the northern territory even if they tried
one man even admitted he did n't think he owned ' smart casual ' attire
last month the airline announced its lounge staff will soon be ensuring visitors to qantas will be keeping a closer eye on what you are wearing and will only allow you into their fancy waiting areas if you wearing ' smart casual ' clothing from now april 1
however , the airline has refused to define exactly what is and is not allowed to be worn and each customer will be dealt with on a case - by - case basis
signs will be put up outside the qantas lounges highlighting the policy
helen gray , qantas ' head of domestic product & service , told daily mail australia : ' from april 2015 , customers entering domestic qantas clubs and business lounges in adelaide , brisbane , canberra , melbourne , perth and sydney will receive a friendly reminder about the smart casual dress guidelines that apply
' people wearing thongs will probably no longer be allowed in the qantas lounges around australia if you have ever wanted to experience qantas business class you 'll have to dress the part ' the vast majority of our members meet and exceed the guidelines , but we have had some feedback from customers that they want to see those guidelines apply to everyone
' the dress guidelines for our lounges are the same as most restaurants and clubs
' playing the role of bouncers , qantas staff is allowed to use their ' discretion ' to determine if a visitor to the lounge meets the smart casual dress guidelines
' singlets , bare feet , and rubber thongs ' in most cases ' will be deemed unacceptable in capital city lounges
this will be the first time the dress code â which has always existed â is actively enforced
the decision has reportedly been made after feedback from customers concerned about the style inside the expensive lounges
high - vis clothing and work attire will still be allowed
men and women are encouraged to dress in smart casual attire if they want to get into the qantas lounges high - vis clothing and work uniforms will still be allowed in the lounges it 's unlikely this woman would get through the doors into the qantas lounges from now on the move comes after the airline announced they would be opening the doors to the business class lounge to people who never had the money or the points to use it before
they announced this week that customers will be able to combine their cash and air miles to experience how the other half fly
