england fans should hide behind the sofa rather than watch the ashes this summer , says mark butcher
after a humiliating world cup exit , england face a test series in the west indies , followed by series at home to new zealand and australia
speaking to radio 5 live , the former england opener warned fans to expect an â absolute hiding â and a â horrendous six months â
mark butcher , who played in 71 tests for england and scored eight centuries , added : â when australia come , just do nât watch , hide behind the sofa
â england 's under siege captain and coach eoin morgan ( left ) and moores speak at the sydney former england opener mark butcher ( right ) has predicted the worst for the national team in the near future here england are preparing for a dead rubber against afghanistan , with moores â men having far more to lose than just a meaningless group match
the indications are that moores will keep his job , at least for the test series in the caribbean , whatever happens at the sydney tomorrow , but the last thing he needs is another desperate defeat by minnows
the fact england turned up early yesterday for what used to be known as naughty - boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their need to take something from their worst - ever world cup
victory against afghanistan would perhaps give moores breathing space before the squad is announced on tuesday for the three - test series in the west indies next month
england will be without moeen and chris woakes , two players who can still expect a one - day future , and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to st kitts on april 2
moores attempts to rally his troops on the sydney on wednesday ahead of their match against afghanistan moeen strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the defeat by bangladesh while woakes has a â stress reaction â in his left foot
it is to be hoped england give games to the two players yet to appear in this world cup : tredwell and bopara , who could then be making their final odi appearances
after the world cup england must start from scratch with a one - day squad who will be at or near their peak in 2019
that means there is little point in persevering in 50 - over cricket beyond tomorrow with the likes of tredwell , bopara , ian bell , stuart broad or jimmy anderson , who said on wednesday he wants to play on
his is not a view shared by former england wicketkeeper matt prior
england quick chris jordan works up a sweat during a tough day of training in the sydney sunshine in his evening standard column prior wrote : â men like ian bell , jimmy anderson and stuart broad ... remain key members of the test side , so perhaps it is time for them to concentrate solely on that form of the game , especially with an ashes summer approaching
â there is a familiar figure at the helm of the afghanistan team in coach andy moles , the former warwickshire batsman
he would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland and said : â we still believe we âve got a scare in us in this world cup , especially if we show composure at the top of the order
if we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock
