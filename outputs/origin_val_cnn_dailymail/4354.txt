new research funded by farmers aims to breed a wheat variety for people who ca n't eat the grain , an endeavor that comes as wider consumer interest in gluten - free foods is booming
the kansas wheat commission is spending $ 200,000 for the first two years of the project , which is meant to identify everything in wheat 's dna sequences that can trigger a reaction in people suffering from celiac disease
the disease is an autoimmune disorder in which eating even tiny amounts of gluten - made up of numerous , complex proteins that gives dough its elasticity and some flavor to baked goods - can damage the small intestine
miller , senior director of research for engrain , a kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry , said funding research to breed gluten - free wheat is ' the right thing to do ' the only known treatment known is a gluten - free diet , which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat , rye and barley
though celiac disease is four - to - five times more common now than 50 years ago , only about one per cent of the world 's population is believed to suffer from it , and just a fraction have been diagnosed
but the gluten - free food business has skyrocketed in the last five years , driven in part by non-celiac sufferers who are either intolerant to gluten or following a gluten - free fad diet because they believe it may help them lose weight or that it 's somehow healthier
sales of gluten - free snacks , crackers , pasta , bread and other products reached $ 973million in the u.s. in 2014 , up from $ 810million the previous year , according to a january report by consumer research firm packaged facts
the research analyzed the sales of hundreds of explicitly labeled and marketed gluten - free products and brands at supermarkets , drugstores , and mass merchandisers
supporters of the kansas research , though , say this is n't a way to regain market share

the only known treatment for celiac desiseas is a gluten - free diet , which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat , rye and barley the research for gluten - free wheat began in july at the wheat innovation center in manhattan , kansas
it is still in its early stages and researchers are looking at proteins inside the grain ' if you know you are producing a crop that is not tolerated well by people , then it 's the right thing to do , ' according to the project 's lead researcher , miller , senior director of research for engrain , a kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry
gluten - free foods are a niche product , and in the broader context of the world 's wheat markets , it is not a driving factor , according to dan o'brien , extension grain market specialist at kansas state university
' i anticipate it will develop as a specialty market , ' miller said.the research , which began in july at the wheat innovation center in manhattan , kansas , is still in its early stages , with researchers extracting proteins from seeds of various varieties of wheat
miller has yet to begin work combining the proteins with antibodies produced by the human immune system to test for reactions
he also plans to examine the wild relatives of wheat as well as modern varieties , and will tap into a kansas wheat variety repository that dates back to the 1900s in hopes of finding a variety - perhaps one that fell out of favor among commercial farmers - that might already be low in reactivity for celiac sufferers
researchers hope to use that variety to develop a gluten - free wheat using traditional breeding methods
miller 's methodology might be ' too simplistic an approach ' that would n't identify all the toxic sequences that trigger a celiac reaction , according to alaedini , assistant professor of medical sciences at columbia university and a researcher at the new york - based school 's celiac disease center

researchers hope to use these varieties and traditional breeding methods to develop a gluten - free wheat alaedini , after looking at miller 's plan online , said the project may end up with a less toxic wheat product that is n't completely safe for all celiac disease patients
' after all this effort , this product that is coming out ... is unlikely to be superior in terms of nutritional value or baking properties and taste to the gluten - free products that are already on the market , ' alaedini said
the medical advisory board for the celiac disease foundation , a nonprofit based in woodland hills , california , could not reach a consensus on the viability of miller 's research
but the organization 's ceo , geller , is encouraged
her son had been sick his entire life before being diagnosed with celiac disease at age 15 , geller said , and his father also was later diagnosed
since the disorder is genetic , her grandchildren will be at risk of getting it
the more the disease is in the public eye , the more physicians are aware of it , she said , and it 'll be more likely the federal government would fund research
' i am certain that there are a large number of people with celiac disease who ( like ) the idea of being able to eat actual wheat , with the properties of wheat that make the bread nice and fluffy , ' she said
' the idea of having a variety of wheat that they could eat that has those wonderful wheat - like properties would certainly be very interesting for them
' sales of gluten - free products in the u.s. increaed last year , reaching $ 973million in 2014 , up from $ 810million in 2013
