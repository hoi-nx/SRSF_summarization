tinder plus , which has been tested since late last year , has subscription fees varying by age and country
in the us , users under 30 will pay $ 9.99 a month and older subscribers $ 19.99 , according to a spokeswoman
prices will be as low as $ 2.99 in emerging markets
one of the features of the new app include the ability to take back a ' left swipe ' - an action with eliminates a potential date
the new service will charge users over 30 $ 20 a month to use tinder plus the new tiered plan raised some hackles , and the phonearena blog wrote that it ' quite frustratingly
. borders on age discrimination
' tech blog endgadget decried the pricing scale as ' sleazy
' but a tinder spokeswoman defended the move
hooking up all over the world : another feature of tinder plus includes the ability to search for users in other locations , ahead of a vacation for example ' we 've priced tinder plus based on a combination of factors , including what we 've learned through our testing , and we 've found that these price points were adopted very well by certain age demographics , ' spokeswoman rosette pambakian said in a statement
' lots of products offer differentiated price tiers by age , like spotify does for students , for example
' tinder is no different ; during our testing we 've learned , not surprisingly , that younger users are just as excited about tinder plus , but are more budget constrained , and need a lower price to pull the trigger
' the app has spread widely among smartphone users , getting particular attention at the sochi olympics when athletes bragged about ' tindering ' for fast hookups
' with tinder plus we 're giving our users access to their two most - requested features through passport and rewind , as well as unlimited liking capabilities
' the ' rewind ' feature allows users to ' take back ' a swipe , so if someone accidentally swipes left on a picture - rejecting a potential date - he or she can find that person again later
' rewind lets you take back your last swipe , ' tinder says
' if you accidentally swiped left on someone you want to get to know , they 're no longer lost in the tindersphere forever
now you can get him / her back with the touch of a button
' the ' passport ' feature allows users to change their location to match with people around the world , such as ahead of a planned vacation or business trip
' passport lets you change your location to connect with people anywhere around the world
it 's like teleporting to a different location , ' the blog said
tinder , owned by the conglomerate iac , has not confirmed reports saying the free version of its app will include advertising
with apps like tinder , prospective daters can see pictures of people who are nearby
if they see someone they like , they can swipe right to indicate interest
people who both swipe right on each other 's profiles can then contact each other .
