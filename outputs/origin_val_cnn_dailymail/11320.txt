the world âs largest boring machine was lifted out of an underground tunnel in seattle , where it has been stuck for more than a year after it broke down mid-job
the gigantic drill , known as bertha , stopped working in december 2013 after digging just 1,000ft of its two - mile journey to replace the aging alaska way , which was damaged in 2001 by an earthquake
a crew from dutch construction company mammoet used a huge red crane on monday to hoist the front end of the machine â which is fivestories tall and weighs 2,000 tonnes â out of the ground so it could be repaired
â the operation was the fourth and final lift in the department âs repair programme , with crews already removing three pieces of bertha âs exterior from the pit , the department added
the machine 's breakdown and other construction issues have left the $ 80million project two years behind schedule and sparked concern about cost overruns and other unforeseen obstacles
the original highway overhaul was expected to cost $ 2 billion and be completed by 2015
the new timeline for replacing the busy alaskan way viaduct , damaged in a 2001 earthquake , is 2017
a white crane arrives on the scene in seattle to help lift part of bertha , which had been buried 120 feet underground workers prepare a gravel pad as bertha is pulled out of the ground
mammoet , the company who set up the huge red crane to remove bertha , has completed similar lifts across the world including hoisting a russian nuclear submarine from out of the arctic ocean matt preedy , deputy highway 99 tunnel administrator for the washington state department of transportation , praised the work of mammoet , stp ( stp ) and tunnel - machine maker hitachi in a report to the seattle times , saying they had devised a good lifting plan and did an ' excellent job '
the mammoth task saw the digger gradually heaved to ground level at a rate of four to five inches a minute , with the help of seven miles of cable
he added that bertha now needs to be disassembled , inspected and repaired before construction companies commit to a time frame where the machine will start work again - with some contractors saying work could start again in august , mammoet has performed other lifts around the world , including recovering a russian nuclear submarine from the bottom of the barents sea , in the arctic ocean
there had been concern that bertha , buried 120 feet might not be able to move itself to the pit opening because it had experienced various mechanical issues , including increased temperatures , before it stalled
the huge section of the digger was pulled up four to five inches a minute , using seven miles of cable , according to the seattle times workmen scale the top of the red crane , to ensure the ropes are fixed properly as they lift the machinery out of the ground , while seattle tunnel partners project director chris dixon walks along the site to check the rescue operation is going to plan this photo was shared on twitter by @ berthadigssr99 , with the caption : ' i 'm up and on the move ! being carried towards the white repair platform
' twitter account @ berthadigssr99 also shared this picture with its 15,000 followers of the part left in the tunnel
the caption , posted at 5.44am gmt , read : ' a look at the section of me that will remain in the pit
catch you in the morning
' but , using its own power , it was able bore through nearly 20 feet of concrete last month to break through a wall leading to the rescue pit 's opening , ready for it to be extracted this week
thousands of people have followed bertha âs journey back to the ground on a dedicated twitter page , called @ berthadigssr99
along with mechanical issues , the project has been set back by other concerns
in february , four men at the site were injured when a rebar wall collapsed , causing them to fall 25 feet
two seattle firefighters walked about a half mile into the state route 99 tunnel and carried out one of the injured men while the others walked out
a fifth worker escaped injury , while his four colleagues were taken to harborview medical center , one of the men suffered a fractured arm
