during the three years that i was serving as a member of tunisia 's constituent assembly , i would frequently walk to work through the gate of the bardo museum so i could get a glimpse of the mosaics , and perhaps enjoy the adjoining herb garden
the museum , in downtown tunis , serves not only as a physical reminder of tunisia 's roman , jewish , christian and islamic heritage , but is also connected to the tunisia parliament
i used to love these peaceful moments on the way to work
sadly , they will likely never feel quite the same again
on wednesday , that kind of mood was shattered as the museum came under siege
more than two dozen people were killed as gunmen armed with kalashnikovs opened fire , sending men , women and children scrambling through the lion gate to escape
the members of parliament who were evacuated were , ironically , discussing an anti-terror bill in a committee
two of the attackers -- who were killed during the assault -- have been identified , and the security minister on friday indicated the pair had been activated from a sleeper cell , although at the time of writing authorities had yet to announce a link to a specific jihadist group
however , the attack followed the release of videos purportedly from the isis threatening tunisia
meanwhile , individuals associated with the banned tunisia organization ansar al-sharia declared allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi
all this has left some wondering if the museum attack marks a shift in strategy for isis
have salafi terrorists moved beyond their usual guerrilla - style operations to suicidal attacks outside iraq and syria ? if they have , then our political leaders -- who have already been vocal about their commitment to combating terrorism , and have been collaborating with turkey to prevent tunisia entering syria -- will need to redouble their efforts
the threat posed by terrorism to tunisia citizens and our guests ca n't be downplayed , much less ignored
however , the reality is that a comprehensive strategy is still wanting , a point made in a recent report published by the tunisian institute for strategic studies , tunisia 's foremost think tank on political , economic and environmental matters
indeed , the institute , which has tracked the upsurge in salafi jihadi recruitment in tunisia based on fieldwork and interviews with tunisia jihadists , has documented how the phenomenon has largely unfolded outside the media 's view
so , how should we respond ? some mps have demanded the immediate passage of a new anti-terror law , and have been dismissive of the need to focus on human rights at a time of crisis
however , wednesday 's attack does n't change the fact that we already have an anti-terror law that applies ; simply passing a new version of a law will not stop a repeat
instead , tunisia should build on the stable institutions we have in place to implement some of the key ideas contained in the institute 's report
for example , rather than rely exclusively on the tunisia security apparatus for short - term gain , we need to better engage the tunisia public in our common struggle against salafi terrorists
part of this means beating the terrorists at the recruitment game
tunisians yearn for a sense that the state recognizes their humanity , dignity and value as individuals , not just as potential voters and taxpayers
with this in mind , it is clear that the tunisia state has done a poor job of " recruiting " its citizens into the fold , which has left space for terrorists to make a pitch for young tunisia who feel alienated and who have lost hope
of course , a robust police response is required to contain salafi jihadism
but this must be matched by an equivalent civil response to uproot the problem
that is why as law enforcement fans out across the country to investigate and protect , i hope also to see educators and trained social workers traveling to rural and impoverished areas of tunisia to demonstrate that the state has recovered the kind of humanity that was lost during decades of police - state , authoritarian stagnation
wednesday 's attack was tragic
but to move forward , we must not be tempted to fall back on our past .
