jackson police chief jackson is about to be out of a job
jackson and city officials in the st. louis suburb have announced his resignation , effective march 19
it 's the latest fallout after a justice department investigation slammed his department 's tactics
speculation has swirled for months that jackson would step down , and critics have pointed to several key points as signs that the police chief was in hot water
here 's a look at some key moments leading up to his resignation : a police officer shoots and kills michael , an unarmed african-americans - american teen
the incident exposes feelings of distrust between jackson 's black community and its police department , which is overwhelmingly white
anger begins to simmer on that first day , when michael 's body is n't removed from the street for four hours
among demonstrators ' demands : that the police department release the name of the officer who shot michael
jackson reveals the name of the officer who shot michael , darren wilson
on that same day , the department releases surveillance video that he says shows michael robbing a store
jackson says he distributed the store videotape " because the press asked for it , " noting he could n't withhold it indefinitely
the chief adds , " we needed to release that at the same time we needed to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting , " though he does n't elaborate on why critics accuse him of inflaming tensions rather than getting the situation under control
in a youtube video , jackson apologizes to michael 's parents
" i 'm truly sorry for the loss of your son
i 'm also sorry that it took so long to remove michael from the street , " he said during his video statement
investigators were doing " important work " trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence during those four hours , jackson said , but " it was just too long , and i 'm truly sorry for that
" " overnight i went from being a small - town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism , equality and the role of policing in that conversation , " he says in the video
" as chief of police , i want to be part of that conversation
i also want to be part of the solution
" that night , he meets with protesters , agreeing to march with them
but even that meeting turns ugly ; a scuffle breaks out and arrests are made
jackson tells cnn 's erin burnett he plans to stay in his job as police chief
" i intend to see this thing through
and i 've been working with a lot of community members to work on some progressive changes that will bring the community together and to open up dialogue and getting us all talking about serious issues and actually creating solutions to problems , " he says
" so , yes , i think i can -- i think i can see this through and come out on the other side with the community , the region and even the country a whole lot better
" the justice department slams the ferguson police department for tactics that federal investigators say targeted african-americans
investigators also find evidence of racist jokes being sent around by jackson police and court officials
asked about his reaction to the report by cnn 's sara sidner , jackson keeps mum , saying that he needs to analyze it further before he comments
asked what he 'll do in response , he says he will " take action as necessary
" the city says it has reached a deal for the police chief to resign , effective march 19
jackson confirms his resignation in a letter , saying " it is with profound sadness that i am announcing i am stepping down
" in a text message response to cnn , jackson says , " it 's a really hard pill to swallow
" cnn 's sara sidner , eliott c. mclaughlin , dana ford and jason carroll contributed to this report .
