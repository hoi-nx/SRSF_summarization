a young albino kangaroo , spotted grazing on a rural property beside her mother , has delighted three young children who were convinced that its strange colouring was a joke
michael collins , who said he had noticed the white roo as joey on his wattle glen property in victoria before , said it often visited his land
' the kids â¦ came running into the house saying " dad ! someone spray - painted him " , ' mr michael collins said to nine news
' yes it 's an albino , not spray painted
it 's definitely an albino eastern grey kangaroo , a young girl with her mum , ' dr ramp said
he added that the occurrence of albinism in any species was incredibly rare and occurred in one - in - 20,000
' the kids â¦ came running into the house saying " dad ! someone spray - painted him " , ' mr michael collins said albinism is a hereditary condition that is characterised by a lack of pigment in eyes , skin , hair , scales , or feathers
ramp , director of centre for compassionate conservation confirmed the roo was a healthy ' they tend to get reported when people see them and that happens once every couple of years - it 's a rare event but it happens well across all animal species , ' dr ramp said
' i 've got photos of an albino wombat down in gippsland that we caught on some remote camera - traps last year
' however dr ramp , who is working with an albino kangaroo population at bathurst in new south wales , said the young grey roo appeared to be quite healthy after examining the video captured by mr michael collins
as part of his own work , dr ramp is examining whether higher than average numbers of albino kangaroos in a certain population indicate that there are wider problems at hand , such as inbreeding
' while it 's not particularly negative for the individual kangaroos , it may mean these animals are inbreeding more than they normally would because they are constrained and they are struggling to connect with other populations , ' he said
' in our bathurst studies we are wondering if the landscape is fraught for kangaroos
' ' it 's a rare event but it happens well across all animal species , ' dr ramp said of albinism in animals
one of his remote camera traps that detects motion captured this image of an albino wombat at cape liptrap coastal park in victoria during research into the importance of foraging herbivores in reducing fire risk albinism is a hereditary condition that is characterised by a lack of pigment in eyes , skin , hair , scales , or feathers
