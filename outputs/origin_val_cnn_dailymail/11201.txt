the university of mary washington has suspended activities for its men 's rugby team after officials there said an audio recording captured some team members chanting a song with lyrics that seemed to condone abuse toward women and even necrophilia
in an email to the university community on march 19 , president hurley said the school imposed sanctions because the team 's actions violated its code of conduct for club sports
according to the school , the recording featured several team members at an off - campus party at the end of the fall semester
officials say the chant contained sexually explicit , derogatory and violent language
( she was right and dead ! ) well god d * * * son of a b * * * * we 're gon na get it in ! ( god d * * * son of a b * * * * we 're gon na get it in ! ) finally got it in ( finally got it in ! ) wiggle it all about ( wiggle it all about ! ) god d * * * son of a b * * * * i could n't get it out ( god d * * * son of a b * * * * we could n't get it out ! ) finally got it out ( finally got it out ! ) it was red and sore ( it was red and sore ! ) moral of the story is never f * * * a wh * * * ! source ' finally found a whore , ' begins the call and response song
' she was right and dead ... well g * * d * * * son of a b * * * * we 're gon na get it in ! ' the november 2014 incident was recorded by a male partygoer -- sans video -- with a phone and uploaded to youtube , jezebel reports
it was soon reported to the administrations
in the months thereafter , the school 's chapter of feminists united got involved , with their president mckinsey writing an opinion piece in the school paper when the club decided initial sanctions against the team were n't enough
' as soon as feminists united started affecting change on campus , we were faced with aggression and hatred , ' mckinsey wrote , saying the group was attacked anonymously through the app yik yak
the group perservered , however , and in early march , they publicly released a transcript of the chant
with still no response , the group took things a step further by releasing audio of the chant to several news outlets on march 18
that same day , president hurley informed the team of their punishment
some students have been exposed to the ' offensive and lurid lyrics due to posting by others on social media , ' hurley wrote
feminists united : the umw feminists united chapter fought for the team to be punished
they were targeted by members of the student body , who attacked them through the anonymous app yik yak at an off - campus party at the close of the fall 2014 semester , several members of theumw men 's rugby club engaged in a chant that contained sexually explicit , derogatory , and violent language
some students have now been exposed to those offensive and lurid lyrics due to posting by others on social media
no student on this campus should feel unsafe , ostracized , or threatened
understanding that the offensive chant is antithetical to university of mary washington values , and will not be tolerated , the university of mary washington pursued action against the men 's rugby club
at the beginning of the current semester , sanctions were imposed on the rugby club for willful violations of university of mary washington 's code of conduct for club sports
after an appeal by the accused , the disciplinary process concluded on march 18 with this ruling : all rugby club activities have been suspended indefinitely
further , each member of the men 's rugby club is required to participate in education and training sessions regarding sexual assault and violence
university of mary washington 's statement of community values informed the process and response to this situation
as i stated yesterday , the university of mary washington will not stand for such behavior
it not only violates our community values , it is not how members of this collegial campus live , and it is not reflective of the university of mary washington we all know and love
university policies prohibit discrimination , harassment , threats , and derogatory statements of any form
we pride ourselves on being a diverse , accepting , caring community , and we must live up to that ideal
i urge anyone on campus who feels unsafe , ostracized or threatened to immediately contact campus police or dr. leah cox , special assistant to thepresident for diversity and inclusion
she may be reached at lcox@umw.edu or 540 - 654 - 2119
richard v. hurley president source ' no student on our campus should feel unsafe , ostracized , or threatened , ' hurley continued
' we pride ourselves on being a diverse , accepting , caring community , and we must live up to that ideal
' other sanctions imposed at the beginning of the semester were appealed and upheld
in addition , the team must participate in sensitivity training and education sessions
messages left for the contact listed for the rugby team through the school 's website and a campus women 's rights group were not immediately returned
the incident at the fredericksburg school follows recent news of a fraternity at the university of oklahoma that was disbanded after its members were caught on video engaging in a racist chant
last week , north carolina state university also disbanded a fraternity chapter after the discovery of a notebook filled with sexist and racially offensive entries in a restaurant off campus
the university of mary washington was founded in 1908 and has about 4,000 undergraduate students
censured : the school administration doubled down on an earlier censure of the rugby club by suspending their activities indefinitely and requiring them to attend sexual assault education courses
