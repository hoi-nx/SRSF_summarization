shoppers could be faced with empty shelves without urgent action to recruit an army of lorry drivers , it was warned today
chancellor george osborne is under pressure to announce support for training in the haulage industry in the budget this week , amid warnings of shortage of 45,000 drivers
the crisis in in the industry could mean food shortages at peak times , including this easter and the summer months
shoppers could be faced with empty shelves without urgent action to recruit an army of lorry drivers , it was warned today new training rules mean the logistics industry is thousands of drivers short , according to the uk commission for employment and skills
the freight transport association claims more than 20,000 drivers have quit since september
it comes after a new driver certificate of professional competence was introduced across the eu , which meant drivers had to complete an extra 35 hours training , costing some Â£ 500
hauliers say the rules mean there are not enough people to drive lorries across the country , raising the prospect of ' empty shelves '
mr george osborne is being urged to find Â£ 150million to increase training for thousands of drivers before the shortages hit vital supplies
a shortage of 45,000 drivers has been caused in part by new rules forcing hauliers to be tested on their driving skills richard burnett , the chief executive of the road haulage association , told the telegraph : ' we need george osborne to dig deep and find a way through this
' the problem is n't going to go away
if it 's not tackled in this budget , then whoever comes in to government are going to have to wake up and recognise that this is a significant issue and it 's growing
we 've no young people coming through into the industry
' he added : ' there 's going to be an impact in terms of getting goods to consumers on time
the expectation in the market is immediate , but we 're seeing signs of slowing
we 've insufficient drivers to get products there on time
' that 's set to get worse
we will see delivery failure during the peak trading periods
bank holiday weekends , during the summer where you see big spikes when the weather starts to improve and there 's a massive draw upon driver resource , we 're going to see problems â definitely at christmas this year as we see a further reduction in the number of drivers
' chancellor george osborne is being urged to find Â£ 150million to increase training for thousands of drivers before the shortages hit vital supplies six weeks before chrismtmas , transport secretary patrick mcloughlin urged people to ' get their shopping done ' in case the driver shortage hit the supply of food and presents
he defended the new eu rules , arguing that drivers need to know how to drive their lorries properly
but he urged people not to leave their shopping until the last minute , in case supply lines are affected
' if you 're driving a motor vehicle , with the investment you 've got in that motor vehicle , it 's no bad thing to know what you 're doing , ' he told the conservativehome website
asked if there were going to problems with deliveries before christmas , he replied : ' i hope not
i think we 'll be all right
but i 'd advise everybody to get their shopping done
