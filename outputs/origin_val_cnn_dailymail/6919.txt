his crimes were outlined at the old bailey on friday , where he was convicted of conspiracy to supply drugs and possession of firearms
the court heard how babs arogundade often frequented expensive west end nightclubs and met ms bianca willoughby two nights before he was caught in may 2013
she is said to have agreed to help him with ' a favour ' after she went to his home in st john 's wood , north west london , to ask for financial support for her business
the ' favour ' was to look after bags filled with the weapons in exchange for him allowing her friend to borrow his expensive maserati for a wedding
prosecutor wilkins told the court about the operation on may 27 , 2013 , which led to the conviction of the ' charismatic gangster '
he told the old bailey : ' armed officers intercepted a blue honda civic parked in hemel hempstead and found willoughby sitting in the driver 's seat with her four - year - old son sitting next to her
' inside the boot was four shotguns , a hand gun and a rifle together with compatible ammunition
' babs arogundade was standing by the boot with a sports bag , the prosecutor said
he added : ' the prosecution say he brought that bag and would have used it to take back whichever firearms he was going to select from willoughby 's car
' the cache included a keely smith and wesson revolver containing one bullet , a winchester rifle with seven rounds , a sawn off pump - action shotgun and three other shotguns with more than 300 shells
mr wilkins said the stash could ' really only be described as an arsenal of guns and ammunition '
police found four shotguns , a loaded smith and wesson handgun ( pictured ) , a winchester rifle and ammunition when they raided the honda civic during a surveillance operation focusing on his criminal ways a shotgun was among the items seized from ms bianca willoughby 's car
the old bailey heard that he kept the weaponry in her honda civic in return for allowing her friend to borrow his expensive maserati for a wedding ammunition was also discovered hidden in bags in the boot of the car , which was occupied by ms bianca willoughby and her four - year - old son in hemel hempstead , hertfordshire , when police raided it in 2013 both willoughby and babs arogundade were arrested at the scene and the young mother told police she had agreed to do the favour following a visit to his home
she claimed he let her stay the night when she asked for financial help , but spent most of the time fending off unwelcome sexual advances
she told the court : ' he said : " did your friend enjoy the maserati ? " , he was saying it would be a lot of money to hire '
' he said : " i did you a favour , and i would like you to do a favour "
' the court heard a set of keys to the maserati were later found stashed along with diamond - encrusted jewellery and expensive watches under a sink at an address in isleworth , west london
mr wilkins said it showed babs arogundade was ' storing items at premises under the control of women he knew
' despite the keys being found , it is believed the maserati was sold on to a private owner before babs arogundade was convicted

jailing babs arogundade , the judge said : ' the court heard ... about your lifestyle , which involved luxury cars , a bentley and a maserati , a collection of expensive watches , which were found , a rolex and equally expensive brands , and a collection of diamond - encrusted jewellery
' as to the guns
you stored those guns in the car of someone i am satisfied that you took advantage of the fact she had recently broken up with her boyfriend and was more vulnerable than usual
' i have no doubt you are not just a drug dealer , but somebody with a leading role in an organisation involved in supplying multi-kilos of class a drugs
co-defendants fred jones-lartey , 34 , ( left ) and nicole douglas , 28 , ( right ) were also jailed at the old bailey on friday for 12 years and four years respectively after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine police found a kilogramme of cocaine in a car belonging to nicole douglas on may 7 , 2013 and later found she had links to babs arogundade

' i have no doubt that some of them did so for very little personal gain and without knowing the full extent to which you were including them in serious criminal activities
' some of them , formerly of good character , were drawn to you because of your personality , women who regarded you as a friend
you took advantage of that trust
' following the sentencing , detective inspector keely smith , from the metropolitan police service 's projects team , said : ' this case has prevented six firearms from reaching the streets of london and having potentially lethal outcomes
' i believe babs arogundade was looking to sell the weapons on to those who would be willing to use them
' this investigation highlights the work my team is doing on a day - to - day basis to keep the community safe
