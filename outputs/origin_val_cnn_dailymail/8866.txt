cameron last night agreed to a single tv debate during the election campaign
the prime minister is expected to attend a seven - way session at the start of april , to be shown on itv
the deal includes three other political programmes during the campaign in which some of the party leaders will take questions from the public or television interviewers
he will also appear on a number of election specials â but without going head to head against miliband crucially , the bbc , sky , itv and channel 4 appear to have blinked first and dropped their demand for a head - to - head clash between the pm and miliband
and they have backed down from their apparent threat to â empty chair â the pm by holding debates with other leaders which he refused to attend
labour appeared to deny the validity of the new proposal , insisting it still wanted three debates as originally proposed and accusing the pm of â running scared â of a one - to - one with mr miliband
but , in an attempt to nail down the latest agreement , mr cameron said the other parties should accept it
â an offer âs been made , a deal âs been accepted , now the other parties must make clear that they accept this deal too , otherwise they will have to bear the responsibility , â he said
â that âs what happened : a new offer put forward by the broadcasters , led by the bbc , to me , i accepted it , in full , on saturday
so , i âm helping to make this debate go ahead
the other parties have got to stop running away from this and agree to the debate the broadcasters have now suggested
â labour leader miliband and the deputy prime minister clegg would only face mr cameron in one seven - way debate the latest proposal is thought to have been presented to the parties over the weekend
according to tory sources , it includes four potential shows , the first in just nine days â time on march 26
it will be a channel 4 and sky joint production hosted by jeremy paxman and featuring the pm and mr miliband , one after the other , facing questions from the host and a studio audience
the second show will be the only debate and will involve seven party leaders , with the addition of clegg , nigel farage , green leader natalie bennett , nicola sturgeon of the snp and the plaid leader leanne wood
it will be broadcast by itv on april 2
on april 16 the bbc is proposing a â challengers â debate featuring the greens , snp , ukip and plaid
a week before polling day , on april 30 , the bbc will host a 90 - minute question time - style show with mr cameron , mr miliband and mr clegg appearing one after the other to face questions from a tv audience
this is a better deal for the lib dem , who complained that a head - to - head between the other two leaders would prevent them from defending their record in government
a labour spokesman said : â no one should be fooled : cameron is still running scared of a head - to - head televised debate with miliband
â n mr cameron poked fun at miliband for posing for tv cameras in a pokey kitchen that turned out to be one of two in his Â£ 2.5million london home
â i am not saying this to make a point but you should nât pretend to be something you are not , â the prime minister said
showing off the open - plan kitchen he and wife samantha had installed in downing street , he added : â we are lucky , we both work , we were able to spend our own money on this
â to me , the kitchen is where you spend all your time
it needs a sofa you can slump on , a table you can sit at , a kitchen you can cook in , a place children can do their homework
â under the broadcasters ' latest proposal , the tory , lib dem and labour leaders would appear on question time hosted by david dimbleby ( left )
cameron and miliband would be interviewed one after the other in a channel 4/sky special hosted by jeremy paxman ( right )
