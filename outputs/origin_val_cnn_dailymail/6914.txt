martin o'neill has confirmed that a representative for kane approached him expressing his client âs interest to play for the republic of ireland
the ireland manager had admitted last summer that he was chasing up a lead with a player at tottenham and the 21 - year - old was the man in martin o'neill âs sights
despite being offered encouragement by kane âs camp , the striker , whose father was born in galway , insisted in august that his only aim was to break into the senior england squad
and after his breakthrough season in the premier league , martin o'neill has accepted that the chase to land him is over
kane celebrates scoring his second goal as tottenham beat qpr 2 - 1 at loftus road last saturday the england under 21 striker is also eligible to play for the republic of ireland because of his father â yeah , yeah , it is
i was talking to somebody about this last night and we were just saying that kane himself always wanted to play for england
really , it was as simple as that , â he said
â the order of events â though i do nât think it âs really important any more â is that initially the agent got in touch and said that he would have a keen interest , and we wanted to go and chase it up
â but then i noticed in the newspaper where he said he wanted to play for england
and that has remained the same
someone was even speaking to him recently and that was exactly the same conversation
fine , if that âs the case

ireland boss martin o'neill has revealed that kane was interested in representing ireland before this season â considering what the agent said to me , â he added
â sometimes what agents do is they have someone who looks after the player who is not actually licensed to buy or sell or be involved as an agent but they look after the player
and he was the one who called
but he happened to call me on a day when kane said he wanted to play for england
â it would have been really nice , absolutely
there âs a fairly decent chance he might have had a few caps for us before he actually makes his debut for england , considering the way he âs playing

kane has scored 26 goals so far this season and is on the brink of roy hodgson 's england squad â i do nât want to sound like a detective here but i âm following up on a number of leads
honestly , i think there âs one or two might come to fruition in the next couple of months , maybe even before the scotland game , that might be pleasantly surprising
i âm saying that , maybe i âm being optimistic
â if i thought things were really worth chasing up and somebody âs ... i think sometimes the agent is seemingly almost like an excuse preventing that
one particular lad has called me who has bypassed agents and he âd be pretty keen
and i âm putting something in motion at the moment
â although martin o'neill was coy on revealing any names
â do you know , i ca nât really at this minute
