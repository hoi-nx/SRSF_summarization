it has been one of the world 's longest and deadliest civil conflicts
since the first incidents more than three decades ago , an estimated 40,000 lives have been lost
it has been , some say , a battle by activists among turkish 's kurdish minority for independence
it has been , others say , a guerrilla war by rebels who have punctuated their campaign with terrorist acts
whatever it has been to the parties involved , the leader of the militant group at the forefront of the kurdish insurgency in turkish says it is time now for it to be over
" our struggle came to the point it can not continue as it is , " ocalan , longtime leader of the pkk ( pkk ) , said earlier in march from his jail cell
in a letter read to thousands gathered in the southeastern turkish city of diyarbakir to mark persian new year , ocalan called for " a new era " with kurds gathering as " a democratic society with the right to a democratic identity -- within turkish and on the constitutional citizenship basis
" he urged fighters under his command to lay down their arms , stop their war against the turkish state and join a " congress " to focus on the future
ocalan 's letter is nothing less than historic
as recently as 2012 , the long - simmering war between the pkk and the turkish government had heated to the point that the international crisis group , a conflict resolution organization monitoring the conflict , counted more than 700 dead over 14 months
" we 're seeing the longest pitched battles between the ( turkish ) army and the pkk , we 're seeing a widespread campaign of kidnapping , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks by the pkk
they 're very much on the offensive and unfortunately this is matched by much harder line rhetoric on both sides , " hugh pope , chief author of an international crisis group report , told cnn in 2012
perhaps vocally underscoring the cultural split between the turkish government and the country 's kurdish population , when ocalan 's letter was read to crowds march 21 , it was read in two languages -- kurdish first , then turkish
the letter was read by onder , deputy of turkish 's pro-kurdish people 's democratic party
onder is one of the few people regularly allowed to meet ocalan at the prison where he is held on imrali
" saturday officially showed us all that we have moved on to the negotiation period from the dialogue period we 've been working on , " onder told cnn in a phone interview
about a fifth of turkish 's population is kurdish -- a minority long living under cultural oppression , most of them in the underdeveloped southeastern part of turkish
by 1998 -- 14 years after the insurgency began -- turkish counted up to 18,000 pkk guerrillas living in the mountains
the next year , ocalan -- a hero to some , a villain to others -- was captured in kenya by turkish authorities , reportedly with the help of the cia
the united states , the european union and turkish classify the pkk as a terrorist group
ocalan was sentenced by the turkish government to life in prison for treason , and for years , he was the sole prisoner of imrali
it 's an alcatraz - like island fortress best known in the west as the locale for the 1970s book and movie " midnight express
" now , he gets to choose fellow inmates
ocalan began the pkk in 1978 as a kurdish separatist group in turkish , part of a larger separatist movement by kurds scattered throughout the region
northern syria , southern turkish and northern iraq have been home to millions of kurds for thousands of years
there are also millions of kurds in iran , where they make up about 10 % of the mostly persian nation 's population
violence flared in august 1984 when fighters from the pkk , which has a marxist-leninist philosophy , killed two turkish soldiers
as the years passed and the death toll mounted , the pkk proved to be a militant leg of a regional ethnic struggle to carry on the kurdish culture
but there have been periods of calm and times of talk
in 2009 , turkish intelligence officials allegedly met with high - ranking pkk members in oslo , norway , to begin a series of secret talks
in mid- 2011 , the talks were interrupted by new clashes
the armed fights were followed by a hunger strike by kurdish political prisoners in 2012 , who ended the strike after 67 days upon ocalan 's request
things picked back up when president erdogan announced talks with the imprisoned ocalan in december 2012
since then , the turkish government has lifted language bans , released political prisoners and continued talks with ocalan despite opposition criticism
in return , the jailed leader notably pronounced disarmament intentions and called for a ceasefire in his persian new year 's letter in 2013
on may 8 of that year , the pkk announced a slow withdrawal from turkish
but tensions between the sides sparked again when the predominantly kurdish - populated city of kobani was invaded by isis in october and turkish did n't directly intervene
talks between the pkk and the turkish government continued , though
but at istanbul 's dolmabahce last month , senior government officials met with pro-kurdish parliamentarians and declared a " road map " accord on the way to a stable solution
onder said that ocalan 's letter " shows us that the ... road map decided at dolmabahce is now a concrete step -- one that suits the spirit and the context of the resolution period
" but the government view over the accord seems to be divided
erdogan told reporters that he does not fancy the declaration
erdogan was not present at dolmabahce either
onder said , " despite the president 's opposing remarks , the turkish government took responsibility about its kurdish problem for the first time
