rona fairhead ( pictured ) admitted there is a problem with â blurred accountabilities â between corporation bosses and the bbc she heads , and that it is time for proper outside oversight a report by the culture , media and sport select committee last week called for the trust to be replaced with a new public service broadcasting commission , which would regulate the bbc âs spending and strategy
mrs rona fairhead did not agree with all of the committee âs recommendations , but said the trust should be replaced with a rigorous external regulator whose sole purpose would be to hold the bbc to account
she also called for the bbc to have a stronger board , with more non-executive directors and an independent chairman to help keep the corporation on track and prevent problems that might need regulatory intervention
â responsibilities for strategy , financial and operational management need to sit with the bbc executive to allow them to respond to a rapidly changing environment , â she said
â responsibilities for regulation and broader accountability need to sit at one remove
a report by the culture , media and sport select committee last week called for the trust to be replaced with a new public service broadcasting commission , which would regulate the bbc âs spending and strategy â that way , there should be no possibility of vagueness or uncertainty about who will be held responsible for what when the chips are down
â she added the â cleanest form of separation â would be to transfer the bbc âs responsibilities for regulation and accountability to an external regulator
â that âs an approach we want to explore further
