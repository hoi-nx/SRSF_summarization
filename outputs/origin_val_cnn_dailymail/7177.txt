fans : the queen and prince philip using a defender in 1968 jaguar land rover yesterday breathed new life into its iconic defender â a favourite of the queen
it confirmed that it will create a new version of the 4x4 and also said the existing model will continue to roll off the production line
but amid announcements of the firm 's Â£ 600million investment in the uk it said neither model would be made in uk
there had been rumours that a factory would be created in coventry , possibly to build the revamped defender
manufacture of the current version of the all - terrain vehicle , first made in 1948 and one of the first cars owned by the queen after she came to the throne in 1952 , is due to end in december after a series of special editions roll off the production line
but it is understood that the new model will be built abroad
a spokesman for jaguar land rover , owned by indian industrial giant tata , said : ' we will create a new version of the defender but no decision has been made on where it will be built or when
' commenting on the future of the existing model , the spokesman added : ' we are investigating the possibility of maintaining production of the current defender at an overseas production facility for sale outside of the eu , after we cease building in the uk
' this could mean it being built at jaguar land rover 's factories in brazil or china
three - quarters of the two million defenders built since launch are still in regular use
a prototype of the new generation 4x4 was unveiled in 2011 , and yesterday 's announcement brings it a step closer
but at the heart of jaguar land rover 's current plans are a Â£ 400million revamp of its castle bromwich site in the west midlands , including a Â£ 320million body shop to manufacture the xf , the new all - aluminium sports saloon
the remodelled car was launched earlier this week with a dramatic stunt â being driven on wires over water in london 's docklands
jaguar land rover also said it was doubling the size of its advanced design and engineering centre in whitley , coventry , at a cost of Â£ 50million , ' to support the company 's creation of high - technology , ultra-low emission vehicles '
the plans are expected to create thousands more jobs on top of the 32,300 people the firm already employs in the uk
jaguar land rover is also funding a Â£ 150million research complex â the national automotive innovation centre â in partnership with warwick university
chief executive dr ralf speth said the venture demonstrated its ' unwavering support to the uk automotive industry '
he added : ' this investment , made here in the heart of our uk business operations , signals the confidence we have in this region to support the creation , engineering and manufacture of ultra low - emission , premium uk products
