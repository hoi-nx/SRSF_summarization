' back then , we saw leftist organisation like the red brigades in italy , the red army in germany , the baader meinhof group ... ' rima tries to get al-seba'i back on topic , asking him to ' focus on the present '
she asks : ' at present , what slogans are used to attract ( christians ) to these groups ? ' but dr al sebaâi becomes angry and abruptly replies : ' listen , do n't cut me off
i will answer as i please
' he then raises his voice , adding : ' i will not answer the way you like , because i âm here to serve the idea in which i believe
