at dolce & gabbana 's milan fashion week show this afternoon , it was n't just the clothes that turned heads on the catwalk
in a tribute to mothers and motherhood , each model carried a baby down the runway , with some expertly holding their precious cargo and others struggling to come to grips with the little ones
the backdrop , a white panel adorned with a red rose and the word ' mamma ' in script , completed the theme of the show , which was fittingly called ' viva la mamma '
another model ( right ) kept her precious cargo close the tiny fashionistas , who were all decked out in lace dresses and mini suits , ranged in age from just a few months to a few years old
while most of the babies were apparently unrelated to the models , pregnant supermodel bianca balti , 30 , showcased her very own baby bump on the runway , looking positively glowing in a powder pink sheath dress and black heels
according to guests , the youngsters on the runway were extremely well - behaved , but a few pictures from the show tell something of a different story
in one image , for instance , a model clad in a black and red floral ensemble smiles brightly as she carries her adorable accessory - but the baby looks thoroughly nonplussed
