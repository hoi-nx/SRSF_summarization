but that does n't much compare to their potential us property , which they could be set to move into in early june after the sportsman 's long and illustrious career with liverpool comes to an end in late may
with six bedrooms and nine bathrooms , the swanky property also boasts sweeping mountain and pacific ocean views and was regularly featured on reality show the real housewives of beverly hills

one of the bedrooms in particular opens up into a stunning panorama of the ocean steven gerrard ( left ) will be hoping to end his liverpool career on a high by winning the fa cup this season steven gerrard follows in david beckham 's footsteps who played for la galaxy between 2007 - 2012 in the official pictures of the impressive property , it is clear it 's finished to an incredibly high standard , a combination of both contemporary and classic design , with a deluxe california and certainly hollywood - style vibe
it 's going to be a huge adjustment process for both steven gerrard and his family , but he 's not the first british footballer to make such a move : david beckham famously left madrid to play with la galaxy back in 2007 , and he moved his entire family out to la for the job
the mls team recently confirmed steven gerrard 's signing following his decision to turn down the offer of a contract extension and leave liverpool after 17 years with his beloved team
' football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years , ' he said on confirming his move
' i 'm not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself
i 'm going over there to win , and if i win and play well , then my life becomes more enjoyable
' there 's obviously a bonus of where the la galaxy are located as well
that will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different
' steven gerrard scored twice from the penalty spot during liverpool 's foundation charity match on sunday and a senior la galaxy official confirmed : ' the club is helping steven gerrard and alex with every imaginable aspect of their family move and we are obviously hoping to get them settled as soon as possible
' alex returned to liverpool last month after jetting to la in search of a new home for her , her husband and their adorable girls
tweeting shortly before she returned , she wrote : ' last day in la coming home tonight ! ! villa blanca for lunch then last few bits of shopping , looking forward to seeing my man and girls
' and it seems like the move ca n't come quick enough for the steven gerrard family
alex , who has been married to the footballer since 2007 , recently tweeted her disdain for the typical british rain , something she surely wo n't miss when moving to sunny california in june
' wish this rain would do one ! ! ! ' she wrote on twitter while watching her man play in the all - star charity match at liverpool 's anfield on sunday
mailonline has contacted a representative for steven gerrard and is awaiting comment
