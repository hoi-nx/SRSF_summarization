a plus - size blogger who once suffered from an eating disorder has revealed why she feels she is prettiest at her heaviest weight and â and why she proudly calls herself fat â as she strips down to her underwear while on camera for a new body image campaign
marie southard ospina , from brooklyn , new york , sheds her clothing as a part of stylelikeu 's video series , the what 's underneath project , in which a select group of individuals were asked to remove their clothes in order to help prove that style is really about knowing who you are and being comfortable in your own skin
' i try to use the word fat a lot in my writing , ' the 23 - year - old says in her video
' i use it to describe myself quite a lot , and i think people 's initial reaction is , " you 're not fat
" that in itself is problematic because that just implies that you ca n't be fat and beautiful
it 's not this horrendous thing
' when the clip opens , marie southard ospina is fully dressed and sitting on a stool in front of a brick wall
she first removes her hat and throws it on the ground before she begins to describe her past struggles with body image
' for a long time my style was just about kind of concealing by body and for maybe until my early twenties it was just about hiding any kind of excess fat , ' she says
marie southard ospina explains that she now likes to ' counter a lot of the rules ' that plus - size women are told to follow , particularly when it comes to fashion , which means she favors tight - fitting dresses and skirts , as well as bold prints and other things ' that are n't necessarily designed to make you more invisible '
she adds that people have been ' taught that fat is an inherently bad thing ' , so when they see a larger woman in clothes that show off her body , they are opposed to it
throughout the video , marie southard ospina removes her layers of clothing one piece at a time
she recalls being relatively thin as a child , but says she started gaining weight when she was about nine - years - old
she remembers being bullied in elementary school and describes how her family members would make comments about how she needed to start doing sports
marie southard ospina notes that , because she takes after her father , who is 6 ' 2 and heavy set , her colombian mother and her relatives did n't understand how her bone structure was different
while their idea of beauty is large breasts and thick thighs â they do nât understand women who are classed as â fat â
lots of layers : the 23 - year - old blogger was fully dressed at the start of the clip newfound confidence : marie southard ospina removes her clothes as she explains that she once had an eating disorder and struggled with body acceptance ' if i was going to be curvy , i was going to be fat and as soon i started dropping weight i just became a rail and my curves were gone , ' she says
' they did n't like that either
' marie southard ospina says that she believed food was the problem , so she just eradicated it from her life
people did n't realize she had developed an eating disorder at first , and they would often make comments about how her body finally matched the prettiness of her face
' i think that 's the cycle with eating disorders in general , ' she says
' i think you start to get used to the praise , and so you just want to do it more and more
you want to lose more weight
you want to hear that you are doing something good
' two years into her eating disorder , her mom realized something was wrong
marie southard ospina was quickly told to start working with a nutritionist and was also sent to see a therapist
she says she gained a lot of weight back in her later years of high school and when she started college she was a size 14 - but she still was n't eating healthy
it was n't until she set off to spend a year studying abroad in madrid and prague that she started to accept her body
' people just did n't seem to look at my size , ' she says of the people she met in spain
' people when they talk to you they actually talk to you and they 're not secretly thinking this girl 's a * * is so big or she needs to lose some weight
' marie southard ospina adds : ' it was more like people actually made the effort to get to know me
' nothing to hide : marie southard ospina even removes her make - up in the video after she notes that she feels her prettiest when she is ' fresh - faced ' final pieces : after removing her socks and pantyhose , marie southard ospina is left sitting in a lace bra and underwear it was there that she met her partner , who she is still with to this day
marie southard ospina describes him is a ' thin , pretty guy ' who has never been directly attacked for his body , yet he has ' a lot of problems with how beauty is perceived ' and is ' really into body positivity '
she notes that she feels her prettiest when she and her partner wake up in the morning and she is fresh - faced
marie southard ospina , who once used to hide in her cover - up , says she wore her first real bikini last year
' beauty literally comes in every shape and size and we should be able to use the word [ fat ] without it being tied to these treacherous connotations , ' she explains
she admits that she has gained weight in the past 18 months , but it is not something that bothers her anymore
at the end of the video , marie southard ospina is confidently sitting on a stool in her bra and underwear
' i âm the fattest i âve ever been , but i âm also the prettiest i âve ever been , ' she says .
