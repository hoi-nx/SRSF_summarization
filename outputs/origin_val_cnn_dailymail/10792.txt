while united and arsenal meet at old trafford on monday , the match - winning hero of the 1979 fa cup final between the clubs will be watching in solitude two thousand miles away in malta
former gunners striker alan sunderland emigrated there 20 years ago after his life in england turned sour but he still follows arsenal âs fortunes and returns two or three times a year as a guest of the club
â when arsenal play a big game , i have to watch on my own , i âm nervous if i am around fans of the other teams , â he said
yet he showed no sign of nerves in 1979 when he slid in to win the fa cup for arsenal
