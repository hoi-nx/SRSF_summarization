what is the last thing you remember about lionel messi and ronaldo ? for lionel messi , it is most likely him tearing barclays premier league champions city apart , making them look like a league one team lost in europe , nutmegging milner to leave him with grass stains on his backside
for ronaldo , it may be him throwing his arm in the air in disdain , sulking back to the halfway line , protesting even though team - mate bale had just put real madrid 1 - 0 up against levante
lionel messi may well be priceless as the barcelona star continues to find the best form of his career lionel messi smiles during barcelona 's win over city that knocked them out of the champions league ronaldo can not mask his frustration during real madrid 's last match against levante it was a tough night for ronaldo , who will need to improve fast for el clasico against lionel messi 's barcelona it is an unforgiving game for the two undisputed best players on the planet
yet there is currently no debate to be had
the headlines this week belong to lionel messi , even if he did n't break a champions league record on wednesday and his free - kicks served only to remind us he is human after all
there was more to his embarrassment of city than missing out on his ninth goal in the tournament
if it was n't his menacing dribbles , it was his six shots against a magnificent joe hart
if it was n't his assist for ivan rakitic 's goal , it was his nutmeg on milner that reduced guardiola â the architect of the barcelona way and current bayern munich manager â to nothing more than another supporter in the stands
the one - twos , the drops of the shoulder , the shimmies
guardiola has seen it all before â at the nou camp , at their ciutat esportiva joan gamper training ground , at almost every stadium he took barcelona to â yet still it was enough for him to hide his face in disbelief

so much so it 's almost unfair , and part of the credit can even go to â dare we say it ? â his nemesis , ronaldo

yet ronaldo 's cry of ' si ' lit something under the four - time winner

those all - too - familiar white handkerchiefs were waved in his team 's direction , and the spanish whistles were piercing
' i wo n't talk again until the end of the season , ' ronaldo announced afterwards , as frustrated as any , while a poll by spanish newspaper as found 32.2 per cent voted for ronaldo to be dropped
