nearly 70 years ago , comic strip detective dick tracy showed off his first two - way wrist radio , inspiring baby boomers to babble into their knuckles in pursuit of bad guys like pruneface and the mole
the gadget was updated to a tv phone in 1964 , heralding a fantastic future for mobile communications
a half - century later the future is finally here , with a new wave of tracy-esque devices certain to accelerate following the much anticipated debut of apple watch in april -- which became official with the company 's " spring forward " preview on monday
in classic fashion , consumers huddled around apple watch stores to get a peek , some even showing up wearing padded wrist " hoodies " to make room for the watch when it goes on sale next month
naturally , apple watch faithful were urged on by tim cook , who tweeted : " got some extra rest for today 's event
slept in ' til 4:30
" arianna huffington weighed in on twitter , too : " looking forward to a smart watch that tells me not to cram too many things into too few hours
" analysts project sales of 25 million the first year and nearly 70 million by 2018
prices for the new watch range from $ 349 to a reported high of $ 17,000 for an 18 - karat gold version to make any rolex show - off feel at home
enthusiasm for apple watch -- and its long line of apps -- could lift the fortunes of samsung , sony , pebble and others pitching their own interactive watches , making the human wrist the most coveted piece of real estate since the redevelopment of times square
if apple watch does indeed take off , it would reignite the emerging -- but tricky -- market for wearable devices following google 's sudden move in january to halt public sales of its glass product , which failed to catch on in light of what the wall street journal said were concerns over " privacy , technical shortcomings and a lack of obvious uses
" the company is going back to its drawing board and hopes to re-introduce glass later this year
as the wearables wrist race heats up , it 's worth considering how these meta - timepieces -- with their tactile messaging , biometric loops and eye - controlled display screens -- could alter everyday behavior and spur new codes of etiquette , not to mention a few novel personality disorders
one of the most awaited features of apple watch will be its " taptic " engine , a sensory feedback tool derived from gamer joystick technology that allows for personalized tapping vibrations -- a " yo " - like blip for a work pal or an echo of your own heartbeat captured through an embedded cardio sensor
of course , your intended recipients will need their own apple watch watch to " feel " your greeting
early adopters will have to be extra careful with these taps -- imagine the explaining needed when someone inevitably sends a sonic valentine of their beating heart to their boss , or their child 's soccer coach
taptic wrist vibes can also carry a purpose -- reminding you to pick up a carton of eggs on your way home from work , or delivering an insistent flick from a client demanding a call - back
therein lies a brave new response in human conditioning
all of us are accustomed to electronic signals -- an alarm clock in the morning or a pop - up calendar invite on your phone
but there 's something manchurian candidate - like about a digital prompt delivered palpably to your wrist
sure , the watch is a transmitter , but it 's the person who 's being programmed
in the not - so - distant future , that driver you see lurching toward the off - ramp or the friend whose face glazes over at lunch could be in the grip of a taptic command from their watch
as an accessory , smart watches are perfect for new spatial positioning technology , such as apple watch 's ibeacon , which can triangulate a user 's exact location inside a building and allow targeted messaging when deployed in , say , a supermarket
wall street journal tech columnist christopher mims recently extolled the promise of ibeacon synched to your wrist device
he wrote : " imagine walking into a grocery store with a shopping list on your watch , which knows your location so precisely that it can plot a route through the store , saving you the frustration of wandering from aisle to aisle , wondering where that one particular item is
" that sounds great -- until the day our shopper , now utterly dependent on the beaconing system , discovers in a panic that she left her watch on her bedroom dresser
" how will i ever find the a- 1 sauce ? " will come the cry
you laugh now , but look what 's happened to legions of drivers , who can no longer navigate their own cities without relying on gps
look for more pile - ups at the deli counter once users let their watches do their shopping
the real question is what strategies smart - watch wearers will devise so as not to appear to be staring at their wrists all day
anyone who 's ever been trapped in an interminable business meeting or on an awkward date knows there are only so many ways you can discreetly glance at your watch before it becomes obvious
now , suppose you 're trying to follow someone 's instagram or twitter feed or the score of the yankees game , or perform any of a myriad functions that phone users have been doing for years , but which might look a little ruder when applied to your wristwatch
definitely expect to see more people fiddling with their sleeves , admiring their nails and earnestly cupping their brows with their opposite hand , in order to get a better look at the action on their watch
many users may end up simply removing their watches and dropping them in their laps alongside their phones , so they can tap with one hand and swipe with the other
as an unexpected boon to evolution , apple watch may soon be responsible for helping humans achieve a new level of ambidexterity , along with super-strong eye muscles
of course , a constantly raised wrist puts a strain on the shoulder , which suggests we 'll soon be hearing about exercises designed to prevent watch fatigue
some enterprising type might come up with a fashionable i - sling or support cushion to keep the arm and wrist sufficiently elevated to allow for hours of uninterrupted tapping and finger sketching
with so many digital features to track personal fitness -- including apple watch 's " accelerometer , " which will measure total body movement , as well as the number of steps and calories burned in a day -- the new wearables aspire to promote extreme wellness
the flip side is that such constant self - assessment will also lead to an increase in hypochondria and ocd symptoms among many wearers who already went nuts with their fitbits
and get ready for a new universal facial expression to emerge on elevators , subways and at the dinner table , as users learn to open their little round retina using just their eyes
it will be unblinking , mesmerized and zombie - like , with a hint of chin dribble : the smart watch stare
i 'm looking forward to practicing my own version
and if pruneface is out there listening , i 'm coming for you .
