horses played a crucial role ferrying supplies to australian troops during wwi and carrier pigeons kept commanders in touch with soldiers fighting on the front lines
but did you know domestic cats and dogs , kangaroos and even glow worms were enlisted by australian troops in their efforts to win the war ? new research has uncovered the extent to which a range of animals helped our troops in amazing historical photographs
of the 130,000 horses sent to battle in wwi only one horse , named sandy , made it back to australian shores mercer , content director at genealogy organisation ancestry.com , said a renewed interest australian 's war - time history prompted him to start researching the role of animals in the wwi , which led him to the discovery of a rich photographic history
mr mercer said horses played a vital role in wwi with around 130,000 sent overseas to support australian âs war effort
originally intended to play a cavalry role , it was soon realised the horses were not suited to the terrain and the men would have a better chance fighting on foot
â the horses went from being cavalry - based to assisting with transport and communication
they became very important to moving supplies and men from behind the lines to the battlefield
â horses usually drink about 30 litres of water a day but when resources were stretched at the height of the the animals often went 60 hours without life - sustaining fluids while carrying over 130 kilograms each of equipment , food , water and supplies
at war 's end , just one horse , named sandy , made it back to australian shores
the rest were put down or handed off to british units and used in palestine

camels were also the perfect candidate for long haul trips where it was required to pull heavy loads across long distances with very little food and water with a lack of water in the field camels were prime candidates for long haul trips where it was required to pull wounded men and heavy loads across long distances as they are genetically equipped to survive on little food and water
man âs best friend also found his way on to the battlefield , not only as a war - time companion , but to to carry important messages and sniff out explosives or injured soldiers
their superior strength , agility , territorial nature and trainability made them the perfect candidate for their jobs on the field
dogs strength , agility , territorial nature and trainability gave them the edge on the battle field â very often the phone lines on the western front would be destroyed in artillery barrages
men who acted as runners would be shot so dogs were used when all else failed to carry those really important messages
â dogs became such an important part of life on the battle field that soldiers made specialised gas masks to ensure the pooches were nât affected by deadly gas released on the field
another species also played a vital role in battlefield communications , and was the first animal to be awarded a medal of honour : the humble pigeon
carrier pigeons were the first animal awarded a medal for their contribution to the war carrier pigeons were used by troops to send important logistical information to their commanders when phone lines were damaged or it was difficult to send a runner
they were silent , quick and were nât affected by the gas that hung over combat zones at ground level
â men would go forward during battle carrying cages of pigeons so they could talk to their commanders if all else failed , â mr mercer told daily mail australia
carrier pigeons were used by troops to send â important logistical information â back to their commanders when the phone lines were damaged or it was difficult to send a runner
carrier pigeons were the first to be awarded the animal equivalent of a victoria cross - the dickin medal
it was presented after an animal displayed gallant devotion to serving the men and women on the field
mr mercer said this only testifies to the importance of the messages the pigeons carried
the medal was presented to 32 pigeons , 29 dogs , three horses and one cat
kangaroos were taken to hospitals to become companions for injured soldiers and played an important role in reminding soliers of home one of australian âs most iconic animals also made it across the globe to support our injured soldiers
kangaroos were taken to hospitals deep in the war zone to raise the morale of wounded soldiers
â they would take care of them , pat them and feel better about the difficult time they were facing
â i think it also reminded the men of australian , of home , â he added
donkeys stamina in the heat and cold made them the perfect candidate to carry soldiers and equipment the story of simpson and his donkey became a part of the anzac legend but there were many other donkeys and mules who âs stamina in the cold and heat contributed to their ability to perform while transporting soldiers and equipment throughout wwi
â they were also used to tow field ambulances and were very important in battles like gallipoli where it was difficult to move men and supplies from the front line
â â in the trenches of the western front there were serious problems with rats
as you could imagine wherever you have food , and unfortunately decaying bodies , there were rats and it was the cat âs job to keep them at bay â mr mercer said , like in any farming household , cats were also kept on boats and in trenches to take care of rodent problems
glow worms provided the soldiers with light , even in the darkest hour â in the trenches of the western front there were serious problems with rats
as you could imagine wherever you have food , and unfortunately decaying bodies , there were rats and it was the cat âs job to keep them at bay
â mr mercer said australian were known for their innovation in the trenches
even in the darkest of hours they found an interesting way to use glow worms that would bring light to the battlefield
â they adapted very quickly to very difficult situations and when they were in action , being asked to perform roles in the dark , they used glow worms to give themselves a bit of light where they needed it
â after collecting the worms , soldiers would place them into jars so they were able to examine maps or intelligence reports , even read letters from home
cramming ten glow worms into a jar could reportedly provide as much light as a modern day roadway light and did nât require the same kind of back up or fuel that other lights did
mr mercer said he 's seen a strong interest from australian who want to get a better idea of who they are and how their family history fits into the ' australian story '
