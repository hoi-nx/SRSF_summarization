the adoptive parents of a teenager missing from her home for years have received prison sentences from a federal judge who also scolded them for the girl 's treatment
u.s. district court judge thomas schroeder in winston-salem , north carolina , on friday sentenced casey parsons to 10 years in prison for tax fraud
her husband , sandy , received an eight - year sentence
erica , the couple 's niece , lived with the family until she disappeared in 2011 at age 13
she was n't reported missing until 2013 when her 20 - year - old adoptive brother informed authorities of his sister 's absence after getting into a fight with his parents
her husband , sandy , received an eight - year sentence schroeder said that , after sentencing more than 1,000 people , he has never been more troubled by a case
last month , the judge delayed the sentencing after a hearing revealed the conditions under which erica lived before her disappearance
prosecutors said the couple routinely abused the girl and continued to collect benefits after she disappeared
casey parsons and sandy parsons collected benefits for their adopted niece after her disappearance , including a $ 634 monthly check for adoption assistance
additionally , prosecutors say the parsons lied on their income tax returns by using different identities to make up false dependents
according to the indictment , erica was home - schooled , had hearing problems and learning disability
the parsons continue to claim that they sent erica to live with her ' nan ' , though the girl 's biological mother says no such grandparent exists
the missing teen 's biological mother carolyn spoke out against the couple 's claims , saying she will not give up looking for her daughter , who is now 15
video from wsoc-tv gone : erica was 13 years old when she was last seen in november 2011
however she was n't reported missing until july 2013
a picture of a younger erica on the left , while on the right an age - progressed image shows about what she would look like now she also said she had not wanted to hand her daughter over to her in - laws , but felt she had to because she was unable to bring up the child properly
' no mother wants to have children and just give them up , ' she said
' i did n't want to
she did n't deserve the life that i had
' carolyn says she has not seen erica since january 2011 , 10 months before she went missing
a polygraph test carried out on sandy parsons was found to be ' strongly deceptive ' when he described how he had nothing to do with her disappearance .
