sydney mum bushe , who won $ 10,000 on the today show this morning , has hit back at trolls who attacked her for not deserving the prize she said the money would ' massively ' change her life
ms bushe also said she had recently been served with an eviction notice as a result of not being able to pay the rent
her friend , nicole , who nominated her for the prize said ms bush is ' one of the strongest and most lovely women ' she has met , and very deserving of the cash
however , viewers of the show quickly took to today 's facebook page , attacking her justification for being job-less
' i did n't know your ( sic ) could get evicted for being pregnant , must be another reason ! ! ! and she said she only took kids in to look after them that 's not a foster parent because foster parents get paid to do that , ' one person wrote
channel nine weatherman jacobs arrived on ms bushes doorstep as part of the today show 's knock of cash competition ms bushe , who answered the door in her dressing gown , initially slammed the door in the presenter 's face ' this annoys me ! it 's called priorities ! i was a single mum with two kids one with a disability for 8yrs , no family to help me and i never once was not able to pay my bills ! ' another commented
' how about giving away cash to the average bloke & lady that work long hrs that are on a low wages just to give them a break well like that will ever happen these shows & radio shows always go after people with all the problems in world , ' one facebook user complained
ms bushe then leaped to her own defence , and swung back at the trolls attacking her
she explained that she had slept for little more than an hour overnight due to her medical condition , which explained her seemingly dazed and confused state when first opening the door
' i opened the door in my robe ( that did n't have a tie ) having no idea who was there and to be honest was a bit worried having a mic shoved in my face by a complete stranger not knowing what was going on , ' she wrote
online trolls attacked the mum 's win , saying she ' did n't have her priorities in order ' and that her pregnancy would n't have caused her not to have a job ms bushe quickly leaped to her own defence
' i was in a good job and a comfortable position before i fell pregnant and was able to afford these luxuries ' she said ' as for my piercings and tattoos
i was in a good job and a comfortable position before i fell pregnant and was able to afford these luxuries
i did n't get pregnant then run off and decide to get a million piercings
' ' as for fostering kids i do n't do this through foster care
i have taken kids in that have been kicked out of home and have nowhere to go
' so to answer some questions in here no i do n't get anything for it
' other users quickly began to throw their support behind ms bushe , and started hitting back at the ' cruel hearted ' and ' small minded ' people who were critical of her win
' australia has become such a nasty country ! so jealous that you all have to put this lady down when you do n't know her situation and do n't forget she 's been a foster mum to many kids
