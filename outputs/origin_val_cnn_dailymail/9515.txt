a mother has not eaten a meal for seven years due to a rare condition which left her stomach paralysed
nicola nichols , 25 , from bolton , was struck down by a ' mild case of man flu ' in 2008
she has not been able to keep any food or drink down since and vomited up to 50 times every day
initially doctors believed she had an eating disorder , before finally diagnosing her with gastroparesis
this is a condition in which the stomach muscles are paralysed , meaning food is not emptied properly
she unable to eat anything at her wedding to it worker ben , 27 , and has been told she will never eat again
mrs nicola nichols said : ' i ca n't really stress just how mild this flu was - i called it man flu
' my mum had flu at the same time but mine was only slightly different
' but once i started vomiting , it is crippling pain and i have n't really stopped vomiting since
' we always say that you take eating and drinking for granted until you ca n't do it
' i still cook the kid 's teas and it smells and looks great but if i even had a bite then i 'd be in crippling pain
' the mother - of - two ' miracle ' children was forced to jack in her new admin job after just three months to battle the debilitating illness
her weight plummeted from nine stone to just seven and her attempts to regain weight by eating food caused her to regurgitate anything she consumed
gastroparesis is a chronic condition in which the stomach is unable to empty in the normal way
symptoms including feeling sick and vomiting when eating , bloating , loss of appetite and weight loss
the problem is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles controlling the emptying of the stomach
in many cases , the cause of this nerve damage is unknown but it can also be caused by poorly controlled diabetes
other possible causes include parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis and some medications
the condition can not be cured but it can usually be controlled
some people are able to manage the condition by changing their diet , for example by eating six small meals a day or by sticking to soft , easily digestible foods
in some cases , symptoms can be improved with medication but other people require injections of botox into the valve between their stomach and small intestine
if all of these options fail , a patient can have a new procedure which involves fitting a pacemaker device to encourage the stomach to process food
if none of these options succeed in making the stomach process food , the patient will have to be fed through a tube
source : nhs choices the condition meant at her wedding she could only look on as guests lapped up a feast of duck , beef and a rich chocolate cake for dessert
mrs nicola nichols said : ' imagine being sat at the top table at your wedding watching everyone tuck in to the wedding cake that you made and you ca n't have any
' it was the same with the wedding breakfast and i just had to hold the glass of champagne for the toast , i could n't even have a sip
' of course , it was a magical day but it was so difficult
' mrs nicola nichols ' problems began when she was 18
her stomach stopped working after a bout of flu two years earlier , leaving her unable to keep any food or liquid down
she would vomit up to 50 times a day , but doctors suspected she had an eating disorder
finally , in 2008 mrs nicola nichols was diagnosed with gastroparesis , a condition in which there is a problem with nerves or stomach muscles , meaning it does not empty itself of food properly
it is caused by damage to the vagus nerve , which regulates the digestive system
when this nerve is damaged , the muscles in the stomach and intestines stop working , preventing food from moving through the digestive system properly
it is usually cause by diabetes , parkinson 's or as a complication of surgery , but sometimes there is no clear cause and sufferers report they after coming down with flu , a virus , food poisoning or after taking antibiotics
mrs nicola nichols was fitted with a gastro pacemaker , a metal device fitted in the abdomen to transmit electrical signals to the stomach muscles to get them working again
but the emergency measure failed and she suffered intestinal failure , where her bowel could not digest the foods and absorb the fluids necessary for her to live
she has to be fed directly into her bloodstream with total parenteral nutrition ( tpn ) - a specially made three - litre bag and pump that gives her nutrients for 12 hours every night
she has a food bag two days a week and a glucose bag five days a week , which both have to be stored between two and eight degrees
mrs nicola nichols was struck down with mild flu in 2008 , and after this vomited up to 50 times a day
she was unable to eat any of the food on her wedding day to partner ben , an it worker a side effect of being fed through a tube is that mrs nicola nichols ' hair became thin and fell out , something she finds difficult mrs nicola nichols said : ' it has a real impact on your life because you ca n't make any last - minute decisions - everything has to be planned months in advance ' ' you have to have the bag delivered there , the bag has to be stored in a fridge between two and eight degrees , everything has to be deep cleaned - sometimes it just really is n't worth it
' ' it 's funny because it really restricts your life but , obviously , i would n't be here without it so it gives me life too
' the illness has left mrs nicola nichols wheelchair - bound and she has had to watch her hair fall out , something she has found very difficult
she said : ' a side effect of the tpn is that your hair can get very thin and fall out
' my hair came out in clumps and i lost the majority of it and poor william said it scared him , which broke my heart , so ben chopped off all my long hair
' it 's awful for a woman to have to go through that - but after he did mine , he shaved his hair off too in support
' he joked and said he did n't want me to wake up the next day and be the only baldie in the family
' and she was consigned to hospital for three months after becoming seriously ill with sepsis in september last year
despite the chronic illness , she has managed to give birth to son william , three , and 11 - month - old daughter felicity
the two children were both born healthy despite their mother being unable to eat for two
mrs nicola nichols said : ' i call them my two miracle babies - william was fed off my old tube and felicity was fed by tpn
mrs nicola nichols knows she will never eat ' real food ' again , and her weight dropped from 9st to 7st ' william knows it 's different and will always say as soon as we meet anyway " my mummy is fed by a tube " , which really breaks the ice
' felicity is just coming up to the age where she keeps grabbing the tube and that 's not too helpful
' she adds that she feels ' luckier than most ' because she was able to have children , and receives support from her family and from william 's school
she said : ' we always say that someone else is always worse off
i 'm lucky that i have two beautiful children despite my problem
' william 's school is great
i have only managed to do one school run since he started in september because i was too poorly and could n't go in
' but the staff at the nursery have been fantastic - they take photocopies of the work he does in the day and photos of him in class and they send them to me so i can keep up with what he gets up to , so even though i am not always with it , i have snippets in my mind
â on days i feel like i ca n't take it anymore , seeing his face lit up is all i need to keep going
