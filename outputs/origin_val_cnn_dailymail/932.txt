blame modern life , but it turns out that sitting down all day puts you at more risk of having a heart attack or stroke
however , before you put your trainers on to make up for a day at your desk , experts warn going to the gym wo nât help either
a study has found that for every hour each day an adult spends sitting down during their life , the likelihood of developing heart disease goes up by 14 per cent
a study has found that for every hour each day an adult spends sitting down during their life , the likelihood of developing heart disease goes up by 14 per cent ( file picture ) and they said a session at the gym wo nât repair the damage because any increase in fitness from an hour âs exercise is undone by several hours of sitting
the study , presented at the american college of cardiology in san diego , california , adds to evidence of the damage caused by our sedentary lifestyles
government research warned last year that inactivity was as deadly as smoking and responsible for a sixth of deaths in britain
scientists from the medical college of wisconsin in the us looked at levels of activity of 2,031 adults whose average age was 50
they compared the number of hours spent sitting down each day with levels of deposits in blood vessels that signal for heart disease
sitting down all day puts you at more risk of having a heart attack or stroke , a study has found ( file picture ) the adults spent two to 12 hours a day sitting at the office and then in front of the tv
researchers found that for every hour spent sitting , the levels of artery deposits increased by 14 per cent
adults who went for regular runs , gym sessions or aerobics classes were no less at risk
lead researcher dr jacquelyn kulinski , an assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine , urged adults with office jobs to stand up or go for a walk every hour , adding : â reducing the amount of time you sit by even an hour or two a day could have a significant and positive impact on your future cardiovascular health
â despite the research suggesting the benefits of exercise could be quickly undone , she said it was important to aim for at least 30 minutes a day
â it âs clear that exercise is important to reduce your cardiovascular risk and improve your fitness level
â â the lesson here is that it âs really important to try to move as much as possible in your daily life , for example , take a walk during lunch , pace while talking on the phone , take the stairs instead of the elevator and use a pedometer to track your daily steps
â and if you do have a very sedentary job , do nât go home at night and sit in front of the tv for hours on end
â the news comes as it was revealed that antidepressants could protect against heart attacks and strokes
a us study of 5,000 patients found they were 50 per cent less likely to die or develop heart disease
scientists believe their improved mood has a major effect on their health
june davison , senior cardiac nurse at the british heart foundation , said : â we know that sitting down for long periods can have a negative effect on our heart health
â if you have a sedentary job it âs important to keep active during the day
you can try and get active by walking to see a colleague rather than sending an email , or taking the stairs rather than the lift
