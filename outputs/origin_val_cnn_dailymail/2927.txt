manor had no intention of competing at the season - opening australian grand prix and will pay a price for their failure to race , f1 's ringmaster bernie ecclestone indicated on monday
the struggling british - based team , who emerged from the remains of the failed marussia outfit after going into administration and missing the last three races of 2014 , failed to turn a wheel on the track in melbourne
they missed all three practice sessions and saturday qualifying , blaming software problems , which ruled them out of the race
manor mechanics work on their car in melbourne , but they failed to take part at any point over the weekend british driver will stevens has been named one of manor 's drivers this term , and graeme lowdon ( right ) however , they escaped punishment with stewards deciding to take no action after an enquiry decided the team had made ' all reasonable endeavours ' to get their cars ready
' we should have never ever , ever allowed manor to do what they 've done
i predicted this would happen , ' bernie ecclestone said
' they had no intention of racing in australian
they could n't have raced if someone had gone there with a machine gun and put it to their head
so they had no intention
we 'll have to see now
and they will have to pay their way to get there and get out of there , ' he added
bernie ecclestone has indicated that manor will pay the price for their no - show at the season opener marussia , who were ninth overall last season thanks to a ninth - place finish by frenchman jules bianchi in monaco , won a race against time to get their cars through crash tests and onto the air charter for australian
bernie ecclestone said there had been no charge for the freight because they were entitled to that providing they were competing
' they are not competing so they have to pay for that , ' he added
the team are in line for some Â£ 28million of revenues from last season but would have forfeited the right to that if they had not turned up to compete in australian with cars that satisfied the regulations
' we knew we had the possibility of unknown problems and we have n't had the benefit of sorting some of those problems out in pre-season testing , ' sporting director graeme lowdon said
' but equally we had to come here on the basis that we 're racing so we brought all of our normal equipment
there 's 28 tonnes of equipment to support these cars and all of the staff
' we are trying very hard but it is a tough thing to do in the time available
