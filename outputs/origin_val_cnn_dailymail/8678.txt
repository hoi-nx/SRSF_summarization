looking lean and healthy and sporting something of a george clooney look , darren clarke signed on for his first official engagement as europe âs ryder cup captain
there are 550 days to go before darren clarke takes his golfing monument men to minnesota to try to bring back the trophy â and many of those days will be filled with the sort of media engagements that occupied his time at the sofitel at heathrow âs terminal five
no doubt darren clarke may struggle for something to say on occasion but that was not the case here as he spoke about rory mcilroy and other pertinent matters , including one surprising comment regarding the ryder cup
darren clarke will captain europe at next year 's ryder cup in minneapolis the former open champion holds aloft the trophy on his first official appointment as captain after the comprehensive win at gleneagles last time in 2014 , the overwhelming temptation must be to keep everything the same but darren clarke is considering one small change to the blueprint
he plans to study the data on wildcards in the tournament before deciding whether to recommend cutting their number from three to two
of course , there are arguments both ways
he might leave himself short of options if too many of the top players fail to qualify automatically but there is an equally compelling case for saying the man finishing in 10th spot deserves to make the team by right
even this far out darren clarke is unequivocal , however , about who will be the team leader â it just has to be rory mcilroy
darren clarke has known the 25 - year - old ulsterman since before rory mcilroy was even a teenager
â rory mcilroy always was special as a kid and a golfer , â said darren clarke
â he was different from everyone else and still is
â darren clarke has backed his compatriot rory mcilroy to complete his grand slam of all four majors the world no 1 travels to augusta in a fortnight needing only the masters to complete his set the skipper is excited to see how rory mcilroy fares at the masters next month but is adamant about one thing : rory mcilroy will complete the career grand slam one day
â if he does nât win it this year , he will win it next year , â he said
â he âs just too good not to win it , with all his gifts and on a course made for his game
â what sort of captain will darren clarke be ? given his emotional personality , it is hardly surprising he picks out the ryder cup ships run by ian woos-nam and sam
â sam once said to me that playing in the ryder cup is like having your first child , that you really ca nât describe it until you âve gone through it , and that âs always stuck with me , â he said
â i was fortunate enough to experience the pressure of contending for a major and coming through to win , but for me the pressure of the ryder cup was far greater
â and i will be a player - friendly captain
some might think i âm too close to the players but i will not shirk my responsibilities
â darren clarke is keen to foster that community feeling that marked paul âs team in 2014 and one or two earlier incarnations
â it was interesting seeing that from the outside at gleneagles , â he said
â i was working for sky but that togetherness was still so easy to see and clearly so beneficial
â players celebrate with former captain paul after winning the ryder cup at gleneagles last year darren clarke had a well - publicised falling out with paul but , thankfully , both are keen to present a united public front
â of course i will be taking up his offer to talk with him , â said darren clarke
â paul could nât have done a better job so it would be foolish not to talk
i intend to speak to all the captains
how can that not be a help ? â the first day in a new job can often be a nervous one but darren clarke was composed and confident , and enjoyed some light - hearted football banter
after sir alex ferguson âs motivational talk at glen - eagles , would clarke the liverpool fan ask keen golfer steven gerrard to speak in minneapolis , given he will be playing in america by then ? â after yesterday , what a time to ask me that ! â he said
what price tiger woods pulling out of the masters next week just as he did last year ? whatever happens , it is guaranteed already to be another sad landmark in his startling fall from grace
now down to 96th in the world , tiger woods is certain next monday to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since october 13 , 1996
tiger woods is set to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since october 1996 â i have a dislocated shoulder and it has been keeping me out of the gym , which is disappointing
i want to stay fit because
well , i shall be old one of these days
â arnold palmer holding court as tournament host last week
now 85 , the great man promised that not even a dislocated shoulder would prevent him from hitting the ceremonial first tee shot at the masters
in the words of the old bob dylan song , may he stay forever young
arnold palmer ( right ) presents matt every with the trophy after winning the invitational in orlando there is a fine line separating casey in 49th place in the world rankings from warren in 51st but right now it is making a huge difference
one is heading to the masters in a fortnight âs time while the other is not
that could all change , however , following the open this week
anyone inside the top 50 after this event will get an invitation to augusta and while warren has secured a prized sponsor âs invitation , casey has decided to stay at home in arizona
casey will be sweating on warren 's performance at the open to find his masters fate what price scotsman warren , on a straight - shooter âs course that ought to suit his eye , tipping the englishman out of the field for the season âs first major ? it is to be hoped that both scrape in
under the ranking system , casey is actually projected to move up a spot without taking the week âs events into account ( proceedings at the trophee hassan in morocco on the european tour could also influence matters )
so not just warren but two other players would have to go past casey to deny him a masters outing
as for warren , anything resembling the tied - 17th finish he achieved in his last start at miami âs cadillac championship would do the trick
among those who could also force their way to augusta via their efforts in morocco are englishmen andy sullivan ( 61st ) and tommy fleetwood ( 66th ) .
