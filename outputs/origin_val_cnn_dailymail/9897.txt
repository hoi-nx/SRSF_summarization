he is notorious for remaining tight - lipped about his personal life in interviews
and last night davis cup team - mate inglot must have hoped murray would extend the same privacy to his fellow players
asked by eurosport presenter annabel croft how the team would celebrate following victory over the usa , murray was quick to point out that his 29 - year - old team - mate has a â little girlfriend on the go here in glasgow â
quiet murray ! murray , far left , with anabel croft , his brother jamie , centre , and a mortifies inglot tweet : inglot appeared eager to set the record straight on twitter following murray 's joke unfortunately for inglot , he already has a girlfriend of six months at home in london
when asked for the name of the lady in question , a mortified inglot replied : â you âve actually landed me in this
because i actually have a girlfriend that âs going to be watching this
â the jokey stitch - up left murray in hysterics as the team sheepishly shuffled away from the disastrous interview
a source close to the team last night explained that murray was unaware inglot has a girlfriend in london and did not know that the joke would backfire on his team mate
but a spokesperson for the lta last night dismissed the stitch - up as â pure banter â
laura lord of the lta said it was â just a bunch of guys messing around â
inglot , from chiswick , was only playing his second davis cup match and , as a specialist in doubles , is not someone murray habitually spends much time with although they are friends
