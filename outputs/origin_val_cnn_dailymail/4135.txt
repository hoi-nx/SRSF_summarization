' a birthmother had selected us ! she was due in three weeks â¦ we were finally going to be fathers ! ' but after the baby was born , two days before thanksgiving , the social worker told them that the mother had chnaged her mind : she had decided to keep the baby
' words can not even begin to describe the shock , heartache , and sheer disbelief we felt â¦ for weeks , ' they recalled
' looking back , we were lucky â¦ we could have had her longer , fallen deeper in love , promised her more ; but regardless of whether you have a child for ten minutes or for the rest of your life , you have been changed with their presence
' it was a rough thanksgiving â¦ and an even harder christmas â¦ but by the time january was upon us , we were ready to start again
although the situation was devastating and extremely unfortunate , it reaffirmed our strong desire and commitment to becoming fathers
' with a renewed spirit and the sweet melody of ms trainor 's song , they were inspired to create a parody / ' our goal is to have our video shared with as many people as possible in hopes of being connected with our future birthmother
