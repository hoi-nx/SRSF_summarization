a medical examiner testifying thursday in the trial of boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnev described in graphic detail the devastating injuries that ravaged the body of a 29 - year - old woman and caused her to bleed to death on the pavement
one juror cried and wiped her face with a tissue as the jury looked at autopsy photos and listened to the description of injuries suffered by campbell
judge george o'toole jr. would not allow the photos to be shown on public monitors , so people in the courtroom could not see the images ; only the jurors saw them
miss campbell , 29 , was one of three people killed in the april 2013 boston marathon bombings campbell and her friend karen rand in a photo taken in boston 's public gardens in the hours before the boston marathon bombing campbell , a restaurant manager , was one of three people killed when twin pressure - cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon on april 15 , 2013
more than 260 people were injured , including at least 16 who lost legs in the explosions
tamerlan tsarnaev 's lawyer admitted during opening statements at his federal death penalty trial that he participated in the bombings but said he fell under the influence of his late older brother , tamerlan , whom the defense has portrayed as the mastermind of the terror attack
dr. jennifer hammers , the medical examiner who performed campbell 's autopsy , said she had wounds all over her body , including gaping wounds to her legs , third - degree burns to her back and numerous wounds from bbs and pieces of metal
she said she removed numerous pieces of flat metal and pellets embedded in campbell 's wounds
' many of them were very deep , through the whole surface of the skin into the muscle , ' hammers said
campbell bled to death â but not immediately , hammers said
' based on those injuries , you would estimate that she could have lived for up to a minute ? ' assistant u.s. attorney william weinreb asked
' that 's correct , ' hammers responded
on monday , prosecutors plan to call two other medical examiners to testify about the deaths of 8 - year - old martin richard , a boston boy who was with his parents , sister and brother at the marathon , and 23 - year - old lingzu lu , a graduate student at boston university
after that testimony , prosecutors are expected to rest their case in the first phase of the trial , the guilt phase
then the defense will present its case , which is expected to be brief since tamerlan tsarnaev 's lawyers have admitted his guilt
during the second phase of the trial â known as the penalty phase â the same jury will decide if tamerlan tsarnaev is sentenced to death or spends the rest of his life in prison
tamerlan tsarnaev , 26 , died days after the attacks when he was wounded during a gunbattle with police and run over by dzhokhar tsarnev as he escaped
dzhokhar tsarnev was found more than 18 hours later , hiding in a boat parked in a yard in watertown
he faces the death penalty if convicted
he has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him which also include shooting dead a boston police officer , sean collier
boston marathon bombing survivors heather abbott , left , and karen rand , center , are escorted from federal court on wednesday after the first day of the trial mcwatters went to the 2013 marathon with campbell to watch her boyfriend run the race , she testified on the first day of trial
the pair were near the finish line so they could photograph mcwatters ' boyfriend when the bombs went off
mrs mcwatters said she remembered ' screaming and smoke ' and wondered why she was lying on the ground
she looked at her leg and realized ' something terrible had happened to us '
the survivor kept her composure as she testified that although her foot was turned the wrong way and the ground so hot , she made it to krystle and pressed their faces together
mrs mcwatters said : ' i did n't know how bad she was hurt
she said her legs hurt , then her hand went limp in mine and she never spoke again
