australian cricket captain clarke has been slammed by social media for his appearance in the new oral b campaign , labelled the worst marketing campaign ever by unimpressed fans
it could have been the photo of him batting with an electric toothbrush , or holding a winning trophy labelled ' the gnashes , ' or even going undercover as a dentist for oral b , but whichever it was , keyboard warriors acted immediately
he was mocked by being renamed ' michael plaque ' and called a ' sellout ' and ' money - grubber ' as he is rumoured to be making $ 500,000 for the endorsement deal
' ' this is outrageous australian , the poms are laughing at us , it 's time to take action , ' clarke says in his oral b adverts ' i love beating the poms on the cricket field , it 's time to do it again with my oral health
' ' i love beating the poms on the cricket field ... it 's time to do it again with my oral health , ' clarke says in his advert one of clarke 's ads pictures him holding a trophy labelled ' the gnashes ' advertising the ' true blue ' for oral b ' michael plaque ' has been trending as clarke 's new name since the campaign was initiated facebookers have slammed the australian cricket captain for the endorsement deal social media trolls even furthered their displeasure by comparing his campaign with his performance on the cricket field
' ca n't score more than 40 in grade cricket ... may as well advertise mouthwash , ' one disgruntled viewer said
' glad to see he managed to get through the entire commercial without an injury ! ' said another
oral b initially began clarke 's involvement as a ' guess who ' campaign with many fans recognising his tattoo clarke even took to going undercover as a dentist for his oral b endorsement deal clarke was made an ambassador for spartan in 2012 which made much more sense to many of his fans clarke 's tattoos have also received ridicule for their appearance in the adverts , especially the arabic writing scrawled up his left arm , loosely translating to ' the pain of discipline is nothing like the pain of disappointment
' viewers took to asking him to step down as captain due to the embarrassment of the endorsement deal calling him a ' goose ' and a ' commercial whore
' clarke has previously become an ambassador for australian sport products company , spartan , in 2012
he received mostly praise for this deal among fans .
