golden retriever are known to be one of the most - loving dog breeds
and for one named smiley , being born without eyes was not going to stop him from being just that
the gorgeous pup from stouffville , canada , was adopted from a ' scary ' puppy mill by local dog lover joanne george , who believes pairing smiley up with a deaf great dane named tyler was the best decision she has made
' tyler was so bouncy and crazy and happy go lucky and [ smiley ] turned into the same dog , ' george told abc
' one smiley began interacting with people more and more , george realized how good at it he was
she started taking him to hospitals and schools to visit people who needed some cheering up
there was one patient in a nursing home named teddy that had no communication and could not speak at all
staff said they had never seen him smile
that was , of course , until smiley came along
' ( teddy ) smiled when smiley got into his vision , ' george recalled
blind : smiley is prone to run into things , but walks around very carefully careful : smiley takes high steps when he walks to feel out the ground around him self - reliant : owner joanne george said the best thing she did was let smiley work things out alone precious : the gorgeous pup from stouffville , canada , was adopted from a ' scary ' puppy mill by local dog lover joanne george many people who have had contact with smiley say they either did n't realize or soon forgot that he had a disability
his is prone to run into things , but walks around very carefully
he takes high steps when he walks , so as to feel around the ground and see whats around
george said she has taught him to follow her voice
she also said it was important for him to work things out by himself , and she 's glad she let him discover that
' somebody through st. john âs ambulance is wanting to adopt a dog that âs blind , ' george told abc
' i told her of all those things , don â t be his eyes , do nât run his life , do nât â keep him in a bubble
' adventurous : not having eyes does not hold smiley back from doing what he wants
