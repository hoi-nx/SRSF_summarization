education secretary education secretary admitted she was â concerned â about what might be being taught in some schools
she told murnaghan on sky news : â i âm not going to comment on what is a leaked document , but i think as education secretary it would be right for me to say i am of course concerned about what might be taught in some of our schools
â and we have since last year required all schools to actively promote these fundamental british values so that our education system is opening up young minds , it is not closing them down
â and i think the messages that young people receive , whether it âs in school or outside school , are very , very important

it adds : â we need to stand up and be more assertive in promoting our values and challenging the extremists who fundamentally oppose them
â â this will include explaining our foreign policy ( and ) promoting mainstream voices supporting the quiet majority in all communities who oppose extremism
