european council president donald tusk said cameron 's plans were ' mission impossible ' cameron 's hopes of winning sweeping changes to britain 's relationship with brussels are ' mission impossible ' , the top eu politician who will run the negotiations has said
donald tusk , the president of the europe council representing eu leaders , said he was ' ready to help cameron ' â but dismissed his chances of negotiating a new europe treaty within the next two years before holding an eu referendum
the former polish prime minister said it would be hard to find agreement among all 27 eu leaders that would satisfy mr cameron
he said : ' i have no doubt that we have to help in a limited and rational framework
we have to help cameron because he is obviously pro-european
but mr donald tusk added : ' i am sceptical when it comes to changing the treaty
' mr cameron wants a new brussels treaty to nail down a series of changes allowing britain to limit benefits for eu migrants
the pm has insisted that new rules are needed to help the crisis - hit eurozone , giving britain the chance to renegotiate its relationship with brussels
but mr donald tusk said : ' my intuition is that treaty change is close to mission impossible today because it 's not only about rationality , about good argument
' we need unanimity between 28 member states , in the europe parliament , in 28 national parliaments in the process of ratification
to say that it is a pandora 's box is too little
' mr donald tusk said : ' first of all we need more precise concrete [ details ] about united kingdom demands
' when we have more information about details , about legal problems , then we can decide if discussion about treaty change is at all necessary
' for me the problem of possible treaty change is a practical question
it 's not only about the arguments of cameron
i can agree or disagree with some of them
' but at the end of the day i would like to ask him ' what is your concrete proposal ? ' and then i can consult with the other member states
' mr donald tusk , the former polish prime minister likened cameron 's chances of negotiating a new eu treaty by 2017 to the tom cruise blockbusters ' mission impossible ' but he said : ' we need , also for the united kingdom , a good solution for cameron and britain under existing law , ' he said
' we need the united kingdom in europe
for me there 's no more obvious political thesis than this one
and i feel , but it 's not my role to decide about it , but i feel that the united kingdom needs europe
' the former polish prime minister 's remarks are the first since he took over as european council president in december
he also admitted , in an interview with the guardian , that he will find it hard to crack down on immigration â because of the number of polish living and working abroad
he said : ' it 's not easy for me because of some expectations close to the immigration problems , which means also the huge polish minority in britain
