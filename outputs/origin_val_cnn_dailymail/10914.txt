a lesbian has created a unique sex toy , which also serves as a means of at - home artificial insemination
stephanie berman , a reproductive health expert from boston , came up with the clever concept , which she named the semenette , after examining the other available methods of at - home fertilization open to her and her wife
' the only options other than going to a doctor 's office would be with a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe , ' ms stephanie berman told refinery29 about her creation , which retails for $ 139.99
' there is nothing romantic or sexy and fun about trying to impregnate your wife with a turkey baster
' moving on up : ms stephanie berman is hoping to release a second version of the unique sex toy later this year the mother - of - one began looking into alternative designs , which would use the same pump - based technology as a turkey baster - one of the more traditional at - home means of artificial insemination - but also enable the user , and their partner , to enjoy the process of impregnation
and while ms stephanie berman initially intended for the toy , which comes complete with a pump , to be used by lesbian couples , she explained that it will actually serve as a great fertilization aid for anyone who might not be able to get pregnant using traditional means - and who does not want to go through ivf
' when my wife and i wanted to start a family , we thought about our options and were nât necessarily happy with any of them , ' she added
' i started thinking , what if i could recreate the technology that a turkey baster would provide , but in the form of a sex toy ? ' that would be the perfect scenario - it would not only allow both partners to be really involved in the process , but it would allow for privacy and authenticity and intimacy
' ms stephanie berman and her wife kiersten marie , who used the semenette when conceiving their one - year - old baby daughter isabella , have received an outpouring of support and praise from a variety of people from different communities
thus far , the entrepreneur 's unique creation has been used by transgender and transsexual couples , men with erectile dysfunction and even heterosexual couples , who , ms stephanie berman explained , still ' enjoy the sensation ' of using the semenette
the turkey baster method is widely thought to be the most common means of at - home artificial insemination
tradition : a turkey baster ( pictured ) can be used as a means of at - home insemination while some women choose to use a traditional turkey baster , a needle-less syringe will also serve the same purpose
the method involves women using semen from their boyfriend or husband , or from a willing donor , which they then inject into themselves using a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe
women who are eager to use this method are advised to attempt it on the day of ovulation and the 2 - 3 days before ovulation
while the success rate of the turkey baster method is thought to be reasonably high , some women , like the semenette 's creator stephanie berman , have complained that it causes discomfort , and it is not known to be particularly enjoyable for the user
however , the method is still favored by women who do not wish to undergo ivf
indeed , the product has proved so successful that the businesswoman has launched a new crowdsourcing campaign on indiegogo.com in the hopes of funding the semenette 2.0 , which will come in a wider variety of colors , shapes and sizes , according to its website
' up to this point , we [ have ] manufactured 500 units in three realistic colors , vanilla , cinnamon and chocolate , ' ms stephanie berman explains on her indiegogo page
' with your contribution , we will manufacture the semenette v2 in new non-realistic color options ( tell us what color you want to see ) , make different sizes of the toy , larger bulbs ... and use a softer silicone to enhance the comfort and feel of the toy
' and ms stephanie berman insists that the semenette should not just be viewed as a means of insemination - but can also be used by couples , or single people , who are looking to get a bit more creative in the bedroom
' i âve had people use this at bachelorette parties , and they put alcohol in it , ' she added to refinery29
' you have to take into consideration what you âll be introducing into the body
a lot of people will use lubricants ... ' it sort of depends on what your desires are , but the most common things in there are probably lubricant or other stuff that 's okay to be put on or in the body
