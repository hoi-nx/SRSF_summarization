federal prosecutors could file corruption charges against new jersey senator menendez by the end of the week , ending a years - long saga that has had the democratic party politician livign and working under a shadow of criminal suspicion
the wall street journal reported that the ranking democrat on the senate would see charges filed in his native new jersey , citing people familiar with the fbi 's investigation
the allegations against menendez involve claims that he used his office to promote the business interests of a democratic party donor and close friend in exchange for personal gifts
menendez has denied any wrongdoing , vowing that he is ' not going anywhere
' but a grand jury probe that has lasted for two years coudl complicate his future
the senator : sen. menendez , a new jersey democrat , may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption politics : ( l - r ) menendez , donor melgen , white house minority leader nancy pelosi , and her husband paul , posed in february 2012 at a national association of latino elected and appointed officials gala menendez , 61 , has seen pressure from the obama administration over his positions on cuban and iranians , leading some republicans who share his foreign policy views to suspect that the white house is exacting retribution on him
but more troubling are the ethics questions lingering about menendez 's relationship with florida eye doctor melgen , a wealthy and prolific donor
the senator 's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the medicare on his friend 's behalf , pushing back against accusations of overbilling the medicare system by $ 8.9 million
menendez has also repaid melgen $ 58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor 's private jet , mostly to the posh dominican republic resot casa de campo
but his spokeswoman fiercely denied he has done anything illegal even as a conservative group is calling for him to resign and face the music
enright , menendez 's communications director , told daily mail online in a statement earlier this month that ' we believe all of the senator 's actions have been appropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that
' ' any actions taken by senator menendez or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason
' ' the senator has counted dr. melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades , ' enright said
' the two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other âs family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts
' coy : attorney general eric holder would n't talk on friday about whether charges are forthcoming for menendez , saying ' i ca n't comment ' she called the investigation 's beginnings ' suspect , ' referring to ' false allegations ' that have been ' discredited ' in the past
meanwhile , the conservative activist group american commitment has called on menendez to resign his office
on a new website called byebob.com , the group claims he ' unethically , and likely criminally , compromised his ability to represent the people of new jersey
' cnn reported that the investigation into menendez is reaching a crescendo , with prosecutors under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out on some charges
attorney general eric holder , according to the network , has already given his approval
but he insisted ' i ca n't comment on that ' when a reporter asked him about the report friday afternoon after obama gave a speech in south carolina
menendez 's first high - level meeting at hhs related to melgen 's medicare troubles occurred on june 7 , 2012 , according to court documents seen by the new jersey law journal
the government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with tavenner , who was then in charge of the agency 's medicare subagency
court papers also indicate menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call , and then took nevada sen. reid , who was then the senate majority leader , to an august 2 , 2012 meeting with the hhs 's then - secretary , sebelius
cnn reported that melgen was one of the medicare system 's most - reimbursed doctors nationwide , during the years when he was also a major donor to menendez and to the majority pac
that political action committee , run by former reid staffers , collected more than $ 700,000 from melgen and made sure $ 600,000 of it benefited menendez âs re-election campaign
the senator , now the ranking democrat on the senate and its chairman until two months ago , has become a thorn in the white house 's side by taking positions that grate on president obama
menendez opposed the presdient 's rapprochement with cuban strongman raul castro , saying in december that his actions ' have vindicated the brutal behavior of the cuban government
' he has stood in the way of the state department 's negotiations with iranians , threatening to lead congress in imposing new sanctions on the islamic republic if it does n't shelve its nuclear ambitions
the white house has insisted the iranians can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain
' i have to be honest with you , ' menendez said during a january 21 capitol hill hearing
' the more i hear from the administration and its quotes , the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of tehran
' while he is not among the senate 's super-rich elites , the new jersey legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges : his legal defense fund has already collected , and spent , more than $ 1 million
last week two of his senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case , arguing that the senator 's actions , and theirs , are protected by the u.s. constitution 's ' speech or debate ' clause
those words in u.s. 's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny , including justice department investigations , while they are actively working on legislation
the doctor : melgen , a wealthy florida ophthalmologist and a major menendez donor , was ordered to pay back medicare for $ 8.9 million in overbillings , and menendez intervened with hhs for him search warrant : a january 30 raid of melgen 's medical practice yielded van - loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files according to the new jersey law journal , aide michael barnard refused to answer 50 questions about menendez 's conversations with sebelius and tavenner , and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator 's office and melgen 's lawyer - lobbyist about those conversations
another more senior aide , former menendez chief counsel talbot , reportedly refused to testify about a separate mattter
the grand jury wanted to know if talbot had emailed a staffer at u.s. customs and border protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port - screening equipment â principally cargo - container x-ray machines â to the dominican republic
melgen , the senator 's donor , controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through
the x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband
narco - politics : dr. melgen controlled a company that wanted a dominican republic ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs
menendez allegedly helped ensure the u.s. would n't provide the machines for free in 2013 fbi agents and investigators from hhs raided melgen 's west palm beach , florida medical office , vitreo-retinal consultants
over a period of nearly 24 hours , then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing whatnews reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files
the washington post reported at the time that hhs auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments melgen 's practice billed to medicare
other news reports described an alleged scheme in which melgen used leftover fluid from single - use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients , billing medicare for a new vial with each treatment
the government typically paid $ 2,000 for each container , raising the possibility that melgen could have overbilled medicare between $ 4,000 and $ 6,000 per vial .
