anti-drugs lessons in schools may encourage pupils to try illegal substances rather than steer clear of them , government experts have warned
the advisory council on the misuse of drugs said there was evidence that raising awareness could be counter-productive
its report said prevention classes that have been taught for generations were â ineffective at changing behaviour â and â may even increase the risk of drug use â
it urged the government to cut funding unless there is good evidence that anti-drugs initiatives , such as 2003 âs â talk to frank â campaign are working
the report also said that hard - hitting school talks by policemen may make drugs appear â sexy â to teenagers , while adverts that intended to conjure a â fear â of drugs were also criticised as potentially counter-productive
many schools have already switched to behaviour - led measures that help children to avoid peer pressure , but experts have urged for faster and more wide - covering progress
its report said prevention classes that have been taught for generations were â ineffective at changing behaviour â and â may even increase the risk of drug use â ( file picture ) however , the report does concede that there is growing evidence of the importance of teaching drug prevention as part of a broader strategy to improve national health
a home office spokesman said : â preventing and reducing drug misuse is a key part of our drug strategy and there are positive signs our approach is working
â there has been a long term downward trend in drug use over the last decade , the number of heroin and crack cocaine users in england continues to decline , and more people are recovering from their dependency now than in 2009 - 10
â our evidence - based approach recognises the importance of having a range of prevention initiatives to give individuals the confidence to resist drugs
we welcome the advisory council on the misuse of drugs âs advice on this important issue
