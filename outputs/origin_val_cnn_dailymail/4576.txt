inevitably , it all kicked off in the end
three games in two competitions over 10 days has forged some barely disguised contempt between celtic and united
six red cards tell their own tale
for mcnamara âs team , the frustration â and indiscipline â is growing
ryan mcgowan became the fourth united player to see red in the dying minutes , seconds after celtic âs anthony stokes was dismissed for a retaliatory kick at paton
afterwards , deila rounded on the australian , claiming he could have injured substitute henderson â for life â
the open wounds enveloping this fixture are now there for all to see

spark sent off : ryan mcgowan booked : cierzniak , rankin , ciftci referee : murray it is hard to see who will stop scotland âs champions now
united will have a fourth attempt in the spfl premiership this weekend
yet after losing the league cup and crashing out of the william hill scottish cup in this quarter - final replay , that prospect holds all the appeal of a cold - meat buffet with jeremy clarkson
inverness caley thistle will make all the right noises before a william hill scottish cup semi-final at hampden
aberdeen believe their title aspirations are alive and well
yet , celtic are developing a habit of wrapping themselves around opponents and squeezing tight
for deila , the fourth domestic treble in this old club âs history is edging over the horizon
jason denayer âs 17th - minute headed goal was the platform for leigh griffiths to add a second on 57 minutes
kris commons thrashed the third high into the net 12 minutes from time before virgil van dijk tapped in from close range in the final moments
by then , things threatened to run out of control
anthony stokes had taken a kick at paton and witnessed the flash of red
the crowd bayed for retribution against ryan mcgowan seconds later and were duly obliged by referee murray
in a freakish run of three consecutive meetings , united have now scored one , losing six
they return to glasgow at the weekend a punch - drunk team blighted by suspensions , with former players stuart arsmtrong , gary mackay-steven likely to return to the celtic fray
it âs hardly a prospect to savour
deila âs team began the game with a flourish and kept going
ciftci , the united striker spared further punishment for a kick to the face of brown in the first game , felt the celtic skipper âs robust retribution in all of six seconds
it was a forerunner for what was to come
for one heart - stopping moment in only the second minute , the visitors feared they might witness their latest red card in this fixture when keeper cierzniak raced from his line to clatter leigh griffiths as he hared on to a superb commons through ball
leigh griffiths had already lost control , the goalscoring opportunity gone
referee murray â rightly â contented himself with a yellow card
he would have the chance to flex his muscles later
jason denayer ( centre ) rises above the united defence to score the opener for the hosts jason denayer celebrates after putting celtic 1 - 0 up in the william hill scottish cup quarter - final mcnamara reshaped his defence in the absence of suspended duo paul dixon and sean dillon , fielding midfielder rankin as a makeshift , emergency left - back
the midfielder suffered a form of torture here
it made for painful viewing
forrest â finally free of injury and a scorer in last sunday âs league cup triumph â used his pace to offer celtic width and speed
even so , the home team had just one goal to show for 45 minutes of dominance at the interval
it came from a calum butcher foul on kris commons midway inside the united half
anthony stokes â an improved performer since his recent disciplinary faux pas â floated the ball into a crowded area , jason denayer planting a firm , looping header beyond cierzniak for his fifth of the season
at hampden , celtic were loathe to build on their lead and possession
so it was here again
a commons corner picked out virgil van dijk , the dutchman âs firm header surging over the bar
celtic 's leigh griffiths ( right ) is airborne as he puts his side 2 - 0 in front against united leigh griffiths gives a salute as he slides across the celtic park pitch in celebration taunting and tormenting rankin , forrest then came close to scoring by accident
putting his head down and surging for the byeline , his attempted cross dropped under the bar and was heading into the net until cierzniak tipped over at the last
another opportunity was passed up before half - time , a sclaffed cierzniak kick out to bitton prompting a rare loss of composure in the usually unflappable israeli
he had the chance to shoot , but opted to take on callum morris instead and lost the ball
united âs resistance was sporadic
they came close in 32 minutes after an outstanding incursion down the right flank by ryan mcgowan
the australian made it unchecked from his own half to the celtic byeline , his low centre aimed at ciftci before celtic keeper gordon managed â unconvincingly â to get a hand on the ball
kris commons ( second left ) scores celtic 's third goal of the evening at their home ground commons celebrates as celtic go three up against united in the cup efe ambrose , in that way of his , casually walked the ball clear from under his own crossbar
celtic then began the second period in a ragged , loose fashion and that allowed the visitors their best spell of the game
in the opening five minutes , united summoned more attacking menace than they had managed in the entire first 45
ciftci âs low , right - foot shot was pushed up in the air by gordon as he retrieved another piercing ball across the face of goal from ryan mcgowan
but it did nât last long
until the 57th minute to be precise
celtic scored with virtually their first effort on goal in the second period , leigh griffiths cleverly guiding a quite superb long ball from brown past cierzniak with a first - time effort from 12 yards
the outcome was placed beyond doubt 11 minutes from time
commons blew a fine chance after a flowing passing move involving darnell fisher , bitton and a anthony stokes cut - back
last season âs player of the year â a scorer at hampden last sunday â dallied too long
celtic 's anthony stokes speaks with referee murray before he is sent off celtic 's john guidetti ( second right ) shows his fury as he comes together with ryan mcgowan ryan mcgowan is sent off by referee murray as both sides end the match with 10 men van dijk scores with a tap - in late on to cap a successful night for the home side but within seconds he atoned , playing a deft one - two with substitute john guidetti before slamming the ball high into the net for 3 - 0
what came next was regrettable , but predictable
two teams sick of the sight of each other began settling scores
anthony stokes took a blow to the mouth , drawing blood , and the irishman took swift revenge as he lay on the deck
within moments , the scores were evened up when ryan mcgowan âs crude lunge at substitute henderson sparked a melee at the corner flag
the former hearts player went off after what deila described as a â stupid â challenge â with some verbals between the two as he left the pitch
and deila âs players had the last word when virgil van dijk tapped in jason denayer âs simple cut back from close range .
