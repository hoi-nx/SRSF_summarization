pietersen has signed a contract to return to surrey this summer and will donate all of his salary to his kp24 foundation
the move gives the record - breaking batsman the opportunity to press for an england recall , after being sacked in february 2014 following the ashes whitewash defeat in australia
pietersen cleared the way for a return to the oval by agreeing a release from the majority of his ipl contract with sunrisers hyderabad - which clashed with the start of the english domestic season - and he will be available for surrey 's first county championship match against glamorgan in cardiff on april 19
encouraged by new ecb chairman graves ' indication that he may be back in the mix if he can impress again in county cricket , the 34 - year - old pietersen has two months to do that if he is to achieve his dream of a test recall in time for this summer 's ashes rematch
pietersen will have nine county championship matches at the most to impress england 's selectors he 's secured a released from sunrisers hyderabad to stake his claim for an england return in the ashes pietersen told surrey 's website kiaoval.com : ' i 'm absolutely thrilled to be back at surrey
' it 's a club very close to my heart - and ( director of cricket ) stewart , ( coach ) graham ford and everyone at the club has been exceptionally supportive
' there is a fantastic group of lads here , and i hope we can deliver what the great surrey fans want to see - lots of runs and comprehensive victories
' pietersen also wrote in his column in the telegraph : ' when i heard graves say that i would be considered for selection again if i play county cricket and score runs i realised i had the opportunity for a fresh start
i always said this was not about money and i will be donating my full surrey wage to my foundation
' even if this does not work out and i do not get back in the england team , i will at least end my career knowing i gave it another shot
i would kick myself for a long time if i walked away now without having a go
' a lot of people thought i would not be prepared to put in the hard yards and play county cricket but i will do anything to get that england cap back on my head
' pietersen will donate his full salary from surrey to his kp24 foundation imminent surrey signing pietersen says he will ' do everything in my power to earn a recall ' with england stewart added : ' a pietersen with ambitions to play for england and a real determination to score big runs for surrey will be a huge asset to us
' the apparent clinching development in pietersen 's negotiations to rejoin the club which de-registered him at the end of last season was the sunrisers hyderabad ' willingness to release him from the majority of his contract
pietersen would have been in india for more than seven weeks - and surrey , for whom he played only twenty20 cricket last summer , did not appear immediately keen to secure his services again unless they knew his availability would be more comprehensive this time
the controversial south africa - born batsman 's ambition to play for england again may not depend entirely on him demonstrating form and fitness
but irrespective of mixed messages from the ecb , that is where he must start
he was described by ecb managing director downton as ' disengaged ' during england 's heavy defeat in sydney almost 15 months ago - his last test to date , in which the ashes whitewash was completed
pietersen was axed by england following their 5 - 0 ashes whitewash in australia last winter pietersen in action for surrey in the natwest t20 blast last summer pietersen started the year by playing more short form cricket for melbourne stars in the big bash weeks later , pietersen was sacked - in a meeting attended by downton and also test captain cook
downton , cook , national selector james whitaker and returning coach peter moores - contrary to the tone of graves ' remarks - have all reiterated , in their different forms of words , that pietersen remains firmly on the outside as far as they are concerned
england embark on a three - test tour to west indies , without pietersen of course , early next month - and have already been left in no doubt by graves , set to begin his tenure officially in may , that victory over what he describes as ' mediocre ' opponents is non-negotiable
while they are busy with their caribbean mission , pietersen has his chance to impress and make headlines on home soil - and therefore put his name back in the mix in time for the start of the ashes in july .
