jailed : matthew parkhouse was sentenced to 20 months in prison for stealing money from customer accounts while working at a natwest call centre a bank worker who stole a fortune from elderly customers after taking their account details over the phone was caught out when his own account rocketed from Â£ 8 to Â£ 36,000
natwest telephone advisor matthew parkhouse asked a string of account holders for the security digits on the backs of their cards when he did n't need them for legitimate banking purposes
he secretly noted the numbers down and then used them to make payments of thousands into a business account he held
had the scam succeeded , parkhouse would have got away with over Â£ 50,000 - instead he has been jailed for 20 months
manchester crown court heard how he was employed at the bank âs call centre in manchester between april 2012 and march 2014 - where he was responsible for dealing with customer accounts queries over the phone he was rumbled in december 2013 after his own bank - barclays - became suspicious that his savings had shot up
parkhouse , 30 , of hulme , manchester had set up the barclays account in the name of ' megabyte software ' , two months before he began the frauds
prosecutor lindsay thomas said : ' it transpired that part of that agreement with barclays involved allowing customers to process card payments without them being present - so long as all the card details , including the three digits on the back of the card - were presented
' when barclays examined the transactions they found out they had come from six different bank cards - all issued to natwest , where matthew parkhouse worked
two days after barclays first became suspicious , parkhouse went into the stockport branch of barclays and withdrew Â£ 6,000 in cash
parkhouse blamed another ' rogue ' employee for the frauds when quizzed by bosses , but he was the only member of staff to have accessed all six of the victims ' accounts and transcripts revealed he had asked for their security digits
fraudulent activity : the 30 - year - old was employed at the bank âs call centre in manchester between april 2012 and march 2014 and would ask account holders for their three digit security pin without a legitimate reason he later admitted six fraud charges and one charge of converting criminal property
harney , defending , said the offence had ' naive ' characteristics , adding : ' this is a young man who set up a business account in his own name , to his own address , and there was a very clear audit trail within the bank
' this is not a young man who had thought this through
' miss harney said the breakdown of his parents ' marriage had caused difficulties for his mother and that parkhouse had been hoping to help her with the cash , but ended up doing ' nothing to assist ' her
sentencing for the ' gross breach of trust ' recorder suzanne goddard qc said parkhouse had received a good education and had ' thrown away the opportunities ' given to him

' he abused this trust and stole a large amount of money from mainly elderly customers and used his position for his own gain
' both natwest and barclays were quick to act and worked in partnership with the police to help us to prosecute this man
i hope today 's sentence serves the message that you will be caught and you will be prosecuted
