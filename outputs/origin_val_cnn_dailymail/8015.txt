it 's normal that he can create controversy if he knows that certain decisions will benefit the national team
' however , with euro 2016 likely to be the veteran defender 's last major tournament for his country , andrea barzagli hopes that the likes of 20 - year - old sampdoria defender alessio can fill his shoes
' i ca n't see myself still in azzurro [ the italy squad ] after the euros , primarily because i 'll be over 35
i 'm not a player like [ gianluigi ] buffon or [ andrea barzagli ] pirlo who can keep going until 40
' so i hope that young defenders like [ alessio ] romagnoli can take over for the national team
there needs to be rejuvenation , definitely
