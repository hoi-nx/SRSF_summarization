iraqi claims it has liberated the city of tikrit - its biggest victory in the fight against islamic state terrorists to date
security and allied forces , backed by u.s. - led coalition aircraft retook the hometown of former president saddam hussein and the iraqi tricolour was raised
the operation began on march 2 and had looked bogged down before iraqi forces made rapid advances over the past 48 hours
prime minister haider al-abadi ' announces the liberation of tikrit and congratulates iraqi security forces and popular volunteers on the historic milestone ' , his official twitter account said
iraqiya state television showed footage of houses previously used by the terror group in liberated areas , but it was not clear whether any pockets of resistance remained
the provincial government headquarters was retaken on monday , and on tuesday the iraqi tricolour replaced the black isis flag on the building
in a statement to afp just minutes before haider al-abadi 's tweet , his spokesman rafid jaboori said : ' iraqi forces reached the centre of tikrit , raised the iraqi flag and are now clearing the city
' there no immediate information on how many fighters were killed , wounded or captured in the fighting
the government has not provided any casualty figures since the operation started a month ago
iraqi army and police forces , as well as volunteers and iran - backed shiite militias , completely surrounded tikrit within two weeks of launching the operation
there was a lull in fighting when government and allied forces apparently balked at the number of snipers , booby traps and trenches which isis was using to defend the city centre

the government eventually requested strikes from the u.s. - led coalition which has been assisting iraqi forces elsewhere in the country since august last year

france also took part in the campaign
the move sparked a freeze in the participation of the popular mobilisation units , an umbrella organisation for volunteers and militias which accounted for the bulk of the manpower involved in the tikrit battle
the pentagon had expressed unease at the role played by iran and its proxies in the battle and said it conditioned its intervention on regular forces taking the lead
on friday , it hailed the withdrawal from the fight of ' those shiite militias who are linked to , infiltrated by , ( or ) otherwise under the influence of iran '

tikrit , which once had an estimated population of around 200,000 , had been largely emptied of civilians by the time the government operation was launched at the start of march
the fate of those who were believed to have remained in the city was unclear on tuesday
thousands of people displaced last year or more recently from salaheddin province , of which tikrit is the capital , have started returning to their homes in outlying liberated areas
but the level of destruction tikrit is believed to have suffered and the threat posed by unexploded bombs mean residents of the city itself could take longer to return
tikrit holds both strategic and symbolic importance
it was the hometown of executed dictator saddam hussein , remnants of whose baath party collaborated with isis last summer
since june , iraqi forces had tried and failed several times to retake the city , seen as a key stepping stone to recapturing mosul , the jihadists ' largest hub in iraqi
