chinese tourists have been told to stay off commuter trains that run between central paris and french âs largest international airport following a rash of robberies this year
the chinese embassy in paris issued the rare travel warning this week , saying that it is following up on the cases with investigators
instead of taking rer trains the embassy is urging chinese visitors to use buses , taxis or â other transport â to travel between paris â tourist zone and charles de gaulle airport north - east of the city centre
chinese tourists have been told to avoid the rer b train between central paris and charles de gaulle airport according to the embassy at least four robberies have occurred on rer b trains â which run almost 24 hours a day with frequent departures â since mid-february , the hong kong newspaper the standard reported

in other incidents , a young chinese visitor suffered â a very huge loss â , and two tourists missed their flights home after they had property stolen
