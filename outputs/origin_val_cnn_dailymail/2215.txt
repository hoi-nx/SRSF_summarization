in these fantastic images you can see mars and its moons , an amazing nebula and even the surface of a mysterious world covered in water
or can you ? these might look like pictures of space at first , but they âre actually just shots of glasses of water and food in a photocopier
the amazing photography trick was performed by 34 - year - old freelance photographer navid baraty from new york
new york photographer navid baraty has created fictional images of space using ingredients found in the kitchen
shown is a ' spiral galaxy ' , made with baking soda , curry powder , chalk , salt , sugar and cinnamon the project follows an imaginary spacecraft called wander-wormhole-accelerated nomad delivering reconnaissance - which you can follow on instagram , facebook or his website
in the images he used common kitchen ingredients to make the cosmic images
- glass containing water and food colouring - salt , cinnamon , baking powder - cat fur , cumin , tumeric - coffee , corn starch , butter he told mailonline that the images were made by placing objects on an epson photo scanner and then doing a scan with the lid open
he then partially filled glasses with liquids and put food colouring in them in order to create shapes and swirls
the stars and other points of light , meanwhile , are made by sprinkling spices such as cinnamon on the scanner glass
â i 've had a fascination with space ever since i was a kid camping in the backyard and looking at the stars through my childhood telescope , â he said
â when i see the cosmos through photographs taken by the hubble space telescope and other spacecraft , i âm often left without words
â when i look at the night sky , i âm captivated by its mystery and its unknowns
i think the awe and wonder of space ignites our innate curiosity as humans
â this mars - lke planet consists of the bottom of a glass containing half and half , water and food colouring
moons at the bottom of a glass contain coconut milk , wate and food colouring
the stars are salt , cinnamon , baking powder and tums all the images were taken in a photocopier
here we see a nebula with gas streams - but it is actually cat fur , garlic powder , salt , flour , cumin and turmeric , according to mr navid baraty this planet consists of the bottom of a glass with half and half milk , water and food colouring
the starts are salt , cinnamon and baking powder a distant galaxy ? no , thi is olive oil , sesame oil , water , cumin , cinnamon and flour in a photocopier some of the glasses use just water , and others use a mixture of coconut milky as well
one of the nebulas was created using cat fur , garlic powder , salt , flour , cumin and turmeric
and mr navid baraty says he intends to continue take the photos , so people can keep following the fictional progress of the wander probe â i thought it would be fun and exciting to frame the project around the idea of this imaginary spacecraft roaming around the universe taking photos of its encounters , â he said
baking soda , salt , sugar , curry powder and cinnamon were used to make this ' globular cluster ' this nebula is a mixture of makeup , olive oil , chalk , baby powder , salt and water this icy planet consists of the bottom of a glass containing half and half , water and food colouring
the moons are silica gel and food colouring , while the stars are made of sugar , cinnamon and cumin this supercluster is made of flour , sugar , salt , olive oil , cumin , turmeric , cinnamon , curry , garlic powder and water â i had a whole story going for a while of how i was selected to be the lead image processor for the wander mission since i 'm a photographer but have a degree in engineering and that this was a real spacecraft out there taking images
â a lot of people actually thought it was reall ! eventually i decided to tell people how i really make the images and that wander is entirely fictional
â he added : â i 'd like people to look at these images and think could my fictional creation of a planet or moon or galaxy actually exist somewhere in our universe or possibly even beyond ? â i 'd like for the imaginary explorations of wander to inspire others about the cosmos and actual space exploration
â this ghostly anomaly is made of butter , food colouring and salt the bottom of a glass of coffee here looks a bit like a black hole , together with salt , sugar , corn starch and cinnamon this planet in deep space is two glasses containing half and half , coconut milk , water and food colouring
