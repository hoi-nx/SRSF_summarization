hearsum , who trapped a female friend in her home before sexually assaulting her , has flouted a restraining order by sending the victim threatening texts a lesbian who trapped a female friend in her home before sexually assaulting her has flouted a restraining order by sending the victim threatening texts , a court heard
hearsum stripped naked and attacked the woman during a hour - long hostage ordeal after she refused to have sex with her last year
the 32 - year - old was spared jail , despite pleading guilty to false imprisonment , sexual assault , assault by beating and harassment in november
she was handed a three - year restraining order banning her from contacting the victim , and two years in prison , suspended for two years
but the court heard that just a few weeks after she was sentenced , hearsum began texting the woman
prosecutor o'brien said that at first her messages had been apologetic
' they then changed to wanting her back and then changed again to threatening , ' said mr o'brien
' the victim did n't report these breaches because she did n't want to feel responsible for putting hearsum in prison
' however , he said , hearsum then sent a text saying ' i should have f * * * ed you up when i had a chance
' she sent another text saying she should have gone to the victim 's boyfriend 's house to ' mess him up
' when the victim replied that she would report the texts to the police hearsum replied ' you should , i am not in the right place
' hearsum then sent several facebook messages to the victim 's sister before texting ' did anyone call the old bill ? text back
' mr o'brien said hearsum , from cashes green , stroud , was arrested later the same day
at gloucester crown court she admitted two charges of breaching the restraining order but was again spared jail
judge judge deferred sentencing until june 15 and told hearsum if she behaved herself until then , he would not jail her
mr o'brien reminded the court of hearsum 's original offence when she asked the victim to visit her and then tried to coax her into bed before stripping off and throttling her
hearsum held the woman prisoner in her home for over an hour and threatened her with a knife
at last year 's hearing she admitted falsely imprisoning the woman on july 29 , 2014 and sexually assaulting her by penetrating her v * * * * a with her finger
she also admitted assaulting the woman by beating and she pleaded guilty to harassing her after the incident by sending numerous texts and facebook messages which became increasingly intimidating
prosecutor kesner told the court last year that hearsum had rung her friend - who had a boyfriend - last july because she wanted to talk about problems in her relationship
the pair went to the pub and returned to hearsum 's home at 9pm , but the victim went to use the bathroom , she noticed the front door had been locked from the inside and the key was missing
the woman told hearsum she had to go home , but hearsum replied that she was ' not going anywhere '
mr kesner said : '' she repeatedly asked the victim to stay the night and go to bed with her
her repeated invitations were declined
' the defendant was acting in a bizarre way
she took all her clothes off and asked the lady for a kiss
' but the judge at gloucester crown court told hearsum she would be spared jail again if she could ' behave ' until july the court heard how things ' degenerated ' after that , with hearsum attempting to strangle the victim and punching her around the head
the victim then managed to use her phone to contact her boyfriend on facebook , who called the police
she was sentenced to two years prison suspended for two years , placed under supervision for the same period , and given the restraining order
the defendant was also ordered to sign the sex offenders ' register for 10 years
today , tim burrows , defending , said : ' she has been using alcohol in excess and that was fuelling the messages she started sending
it got to the point where she was almost inviting the victim to call the police and get her arrested
' despite these breaches she has continued to engage with her supervising officer and has been extremely open with him about her behaviour and why it has taken place
' she has also been to her gp and turning point to try to deal with the emotions she has
her supervisor is anxious to continue to work with her
there has been no further contact with the victim since these breaches
she has changed her medication
' i urge you to consider it would be unjust to activate the suspended sentence
i have to admit she has not behaved well and that she was told of the consequences if she failed to comply
' judge judge told hearsum her messages had been ' unpleasant and scary ' but he had decided to give her a final chance to obey the order and the terms of her sentence
he deferred sentence on her till 15th june and said if she behaved herself till then and complied fully with the order he would not jail her .
