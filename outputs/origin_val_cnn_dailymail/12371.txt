you may have heard that israeli politics is extremely complex
but one of the most important forces at play there is actually rather straightforward : when israeli feel safe and strong they tend to support moderate parties
when they feel vulnerable they move to the right
understand that , and you will understand israeli -- and why president obama may have inadvertently given benjamin netanyahu a helping hand
israeli know they need u.s. support to survive in a hostile , increasingly unstable and radicalized neighborhood , but they do n't believe they can trust obama to help keep them safe
and the president , despite taking numerous measures to support the jewish state , has done a dismal job of persuading israeli that he has their back
this reality helps explain how benjamin netanyahu and his rightist likud party pulled off an upset victory this week , despite opinion polls showing them trailing the main opposition zionist union heading into tuesday 's election
clearly , it 's not all obama 's fault
benjamin netanyahu 's opponents also failed to address security issues , believing a focus on pocketbook matters would be enough
and benjamin netanyahu is a skilled , articulate and shrewd politician
but obama , like it or not , was one of the reasons for likud 's success
when benjamin netanyahu traveled to washington a couple of weeks ago to warn the u.s. congress about an impending " bad deal " with iran over its nuclear program , obama refused to meet with him , claiming he did n't want to influence israeli 's elections
few believed this was the real reason -- it 's no secret the two men do n't particularly like one another
through much of his presidency , obama has failed to convince israeli thay they can trust him
and his handling of the recent spat with benjamin netanyahu only added to the problem
by appearing to dismiss benjamin netanyahu 's warning of a " nuclear nightmare " over the iran talks by arguing that the prime minister was offering no " viable alternatives , " obama missed an opportunity to reassure security conscious israeli that the u.s. will safeguard their survival
his tacit acknowledgment that there might be no alternative to an imperfect deal was of little comfort to israeli who have spent years hearing genocidal threats from the iran regime
opinion : will benjamin netanyahu win seal iran deal ? the fact that obama has become one of the key reasons why benjamin netanyahu continues to win elections in israeli is ironic considering israeli are profoundly worried about the deteriorating ties with the u.s. , a relationship they consider key to ensuring their country 's survival
one recent poll showed only 37 % of israeli believe obama has a " positive " position towards israeli , a mood that has undoubtedly helped benjamin netanyahu enormously , despite the fact that large numbers of former security officials have said benjamin netanyahu is endangering the country by undermining ties with washington , and despite israeli saying close relations with the u.s. are the second most important factor for israeli 's security , behind only israeli 's own military strength
all this left a genuine opening for obama to influence the israeli electorate , because israeli desperately want to trust the u.s. president -- and they remain u.s. 's biggest , most loyal fans , according to a recent pew poll
5 questions about benjamin netanyahu 's apparent victory yet despite the positive sentiment in principle , israeli voters -- especially on the right -- have been skeptical that obama has their best interests at heart
this point was underscored in a recent poll that asked israeli recently if they believed president obama would agree to a deal that israeli officials considered harmful to israeli 's security
of those that responded , 61 % said yes , he would do so
however , 95 % of labor supporters said no , obama would do no such thing , while 93 % of likud voters said they believed obama would disregard israeli 's security
the worry over security extends beyond a nuclear deal with iran to include the other key foreign policy issue -- the possibility of a palestinian state
a majority of israeli still support the creation of two states , one for israeli and another for palestinian
and despite the last - minute statements from benjamin netanyahu dismissing the idea , it is important to remember that polls have consistently shown israeli continue to support the establishment of a palestinian state , as long as israeli 's security can be assured
the trouble is that right now , many israeli do n't believe they can preserve their security with a palestinian state just a few miles from their major cities , not least because previous territorial withdrawals -- from gaza and from southern lebanon -- have simply created launch pads for attacks against israeli
so when rightist leaders such as benjamin netanyahu say israeli will not be safe with a palestinian state , voters are inclined to believe them
all this suggests that if obama wants to persuade the israeli public to push its government towards compromise , he needs to rebuild the public 's trust in him
israeli want peace , but they also need to be reassured that their safety and survival is a paramount concern of their u.s. ally
and if president obama can not assure them of this ? well , they will simply wait until there is a president they feel they can trust
it 's not that complicated .
