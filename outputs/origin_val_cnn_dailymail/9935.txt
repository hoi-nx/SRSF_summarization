cia director brennan has ordered a sweeping overhaul of the spy agency , aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into traditional intelligence gathering brennan announced the restructuring to the cia workforce friday
he said the move comes after nine outside experts spent three months analyzing the agency 's management structure , including what deputy cia director cohen called ' pain points , ' organizational areas where the cia 's bureaucracy does not work efficiently
briefing reporters with cohen at cia headquarters this week , brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the cia is not covering
he lamented that there is often no single person he can hold accountable for the spying mission in any given part of the world
not your grandparents ' cia : the cia is launching one of the biggest reorganizations in its history , aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into intelligence gathering critical look : cia director brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the cia is not covering ' there are a lot of areas that i would like to have better insight to , better information about , better access to , ' brennan said
' safe havens , denied areas
whether because we do n't even have a diplomatic presence in a country , or because there are parts of countries that have been overrun and taken over by terrorist groups and others
' on the cyber front , the cia chief said he is establishing a new ' directorate of digital innovation ' to lead the agency 's efforts to track and take advantage of advances in cyber technology
us officials said that brennan decided the agency had to increase the resources and emphasis it devoted to cyberspace because advanced communications technology is rapidly becoming pervasive
historically , electronic eavesdroppers at the national security agency have been at the cutting edge of digital innovation within the us government
but the cia felt that it too had to reorganize to keep up with the technological ' pace of change , ' as one official put it
brennan said the new digital directorate will have equal status within the agency with four other directorates which have existed for years
' our ability to carry out our responsibilities for human intelligence and national security responsibilities has become more challenging ' in today 's digital world , brennan said
' and so what we need to do as an agency is make sure we âre able to understand all of the aspects of that digital environment
' pitfall : evidence shows that the cia may have taken too long to find and kill osama bin laden - a mission that was accomplished in 2011 after a decade - long manhunt brennan avoided the term ' cyber , ' a word used by the national security agency , the country 's premier digital spying service the changes come against a backdrop of widespread concern that the cia 's focus on hunting and killing terrorists since the september 11 attacks has led to an erosion of the espionage and analytic capabilities the agency built during the cold war
the cia , along with other us intelligence agencies , wrongly assessed the presence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in 2002 and failed to anticipate the rapid collapse of middle east governments during the arab spring in 2011 , among other shortcomings
the agency 's greatest public success of recent years â the 10 - year effort to locate and kill osama bin laden in 2011 â may have taken longer than it should have , according to evidence made public in the recent senate report on cia interrogations
internal cia surveys have cited bad management and bureaucratic frustration as factors in driving talent away from the agency
in the most significant departure , the cia would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms , a system that typically has required the case officers who recruit spies and run covert operations to work for different bosses , in different offices , than analysts who interpret the intelligence and write briefing papers for the president and other policymakers
the new plan would blend practitioners of those separate disciplines into 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world
there are a handful of such centers at the moment , including the counter terrorism center , where analysts and operators have worked side by side for the last decade targeting al-qaida with espionage and drone strikes
under the new plan , each center would be run by an assistant director who would be responsible for the entire intelligence mission within that jurisdiction , including covert operations , spying , analysis , liaison with foreign partners and logistics
the system of cia stations , headed by a cia station chief , will remain in place , brennan said
most stations are in us embassies , and various cia case officers in embassies may be working on different missions for different centers
the changes do not require congressional approval and will be undertaken within the cia 's current budget , cia officials said
critics of a blended approach have raised concerns that combining analysts with operators could compromise the objectivity of the analysts , who are tasked with coldly interpreting intelligence in which they have no stake
it may be harder for an analyst to cast doubt on a source recruited by a case officer he knows personally , the theory goes
blended : the new overhaul plan would bring cia operatives and data analysts together in 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world the head of the cia 's operation arm retired abruptly in january after voicing concerns about the plan , say two former cia officials who know him but spoke on condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to discuss internal agency matters
brennan said the undercover officer 's decision ' was not a result of this , ' but he did not dispute that the officer had opposed some of the changes
' any time we 've put analysts and operators together , the result has been a more powerful product , ' said john mclaughlin , a former cia analyst who became acting director , and who advised brennan on the restructuring
brennan is retaining the old structure of cia ' directorates
' but he is changing some names , including restoring the old moniker ' directorate of operations , ' to the spying arm , the name it had before being rebadged the directorate of operations in 2005
for analysts , what used to be called the directorate of intelligence will be renamed the directorate of analysis
two others , the directorates of support and security , remain
the directorates will manage human resources and set tradecraft standards , brennan said , while the centers carry out the intelligence missions
the cia will also significantly boost its leadership training and talent development efforts , which have been compared unfavorably to the military , brennan said
the reorganization is already drawing fire from some quarters
paul pillar , a former cia analyst who famously dissented from the case for war in iraq , expressed concern that the costs of the changes would outweigh the benefits
' i worry that this plan may be another instance of the all - too - common pattern , among senior managers in both governmental and private sector organizations , to try to leave a personal mark by reorganizing the place , ' he said in an email .
