brighton defender gordon greer has warned against complacency ahead of scotland 's game with gibratlar the scotland squad train ahead of their euro 2016 qualifier with bottom placed gibratlar on sunday he said : ' i think the pressure that is on us now is to break them down and score the goals because other teams have done that but ultimately it is all about just winning the game
' obviously , if you score a lot of goals in front of your home fans and everything is great then it is a perfect afternoon
' but these players are no mugs and for me it is all about winning the game and moving on
' it will be a difficult game and difficult to break them down and we are preparing as best we can
gordon strachan 's side face a team that is yet to win in four attempts in group d ' the squad has watched bits and pieces on video
' obviously they were playing against some good opposition
they put men behind the ball in the germany game , the same against ireland and poland , so i think it will be much the same on sunday
' you have 90 plus minutes in a game so at the end of the day when the final whistle goes you just want to have three points and hopefully the team puts on a good performance

' at times we struggled to break them down in the final third but we will do our best to break gibraltar down as early as possible
