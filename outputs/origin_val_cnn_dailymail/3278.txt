professor christina slade , vice-chancellor of bath spa university , used her expense account to fly business class in order to ' drum up interest ' around the globe
she is of a number of well - paid university vice-chancellors who used expenses accounts for luxury travel
her expenses were revealed in a study by the ucu ( ucu ) , which has criticised the ' murky world ' of university pay
ucu asked every university in the country to reveal how much their top staff were paid and how much they claimed in expenses in 2013 - 14
the top paid vice-chancellor is neil gorman , of nottingham trent university , who raked in a staggering Â£ 623,000 including bonuses
prof slade said that her travel bill is essential for drumming up interest among foreign students and that travelling business class is ' the norm for vice-chancellors '
the travel bill is on top of her Â£ 299,000 - a - year salary , which rose 16 per cent last year
ucu spokesman nick varney said : ' it 's a chaotic state of affairs where some vice chancellors spend thousands on travel or enjoy large pay rises
' this lifts the lid on the inconsistent and arbitrary nature of senior pay and perks in our universities and shines a light on the murky world of the shadowy remuneration committees who sign off these deals
' we need a far more transparent system that allows for proper scrutiny of the spending at the top and the rationale behind pay rises
' figures obtained from 150 institutions under the freedom of information act show the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was Â£ 260,290
a total of 18 vice-chancellors saw their pay rise by more than 10 per cent , the lecturers â union calculated
a spokesperson for bath spa university said prof slade had gone abroad to recruit international students after falling numbers put courses and jobs at risk
' the increase in international students has replaced the student numbers removed in the wake of an earlier decision on fees
' there have been no staff redundancies as a result of downsizing at bath spa university , making it unique in its part of the sector
' without the international students , redundancies would have been necessary
