bernie has very particular requirements for formula one 's pre-race grid walk
being a glamorous woman is top of his list
in a letter that has come to light , bernie wrote to former caterham team principal cyril abiteboul requesting : bernie appears to have written a letter outlining his requirements for the grid the formula one chief made a point of calling for glamorous ladies to be given passes bernie 's daughter tamara at the british grand prix with her husband jay rutland last year ' please be reminded that where possible , grid access passes should be used for celebrities or people of note or as always , really glamorous ladies
' this is not so much a sporting matter but a part of the show business of formula one
' the letter , from may 2013 , is signed ' bernie ' and appears to be genuine
sportsmail contacted bernie 's office for confirmation but they declined to comment
bernie 's blueprint is hardly surprising , the grid walk being unashamedly about glitz and glamour
