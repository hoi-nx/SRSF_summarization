' on tuesday , heather mack gave birth to a baby girl via caesarean at sanglah hospital in denpasar
in exclusive pictures , obtained by daily mail online , mack was seen at the window of her hospital room a day after giving birth to her 6lb 1oz daughter , stella schaefer , the last name being that of the baby 's father and her co-accused
the accused murderers have claimed in court that the unborn baby had been at the center of problems
however , emails provided by mr jacobson to the chicago tribune , revealed that heather mack had a long history of violent outbursts , stealing and manipulative behavior
in march 2014 , mrs von wiese mack wrote in a string of emails to her longtime friend about her teenage daughter 's explosive rages
' her anger escalates at an alarming rate and she seems to have no control over it - very scary
at least she did n't hit me - her rage went to the window instead , ' she wrote , according to the tribune
in another email she wrote : ' heather mack ran away again tonight
she will not answer her phone
she will not answer emails and she told me that she would kill me and then kill herself ... i feel so desperate
' in one chilling message to her friend , mrs von wiese mack wrote : ' i am really scared of what she may do next
' mr jacobson , 72 , who worked in politics , passed on the emails to the chicago tribune so that his friend 's voice may be heard , he reportedly said
earlier this week mack had given birth in a caesarean operation to her 6lb 1oz daughter , stella schaefer , the surname being after the father and her co-accused 21 - year - old tommy schaefer heather mack and tommy schaefer , from chicago , illinois , ( pictured in court on march 12 ) are being tried separately by the denpasar district court
they could both face a firing squad if found guilty of her mother 's brutal murder last august although miss heather mack was not considered a flight risk , she remains under guard at all time , no matter what the circumstances , at the sanglah hospital with her baby beside her in a cot
joining her in the hospital room were the child 's grandmother , tommy schaefer 's mother , and other relatives and friends who had flown from their homes in chicago
and it is from his mother and relatives that tommy schaefer will have to rely for a first - hand description of his baby , for he has been refused the right to travel under guard from kerobokan prison to the hospital
prison sources said he was ' pacing up and down with frustration ' in his cell as he anxiously waits for the moment when he will first set eyes on his daughter
â he âs going crazy in there , wanting to see his daughter , but he âs been told he 's a prisoner on a serious charge and there will be no hospital visits , â a prison source said
unless the prison grants him a special privilege to see the baby , he is unlikely to see her until - and if - miss heather mack takes the child with her to their next scheduled court appearance on march 24
there is every likelihood of the couple âs next court appearance - their cases are being held separately - being adjourned while she regains the strength to face the judges in the denpasar district court
miss heather mack earlier had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital wanted up front
but her united states attorney , anthony scifo , has told the chicago tribune that he was able to send money to indonesia earlier in the week after working out a deal with miss heather mack âs uncle , who controls $ 1.56 million in a trust fund set up for her by her murdered mother
miss heather mack does not have access to the money before her 30th birthday
miss heather mack planned to keep the baby with her in the cell for the maximum allowed period of two years - unless there are dramatic developments in the case against her and she is able to leave the notorious prison
sheila von wiese-mack 's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel it was not known when she will be returned to the prison with her baby , but hospital staff suggested it could be within the next 48 hours
mack had earlier told friends who have been supporting her during jail visits that she was expecting her baby in april
this means the child was born prematurely
last week , tommy schaefer told the trial that he had been attacked by mack and called a racially offensive slur
he said that his relationship with heather mack was not endorsed by her mother and he went to bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant
after meeting with mack at the hotel , they discussed how to inform mrs von mack that mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where mack and her mother were staying
speaking through an interpreter , tommy schaefer said mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl , which he hid under his shirt as a ' precaution '
asked by a judge why it was hidden , tommy schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself
according to tommy schaefer , he arrived in the room and found miss heather mack weeping
he did not know why , but also saw her mother was screaming
' she ( von mack ) was angry at me when she knew that heather mack was pregnant , ' tommy schaefer said , while trying to hold back tears
heavily pregnant mack ( pictured right a week before the birth ) and boyfriend tommy schaefer ( second from left ) , 21 , sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of her mother , sheila von wiese - mack miss heather mack , who was sitting beside her lawyer , sobbed at the testimony
he said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man
he said the situation got heated when mrs von mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby
tommy schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which mr von mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds
' i was angry , i took the fruit bowl and hit her , ' tommy schaefer said , in tears
he added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim
after acknowledging she was n't breathing , he tried to give her artificial respiration , while mack , who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes , came back and tried to revive her mother
he said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the united states
in her first questioning in court last wednesday , mack , who is eight months ' pregnant , said tommy schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von mack made the threat in an argument
' the blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting , ' miss heather mack said
' i asked tommy to stop and then i ran into the bathroom
' the 62 - year - old 's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets
in january , mack had said she vowed to bring the baby up in the cramped bali prison she shares with six others
she has told fellow prisoners in the wijaya kusuma cell block of her intentions - but that has not gone down well with several of the other women
' make arrangements to get your baby out of here , ' one prisoner was reported to have angrily told her
' we 're fed up with being woken by crying babies
' in an adjoining cell a prisoner in her late 30s was raising a baby which cries through the night , waking other inmates
' this is what your baby is going to be doing - waking us up - and we do n't want that , ' heather mack was told by one woman - according to visitors leaving the prison after delivering food to relatives in the women 's section of the notorious prison
the protests , however , have failed to dampen the resolve of mack .
