kogi police said shortly after the abduction that the men who took phyllis sortor had demanded a ransom of nearly $ 300,000
police said they were collaborating with security forces to secure her return
friends described phyllis sortor as courageous , tenacious and passionate about helping the people of nigeria and said she was aware of the dangers
phyllis sortor has been working as a missionary for ten years
her friends say she was passionate about helping people in nigeria and aware of the dangers of working there she had spent years living in africa , including mozambique - where she spent much of her childhood - later working in rwanda and , since 2005 , nigeria , kendall said her work in kogi was focused primarily on educational development and conflict resolution between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities who frequently clash in central nigeria 's middle belt region , the church statement further said
foreign nationals have often been kidnapped in nigeria by local gangs who typically release hostages following a ransom payment
such abductions are especially common in the southern , oil - producing niger delta , where expatriates working with large oil companies have been a frequent target
a number of foreigners have also been kidnapped in the north of the country , but those attacks claimed by boko haram or the associated islamist group ansaru are considered a different phenomenon , and not necessarily motivated by a desire for ransom
boko haram has been blamed for previous attacks in kogi , including two raids targeting the same prison in 2012 and 2014
nigeria 's islamists groups have in the past publicly claimed the abduction of expatriates and the lack of such a claim following phyllis sortor 's kidnapping led many to believe that boko haram and its affiliates were not involved .
