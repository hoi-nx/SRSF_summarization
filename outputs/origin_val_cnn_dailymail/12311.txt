a sixth suspect in the shooting death of a top russian opposition figure blew himself up after a standoff with police in the capital of the chechen , state - run television reported sunday
beslan shavanov , 30 , was holed up in a building in grozny when police arrived to arrest him saturday afternoon , russian 24 reported
police surrounded the building and shavano tried to escape , throwing a grenade at police officers before blowing himself up , the station said
the news came as russian authorities reported making five other arrests in connection with nemtsov 's killing
one of those arrested claims to have an alibi , according to russian 's sputnik
" at the time of the murder , i was at work as i usually am every day
there are many people , my colleagues , who will confirm this , " the news agency quoted tamerlan eskerkhanov as saying in moscow 's basmanny district court
two of the suspects have been formally charged and three " remain under the status of suspects , " court spokeswoman anna fadeyeva told sputnik
nemtsov , one of president putin 's most outspoken critics , was shot in the back on a moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the kremlin in late february
surveillance video showed someone darting from the sidewalk and into a nearby car right after nemtsov collapsed
putin has been informed of the arrests in connection with nemtsov 's death , russian media said , citing federal security service director bortnikov
two of the other suspects are anzor gubashev and dadayev , bortnikov said in a televised statement
the others are ramzan bakhayev and gubashev , anzor 's younger brother , according to a sputnik report that also said dadayev was the only one of the five to plead guilty -- though to what crimes was not clear
bortnikov said those detained are from the southern region of the caucasus , which for years has been a hotbed of unrest and rebellion against moscow
dadayev had previously served as an officer in a chechen police battalion , barakhayev , secretary of the security council of the caucasian republic of ingushetia , told the official news agency tass
dadayev was the deputy commander of one of the chechen 's ministry of internal affairs groups , sputnik reported , adding that gubashev worked at a security firm in moscow
gubashev was arrested between the town of malgobek and the village of voznesenovskaya , while dadayev was arrested in the city of magas , barakhayev told tass
the slain opposition leader 's daughter , nemtsova , told cnn she is " not surprised both of them ( are ) of caucasus origin
" nemtsova said the only things she knew about the arrests came from media reports , as authorities did not contact her immediately
later saturday , a southern russian law enforcement official told state news agency ria novosti that two more men were arrested
the two suspects in the second arrest were not named , but one of them was driving with dadayev , and the other man is gubashev 's younger brother , barakhayev said
like gubashev and dadayev , those two suspects are also ethnic chechens , according to barakhayev
after nemtsov 's shooting putin blamed extremists and protesters who he said were trying to stir internal strife in russian
many opposition sympathizers and people close to nemtsov have pointed the finger at putin and the russian government he leads
they note that nemtsov -- the deputy prime minister under former president boris yeltsin -- is the latest in a list of putin 's opponents who have been killed or imprisoned
nemtsov had also been arrested several times for speaking against the government
in her first tv interview since her father 's death , nemtsova told cnn that putin shares " political responsibility " for her father 's assassination
" i do n't believe in the official investigation , " she said saturday
other opposition figures previously jailed or killed include anna politkovskaya , a journalist critical of russian 's war in chechen
she was gunned down at the entrance to her moscow apartment in 2006
there was also business magnate khodorkovsky , who backed an opposition party and accused putin of corruption
khodorkovsky landed in jail after a conviction on tax fraud , which he said was a ploy to take away his oil company
the government rejected the claim
putin pardoned him in 2013
former russian security agent alexander litvinenko was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium , his tea spiked in a london hotel during a meeting with two former russian security service men in 2006
he had blamed the agency for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in russian in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to russian 's invasion of chechen later that year
the kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it or its agents are targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths
