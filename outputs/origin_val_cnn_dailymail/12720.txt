when i was a child , a pale specter used to call our house most evenings , eager to chat with my doctor father about her myriad medical concerns
we called her the " white bread lady , " a moniker she earned for one particularly inane call in which she panicked to my father after consuming white bread
she was n't breaking out in hives or having any adverse effects to the bread
no , she was just concerned that some future illness could befall her given that one particular dietary decision
although we all laughed at the time , it was with a bit of shifty - eyed shame
because most of us ( including if not particularly the illustrious ehrlich family ) have lurking within us our very own " white bread lady , " ready to convince us that each cough , sniffle and less - than - nutritious meal might be a detriment to our health
and , naturally , that white bread lady looms even larger when we can type our worries into a search bar and unlock a bevy of potentially distressing information
yup , so quoth google , we all have cancer
according to the pew , 80 % of internet users have looked up health information online
while that practice can be beneficial in some respects , the abundance of ( variably valid ) information online can turn us into e-hypochondriacs
( or , worse , can lead us to neglect getting the care we need
) read on for five mistakes -- courtesy of a selection of health care professionals -- that people make when diagnosing themselves online
searching blind your eye is twitching like an overly caffeinated college student sitting behind a pretty girl in lecture hall , twirling his pencil and hoping to catch a whiff of her lovely shining hair
you type " eye twitch " into google and come up with a really rad website that explains that this newfound spasm is actually an indication that your third eye is fixing to open , revealing to you wonders untold
you are the chosen one
too bad that this trove of " medical information " is actually some dude 's fan - fiction site
sure , the above is an extreme example , but , as dr. pho of kevinmd.com pointed out , " there 's a lot of bad information on the web and information that can be dangerous
" especially if you 're not considering who put up that information in the first place
pho urges users to favor web addresses ending in
edu when looking for reputable health - care info , and to check who is funding the collection of that information
" there 's so much information from organizations trying to sell products or push their agenda on the web , " he said
he suggests turning to sites like mayo clinic as well as troves of information curated by doctors ( like pho 's own website ) when trolling the web for info
and , of course , if a site mentions trolls and third eyes , one should definitely press on
flailing in forums if there 's one thing people like to do online , it 's talk about their problems -- especially mundane things like coughs and headaches and their babies ' various and sundry discharges
that 's all well and good ; sharing experiences with others is enriching ! unless the people you 're sharing with are idiots
" you can easily fall into that rabbit hole and find some forum that really is n't relevant but maybe sounds kind of close , " warned craig monsen , co-founder of symptom - checker app symcat
on the other hand , " sometimes you 'll stumble on exactly the right forum where someone has your same exact problem , and their solution does help
" " health care forums are definitely another tool that individuals can use in order to crowdsource a diagnosis based on their symptoms , " added dr. burgert of kc kids doc. " i think that these can be a really powerful tool not only for discussing potential diagnosis or symptom relief but also finding a forum of individuals in which you can discuss emotional and psychological parts of an illness and develop a wonderful online support community
" the trick is to be wary about the issues being discussed in forums and how germane they are to you
and , you know , if people start talking about homemade remedies fashioned from bleach , maybe click off and see a doc. getting emotional you know that game " 6 degrees of kevin bacon " ? there should seriously be a version of that called " 6 degrees of cancer " -- as in , when looking up your symptoms online , how long does it take to deduce that you have a life - threatening disease instead of , say , a simple cold ? according to burgert , the root of this whole " worst - case scenario " thing is getting too emotional
" for most intents and purposes , when you 're looking for online health information , it 's about yourself or a family member , " she said
" when you 're looking through that lens , it 's very hard to keep emotional distance
so you can read about a diagnosis that either makes you very scared or calms your fears -- and that 's the path you 'll continue down , whether it 's correct or not
" burgert suggested using online symptom checkers simply to " understand possible diagnoses , find some initial steps for relieving the symptoms and determine if this is something that needs further evaluation or that can be managed at home
" symcat and mayo clinic 's symptom checker let you type in what you 're experiencing and unearth a spectrum of diagnoses and suggestions for when to seek a doctor 's aid
your doctor 's website might also have such a tool
voila , you just increased your separation from cancer by at least a couple of degrees
keeping mum around mds " i think , traditionally , many physicians are a little apprehensive when that stereotypical patient comes to their office with big stacks of printouts from the internet , " pho said
" but i think more and more doctors are accepting it
personally , i think that transparency of information is helpful in a way
" translation : help your doctor help you
if you 're worried about a particular medical situation and did some research to help narrow down what 's ailing you , share that info with your physician
" i really appreciate when patients bring in information that they found online , because it allows me to guide my instruction and plan based on their true concerns , " burgert said
" people get scared when they get sick and hurt , and they want to use multiple sources of information to help themselves
the internet adds to that physician 's expertise in order to do that
" remember , though , knowing how to use the internet does n't make you a doctor
google does n't count as a second opinion
if you 're unhappy with your doc 's diagnosis , go get one the traditional way
putting off the inevitable if your ailment is n't going away , all the symptom - checking and mayo clinic - ing in the world is n't going to help you
make a doctor 's appointment
sites like zocdoc make it super easy ( and free ; doctors pay to be listed ) to set up an appointment asap , so no whining that you 'll have to wait two weeks to see a doc and maybe by then " it " will have gone away
unless , of course , " it " is that white bread you just ate
in that case , please stop calling my dad .
