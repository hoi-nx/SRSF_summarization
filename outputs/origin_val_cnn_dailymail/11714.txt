forget the bragging rights - victory in sunday 's liverpool vs manchester united clash could be worth as much as Â£ 70million
while nothing will be decided in the latest installment of the old rivalry , at 3.20pm we will be a lot closer to knowing who will be in pole position to land a treasured place in the top four and the champions league qualification that brings
the victors can look forward to a Â£ 70m cash bonanza from appearing on uefa 's biggest stage thanks to the tv money and gate receipts that brings
louis van gaal ( left ) and brendan rodgers come face to face in a huge clash at anfield on sunday after manchester united 's disappointing 2013 - 14 season , they will be desperate to break into the top four this time around liverpool are two points behind manchester united in the league , and desperate to topple their rivals group participation : Â£ 6.3million win bonus : Â£ 720,000 draw : Â£ 362,000 qualification to round of 16 : Â£ 2.54m quarter - finals : Â£ 2.83m semi-finals : Â£ 3.55m winners : Â£ 7.61m runners - up : Â£ 4.71m gate receipts per match ( manchester united ) : Â£ 2m gate receipts per match ( liverpool ) : Â£ 1.5m ( numbers based on 2013/14 figures ) the losers , however , may be advised to find out what number itv4 is on their tv boxes and brace themselves for the prospect of a fraction of that sum from the europa league
in the packed stands it will all be about what happens on the pitch
in the directors box , however , officials will no doubt be calculating the rewards of glorious victory and the cost of miserable defeat
should louis van gaal 's visitors triumph in the early kick - off they will stretch the gap on liverpool to five points with eight matches to play
victory for brendan rodgers 's resurgent reds would see them take over fourth spot by a point
a draw and the advantage remains with the visitors from the other end of the ship canal
while officials from both clubs are desperate to make the champions league , failure to do so would do more damage to the old trafford coffers
there has been plenty at stake in previous matches , but champions league money is now bigger than ever andy cole ( left ) and david beckham celebrate during a manchester united vs liverpool clash in 1997 - 98 liverpool are two points behind manchester united going into sunday 's huge game at anfield manchester united , perennial participants , are already counting the cost of this year 's non-participation
figures recently released reveal that they are set to see a drop in revenue of around Â£ 50m as a result of their inability to qualify under david moyes
should they repeat the trick this year that figure will rise to around Â£ 70m thanks to the new tv deal with bt sport which is worth an extra Â£ 20m
then there is manchester united 's Â£ 750m kit deal with adidas
that features a Â£ 22.5m penalty should they fail to qualify for the champions league for two consecutive seasons
if the unthinkable happens , the loss would hit a staggering Â£ 100m
david moyes ' failure to reach the top four last season has made success imperative this time around liverpool got a taste of the champions league this season , and will want the same again in 2015 - 16 the impact another year without champions league football would have on existing and potential sponsors can not be quantified but it could run into the millions
manchester united have a vast commercial operation with offices in manchester , mayfair and hong kong aimed at squeezing every penny out of their global brand
while they could label one year without champions league football as a one - off , investors may see two years of non-qualification as more of a trend
that logic would no doubt spread to the new york stock exchange where failure to qualify could have an impact on the club 's share price
manchester united are used to european success , and will want to recreate nights like this - moscow in may 2008 much of their success came under sir alex ferguson ( centre ) , and they have struggled since his retirement in 2013 - 14 , when manchester united were knocked out by bayern munich in the quarter finals , they picked up Â£ 31.3m in broadcasting money alone
as for prize money , uefa pay around Â£ 800,000 for each win and Â£ 415,000 for a draw
there is also the extra gate receipts , although this would be offset by an appearance in the europa league
season ticket holders at manchester united commit to buying tickets for european matches and they would be looking to pick up around Â£ 2m per game
sunday 's match is set to be broadcast to 645 million homes across 175 countries around the world cristiano ronaldo ( left ) and david beckham ( right ) left manchester united for real madrid all of the above would help both clubs when it comes to complying with financial fair play regulations
however , the latest , staggering Â£ 5bn tv deal for premier league tv rights is a game changer
manchester united privately believe that could give them the clout to finally overtake real madrid and end the talent drain that saw cristiano ronaldo and david beckham depart old trafford for the bernabeu
there is not only champions league cash up for grabs
van gaal ( second left ) speaks to his players during a training session at the club 's carrington training ground manchester united 's first team were readying themselves for sunday 's match in training on friday morning at the end of the season the premier league dishes out ' merit ' money based on finishing position
last year the difference between arsenal , who finished fourth and everton , who finished fifth , was Â£ 1.24m
liverpool and manchester united are seemingly out of the title race
this is not a battle for honours but the match is set to be the most - viewed of the season
it will be broadcast to 645 million homes across 175 countries with the global fanbase enjoyed by both a major factor
there is much more than three points at stake , but then there always has been .
