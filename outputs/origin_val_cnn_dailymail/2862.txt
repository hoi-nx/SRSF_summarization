according to the fashion world , the seventies are back â and there âs no one happier about it than me , as someone who lived and breathed every second of it
designers such as prada , tom ford and gucci showered catwalks last year in flares , jumpsuits , wide - brimmed hats and wild prints
but the retro revival does nât stop at the ankles ; summer stilettos have been ditched in favour of towering platforms on almost every high street in the country
as a top model during the seventies , i lived in platforms
bigger was always better , especially because â at 5 ft 8 in â i was a little on the short side for the fashion world
but now , aged 61 and with 11 grandchildren , i âm not sure i can carry them off with such aplomb
surely thin , slimming lines and elegant shapes are what i âm after rather than weighty clodhoppers ? to find out if they can ever be flattering , i put eight pairs through their paces
kurt geiger , Â£ 130 shoes : www.kurtgeiger.com completely inappropriate â but i think these are divine
i had a pair of red snakeprint platforms by terry de havilland like these more than 40 years ago
sadly , those days are gone
no one over 30 should attempt these now
at 6 in , they are impossible to walk in , though the colour is fabulous
i âd call these ankle breakers
height : 6 in wearability : 3/10 clarks , Â£ 150 shoes : www.clarks.co.uk help ! these look like dumb - bells stuck to my feet
they are out of proportion with my legs
not even wearing these shoes with a delicate dress saves them
height : 5 in wearability : 0/10 next , Â£ 35 shoes : www.next.co.uk these work because the straps are thin and dainty and the heel is not a thick wedge
they would jazz up a tailored suit or little black dress perfectly
i âd buy them in a heartbeat
height : 5 in wearability : 9/10 russell & bromley , Â£ 125 shoes : www.russellandbromley.co.uk these are reminiscent of my seventies â peace , love and brown rice â days
the clog style is not sophisticated enough for a lady in her 60s
i clumped about as though walking on stilts
height : 5 in wearability : 2/10 dune , Â£ 79 shoes : www.dunelondon.com my absolute favourites : the front platform ( about an inch thick ) is just enough to boost your height without looking clunky
orange is a bright and breezy colour for spring and summer
height : 4.5 in wearability : 10/10 zara , Â£ 49.99 shoes : www.zara.com i know i should nât , but i love these skyscrapers
forty years ago , i would have practically slept in them
padded soles and thick ankle straps mean they are surprisingly comfortable
height : 5 in wearability : 6/10 topshop , Â£ 55 shoes : www.topshop.com from the knees down i look great , but i âm not sure a 61 - year - old can get away with these
they are as subtle as a sledgehammer and too cumbersome in heavy looking black
height : 5Â½ in wearability : 6/10 office , Â£ 65 shoes : www.office.co.uk one of the sturdiest pair of heels i âve ever worn
the soft leather and mule style is spot - on seventies
the open toe is perfect for summer and these are age appropriate , too
hallelujah ! height : 4 in wearability : 10/10
