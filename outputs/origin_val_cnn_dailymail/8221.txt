a new species of bug - eyed catfish with a suckermouth has been named after the star wars character greedo
the catfish has been named by biologists at auburn university , in alabama , as peckoltia greedoi after the fictional alien bounty hunter
the fish was discovered in the gurupi river in north central brazil and has large dark eyes , protruding birstles and a sucker mouth
the new species of catfish peckoltia greedoi ( left ) has large eyes and a sucker mouth much like the bounty hunter greedo ( right ) in that featured briefly at the start of the first installment of the original star wars films professor jonathan armbruster , a biologist and curator of fishes at the museum , said his colleagues chris noticed the resemblance to the alien killed by han solo in the first of the original star wars films
yoda purpurata - a deep sea worm han solo - an extinct species of trilobite found in southern china aptostichus sarlaac - a species of trapdoor spider tetramorium jedi - a madagascan ant darthvaderum - an australia arboreal mite polemistus chewbacca - a wasp agathidium vaderi - a species of beetle he said : ' chris looked at the specimen and said " that looks like that guy from star wars "
' after a little prodding , i realised he was talking about greedo
' we then knew what the name had to be
' the peckoltia greedoi does bear a striking resemblance to greedo
' as a seven - year - old kid , i watched star wars in the theatre and it was a life - changing experience for me
' i became a lifelong fan , and i now share that with my son
' greedo has always been a personal favourite of mine
' greedo , a bug - eyed green alien from the spaceport mos espa , was killed by han solo in a brief scene close to the start of star wars : a new hope a new hope
it is not the first new species to be named after characters from the star wars films
even though taxonomy is considered to be a serious business , those naming new species often have a lot of fun with the names
in 2012 marine biologists named a purple deep sea worm yoda purpurata after the jedi knight from star wars - yoda
professor jonathan armbruster ( pictured above on the right with student carrie allison left ) named the new species of catfish after his favourite character from the star wars films that he watched as a young boy peckoltia greedoi ( shown above ) has bug - eyes , bristles on its cheeks and a large sucker mouth there is also a small parasite that lives on a burrowing crab known as albunione yoda
a fossil trilobite which was found to belong to a new genus was given the name han solo by a palaeobiologist samuel turvey
jason bong , director of the auburn university of natural hisotry also named a new species of trapdoor spider the aptostichus sarlaac , after the sarlacc monster that appears in the return of the jedi
a species of ant in madagascar is called tetramorium jedi , while an entire genus of mite in australia is called darthvaderum
there are also three species of wasp called polemistus chewbacca , polemistus vaderi and polemistus yoda
professor armbuster himself has named more than 40 new species of fish
peckoltia greedoi was first discovered in 1998 but had not been described as a new species until this year
two other new species - peckoltia greedoi ephippiata and peckoltia lujani - were found alongside it
he said : ' in biology , taxonomy is probably the most important science
' we have not even completed cataloging all of the species found locally , and in places like south america , it sometimes feels like we have barely started
' we need names to be able to discuss anything about the biology of the organisms , and it is the one branch of biology used by every biologist alive
' the purple deep sea worm above was named yoda purpurata , after the jedi knight from the star wars films the trapdoor spider above was named aptostichus sarlaac , after the sarlacc monster in return of the jedi
