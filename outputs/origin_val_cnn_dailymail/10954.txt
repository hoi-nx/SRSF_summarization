this is the haunting last picture of a ' kind and caring ' iran sports journalist , taken in the window of his barcelona hotel hours before he boarded the doomed germanwings flight
hussein javadi took the picture in the window of hotel hespiria before he departed for the airport on tuesday morning , sharing it on his private instagram account
he had been in the spanish city to cover ' el clasico ' , a football match between barcelona and real madrid - his favourite team , according to his profile on the picture sharing site
but they never reached their destination , as the plane was plunged into the alps by german pilot lubitz , killing all 150 people on board the flight to dussedorf
mr hussein javadi 's long - time friend maysam bizã¦r - who shared the picture on his twitter account after learning of the tragedy - told the evening standard : ' he was a kind , loving and caring man with high passion for his work and football
' the heartbreaking picture of mr hussein javadi , who worked for vatan emrooz newspaper , is just one of the traces left behind of the passengers ' final hours
many of the 16 german schoolchildren , who had been in barcelona on an exchange , messaged friends and family as they boarded the plane
among them were 16 - year - old elena , who friends described as a â happy girl â who dreamed of going to university and travelling the world
germanwings co-pilot - 28 - year - old german lubitz ( above ) - deliberately crashed into a mountain to ' destroy the plane ' , it has been revealed these are some of the german pupils who died on the germanwings flight , which crashed in the alps , killing all 150 passengers
the teenagers had been on a week - long exchange trip to barcelona and were flying home â she had been sending me messages on whatsapp and snap chat and had been very happy about the trip
she had had a good time
â elena âs best friend and classmate philippa said
â she sent me pictures of the group together and the different sights they saw
they looked like they had had fun
â investigators have since revealed how the 28 - year - old pilot locked his captain out of the cockpit in the moments before the aircraft was downed
the chilling final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by french prosecutors who said lubitz 's sole aim was to ' destroy the plane '
' we hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something
' so the co-pilot is on his own , and it is while he 's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane
' at this altitude , this can only be done voluntarily
we hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in , speaking through the intercom system , but there 's no answer from the cockpit
' his ( lubitz 's ) breath was not of somebody who was struggling
he never said a single word
it was total silence in the cockpit for the ten past minutes
' there are alarm systems which indicate to all those on board the proximity of the ground
then we hear noises of someone trying to break into the door
' the door is reinforced according to international standards
' just before final impact we hear the sound of a first impact
it 's believed that the plane may have hit something before the final impact
' there is no distress signal or mayday signal
no answer was received despite numerous calls from the tower
' i do n't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds
' the intention was to destroy the plane
the plane hit the mountain at 700kmh ( 430mph )
' he did this for a reason which we do n't know why , but we can only deduct that he destroyed this plane
' we have asked for information from the german investigation on both his profession and personal background
' there is no reason to suspect a terrorist attack
' people who commit suicide usually do so alone ... i do n't call it a suicide
