scott kelly and his girlfriend will be giving a whole new meaning to the term ' long - distance relationship ' when he sets off for a 12 - month trip to the international space station on saturday
' for me it 's like the most romantic long - distance relationship ever , ' the nasa astronaut 's girlfriend of five years , amiko kauderer , told abc news
scott kelly , who has spent a total of six months away from amiko kauderer on previous trips to space , will be able to call her whenever he likes and will be able to video chat once a week
' we get to connect on phone calls
we get to have our face conference
but you ca n't upload human touch
' amiko kauderer , 41 , works in nasa 's public affairs department in webster , texas ; she has been with the agency since 1998
last year the fitness fanatic tried out to become a houston texans cheerleader , but failed to make the squad
scott kelly , 51 , who has two young daughters from a previous relationship , said he will miss food on earth as well as ' the rain , the breeze , the change of seasons '
but ' most of my concerns with this flight , being gone for a year , is the stuff that can happen to people on earth while i 'm gone , ' he told cbs sunday morning
still , the couple say they are more excited about scott kelly 's return home and what his record - breaking trip will achieve
' we kind of really appreciate challenge and things that are hard , because we often know at the end of it , that you can kind of go , " yeah , we did that , " you know ? ' amiko kauderer said
' and the homecoming 's really good after a year , ' scott kelly quipped
left behind : speaking from their houston , texas home , the couple agreed they would miss human touch during the 12 months apart but were already looking forward to the homecoming family : scott kelly said he also worries about being away from his two daughters from a previous marriage scott kelly , together with russian mikhail kornienko and padalka , will launch from baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan in the early hours of saturday
the trip will test how the human body copes with prolonged space travel by comparing scott kelly 's health to that of his identical twin brother , retired astronaut mark kelly , who will remain on earth
called the nasa , the kellys will be subjected to 10 experiments in four areas : human physiology , behavioral health , microbiology and molecular
' maybe there is a little cliff out there that you fall off with regards to the radiation , bone mass , bone density , those type of things , so , i am all in , ' mark kelly told abc news
still , mark kelly , who is married to former congresswoman gabrielle giffords , says he has no intentions of consuming bland space - type food or working out and running two hours a day on a treadmill , as his brother will be doing in space
' this is a chance in a lifetime , â said dr craig kundrot , the deputy chief scientist of nasa 's human research program
giant leaps : scott kelly , pictured right , will undergo tests to compare his health to that of his identical twin brother , mark kelly , left , himself a retired astronaut , to see how being in space affects the body close : mark kelly , pictured left as he joked around with his brother after a news conference in the baikonur cosmodrome , kazakhstan on thursday , said he would not be eating the same diet as his twin ' in this case we 've got two genetically identical individuals and we can monitor what kind of changes occur in mark kelly in an ordinary lifestyle and compare those to the changes that we see in scott kelly
' by staying on the station for 12 months , the astronauts will also provide key information on how an eventual mars mission - estimated to last three years there and back - might play out
a mission to the red planet will require long periods of time in reduced - gravity environments , both in space and on the surface of the red planet
but , until now , crew members have only spent about six months on the space station at a time
scott kelly and mikhail kornienko will spend 12 months in space , while padalka will be there for just six months
they will travel there on the soyuz spaceshuttle
mikhail kornienko , 54 , a former paratrooper from moscow , will also leave a wife , irina , on earth
his 32 - year - old daughter is a new mother
team : scott kelly is pictured with russian cosmonauts padalka ( center ) and mikhail kornienko ( right ) , who will travel with him
only he and mikhail kornienko will remain on the space station for 12 months new digs : scott kelly , 51 , sits inside a soyuz simulator at a training center earlier this month the soyuz tma-16m spacecraft is seen on its launch pad at the baikonur cosmodrome cosmodrome ahead of its mission getting ready : an orthodox priest blesses the soyuz rocket at the baikonur cosmodrome on thursday his wife cried when she learned in 2012 that he 'd be leaving earth for a whole year
and she 's still not happy about it , mikhail kornienko previously told the ap. ' she understands that it 's a dangerous mission
but she 's getting used to the idea , ' he said
on his trip , padalka will break the record for cumulative time spent in space , which currently stands at 803 days , and will also become the first person to command the station four times
the three will join expedition 43 commander terry virts of nasa and his crewmates , anton shkaplerov of roscosmos and samantha cristoforetti of esa
see below for video scott kelly this will be the fourth spaceflight for mr scott kelly , 51 , a former nasa shuttle commander and navy test pilot whose identical twin brother , mark kelly , also was chosen as an astronaut in 1996
the two will conduct many of the same medical experiments over the coming year so scientists can compare the results
scott kelly 's first two flights were aboard shuttles
he spent more than five months on the space station in 2010 to 2011
it was during that mission that his sister - in - law , then congresswoman gabrielle giffords , nearly died after being shot in the head in tucson , arizona
once he 's back home in houston , scott kelly imagines it will be ' hard to walk away ' from spaceflight
he 'd love to pilot one of the new us spacecraft in development
but he figures if he cuts in front of other astronauts awaiting assignments , ' someone will run me over with their car
' what will scott kelly miss the most , besides his loved ones ? the weather
' it never changes on the space station , ' he said
' even though it 's a pretty nice environment , i guess it 's like living in southern california , people get sick of it ... after a while
' mikhail kornienko it will be the second space mission for mr mikhail kornienko , 54 , a former paratrooper whose helicopter - pilot father was part of the search and rescue team for the first soviet cosmonauts back in the 1960s
his father brought back souvenirs from the returning soyuz capsules : uneaten food rations and pieces of the orange silky parachutes used for the final descent
' mom made gorgeous skirts out of them , ' he said
' i still have a small piece of one of those parachutes
' i cherish it as if it were something sacred
' a religious man , mr mikhail kornienko is taking into orbit a folding icon depicting the madonna and child
his previous station stay was in 2010 , 12 years after his selection as a cosmonaut
he figures he 'll miss the same things he dreamed about last time he flew : water not in the form of blobs as in space , but water you can swim in , as well as grass , forests and fields
mr mikhail kornienko already says he 'd take on another one - year mission â after a break , of course .
