human waste left by climbers on everest has become a problem that is causing pollution and threatening to spread disease on the world 's highest peak
the more than 700 climbers and guides who spend nearly two months on everest 's slopes each climbing season leave large amounts of faeces and urine , and the issue has not been addressed , the chief of nepalese 's mountaineering association , tshering , told reporters on tuesday
' climbers usually dig holes in the snow for their toilet use and leave the human waste there , ' tshering said , adding that the waste has been ' piling up ' for years around the four camps
hundreds of foreign climbers attempt to scale everest during nepalese 's mountaineering season , which began this week and runs through may
last year 's season was canceled after 16 local guides were killed in an avalanche in april
climbers spend weeks acclimatizing around the four camps set up between the base camp at 5,300 meters ( 17,380 feet ) and the 8,850 - meter - high ( 29,035 - foot - high ) summit
the camps have tents and some essential equipment and supplies , but do not have toilets
at the base camp , where there are more porters , cooks and support staff during the climbing season , there are toilet tents with drums to store the waste
once filled , the drums are carried to a lower area , where the waste is properly disposed
hundreds of foreign climbers attempt to scale everest during nepalese 's mountaineering season , which began this week and runs through may dawa steven sherpa , who has been leading everest cleanup expeditions since 2008 , said some climbers carry disposable travel toilet bags to use in the higher camps
' it is a health hazard and the issue needs to be addressed , ' he said
nepalese 's government has not come up with a plan yet to tackle the issue of human waste
but starting this season , officials stationed at the base camp will strictly monitor garbage on the mountain , said katuwal , the head of the government 's mountaineering department
the government imposed new rules last year requiring each climber to bring down to the base camp eight kilograms ( 18 pounds ) of rubbish â the amount it estimates a climber discards along the route
climbing teams must leave a $ 4,000 ( Â£ 2600 ) deposit that they lose if they do n't comply with the regulations , katuwal said
more than 4,000 climbers have scaled everest since 1953 , when it was first conquered by new zealand climber edmund hillary and his sherpa guide , tenzing norgay
hundreds of others have died in the attempt , while many have succeeded only with help from oxygen tanks , equipment porters and sherpa guides .
