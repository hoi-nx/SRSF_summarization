sanaa , yemen oversized military trucks painted in desert beige hauled tanks in the same camouflage color down a dark highway late saturday past glowing billboards in the saudi arabia town of jazan
with the border with yemen little more than 20 miles away , the trucks captured on a video distributed by the news agency reuters also carried a message : suggestions of a ground incursion into yemen , which is in the throes of a houthi rebel uprising , may be more than just talk
saudi arabia and egypt have both spoken about the possibility of putting boots on the ground before
and on saturday , yemen foreign minister riyadh yaseen said he expected coalition troops to be in yemen within days
saudi arabia leaders have said that if troops do go in , they wo n't leave until they have degraded the houthis ' ability to do battle , cnn 's ian lee reported
the houthis are apt guerrillas
a fight on the ground could prove bloody and lengthy
politically , the situation appears to be heating up
ahmed ali abdullah saleh , the son of former yemen president ali abdullah saleh , has been removed from his post as ambassador to united arab emirates , according to two aides of the nation 's current president , hadi
hadi fled the country in february amid the houthi uprising
he went to aden and declared that he remained the country 's leader
also on sunday , pro-hadi fighters took over aden 's airport , according to security officials in aden , but that airport has n't been operational for weeks
yemen 's ex-president , ali abdullah saleh , a shiite , still holds influence over large parts of the yemen army , and his troops are also fighting the government
in a taped speech played on yemen today tv on friday , he called for the airstrikes to stop and offered in return not to run for president in the next elections
the saudi arabia - led coalition fighting the houthis , who deposed the yemen government and seized territory in a series of offensives , began its military action last week
it answered hadi 's call for intervention with an unrelenting air campaign called " decisive storm
" hadi slipped out of yemen last week and has gone to the resort town of sharm el-sheikh , egypt , to attend the arab league summit , where he is rallying support with leaders of member nations for operation determination storm
the coalition nations participating in the bombardments make up about a third of the league 's membership
on saturday , hadi called the houthis out : " you violated the sovereignty ( of yemen ) , and you bear the responsibility for what happened and what is going to happen
" dozens have died from the coalition bombardment
houthi commanders put the death toll at 48
most of the dead are civilians , they said
airstrikes have hit houthi militant groups , smashed their big air defense guns and crumbled key infrastructure that links major towns with the capital , sanaa , a saudi arabia official has said
the coalition has destroyed yemen army weapons caches and military facilities
saudi arabia naval special forces have also rescued dozens of diplomats , the official said
and many u.n. representatives have fled the unrest
saudi arabia has set up a blockade , effectively cutting off houthi supply lines , and its air force controls yemen airspace
they have threatened to attack ships that might supply the rebels
the shiite houthis are allied with iran , a majority shiite nation
saudi arabia has accused iran of beefing up the houthis ' weaponry for their offensive
hadi denounced them on saturday as iran 's " puppet
" " i say to the puppet of iran , and those who are with him , you destroyed yemen with your immature politics , and creating internal and regional crisis , " he said
the conflict splits the region along religious lines
determination storm 's coalition comprises the majority sunni nations of saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , kuwait , bahrain , qatar , jordan , morocco , egypt and sudanese
on saturday , houthi claimed to have shot down a sudanese jet and captured the pilot
they distributed photos of a pilot and wreckage to back up the claim
iran and saudi arabia are bitter rivals
having yemen become an iran satellite country on its border would be unacceptable to the kingdom
iran has sharply denounced the saudi arabia - dominated armed intervention
and two arab league members , lebanon and iraq , have voiced opposition to determination storm , ian lee reported
both countries are majority shiite
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu pointed to yemen on sunday to criticize nuclear negotiations between iran and the p5 +1 group of nations
he accused iran of trying to use the conflict in yemen to " take over the whole middle east
" the u.s. voiced approval of the airstrikes
it 's supporting them logistically and aiding coalition forces in locating targets , but it is not participating in active battle
the unrest in yemen led to the withdrawal of u.s. special forces earlier this month , seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts in a country that has been a stronghold for aqap ( aqap )
for years , yemen had allowed u.s. drones and special operations forces to stalk aqap in the country
now , that arrangement is in tatters
on saturday , the coalition struck al anad airbase , which was used as the headquarters for u.s. counterterrorism operations , houthi commanders said
houthi rebels had taken control of the base
houthi rebels and the government began doing battle in 2004 , but arrived at a ceasefire in 2010 , according to the cia world factbook
the country has seen much unrest in the wake of the arab spring uprising
arab spring was n't supposed to turn out like this yemen was plunged into chaos when the houthi rebels , who have long felt marginalized in the majority sunni country , began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country last fall
houthi moved into sanaa in september , sparking battles that killed a few hundred people before a ceasefire was called
in january , they surrounded the presidential palace and hadi resigned and was put under house arrest
in february the houthis took control of military forces stationed near sanaa , including the air force
but the chaos is not limited to the houthi uprising
in the area of the southern port city of aden , opposing yemen military forces -- those allied with the houthis , and those supporting hadi -- have fought for more than a week
correction : pakistan is not participating in airstrikes over yemen , the pakistan embassy in washington said
cnn previously included pakistan in an illustration of coalition member countries participating the operation determination storm
the illustration said the country was contributing 15 jets
that illustration has since been updated
