manchester united playmaker angel di maria failed to live up to his Â£ 60million price - tag once again on wednesday night with his main flaw surrounding his inability to pick out a red shirt
di maria , who looked incredibly disappointed after being hauled off in the 59th minute , was manchester united 's worst passer with a passing accuracy percentage of 63.6 per cent
louis van gaal 's decision to replace the premier league 's record signing with januzaj comes just days after di maria was hooked off at the interval against sunderland following another below - par performance against gus poyet 's side

januzaj , who came off the substitutes ' bench to replace di maria , also seemed to be on a different wavelength to his manchester united team - mates as his passing accuracy percentage was just 66.7 during the 31 minutes he was on the field of play
the likes of ander herrera ( 90.7 per cent ) , wayne rooney ( 90.3 per cent ) and late substitute juan mata ( 100 per cent ) all impressed on the ball during their side 's slender 1 - 0 win over newcastle
van gaal , who said di maria needs a year to adapt to life in the premier league , will be hoping his record summer signing can replicate the form he had shown in his last few months at real madrid
