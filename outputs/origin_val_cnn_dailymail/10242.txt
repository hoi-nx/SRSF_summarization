for pbs science correspondent miles o'brien , seeing on film the aftermath of the freak accident that resulted in the amputation of his left arm above the elbow proved more difficult than he had anticipated
he had an early look at the documentary , miles o'brien : a life lost and found , narrated by his friend , dr. gupta
it premieres on cnn next tuesday at 9pm
' i was a little bit taken aback by how much it affected me emotionally , ' miles o'brien said
' we all want to talk about this linear , analogue thing â here 's when you grieve , here 's when you do therapy , here 's where you get back to work
but that 's not how we all live
he appears on the network as an occasional analyst , such as during coverage of last spring 's missing malaysia airlines plane , but does most of his freelance work now for pbs newshour
he was on assignment for pbs in japan and the philippines in february 2014 when a heavy case of equipment fell on his left forearm
it caused a nasty bruise , but not enough to stop miles o'brien from working
he wanted to finish his stories and escape for a few days on a beach
the following night , his pain increased and miles o'brien sought medical attention
he was diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome , a condition where his swollen muscles blocked blood flow in his arm
as he was getting ready for surgery , he searched the internet for details on a diagnosis he had never heard before , and grew alarmed when words like ' life - threatening ' and ' amputation ' popped up
fateful trip : in febraury 2014 , miles o'brien ( pictured ) traveled to japan and the philippines to report on 3d printing when the accident occurred illusion : waking up after the amputation , miles o'brien could feel his left arm , but it was only a phantom limb denial : miles o'brien continued working on his stories after being discharged from the hospital and did n't tell his family back home about the amputation waking up after surgery , miles o'brien 's first inclination was that he caught a break
he could feel his left arm , the fingers on his hand
but it was an illusion , a phantom limb
he checked out of the hospital two days later and spent more than a week in a philippines hotel , finishing his pbs stories
in an extreme form of denial , the divorced father of two told no one what had happened , even his children
they were dark days , and he told gupta he even considered suicide
' i had never lost an arm before , ' he said , drily
' i was n't sure how that would go
' two weeks after the amputation , he wrote in a blog post- typed with one hand with the help of a voice recognition software : ' life is all about playing the hand that is dealt you
actually , i would love somebody to deal me another hand right about now â in more ways than one
' during an interview on the today show in march 2014 , about a month after his accident , miles o'brien described what happened to him as ' mind - boggling
' unstoppable : the 55 - year - old reporter has learned how to ride a bicycle one - handed with the help of a special contraption ( pictured ) miles o'brien had never been the sort of person who reached out for help
and he wanted to prove to himself he could move forward and still do his job
when he found out about the amputation through the february blog post miles o'brien had written , gupta was worried
' i was n't surprised by miles o'brien ' reaction , ' he said
' my concern was , was this his form of therapy or was he delaying the inevitable psychological crash by not dealing with it emotionally ? ' miles o'brien has tried to prove he can maintain his active life beyond work , with some missteps
he started running , but losing an arm affected his balance and he took some nasty spills
he broke his nose one time when he reached to break his fall with an arm that was no longer there
a woman who came upon him was horrified â look what happened to his arm ! â and miles o'brien had to explain he did n't lose it in the fall
with the help of a prosthetic arm , he completed a 300 - mile bike ride to honor his late sister , gupta pedaling by his side
the licensed pilot has also been testing out how to fly again with his new disability
growing pains : the divorced father of two has been learning how to perform simple everyday tasks like cutting a bagel and getting dressed on his own he 's learning about the oddities of pain in a phantom limb , how to work with new prosthetics and how to negotiate simple tasks â getting dressed , cutting a bagel â that he never had to think twice about before
when filming the cnn special , miles o'brien knew what gupta was up to when his friend asked him to read on camera some of the emails that gupta had sent to him a year ago
he was trying to make him cry
the emotional journey , still not completed , has been one of self - discovery
he 's learned that there 's no weakness in asking for help
he realizes what loved ones and even strangers think of him , and it has been overwhelming
' if i had to trade it â that arm for the knowledge and the love that i feel ? ' he said
' i 'll go with the love
it 's a hell of a way to learn a lesson
