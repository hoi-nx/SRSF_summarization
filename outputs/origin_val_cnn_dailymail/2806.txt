england 's campaign at the european under 21 championship looks set to be dominated over whether kane is included - but gareth southgate may not need him
in front of over 30,000 at the riverside stadium , england came from behind to defeat germany 3 - 2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the czech republic this summer
gareth southgate is still expected to do everything he can to include the tottenham striker , but the win over germany shows that the young lions can go toe - to - toe with the cream of europe
here sportsmail looks at england 's three stand - out stars from the win in middlesbrough
james ward-prowse the southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at st mary 's and is set to be a key member of gareth southgate 's side in the czech republic
the 20 - year - old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after ghosting into the penalty box to find space
but his attacking play extends to set - pieces
germany 's julian korb reaches out in vain as james ward-prowse fires home england 's winning goal the under 21 21 captain celebrates his late strike following a fine midfield performance in ward-prowse , england have potentially their best dead - ball specialist since david beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game
ward-prowse was captain for the germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on
carl jenkinson named the official man of the match , carl jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for germany 's opening goal after allowing the cross for philipp hofmann to fire home
but after a slow start to each half , the west ham full - back , on loan from arsenal , imposed himself down the right - hand side

with england 's senior team lacking depth in the right - back area , roy hodgson could do worse than pick carl jenkinson
because if he does n't , then finland will as he can still play for the scandinavian team
nathan redmond relished the battle with germany full - back christian gunter , often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing
nathan redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach , with his passing in the final third managing to catch the german back four flat on a number of occasions
nathan redmond rifles home england 's second equaliser across goal into the bottom corner nathan redmond celebrates after drawing england level late in the game following an impressive display on the right it was a much improved version of the winger who struggled in a poor norwich side in the premier league last season , but having struck the equaliser against a talented germany team he looks to be improving
now a veteran of the under 21 set - up , it will be difficult for gareth southgate to leave him out of the side in the summer to help make space for kane as he has often impressed on the right wing for the young lions .
