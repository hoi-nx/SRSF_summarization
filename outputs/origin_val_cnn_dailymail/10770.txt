guilty - stricken : rick abath , pictured above as police found him , has spoken about his involvement in the 1990 heist from a boston art gallery the security guard who was duped into letting the thieves at the center of america 's most notorious unsolved art crime into the boston gallery from which they looted paintings worth $ 500million has spoken of his guilt
rick abath , who was a college drop - out working night shifts at the gardner museum in 1990 , said he still feels ' horrible ' about his inadvertent role in the crime , which has baffled investigators for decades
rick abath was duped by two thieves in police uniform , who persuaded him to let them into the gallery , then overwhelmed him and left him in the basement covered in duct tape
he spent the next seven hours handcuffed to an electrical box alongside another guard , while the two men cut loose enormously valuable old masters from their frames , including works by rembrandt , vermeer , degas and manet
the fbi has never come close to finding the paintings - despite supposedly promising leads last may - and there remains a $ 5million reward for information leading to their return
rick abath reflected on the night of march 18 , 1990 , in an interview published by npr
he said : ' they had hats , badges , they looked like cops , and i let them in ... ' ' ultimately i 'm the one who made the decision to buzz them in
' it 's the kind of thing most people do n't have to learn to cope with
it 's like doing penance
he added : ' i do n't want to be remembered for this alone
i 'd like to be remembered for the good things i 've done
i 'm a husband , a father of two really cool kids
' in total the haul including three rembrandt works , five sketches by degas , a manet painting and a painting by vermeer - one of only 36 in the world
a bronze eagle statue , a chinese beaker from 1100 bc and a painting by govaert flinck were also taken
aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the men may have been
missing : the gardner museum continues to display empty frames in the spots where the paintings should be a petty boston criminal , who had broken into the gallery before denies having anything to do with the heist , has since said he believes his boasts to criminal associates may have sparked the crime
louis royce , who was a teenager in the 1980s and made it inside the gallery , told veteran crime reporter kurkjian that he believes information he gave ' criminal associates ' about the lax security may have focused the thieves ' attention on the gardner museum
according to kurkjian , whose recently - published book about the heist was previewed in the washington post , the information passed up the chain in the criminal underworld until a boston gangster decided to make the attempt
the fbi has periodically renewed its appeal for information about the artworks , and carries information about the reward prominently on its website
reward : the fbi has claimed to be hot on the trail of the paintings in the past - but little has emerged
pictured above is a 2013 press conference at which a $ 5million reward was announced in 2013 , the bureau claimed to have made ' significant investigative progress ' after figuring out that the stolen paintings had been taken to connecticut and philadelphia
agents also said ' a criminal organization with a base in the mid-atlantic states ' was responsible , and had attempted to sell the paintings in 2003
federal prosecutors have said they would even consider immunity for those who help recover the artworks , and said they could pay the huge reward anonymously
in may 2014 , the bureau made another announcement , saying there had been ' confirmed sightings ' of the work - and even naming three men in connection with the crime
however , two of them , carmello merlino , robert guarente , are dead , and the third , gentile , denies any involvement
gentile has denied any knowledge of the missing work
in a long piece in the boston globe , gentile , a long - time criminal in his 70s who recently got out of prison , revealed that fbi agents had raided his shed hoping to find the paintings
there was nothing there , and gentile continues to deny he ever had anything to do with the theft
the museum , meanwhile , has been displaying empty frames in place of the missing masterworks ever since the theft
it is now offering virtual tours and lectures about the work , in an effort to make up for their continued absence - though the museum 's directors continue to hold out hope they will one day return
