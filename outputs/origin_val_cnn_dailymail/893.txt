we reveal how to get the enviable physiques of the stars
this week : scarlett 's legs
it 's just months since she gave birth to her daughter , but actress scarlett was showing off perfect pins on the red carpet recently
her take on the closet classic had a surprising twist with a beaded fringe that felt like a flapper girl 's dream
the fringe detail gave the dress movement , making scarlett 's sheath seem fun and effervescent
the actress kept the focus on her bold choice of apparel by keeping the rest of her styling to a minimum
she paired her preen dress with some simple black pumps and stayed jewelry and accessory free
her swept back pompadour - inspired hair mimicked her youthful and effortless elegance
the overall effect was decidedly grown up and dressy , but with a laid back insouciant vibe
scarlett 's time spent living in pairs is clearly rubbing off on her sense of style , shifting her aesthetic towards a more sophisticated , yet whimsical taste
her preen dress is not yet available in stores , but it will come with an equally a-list price tag
considering what a big trend fringe was on the spring runways , finding an alternate take on this dress should come easily

but once she 's there , the 30 - year - old buckles down
' i do the same fitness routine as my big muscle - man trainer , ' she says
' a lot of it is endurance , stability and strength training
' i like to work up a sweat
i 've tried pilates and yoga and all that , and i like to dabble in different things
but i always come back to a good old - fashioned athletic , full - body workout
' what to try : the knee drive with weights
stand with a dumbbell or bottle of water in each hand , palms facing inwards
make sure your feet are positioned underneath your hipbones and are facing forwards
putting your weight on your left leg , bring your right knee up to chest level
swing the right leg back behind the body into a lunge position , placing the foot on the floor
then immediately drive the knee forward to chest level again
keep the weights at your sides as you do this
repeat 12 to 15 times before switching sides .
