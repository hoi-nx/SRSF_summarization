it 's been a great privilege to be part of the senior match officials team and i am going to miss working with some terrific people
i wish everyone here in the british game the very best for 2015
' roby , who has refereed over 75 super league matches over the last five seasons and acted as a touch - judge in some of the sport 's biggest games , including two challenge cup finals , the 2014 super league grand final and the rugby league world cup , is following in the footsteps of russell smith and ashley klein , who made their name in super league before moving to the nrl
rugby football league match officials coaching and technical director jon sharp said : ' this is a fantastic opportunity for tim. i have no doubts that he will do extremely well in australia and we wish him all the best in his new career
' roby is a product of our development programme and his move to australia is an indication of the high regard in which our match officials are held around the world
' there are some outstanding young officials emerging through that same development programme and roby 's departure gives them a chance to realise their ambitions of refereeing at the highest level
