two more united states aid workers who had high - risk exposure to ebola in sierra leone arrived back in the united states on monday for monitoring
neither is sick or known to be infected with the disease
eight of their colleagues have already been flown back to the united states , where health authorities are watching them closely for signs of the disease , according to the cdc
the returning workers are clinicians for partners in health , a boston - based aid group
they all had contact with a colleague who 's been diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the nih in bethesda , maryland
the heath care worker with ebola was in critical condition monday , the nih said
that changed from the nih saying on friday that the patient was in serious condition
details about the patient 's identity were n't released
while in west african , the workers " came to the aid of their ailing colleague , " according to a partners in health statement
as the cdc investigates who else might have had contact with the ebola patient , more workers might be flown back to the united states , according to tom skinner , a spokesman for the cdc
the workers are being housed near hospitals that specialize in treating ebola patients , and if they show signs of the disease , they 'll be admitted as patients -- as was the case with one worker in nebraska
the person developed symptoms sunday evening and " out of an abundance of caution " was taken to the biocontainment unit at the university of nebraska medical center in omaha
" at this point , this person has not tested positive for the ebola virus , " phil smith , m.d. , medical director of the unit , said in a statement monday
" however , because of a change in symptoms , we decided the most prudent course of action was to bring the individual to the biocontainment unit , where we can better monitor symptoms and safely perform testing
however , some of the symptoms which prompted the move to the biocontainment unit have resolved this morning
" none of the other aid workers are showing symptoms of ebola
nurse who contracted ebola sues hospital company state health authorities say all 10 of the workers are deemed to have had high - risk exposure to ebola
this includes people who were not wearing protective gear and were exposed to the bodily fluids of someone with ebola while that person was symptomatic , or someone who lived in the same household and provided direct care to a symptomatic ebola patient
the first of these workers arrived friday night in atlanta showing possible signs of ebola , but testing over the weekend came back negative , according to a government official who did not want to be named
the worker is being isolated in housing near emory for 21 days
" twice a day , we 'll have visual monitoring , either face to face or we 'll skype with them , or do facetime , " said nancy nydam , spokeswoman for the georgia department of public health
" and if it 's skype or facetime , they 'll have to be in a place where we can clearly identify that they are where they 're supposed to be
" the next set of aid workers returned back to the united states on saturday evening and went into isolation in housing on the campus of the university of nebraska medical center , according to spokesman wilson
as in atlanta , these workers have voluntarily agreed not to leave their housing
" they will be monitored so they 'll stay there , " wilson said
another set of three workers arrived sunday morning at housing near the nih
these workers will have more freedom to move around than the ones in georgia and nebraska
according to christopher garrett , a spokesman for the maryland department of health , his state will follow the cdc 's guidelines , which forbid monitored individuals from getting on public transportation but allow them to go outside as long as they stay at least 3 feet away from other people
' 1686 : that 's my number ' two more workers arrived monday morning in atlanta and were isolated in housing near emory
a third worker was expected to arrive monday in atlanta , but health authorities deemed this person to be lower risk and allowed for monitoring at home , according to a government official
the patient now at nih is the second with ebola admitted to the nih hospital

pham recovered and was released free of disease

almost all of the deaths have been in guinea , liberia and sierra leone
