shadow chancellor ed balls said the party could delay hs2 going any further than birmingham in favour of a new east-west line labour has been accused of delivering a ' slap in the face to the north ' after suggesting it could abandon a new high speed rail line to manchester and leeds
shadow chancellor ed balls said the party could delay hs2 going any further than birmingham in favour of a new east-west line
david cameron said labour was ' letting down people in vital regions of our country '
but mr ed balls said prioritising the second phase of hs2 â which would connect birmingham to manchester and leeds â made ' no business or economic sense at all '
mr ed balls said : ' getting on and doing east - west now is the priority
' labour had previously backed hs2 , which could cost more than Â£ 50 billion , even though mr ed balls was known to have doubts about it
mr ed balls was speaking after a cross-party house of lords inquiry warned that the government had failed to ' make a convincing case ' for the high speed rail line and concluded that improving east - west rail links might do more good for the economy
labour will press ahead with plans to build a new line between london and birmingham , with work due to begin in 2017
but it will reconsider the second phase of the project , which extends the line from birmingham to leeds and manchester and was due to begin construction in the mid 2020s
instead , mr ed balls said labour would bring bring forward plans similar to the so - called hs3 , a proposed new line linking the north east and north
he said : ' i will want to be discussing how we can improve east - west links with david higgins from day one and i think that is something we get on with quickly while we ask big questions about the second phase of hs2
' he added : ' the idea that we wait to do east - west until after we have done the second phase of north - south is topsy turvy
it has no economic or business logic at all
' labour had previously backed hs2 , which could cost more than Â£ 50 billion , connecting london to manchester and leeds via birmingham chancellor george osborne also supports hs3 but construction is unlikely to begin until after hs2 is completed in 2033
mr ed balls said : ' i do n't understand this proposal for hs3
why would you decide to spend 20 years improving north - south links before , finally , in the third phase , coming to east - west ? ' i think george osborne has got this wrong
' and our view is that it should n't be hs3 - it should be done before the second phase of hs2
' i think getting on and doing east - west now is the priority
' the shadow chancellor said services would connect the north east and north west , but also suggested a line could also link birmingham and nottingham
' there is actually a big economic need to link east - west , and i 'm thinking about nottingham , birmingham , newcastle as being part of that east - west network as well
' the idea that improving links between birmingham , nottingham , leeds and newcastle , that that should wait until after we have done hs2 , i do n't think makes sense
' david cameron , at a production line for london taxis in coventry , said labour was ' letting down people in vital regions of our country ' responding to mr ed balls 's comment , the prime minister said : ' the economic argument is very simple which is we need another railway line between london and birmingham and up to the north of the country
' so do you build an old - fashioned victorian line or do you build a high speed line , and our decision was to go with the modern technology and build a high speed line
' and i would say to anyone who says there is n't a case for hs2 , try getting on the train from birmingham to london or london to birmingham and see how many people are standing , see how much extra capacity we need
so the case is very strong and has been proven over and over again
' but the very worrying news today is that labour are calling into question the links between birmingham and manchester and birmingham and leeds , and this would be an immense slap in the face from labour to the west midlands , the east midlands and the north of the country and i can not believe they are contemplating letting down british people in vital regions of our country in this way
