roberto martinez insisted everton had to take collective responsibility for their europa league embarrassment as he defended his team selection
everton endured a night of humiliation against dynamo kiev and tumbled out after a 5 - 2 defeat ( 6 - 4 on aggregate ) in the olympic stadium
their performance was stained by defensive mistakes , with alcaraz particularly culpable
this was a night comparable to how everton folded against dinamo bucharest ( 2005 ) and benfica ( 2009 ) when they also conceded five times
everton 's ross barkley and james mccarthy ( right ) look miserable during the painful defeat it made roberto martinez 's decision not to start john stones puzzling but the everton manager maintained there was only a slight difference between the two teams and it was kiev 's superior finishing that meant they reached the quarter - finals
' we did make some defensive mistakes but also there was some incredible finishing and sometimes you have to highlight the quality of that , ' said roberto martinez
' it is only natural and normal from the outside to look back , and i do not regret playing alcaraz - the defence has been strong in the last two games
everton 's phil jagielka , tim howard and leighton baines look dejected after dynamo kiev score their third ' we conceded only one goal from a corner in the first leg and kept a clean sheet against newcastle on sunday , although we did not adapt too well to the pitch
' but it is a case of the whole team not defending well enough
i do not think it is down to the personnel , but as a team
dynamo kiev built a lot of momentum with their crowd rather than us being to blame
' everton got back into the tie when lukaku equalised andrei yarmolenko 's opener but they fell asunder afterwards and phil jagielka 's late header provided no solace
roberto martinez , though , was pleased that everton kept searching for goal
lukaku and ross barkley both look out of sorts as everton crash out of european ' i am looking at the effort and the way we gave up , ' said roberto martinez
' we tried everything to stay in the tie but the way it unfolded was down to one team taking most of their chances ' sometimes the margins are so small and part of the experience in this competition is learning how to play the second leg
gareth barry looks at the ground in disappointment as everton crashed out of the europa league roberto martinez and substitute leon osman remonstrate with the fourth official christoph bornhorst ' both teams created a lot of chances and the difference was one team taking them
after the away goal i thought we would be tighter but it looked like they had a lot of belief and always looked a threat and like they could score a goal
the type of game it was there were opportunities for both teams
