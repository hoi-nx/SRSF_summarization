' we felt we had not done ourselves justice in the first half
but you have got to keep self - belief , that 's really important for the side
' that was the message , ' know that you are still in this game , that we can do better , much better , we can improve '
we 'd given away a really soft goal from our viewpoint , it put us on the back foot for a while , but we definitely could do it
' the players rose to the occasion , which was great
that self - belief was really important
poland , it 's a great point away from home as far as they 're concerned , but we are still well in it
' republic of ireland created little of note before the break and found themselves trailing to slawomir peszko 's 26th - minute opener after he capitalised on an error by makeshift full - back brady
but the home side rallied after the restart and after brady and robbie keane had both hit the post , shane long struck at the death to level it

we played a very good first half and maybe lacked a bit of quality , but overall , we are content with a draw
' three points were really close , but one point is also a good result
it 's no surprise that republic of ireland came back to score an equaliser because the other results show that they know how to play to the end and get a result in their favour at the end of the game
