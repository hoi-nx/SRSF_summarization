when nina langley experienced excruciating pain seven - and - a - half months into her pregnancy , she assumed she was going into labour early
the 32 - year - old went to a&e , prepared to give birth to her baby son , teddy
instead , she was given the devastating news that the pain was being caused by bowel cancer that had spread to her liver
a year ago she had also been diagnosed with ibs , a disease which sometimes has similar symptoms to bowel cancer
she is pictured with son teddy miss nina langley began suffering unbearable pain and believed she was going into labour early , but when she went into hospital tests revealed she had bowel cancer that had spread to her liver miss langley 's fiancÃ© , cusick , who had proposed five months ago , said hearing nina langley had cancer was the worst moment of his life then , throughout her pregnancy she had suffered rib and shoulder pain , but doctors reassured her this was probably being caused by the strain of carrying a baby
miss nina langley was rushed for an emergency caesarean to deliver her son teddy six weeks early so she could start life - saving treatment
now she is set to start chemotherapy once her body has recovered from the operation
her fiancÃ© , cusick , who proposed five months ago , has been left heartbroken by her diagnosis
mr cusick , 38 , a musician , said : ' nina langley is my whole world and i 'm completely devastated that she has been diagnosed with cancer
' we were so excited about becoming parents but nina langley 's shocking diagnosis has overshadowed our happiness
' miss nina langley , a graphic designer from buckingham , had consulted doctors about the rib and shoulder pain she was suffering , but had been reassured it was pregnancy - related
then on february 8th , the pain became so unbearable she began to worry she might be going into labour and so went to a&e
as teddy was born six weeks prematurely , he was kept in hospital so doctors could monitor his growing mr cusick is terrified his fiancÃ© will not live to see her new son grow up , and has began researching specialist cancer treatments online and fundraising to pay for them mr cusick said : ' the thought of meeting our new baby filled us with months of excitement but suddenly the experience turned into a living nightmare
' i never expected it be to cancer , i would n't wish this pain on anyone
' but i need to stay strong for nina langley and i decided to put a status on facebook as a cry for help and that led to me setting up a fundraising page to help with the costs of life - saving specialist treatments that are n't available on the nhs
' doctors believed miss langley might have an infection in her liver , but a biopsy confirmed she had primary bowel cancer that had spread to the organ
she was sent for an emergency caesarean on february 17 to deliver her son teddy , who was born prematurely , weighing 5lbs 13oz
mr cusick said being told of the diagnosis was the worst moment of his life
he said : ' it was a moment of complete dread and fear when we first heard the word cancer
' nina langley was a lot braver than me at first , i just ca n't imagine losing her as she 's my whole life along with teddy
' the news was all the more devastating given that miss langley 's own father had passed away from cancer in october
now , miss langley is due to start chemotherapy next week , after her body has healed from the emergency caesarean
the couple have decided not to ask doctors what miss langley 's prognosis is , in order to remain positive
mr cusick said : ' we have n't asked about what the future holds for nina langley , we just need to stay positive as possible
mr cusick has been left heartbroken by the news nina langley has cancer
he said : ' i just ca n't imagine losing her as she 's my whole life along with teddy ' a year ago , miss nina langley was diagnosed with ibs , a disease which has many of the same symptoms as bowel cancer
she is pictured with her fiancÃ© on holiday last year ' it 's a petrifying worry for nina langley that she wo n't see our teddy grow up but with the help of specialist treatments and those provided on the nhs we aim to throw everything we 've got at this cancer so we can stay together as a family
' after miss nina langley was incorrectly diagnosed with ibs ( ibs ) , mr cusick hopes her story will be a warning to others with similar symptoms to seek help
she was suffering stomach cramps and going to the toilet more often than usual , which doctors said was due to ibs
but because she was so young , no further tests were carried out
mr cusick said : ' i hope other people read nina langley 's story and seek a second opinion if they feel they have worrying symptoms
' the couple were allowed home on february 22 , two weeks after first going to a&e with possible labour pains
' she is my soul mate , i ca n't believe this has happened , ' mr cusick said of the cancer diagnosis as teddy was born prematurely , he was kept in hospital and fed via a tube , so doctors could monitor his growing , the finally was finally reunited when he came home three days ago
mr cusick said : ' teddy coming home has really lifted nina langley 's spirits , i have n't hardly slept since he has been home but it 's amazing that we are finally all together
' we are supposed to be excited new parents but this joy has been masked by the fear of nina langley 's diagnosis
' nina langley watched her dad die from brain cancer in october and having teddy this year the light at the end of the tunnel , it 's just so cruel and unfair that nina langley has been diagnosed with cancer as she is one of the nicest people you 'll ever meet
' i proposed to her five months ago , she is my soul mate , i just ca n't believe this has happened to us
' desperate not to lose his fiancÃ© , he has began researching specialist treatments online , many only available abroad , which he hopes may prolong her life
he has even begun fundraising money to pay for treatment , if doctors agree they could help beat miss langley 's cancer
he said supportive friends and family have rallied round the couple , pledging thousands of pounds towards the treatments and organising a fundraising events for miss langley 's cancer fight
mr cusick said : ' the support we have received has been fantastic , every little helps and i want nina langley to receive the best possible treatment available so if we need to go half way across the world to get it we will
' ' one of the specialist treatments we are considering is called nano knife which targets tumours faster alongside her chemotherapy , we just need to hit her cancer with everything possible
' losing nina is not an option , i would devote to my whole life to ensure she beat this
