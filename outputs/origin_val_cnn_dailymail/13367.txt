her murder shocked a nation , but according to the slain woman 's father , it also woke turkey up
ozgecan aslan 's body was found last month , burned and abandoned , just days after her family reported her missing
she allegedly fought off a sexual assault before being killed by the driver of a bus she 'd taken to go home
her death sparked widespread protests
" a country woke up , " aslan 's father , mehmet aslan , told cnn in a phone interview
" there was no way for so many people to come together over a single killing
but , i know that my ozgecan aslan was sent for a reason
and as devastating it is , it was her part , her destiny to wake people up
" aslan , 20 , was a first - year university student
" my ozge lived for peace , " her father said
" for peace , love and beauty
she believed in a better tomorrow
" since her death , hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets and online , demanding turkey do more to protect women
they say the problem is cultural ; it 's also criminal
bianet , a turkey group that tracks violence against women , reports that at least 281 women were killed in turkey in 2014 -- up 31 % from the previous year
according to gulbahar , a turkey activist and women 's rights lawyer , laws are irregularly applied
" in a majority of turkey 's female abuse cases , the perpetrators receive mitigations in their sentences due to court 's detection of consent granted by the victim , " gulbahar said
" in some cases , wearing a miniskirt or some cleavage got the woman 's rapist mitigation in his punishment , while in some cases the consent was attached to her wearing red
" it 's unclear what will happen in aslan 's case
three suspects have been arrested in her death , turkey 's semiofficial news agency anadolu has reported
the agency identified the main suspect as 26 - year - old ahmet suphi altindoken and said that he had confessed
aslan reportedly fought him using pepper spray , which had been given to her by her mother
although he is heartbroken and angry , mehmet aslan is n't out for revenge
in fact , his family has received donations from across the country and is planning to use those to set up a rehabilitation center -- not for women who are abused but for men who abuse
" we must surrender to love , " he told cnn
" otherwise , we all lose
" aslan 's murder is similar in many ways to well - known case in india
there , a student was attacked by five men on a public bus in 2012
she was raped and later died from her injuries
like aslan 's murder , her death triggered massive outrage and nationwide protests
and like turkey , india has a serious problem when it comes to women 's rights
out of 142 countries , turkey ranks 125th ( india ranks 114th ) on the world economic forum 's 2014 gender gap index
on sunday , some 3,000 women marched in istanbul to mark international women 's day , anadolu reported
the female - only rally was dedicated in aslan 's memory
" ozgecan 's screams have indeed been heard
maybe not that very instant , but later -- and in millions of hearts , " said mehmet aslan .
