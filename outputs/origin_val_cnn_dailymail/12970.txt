a runway at new york 's laguardia airport reopened friday morning , a day after a delta plane skidded off it before halting near the icy waters of flushing bay
runway 13 remained closed until the plane could be removed and brought into a hangar
it reopened at 10:30 a.m. et friday , according to ron marsico , a spokesman for the port authority and new jersey
the delta plane slid off the runway thursday morning , with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters
delta flight 1086 briefly circled new york due to issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. thursday , passenger faellaci told cnn
almost as soon as it did , those aboard realized something was wrong -- the aircraft 's wheels seemed to have little to no traction , sliding for about 20 seconds
" you did n't feel the wheels take , " faellaci said
then it was a matter of " where we are going to end up , " he said
about 4,500 to 5,000 feet down runway 13 , the md-88 veered to the left and mercifully stopped on a small embankment
a little farther , and the plane -- with 127 passengers and five crew members -- would have been in flushing bay rather than on the airport 's snow - covered ground
contrary to what delta said in a statement , the aircraft 's slides did not deploy , according to port authority executive director foye
still , with help from first responders , everyone was able to get off and onto buses that took them to laguardia airport 's delta terminal
video showed passengers exiting the plane into the subfreezing temperatures as emergency vehicles converged on the area
twenty - four people suffered injuries that were non-life threatening
three of those were transported to nearby hospitals , the new york city fire department tweeted
faellaci said he was thankful for the plane 's crew , first responders and god that it was n't much worse
" it was cause for a moment of prayer and a moment of reflection , as people were scared , " he said
" the pilot did a phenomenal job
" the plane left a relatively balmy atlanta shortly after 9 a.m. laguardia airport was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later
before touching down , the plane 's pilot said weather problems could cause a delay
still , little prepared passengers for what happened
faellaci said he was reminded of the u.s. airways plane that landed in the hudson river in 2009
all 155 people aboard that flight -- heading from laguardia airport to charlotte , north carolina -- famously survived thanks to the skills of pilot chesley " sully " sullenberger
the landing of delta flight 1086 was terrifying for many
" there were people that were calm , there were people that were praying , there were people that obviously were frantic , there were people that were crying , " faellaci said
jihad lateef , another passenger , was traveling with his brother
" when the plane landed it was like me falling off of the top bunk -- did n't really know what was going on -- i just felt a hit , boom , " he told cnn 's " erin burnett outfront
" " i just prayed
" the port authority chief said plows had cleared the runway minutes before flight 1086 touched down and that two other landing pilots had reported " good braking " action on runway 13
still , that does n't mean the pilot did anything wrong
" i think the pilot did everything he could to slow the aircraft down , " foye said
" obviously , the pilot and the co-pilot 's efforts were reflected in the fact there were only minor injuries
" after the plane stopped , emotions ratcheted down some but not entirely
faellaci said there was some " panic and shoving your way to the front " to get off , though " for the most part it was very orderly
" passengers spent a few minutes standing in the snow -- carrying little more than their wallets and phones -- before buses took them into the warmth and comfort of the terminal
four minutes after the plane landed , all of laguardia airport shut down to air traffic
one of its two runways -- the one not involved in the incident -- reopened a few hours later
