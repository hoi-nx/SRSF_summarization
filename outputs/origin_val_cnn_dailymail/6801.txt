what next for chicharito ? unwanted by manchester united last summer , real madrid softened the blow by bringing the mexican to the bernabeu in an unlikely move that raised eyebrows across the football world
could the spain giants see something that david moyes , who had no appetite for little pea , could not ? apparently not
chicharito has n't been able to make the most of his loan spell at real madrid chicharito has scored three times in 13 league appearances , coming off the bench on 12 occasions the 26 - year - old was back in the goals for mexico during their 1 - 0 victory against ecuador on saturday chicharito has started just one league match for carlo ancelotti 's side this season and on monday night told fox sports that he , like fellow old trafford outcast falcao , had cried at his situation
still only 26 , chicharito is set to return to manchester following the expiration of his year - long loan where he will face an uncertain future
the striker 's contract with manchester united expires in 2016 and the club will no doubt be looking to cash in
chicharito made the revelation while on international duty
' i 've cried , ' he said
chicharito is set to return to manchester following the expiration of his year - long loan in real madrid ' i 've been through everything
the feeling i have most of all over the last couple of years is one of frustration
' he added : ' you feel frustrated when you 're part of a team , you do everything you can in training , collaborating and helping , then at the weekend the opportunities to play are minimal

' chicharito joined manchester united from guadalajara in 2010
he made 154 appearances in four years at the club , scoring 59 goals and rapidly became a cult hero among fans
but after falling out of favour under david moyes , he moved on when louis van gaal arrived
things have not gone any better in spain , where chicharito has scored three times in 13 league appearances , coming off the bench on 12 occasions
while suffering under david moyes the player 's agent , eduardo hernandez , claimed that six clubs were interested in securing his services , including one global superpower

will he get another chance at old trafford ? that is unclear
while chicharito 's cause will no doubt have been helped by a poor season from falcao , van gaal is understood to have lined up replacements and is set for another big - spending summer
eduardo , if he has not already , might want to start ringing around those other six clubs
