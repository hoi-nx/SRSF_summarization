marijuana is much stronger than it was three decades ago , experts have warned
scientists found cannabis smoked today has tripled in strength since the 1980s
marijuana now contains increasingly high concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) , the psychoactive compound which gives the ' high '
but concentrations of cannabidiol ( cbd ) , a lesser known compound that is being investigated for its medical proponents , but does not create a ' high ' , has gone down
samples also contained contaminants including bacteria , fungi , butane and heavy metals , scientists found
presenting his preliminary findings at the 249th national meeting & exposition of the acs ( acs ) , he found that marijuana has tripled in strength in the last 30 years
he said : ' we 've seen a big increase in marijuana potency compared to where it was 20 or 30 years ago
' i would say the average potency of marijuana has probably increased by a factor of three
' the average potencies of the samples he analysed was 20 per cent thc , but he saw values close to 30 per cent , which he described as'huge '
he explained that 30 years ago , thc levels in marijuana were well below 10 per cent
the thc content of cannabis has tripled in some strains because producers have been cross-breeding them over the years as users demand stronger drugs , he said
he added that an unexpected consequence of the breeding was that many of the samples his lab tested contained little to no cbd
researchers are currently investigating cbd as a treatment for schizophrenia , huntington 's disease and alzheimer 's disease , as well as anxiety and depression
but unlike thc , cbd does n't get provide the same ' high ' , which is why it could be considered in treatments for children
extra potent : concentrations of marijuana 's active ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) ( pictured ) have increased from less than 10 per cent in samples from the 1980s to up to 30 per cent in samples tested today dr lafrate said he was shocked by the levels of contaminants in samples of marijuana producers had voluntarily sent to the lab for testing
he said : ' one thing that 's been surprising is the level of microbial contamination in marijuana
' ' many of the samples were covered in fungi or bacterial contaminants
' others had butane , which are used to create marijuana extracts , and others had heavy metals
' this is n't necessarily a cause for alarm , but it could spark discussions on what are safe levels of contaminants
dr lafrate said : ' it 's a natural product
there 's going to be microbial growth on it no matter what you do
' so the questions become : what 's a safe threshold ? and which contaminants do we need to be concerned about ? '
