cahill wants to prove a point to his critics after coming under fire for some poor performances at the heart of chelsea 's defence
england centre back cahill was widely praised for his water - tight partnership with terry last season , and in the early stages of the current campaign , but his ability has been called into question with a few poor performances of late
cahill was poor for chelsea in the new year 's day 5 - 3 defeat by tottenham at white hart lane and he allowed raheem sterling to run unchecked for liverpool 's goal in the capital one cup semi-final first leg at anfield
cahill wants to prove his doubters wrong by finding his best form again in chelsea 's defence cahill started and helped chelsea keep a clean sheet in sunday 's capital one cup final win over tottenham but having contributed to keeping harry kane quiet and ensuring chelsea kept a clean sheet to win the cup at wembley on sunday , cahill wants to show his worth all over again
' i have proved it time and time again
i proved it when i was at bolton and i got the england call - up
i was told " you ca n't play for england , you 're at bolton " , ' cahill said
' i proved them wrong
i came to chelsea and it was " oh , you ca n't play champions league , you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that " and i proved them wrong

but now the 29 - year - old wants to use his time back in the first team to help chelsea to glory in the barclays premier league and champions league
' it 's that fire in your belly , ' he said
' although you 'd wish not to have it , dealing with criticism is probably what has got me to where i am today
i will come out the other end without a shadow like you see today

certainly since i have been at the club we have been fortunate enough to have positive results against tottenham
' it was said before sunday 's game that that result would have no reflection on the final and so it proved
i use it as motivation to prove people wrong time and time again
' you are not a robot
up until the halfway point in the season it was no problem â but i have come through it time and time again
it 's not the first time i 've had have a dip in levels of performance
