among the stream of letdowns to flow from england âs cricket world cup perhaps the most poignant poured from the lips of eoin morgan on sunday
eoin morgan is the most inventive england batsman of his generation , and that includes kevin pietersen
he is resolutely his own man â a dubliner who crossed the irish sea , an advocate of the ipl in a country which often disdains it , and a thoughtful presence around the traps , alert with a hint of aloof
but the system can drag down the best
and so , reflecting on the horrific nine - wicket loss to sri lanka in wellington after england had scored 309 for 6 , eoin morgan sought comfort in stats
england captain eoin morgan found solace in statistics following the heavy defeat by sri lanka first this : â we were 25 above par , and the stats backed that up
par here is about 275 - 280
â then this : â we bowled a lot of bad balls
over the next couple of days we âll get the hawk-eye stuff , and the proof will be in that
â stats have always been a hallmark of peter moores âs england
famously , he introduced andy flower to moneyball , michael lewis âs classic account of sabermetrics ( the statistical analysis of baseball ) ; infamously , he allowed stats to encourage the selection of darren pattinson against south africa in 2008
stats work â and they do nât
at their best , they confirm hunches
at their worst , they become a usefully faceless scapegoat : do nât blame us , we were only following the stats ! we exaggerate , but not by much
what , after all , is the relevance of stats when the change in fielding restrictions has made 300 the norm ? and why defer to hawk-eye when naked-eye told you england bowled like drains ? buttler needs to be cut loose at the top of the batting order when the situation merits his promotion ballance ( left ) is suffering from poor form and england 's insistence on using him as a no 3 the system is nât working
if it were working â or even close to working â england would not have lost to australia by 111 runs , to new zealand with more than 37 overs to spare , and to sri lanka by nine wickets while defending over 300
the associate nations are making a better fist of things
so if not the system , then what ? poor morgan , by nature a free spirit , has inherited a job weighed down by english caution
roundheads are better at test ; cavaliers prefer one - dayers
and england are playing a form of 50 - over cricket more suited to oliver cromwell and 1645
conservatism continues to bedevil them
when buttler hit the fastest one - day hundred by an england batsman , against sri lanka at lord âs , alastair cook told us he was nât ready for test
alex hales has not been trusted in the one - day side , despite producing the innings of the world twenty20 last march
taylor has been shunted to no 6 , after prospering at no 3
the free - hitting alex hales has not been trusted to form a regular part of their 50 - over batting order taylor leaps to take a catch against sri lanka - and his position in the order has also dived to no 6 england have inverted one of the first rules of international sport , which is to do what the opposition least wants you to do
after moeen ali and bell put on 172 in 30 overs against scotland , in came ballance , a talented batsman whose confidence is being undermined by being asked to slot straight into a demanding role on the biggest stage of all
why not buttler , armed with a licence to do something violent ? instead , ballance scratched around for 10 in 18 balls , england slowed down , and a near - certain score of 350 - plus became 303 for 8
beggars with terrible net run - rates can not be choosers
the total proved well beyond scotland â but , funnily enough , not beyond sri lanka , whose 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ( dilshan , sangakkara , jayawardene , mathews ) is as classy as anything in the tournament
yet , after moeen ali and bell had again provided a useful platform ( 62 in nine overs ) , england proceeded to potter around before the final assault , safe in the knowledge that the 300 was â 25 above par â
for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on twitter : @ the_topspin the lunacy is that , for perhaps the first time ever , this england team contains batsmen capable of casting off the straitjacket : moeen ali , taylor , eoin morgan and buttler
and if ab de villiers had played the lofted reverse - sweep for six produced by root during a thisara perera over costing 25 , we âd never have heard the end of it
there is talent in that dressing - room
there will be more to come : look at sam billings , jason roy and james vince
but it is weighed down by the notion that one - day teams can rationalise their way to victory
here , england seemed to have borrowed not so much from moneyball as from annie hall
in one scene from woody allen âs film a movie producer is overheard at a party : â right now it âs only a notion , but i think i can get the money to make it into a concept and later turn it into an idea
â england coach peter moores has been left to reflect on an embarrassing start to the cricket world cup peter moores is a fan of moneyball ( left ) but his regime has more in common with annie hall england seem to believe that stats will ease them all the way through from notion to concept to idea to â¦ cricket world cup success ! this may work in test cricket
it sure as hell does nât work in the 50 - over game
it may be too late to salvage anything from the wreckage of this tournament
but if england accept that stats - driven prudence is no way to win one - day internationals , they can yet challenge for the 2019 world cup
that was the week that was new - ball nightmare england âs over-planned batting is only part of their problem
after the weekend matches , they had claimed only 22 wickets in four games , a lower ratio than anyone except zimbabwe and the uae
and they had leaked 6.33 an over , more than anyone except west indies
the point has been made that england âs battery of right - arm seamers have become distinguishable only by height and hair colour
but it would nât matter if their two biggest guns â james anderson and stuart broad , with over 1,000 international wickets between them â were at their best
instead , they are suffering almost identical nightmares : both have two wickets and have gone at 6.27 an over , with james anderson averaging 91 to stuart broad âs 92
during england âs tour of sri lanka , it was regularly assumed the attack would be stronger for their return from injury
we âll keep holding our breath
the bowling of stuart broad ( left ) and james anderson ( right ) has been smashed at the cricket world cup so far shifting the goalposts there âs nothing like a ( nother ) cricket world cup fiasco to skew the debate
but : kevin pietersen or not kevin pietersen ? â that is the question
once this cricket world cup is over , it âs all about test cricket : 17 matches in 10 months , including yet another ashes
yet the test line - up looks settled , apart from an opening slot , where kevin pietersen would nât bat anyway
which of ballance , root , bell or moeen ali are you going to drop ? and if kevin pietersen is to be brought back for the one - day team , you âd have to ask a fresh batch of questions about how seriously england are about winning the 2019 world cup : kevin pietersen will turn 39 that june
no - one can doubt his brilliance at the height of his one - day international career
but he drifted away from the 50 - over format in his final year as an england player , and did nât do especially well when he was picked
yes , he âd put bums on seats and get people talking about cricket
but let âs not pretend he âd be the saviour of the english game
kevin pietersen ( right ) has had the door opened on a potential return to the england set - up someone else âs problem ms dhoni earned a few pats on the back for saying , after india had thrashed the uae , that the associate nations needed more exposure at the highest level
but the devil was in the detail : that exposure , ms dhoni intimated , could not come against india , who already have their hands full
and there âs the rub
the big boys profess their support in theory , but with one crucial caveat : not on my patch
cricket âs closed shop remains open all hours
ms dhoni insists the associate nations should get more game time ... so long as it 's not against india
