' alex cole-swann was first diagnosed with cervical cancer last april
she underwent intensive courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy
but she was told three weeks ago by doctors at weston park hospital in sheffield , where she was treated , that there is nothing more they can do
determined not to just give in , alex cole-swann researched alternative treatments to help battle the cruel disease
her quest took her to london 's harley street where she saw a leading cancer specialist professor
he told her about a treatment which is being used in the united states known as l1 immunotherapy
it helps a person 's body fight cancer cells by recognising those cells as impostors
however , it is n't available on the nhs and costs Â£ 25,000 per session
alex cole-swann will need 10 to 12 sessions
the treatment is alex cole-swann 's only hope to win the battle which has left her exhausted , confused and unable to sit and play with her young daughter willow mae initially the council information officer was given the good news that the company developing the treatment are looking for patients to try it on britain - and they were willing to treat them for free
but then came a cruel twist
because alex cole-swann had a tube inserted directly into her kidneys as part of a previous course of treatment , she was deemed not suitable for the trial
it was then that the family decided the only course of action open to them was to pay
so they launched quest for life appeal in a desperate attempt to save alex cole-swann 's life
the treatment is alex cole-swann 's only hope to win the battle which has left her exhausted , confused and unable to sit and play with her young daughter
her husband , nathan , 25 , a self - employed plumber said : ' it has been the worst year of our lives
' it 's been an awful emotional roller coaster as we have watched alex cole-swann fight this cruel and horrible disease
' six months after alex cole-swann was initially diagnosed , she was given the all clear
nathan said : ' we were so pleased â we could n't have wished for anything more
it was like all our christmas 's had come at once
' but very quickly we knew something was n't right
alex cole-swann was still in a lot of pain
she told her doctors and they carried out more tests
initially they all came back clear and doctors thought the pain may have been caused by the radiotherapy
' alex cole-swann , with nathan and willow mae above , says : ' i desperately want to watch alex cole-swann ride her first bike , take her to school on her first day , make all her birthday cakes , so i have to do everything i can to make that possible

nathan said : ' alex cole-swann had been in a lot of pain and she knew in her heart of hearts something was very wrong
initially tests came back clear , but earlier this month we were given the devastating blow that the cancer was back
' only this time it was more aggressive and we were given the horrendous news that there was nothing more the doctors could do
' we were all absolutely heartbroken
all she has ever wanted was to be a mum and watch our little girl grow up
' like any parents she wants to be there for our daughter and see those very special days
' alex cole-swann said : ' i desperately want to watch alex cole-swann ride her first bike , take her to school on her first day , make all her birthday cakes , so i have to do everything i can to make that possible

an emotional alex cole-swann , who says she is in constant excruciating pain , said she is desperate to live if only for willow 's sake
but sometimes the pain is so intense she feels she just ca n't face life as it is
she adds : ' the pain is so bad that there is n't a minute that goes by when i do n't feel in excruciating agony
' it is only through the help of her friends and family that she is able to carry on
she said : ' people i havenÂ¹t seen or spoken to for years have been in touch and iâ¹m overwhelmed by their support
it really does keep me going
' everyone is doing so much but i feel so low and in so much pain i ca n't do anything , i ca n't even walk further than a few yards
' there are times when i feel like pulling the duvet up over my head and just giving in
but then i think about willow , how much i love her , and how much she needs her mummy
' i have to fight this for her sake
i need to be here when she comes home from her first day at school to feel me about her day
i ca n't leave her so young and miss out on so much of her life
i have to keep fighting and do everything i can to battle this horrible illness
