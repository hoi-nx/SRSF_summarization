she is rarely pictured without a beaming smile on her face as she goes about her royal duties
but yesterday the kate was showing the strain of keeping up with her busy schedule at almost eight months pregnant
she looked pale and tired , with fine lines on her forehead , as she left an exclusive london hotel , and , unusually , failed to offer onlookers even the briefest of grins
nevertheless kate , 33 , still showed off her impeccable style in a floral print dress , matched with navy alexander mcqueen court shoes and an understated Â£ 255 russell & bromley muse suede clutch
we were n't expecting to see the kate today but here she is looking fresh as a daisy in a lovely floral print frock as she stepped out of the goring hotel
this spring - ready dress is by erdem and is from the london based designer 's resort 2013 collection
so not only is kate rocking one of the coolest high end labels around but she 's still wearing regular fitting clothes , despite being seven months pregnant
how does she do it ? with fans in alexa chung , kate bosworth and keira knightley , erdem is now a regular feature on the red carpet and kate 's look today confirms just how into fashion she is
styled with her favorite navy blue suede alexander mcqueen heels and a clutch by stuart weitzman , she 's the picture of elegance
and what you ca n't see is that the dress has a cute cut out at the back

getting bigger : the duchess , who is now seven months pregnant and is due to give birth in april , showed off a noticeably bigger bump no coat : the duchess was without a coat and chose to brave the cold in nothing more than her patterned silk dress other royals to love the london hotel include the queen mother who apparently considered it her favourite and used the goring , which first opened its doors in 1910 , as the venue for her last public appearance in 2002
today 's visit to the goring hotel was the kate ' first public outing in two weeks , with her last official visit coming when she travelled to the potteries in stoke-on-trent to tour the emma bridgewater factory
during that trip , during which she wore a seraphine dress , a sportmax coat and her trademark Â£ 395 jimmy choo satin shoes , the kate tried her hand at making plates and was declared a natural by local potters
she also used the occasion to visit the action for children cape hill children 's centre in smethwick , where she joined a group of youngsters who were trying their hand at crafts courtesy of a couple of old tin cans and some colourful feathers
the duchess , an art fan herself , promptly rolled up her sleeves and got stuck in before declaring , as she made her way back to her waiting car : ' prince george would have loved this ! ' prince george 's father , the cambridge , is currently touring china and spent his second evening in the country making a speech in shanghai , following a historic meeting with china 's president xi jinping in beijing

despite prince philip writing off beijing as ' ghastly ' during his 1986 royal tour of china , president xi jinping as also extended an open invitation to the queen and her family , which , according to commentators , could pave the way for a visit by the heir to the throne
afterwards , the cambridge was driven to the forbidden city , an imperial palace that was used by both ming and qing dynasties and takes up more than 180 acres of central beijing
a unesco world heritage site , construction on the palace complex began in 1406 and it later became home to 25 different emperors as well as the spot where the last emperor of china , puyi , abdicated in 1912

' ' it is a platform not only for our famed and still thriving creative sectors , such as film , art and media , ' he continued
' but it is also a platform for the creativity and inventiveness that britain firms apply in a wide variety of sectors , like healthcare and education
' the cambridge also took the opportunity thank president xi jinping for his ' warm welcome ' and put his knowledge of mandarin to use , opening the speech with ' nushimen , xianshengmen , wan shang hao ' which translates as ' ladies and gentlemen , good evening '

' but less than 24 hours into my first visit , i have a strong sense of the opportunity that exists for collaboration and partnership between our two countries
