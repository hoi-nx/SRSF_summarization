victoria police have been criticised for a ' blaming the victim ' mentality and bad timing after posting a warning about taking extra safety measures in parks late at night , in the wake of the brutal murder of teenager masa vukotic
sean price , has been charged with stabbing masa vukotic to death in a park in melbourne on tuesday evening
victoria police homicide chief michael hughes told abc radio on friday : â i suggest to people , particularly females , they should nât be alone in parks
we just need to be a little bit more careful a little bit more security conscious
â the service posted on its facebook advice to people to try to stay safe that included warnings to stay in well - lit areas if travelling through parks ' late at night
' victoria 's minister for women and the prevention of family violence , fiona richardson , led the criticism of hughe 's comments
she said he ' undoubtedly has the best interest of women in mind and made comments on radio this morning out of care and concern for women , who are all too often victims of crime
' ' however , hearing a senior police officer say that , as a woman you are not safe going about your leisure activities or daily business , is a sad indictment on our society
' the community conversation needs to be about stopping men from committing these terrible crimes in the first place , not just about women need to protect themselves
' community members were quick to point out that masa vukotic was killed at 7pm on tuesday evening
meanwhile , devastated friends of masa vukotic , who was stabbed to death while exercising in a park , have vowed to wear pink in her honour
friends of murdered schoolgirl masa vukotic have paid tribute to their ' beautiful princess marci ' on facebook and organised a picnic memorial in a park for the â beautiful , loving , sweet , smart , charismatic and hilarious young woman with a bright future ahead of her â
on thursday , as 31 - year - old man sean price was charged with masa vukotic 's brutal murder , victoria police homicide chief michael hughes told abc radio : â i suggest to people , particularly females , they should nât be alone in parks
â i âm sorry to say that is the case
we just need to be a little bit more careful a little bit more security conscious
â â the safety of all members of our community is a priority to victoria police
we ask that everyone , male or female , take a common sense approach to their safety , â the police facebook post said
â if you âre walking through a park late at night , stay close to well lit areas or walk with friends where possible
do nât shut yourself off to the world , keep one ear free when listening to music and keep your valuables secure
we simply ask that everyone stay alert and stay safe
â facebook user pete bannan replied : â it 's purely sad that people innocently walking need to be reminded of this
â angel egginton said : â this is all well and good but someone was attacked in doncaster in broad daylight ... it does n't matter anymore we are nât safe anywhere
â carla regan responded : â i have a 6 year old daughter and it scares the hell out of me that one day i will have to let her take on this world alone
this poor girl was going about her daily exercise and was murdered in cold blood , it makes me cry
â victoria police posted a warning on their facebook page which asked people to try and not be alone in a park at night ' everyone who met you loved you marci , you 're gone but will never be forgotten , ' one of her friends wrote on facebook masa vukotic , 17 , was murdered about 7pm on tuesday while she was walking on a footpath near her doncaster home - in melbourne 's east
pink flowers and a pink rabbit were left at the scene erin manderson said : â i understand the common sense safety message , but the timing of this message is wrong
it validates the victim blaming mentality that so many people already have
thousands of people walk or run day and night with earphones in and should be able to continue to do so without fearing that the person jogging behind them is going to stab them
love and strength to her family and friends
â and jade eastwood blasted : â i 'm sorry but i hardly consider 7pm late at night ! â ms vukotic was murdered just five minutes from her doncaster home in melbourne 's east on tuesday
