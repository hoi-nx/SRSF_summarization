drivers are to get ten minutes extra time after a parking ticket runs out before they can be hit with a fine
under a change in the law to take effect within weeks , they will have the right to a â grace period â in all on - street or off - street council parking places
for decades , drivers have complained of returning to their cars moments after a ticket expires to find a prowling warden has already hit them with a penalty
the new rules will apply to cars parked in a pay - and - display bays or other spaces with time limits
other new measures include a right for residents and local firms to demand that their council reviews parking in their area , including charges and use of yellow lines
cctv camera cars that automatically issue parking fines are to be made illegal , except near schools , in bus lanes and on red routes
broader guidance will also be issued , saying that councils can not use parking to make a profit
writing for mailonline , government and communities secretary eric pickles and transport secretary patrick mcloughlin said â war on the motorist must end â
the ministers said in a joint statement : â local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area , including charges and the use of yellow lines
parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued
â we are bringing back common sense
â very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from ten minute â grace periods â for council - controlled parking , whether it âs on or off - street , paid or free
it means you wo nât get fined for being a few minutes late
we âre also ending the industrial use of cctv spy cars to enforce on - street parking
â local government and communities secretary eric pickles ( left ) and transport secretary patrick mcloughlin ( right ) have vowed to end the ' war on the motorist ' with their new ' common sense ' approach a new deregulation bill , due to pass through the house of lords next week and come into force next month , will enforce the ban on cctv being used to issue automated fines , except in high - risk areas
the department for communities and local government is tabling a separate parliamentary motion introducing ten - minute grace periods , which will come into effect later this month
the new rules are aimed at curbing draconian parking fines used by town halls to raise extra cash from motorists
without reform , the amount of money collected in parking charges and fines will soon hit Â£ 650million a year
critics say concerns about parking fines are prompting many motorists to shun high streets for out - of - town complexes
the government is also promising new restrictions against heavy - handed action by bailiffs chasing fines , and clearer rules to prevent penalties being issued at out - of - order parking meters when there is no alternative way to pay
councils have also been to volunteer to trial a scheme that allows motorists challenging a parking ticket to benefit from a 25 per cent discount on the fine if they lose the appeal
currently , drivers are only offered a discount on early payment before challenging a ticket
mr eric pickles added : â we are ending the war on drivers who simply want to go about their daily business
for too long parking rules have made law - abiding motorists feel like criminals , and caused enormous damage to shops and businesses
the new rules will apply to cars parked in a pay - and - display bays or free spaces with time limits ( file picture ) ' over-zealous parking enforcement undermines our town centres and costs councils more in the long term
our measures not only bring big benefits for high streets , motorists and local authorities - they put common sense back into parking
' mr patrick mcloughlin said : â helping local businesses thrive is a key part of our long term economic plan
these measures will deliver a fairer deal for motorists and help boost the high street by ensuring that parking enforcement is proportionate
â local residents or firms will also be allowed to raise a petition that will require a council review of the use of yellow lines and unfair parking charges
a minimum of 50 council taxpayers â signatures or at least ten per cent of the residents or businesses in the affected local areas will be required
mr eric pickles and mr patrick mcloughlin claimed the last labour government had made life â unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring â
â we âre ending this pointless war on motorists so that you do nât feel like a criminal just for parking your car , â they added
by eric pickles and patrick mcloughlin controversial cctv camera cars that automatically issue fines are to be made illegal too , the minister have said in the history of human invention , there âs nothing that matches the car
we rely on them every day
to do our jobs , drop the kids off at school , or take an elderly relative shopping
cars mean freedom and independence , and most importantly of all , convenience
but years of crazy parking rules have made many law - abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals , and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses
we all know the story
you return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen
or maybe you run a local shop , and customers have dried up because what you sell costs less than the parking fee
in 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end
that meant not only changing the rules , but changing attitudes , because under the previous government councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny , treating them like cash machines on wheels
this included spying on and filming drivers going about their daily lives
where if you made a mistake it would mean an expensive bill in the post
if you protested it could mean a doubling of the original fine , or an angry bailiff knocking on your door
and all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by parliament
residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence
these rules have now been changed during this parliament
local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area , including charges and the use of yellow lines
parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued
we are bringing back common sense
very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute â grace periods â for council - controlled parking , whether it âs on or off - street , paid or free
it means you wo nât get fined for being a few minutes late
we âre also ending the industrial use of cctv â spy cars â to enforce on - street parking
the new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post , but ensure public safety as cctv will still be used to protect schools , bus lanes and red routes
why have we done this ? because we want see fairness and balance restored to the system
as a result it will no longer possible to use parking to generate profit and we âre cracking down on the use of aggressive bailiffs
and in another victory for common sense parking at an out - of - order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay
there are also occasions where shoppers and drivers receive a fine and appeal because they genuinely believe they âve done nothing wrong
we âll be trialling a new system so if this happens to you , you âll receive a 25 % discount even if the appeal is lost
these changes are great news for drivers but they are good news for town centres and business too
people supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce
under the previous administration life became unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring
we âre ending this pointless war on motorists so that you do nât feel like a criminal just for parking your car .
