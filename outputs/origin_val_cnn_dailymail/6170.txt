the west brom midfielder has his eyes on his side âs first european championship finals appearance but belfast has not always been a happy hunting ground of late
â our home form was nât great in the last campaign , â chris brunt admitted
chris brunt is keen to turn windsor park into a fortress to help northern ireland qualify for euro 2016 â we have started this campaign well with two away wins , but the home win over the faroes was also an important result
â to build on that would be great
â in the last few years , those games were the ones that have tended to let us down
hopefully we can take that on and carry it on in our remaining four home games and we âll have a great chance of qualifying
â the west brom star is hoping to lead his country into euro 2016 and they currently lie second in the qualifiers
