amazon and caffeine powder distributors did n't provide proper warnings about the supplement 's dangers , resulting in the death of an ohio high school student last year , the teen 's father said in a lawsuit filed friday
logan stiner , 18 , was just days from graduating high school in northeast ohio when , on may 27 , his brother found him unresponsive in the family 's home in lagrange , southwest of cleveland
a coroner ruled that logan stiner died of cardiac arrhythmia and seizure due to acute caffeine toxicity
the amount of caffeine in his system was about 23 times greater than the level in a typical soda or coffee drinker
the lawsuit names as defendants a classmate who gave logan stiner the caffeine powder ; amazon , which shipped it to the woman last march ; and six arizona - based companies that the father 's attorney said packaged and sold the pharmaceutical - grade powder under the name hard rhino
the lawyer , balser , said friday that the arizona companies appear to be related
an amazon spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit
messages left with the arizona companies were not returned
there is no number listed for the former classmate
balser said that after the death of a college student in georgia in june and a consumer warning from the fda , hard rhino stopped selling caffeine powder on amazon
balser said , however , that he ordered powdered caffeine from another company off the internet two weeks ago
' it 's still out there , ' he said
the lawsuit focuses on the hard rhino package label
popular : logan stiner was just days away from graduating from high school when he overdosed on caffeine the lawsuit says the package informed users that a cup of coffee contains about 1/32nd of a teaspoon of caffeine
the package label also warned that the powder ' can be dangerous if abused , ' and ' failure to follow safety guidelines can result in serious injury or death , ' the lawsuit said
the lawsuit claims that the label lacked specific instructions on proper use
' the difference between life and death is a pinch and a smidgen , ' balser said
hard rhino sold the powder as a dietary supplement , which allows the company to bypass fda regulations , balser said
the attorney said amazon has a team of compliance specialists that is supposed to review products before they are allowed to be sold through the site
the lawsuit seeks damages of more than $ 25,000
denis and katie stiner have previously urged federal regulators to ban the sale of such substances
' before may 27 , 2014 , we had never heard of " caffeine powder
" now we think about it every day , ' the stiners said in a statement in december .
