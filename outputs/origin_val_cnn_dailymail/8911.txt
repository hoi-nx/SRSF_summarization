ronaldinho 's verdict : ' he was one of the best defenders in european cup history , but what was so impressive about him is that when he was on the ball he did nât look like a defender , but like an elegant midfield player
' paolo maldini ( right ) holds the record for appearances in uefa club competitions and is an ac milan legend roberto carlos like cafu , a marauding defender who brought the art of brazilian flair to defending
claimed three european cup titles with real madrid ( 1998 , 2000 , 2002 ) and was a true galactico at the bernabeu
netting three goals in 161 european outings , roberto carlos also had a ferocious left foot

so important to all of real madrid âs european cup wins
' ronaldinho taps brazil team - mate roberto carlos on the head during a training session in 2006 the real madrid left back was known for his attacking prowess , as well as his fierce left - footed free kicks midfield claude makelele his exploits with real madrid and chelsea saw a holding midfield role named after him , so claude makelele ought to have claimed more than the one european cup final success ( 2002 )

i am sure they would not have let him go , at that time he was one of the greats in europe
his goal record from midfield was what really impressed me

ronaldinho 's verdict : ' things did not work out for kaka as well as expected at real madrid , but we must not forget the player at ac milan who was the real kaka

ronaldinho 's verdict : ' i have won everything , it is impossible for me to have regrets
i do wish though that i could have played with messi for longer than i did at barca
there are no words to describe him ; he just has magic in his feet
' messi has won it all in europe - three european cup winners ' medals and three balon d'ors messi usurped ronaldinho at barca but he holds no grudges toward his former team - mate henry combined grace and speed with a sublime eye for goal , and came so close to european cup glory with arsenal in 2006
