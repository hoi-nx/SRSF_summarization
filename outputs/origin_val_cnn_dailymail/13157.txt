before he was jihadi john , he was little jihadi john -- a young version of the same emwazi who authorities say later became the english - speaking face of isis terror
his earlier , innocent image can be seen in video obtained from british 's channel 4
it shows a teenage boy in the schoolyard of a west london secondary school
he walks through a sea of fellow students in his zippered sweatshirt over his polo shirt , wearing a backpack and carrying a plastic bottle
at one point , a basketball rolls toward him and he returns it with a deft kick
he looks playful at times as when he skips and lightheartedly pushes two other boys , more serious in others
in other words , he appears to be not much different than any other teenager
the boy in the video is emwazi , his former headmaster at quintin kynaston community academy told cnn
who emwazi used to be shuter noted that her former student could be shy at times , but overall he was far from a troublemaker and not much out of the ordinary
" he was bullied a little bit , because he was quiet and reserved , " shuter said
" generally , he was fine
there ( were ) no issues with him
" emwazi became even more focused in his last few years at quintin kynaston community academy , she said
" he was working hard , he achieved great grades for him , and he went to the university of his choice , " shuter told cnn this week , referring to west london 's westminster university , from which emwazi graduated in 2009
contrast that perception with that of the masked , deep - voiced , british - accented man who months ago was dubbed jihadi john
there is nothing shy , nothing gentle , nothing playful about him
he starred in grisly isis videos depicting the beheading of hostages , punctuating his horrific actions with taunts at the u.s.
a man who says he is emwazi 's father told the kuwaiti newspaper al qabas that " there is nothing that proves " the man known as jihadi john is his son , mohammed
his kuwaiti - based lawyer , salem al-hashash , told cnn that the family plans to sue anyone who makes the connection , calling the father jassem emwazi a " victim of libel
" yet western authorities have made just such a link
they say that the kuwaiti - born emwazi went from being a typical " boy next door " type growing up in west london to being one of the most high - profile recruits of isis , the islamist extremist group behind a campaign of terror and conquest in syria and iraq
more than a dozen british administrative court documents obtained by cnn indicate that , as far back as 2009 , british security services believed emwazi was part of a radical west london recruitment network for terrorist groups in east africa
and in late february , two u.s. officials and two u.s. congressional sources confirmed reports in british and other media that emwazi went on to join isis and is the man known as jihadi john .
