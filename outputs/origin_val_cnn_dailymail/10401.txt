a 19 - year - old man has been indicted on murder and other charges in the shooting death of a las vegas mother of four in a neighborhood gunbattle
the indictment filed friday accuses defendant nowsch of murder , attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle
the shooting was initially characterized as road rage but was later found to involve more complex relationships
her husband , meyers , says she took their daughter home after a late - night driving lesson and fetched her 22 - year - old son with his gun to find a driver who frightened her earlier
the 19 - year - old 's defense team hope the request to the coroner 's office will be able to determine whether meyers , 44 , or somebody next to her fired a gun before she died police say the son fired several shots at nowsch during the fatal shootout in a cul - de - sac outside the meyers home
the 44 - year - old meyers was wounded in the head february 12 and died two days later
nowsch was arrested on february 19
nowsch 's defense team said in court today they are trying to obtain surveillance video from johnson junior high school , where meyers was allegedly teaching her daughter to parallel park the night before the shooting
they also want police to turn over radio recordings from the night of the shooting and the day of nowach 's arrest , reported las vegas review journal
the 19 - year - old is being held without bail
he is due back in court march 12
many questions remain after conflicting accounts from authorities and meyers ' family about what initially was characterized as a road rage attack
following nowsch 's arrest late last month , his lawyers said he was high on marijuana while he was being questioned , and police knew it
he surrendered to the authorities after a stand - off in suburban las vegas
claus said he plans to argue in court that anything nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial
it 's not clear what nowsch told detectives after his arrest
' people tend to say things that are n't entirely credible when they 're under the influence , ' he told the associated press
attorney claus said ' not only ' did the police let nowsch smoke , they ' watched him do it ' as they tried ' to talk him down ' during a standoff that involved a helicopter and a swat team
last week , claus said he may consider using a fractured skull nowsch suffered as an infant at the hands of his abuse father in his defense
clark county district attorney steve wolfson will consider nowsch 's childhood injury while deciding whether to seek the death penalty against him
nowsch has been accused of shooting 44 - year - old tammy meyers dead during an act of road rage
it has since been revealed that the meyers family knew the suspect the meyers family initially claimed that meyers had gotten into an argument with nowsch while giving her daughter a driving lesson on the night of the february 12 shooting
they said nowsch followed them home and shot at them
it has since emerged that meyers went home and recruited her son brandon , who brought his gun
meyers was shot in the head and died after two days on life - support
claus said he believes nowsch will be able to claim self - defense because brandon meyers was armed
last month , it was revealed that the meyers family actually knew nowsch .
