the egg is best served warm so the chocolate melts with the chilli - flavoured pork but the madcap meat - sellers are not resting on their laurels , and are working on a smaller version using a mini egg
mr foston said : ' we 've got another idea - mini egg sausages
pork sausage with whole mini eggs - the little ones coated in sugar
' that would work well , i think , with plain sausage meat , and letting the chocolate melt inside the sugar casings of the egg , ' he continued
he said a cracked black pepper and strawberry sausage produced to mark wimbledon was also a great success
if you do n't have the time to make chocolate from scratch , you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs
once your chocolate is melted , it will need to be tempered
the cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along , just pop your chocolate into the freezer ( no longer than 30 seconds )
place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it
keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process
stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature
bittersweet / dark chocolate should reach a temperature of 28c-29c ; milk chocolate should reach 27c-28c ; and white or coloured chocolate should reach 26c-27c
once the first batch has melted , add more chocolate to your bowl , stirring as you go along
as soon as the correct temperature is reached , start building your easter egg layers
spoon some chocolate into a mould ( you can get them from lakeland , denny craft moulds or party delights ) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould
you can make it as thick as you like , building each layer as the previous one cools
once the final layer has been built , leave aside to cool and harden before decorating .
