opinion has swung to the left since the last election â but ed miliband lacks the credentials to take advantage of it , a major report revealed yesterday
five years of austerity have pushed the mood further from the right on issues such as public spending , europe , welfare and business , it showed
political attitudes have now returned to the same point as 2005 when tony blair secured the last of his three election wins for labour
but the party still ' struggles to attract support ' despite the shift in the public mood , according to detailed analysis of the latest british social attitudes survey
the report shows labour 's problems may be the result of a poor reputation for economic competence and leadership and the tory 's ability to portray itself as moderate it shows that labour 's problems may be the result of a poor reputation for economic competence and leadership and the tory 's ability to portray itself as moderate , said the report
the shift to the left could also help explain the rise of the greens and snp in scotland , it added
veteran pollster peter kellner said : ' ed miliband loses more from a perception that he is not up to the job than he gains from being seen as closer to the centre ground
' the report 's author , dr john , said the change in attitudes presented a potential danger for the tory if it campaigns hard on issues like benefits and spending cuts
he said : ' the general leftward shift that has taken place since the last general election suggests that arguments about the need to shrink the state , reduce waste and cut income taxes will have less traction than in 2010

they feed into a wider study which has tracked political attitudes since the mid- 1960s
dr john said the trend since 2010 was typical of that seen in the past â with public opinion moving in the opposite direction to the government of the day
he said : ' beginning in 1964 , the average left - right position generally tracked rightwards until 1980 , the year after margaret thatcher came to power
' the public then gradually moved left during the 1980s and remained there for the duration of the [ john ] major premiership
' the mood shifted rightwards from 1997 under labour and then left under the coalition
consequently , governing parties that achieve their party 's preferred policies cut the electoral ground from beneath their own feet â a tory government that reduces spending and taxes reduces concerns about waste and regulation , while a labour government that increases resources to the nhs and education reduces concerns about public services
' six weeks ago labour vowed not to carry out a negative election campaign
yesterday it unveiled its first poster accusing the tories of stripping the nhs to the bone
a tory spokesman described it as â fear and smear â tactics
