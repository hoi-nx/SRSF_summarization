finland authorities take a very dim view of speeding , as they showed when they fined one driver a staggering Â£ 40,000 for going just 14mph over the limit
the colossal sum was demanded because in finland , fines for speeding are scaled up according to the wealth of the law - breaker â and this one , businessman kuisla , is a multi-millionaire
after he was caught travelling at 64mph in a 50mph zone , the authorities took a peek at his tax return
kuisla posted a picture of his speeding ticket on his facebook page , complaining that the finland authorities were making life for the rich difficult it showed that he earned 6.5m euros ( Â£ 4.72m ) a year , so they dished out a 54,000 euro fine , the iltalehti newspaper reported
the fine has a logic to it , but mr kuisla complained bitterly on his facebook page about the sum he was asked to hand over
he posted a picture of the ticket and said : â finland is impossible to live in for certain kinds of people who have high incomes and wealth
i âm considering leaving the country
â however , sympathy levels in finland for his plight have been fairly low
one user wrote on the iltalehti website : â he should stop complaining and hang his head in shame instead
