scientists have raised concerns about a large , rapidly thinning glacier in east antarctica , warning it could contribute significantly to rising sea levels
they say they 've discovered two openings that could channel warm seawater to the base of the huge totten glacier and bring the threat of potentially disastrous melting
the glacier is bigger and thinning faster than all the others in east antarctica
it contains enough ice to raise the global sea level by at least 11 feet ( 3.4 meters ) , according to researchers from the university of texas who were among the authors of a new study published this week in the journal nature geoscience
scientists had previously detected warm water on the seaward side of the glacier
but until now , they had found no evidence that it could threaten coastal ice
" we now know there are avenues for the warmest waters in east antarctica to access the most sensitive areas of totten glacier , " said greenbaum , a university of texas ph.d. candidate and the lead author of the study
the two gateways on the seafloor that lead to the base of the glacier offer an explanation for why totten glacier has been melting so fast
scientists have already warned about the consequences of melting ice in west antarctica
nasa said last year that glacial retreat in some areas " appears unstoppable
" the increase in sea levels that would be caused by the melting of all the ice in totten glacier is estimated to be roughly equivalent to the contribution from a collapse of the entire west antarctic ice sheet
the united nations ' report on climate change last year estimated sea levels could rise between 1 foot and 3 feet by 2100
such a rise could displace tens of millions of people from coastal areas around the world
but that calculation does n't factor in the latest research on east antarctica
" while the totten melt may take several centuries , once change has begun our analysis reveals it would likely be irreversible , " greenbaum said in comments cited by the australian antarctic division
to prevent the process from becoming unstoppable , atmospheric and oceanic conditions would need to change so that snowfall outpaces coastal melting , the researchers said
the scientists gathered their data through a series of aerial surveys using technology that can scan the ice and seafloors in areas that are inaccessible to icebreakers
the team included researchers from the united states , australia and the united kingdom .
