" we do n't know much about the flight and the crash yet , " germany chancellor merkel said

germanwings started in 2002 and was taken over by lufthansa seven years later as its low - cost airline , handling an increasing number of midrange flights around europe
it was forced to cancel some flights tuesday because there were crews that did n't want to fly upon hearing news of the crash
the valley where the plane went down is long and snow - covered , and access is difficult , said the mayor of the nearby town of barcelonnette , pierre martin-charpenel
it was well populated in the 19th century but there are almost no people living there now , he said
it 's an out - of - the - way place with magnificent scenery , he said
the sports hall of a local school has been freed up to take in bodies of the victims of the plane crash , said sandrine julien from the town hall of seyne - les - alpes village
seyne - les - alpes is about 10 kilometers from the crash site
mountain guide yvan theaudin told bfmtv the crash was in the area of the massif des trois eveches , where there are peaks of nearly 3,000 meters ( 1.9 miles )
it 's very snowy in the area and the weather is worsening , he said , which could complicate search and rescue efforts
responders may have to use skis to reach the crash site on the ground , he said
sandrine boisse , president of the tourism office at the pra loup ski resort , said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened
" it was about 11 ( a.m. ) here
i was outside the garage , and we heard a strange noise , and at first we thought it was an avalanche , " she said
... we did n't know what
" a mountain guide who heard a plane fly at alarmingly low altitude shortly before the crash , michel suhubiette , said helicopters may be the only way to get to the crash site
according to the u.s. federal aviation administration , just under 16 % of aviation accidents occur during the cruise portion of a flight -- meaning after the climb and before descent
accidents are more common during takeoff and landing
the twin - engine airbus a320s , which entered service in 1988 , is generally considered among the most reliable aircraft , aviation analyst david soucie said
the captain of the crashed plane had flown for germanwings for more than 10 years , and had more than 6,000 flight hours on this model of airbus
the plane itself dates to 1991 and was last checked in dusseldorf on monday , according to winkelmann
so what happened ? cnn aviation analyst schiavo said the plane 's speed is one clue
according to germanwings , the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , and then dropped for eight minutes
the plane lost contact with french radar at a height of approximately 6,000 feet
this could indicate that there was not a stall , but that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent , schiavo said
had there been an engine stall , the plane would have crashed in a matter of minutes , she said
that small piece of information about the descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing , or that the plane was gliding with the pilot 's guidance , schiavo said
a scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains , she said
the crash spurred officials in several countries to offer their condolences and pledge solidarity and cooperation to help those affected and determine what happened
" our thoughts and our prayers are with our friends in europe , especially the people of germany and spain , following the terrible airplane crash in france , " u.s. president barack obama told reporters
" it 's particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children , some of them infants
" germany 's merkel said she was sending two ministers to france on tuesday and would travel to the crash site on wednesday to see it for herself
" we have to think of the victims and their families and their friends , " she said
germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the germany government had set up a crisis center in response to the " terrible news " and was in close contact with the french authorities
" in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with those who have to fear that their close ones are among the passengers and crew , " he said
