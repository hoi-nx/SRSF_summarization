a swarm of insects tends to startle us -- chaotic yet organized , fascinating and beautiful
take it one step further
instead of bees hovering around a tree , imagine cheese balls
solo cups in the place of birds , glow sticks as locusts
what seems like a figment of a wild imagination becomes reality in thomas jackson 's " emergent behavior " series
thomas jackson grew up in rhode island and worked in publishing in new york for 13 years , ultimately landing his dream gig as an editor with forbes magazine
but somewhere along the way , he picked up a camera
he found photography " effortlessly fulfilling " compared to the frequent challenges of writing
so he dove in , lens first
after a charming series featuring a robot , he struck a cadence in creating " swarms " with inanimate objects such as post-it notes and plastic plates
" i started creating these whimsical , fantastic scenarios in which the environment is exploiting us , " thomas jackson explained
that 's what initially catches the eye -- the uncanny
the bizarre gathering in the behavior of insects or birds , made up of something that should n't be there
at first , he relied on digital enhancements to polish his illusions
but as the series evolved , he relied less on editing and more on the installations themselves
more than half of thomas jackson 's " emergent behavior " series is digitally untouched
how thomas jackson gets a tubful of cheese balls to hang purposefully around the trunk of a tree seems nonsensical
he only hints at the mechanics
it 's just " wires , " he said , casually , not revealing enough evidence to ruin the magic
social media follow @ cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography
" but if you look close enough , it will reveal all of its secrets
" he spends about a day building the installations , and he usually shoots his photos at dusk
the photo of the pink solo cups was shot against mountainous terrain in wyoming
the cups , already at odds with nature , look as though they are a flock of birds flying along the rocks
thomas jackson seemingly casts a magic spell of manic movement , creating what an internet commentator calls " a frat party being sucked into a black hole
" the idea of a swarm -- be it insects or " thank you " bags -- fascinates thomas jackson
they are disconcerting and familiar at once , creating a conundrum that warrants a closer look
" maybe because they fly in the face of how we see the world , " he said
thomas jackson is a photographer based in brooklyn , new york
