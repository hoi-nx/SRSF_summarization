truly , it is a terrifying development
the great religious fissure between sunni and shia muslims that dominates the middle east has erupted into open conflict in yemen , the region âs poorest country , threatening to engulf the entire area in a wider war
in a dramatic escalation of the stakes , a sunni coalition of arab states led by saudi launched airstrikes against iran - backed shia houthi rebels who have swept south through the country
as yemen veered towards political disintegration , the conflict exploded into a region - wide crisis that could have far - reaching and unpredictable international consequences
but the far more pressing concern is whether we are now seeing a proxy war in yemen between its neighbour saudi , the leading sunni power , and iran , the leading shia houthi power , explode into a regional conflict that could sweep us all up in its wake
saudi warplanes targeted shia houthi positions in the country âs capital sanaâa killing 18 civilians and injuring many more
britain and america supported the saudi - led military intervention in yemen as the coalition deployed 100 fighter jets and amassed 150,000 soldiers to fight in the region
another nine sunni states joined the offensive , including the united arab emirates , kuwait and qatar , pledging to send aircraft to bomb targets , with egypt deploying ships
anticipating the worsening situation , britain elite soldiers â in yemen to train government troops to fight al qaeda , which has established its most dangerous branch in the country â pulled out last friday
this followed a decision by the u
s. to evacuate their remaining military personnel as the country teetered on the brink of civil war between the internationally recognised government of president hadi and the shia houthi rebels
as western forces left , the rebels â trained , armed and funded by iran â made further advances in the south of the country
the yemen president , who is backed by the u.n. , was forced to flee his palace in the former britain colonial port of aden on the southern coast and there were reports last night that he had left by boat for the saudi capital , riyadh
this week , aden â once one of the british empire âs most important ports for ships heading to imperial india , and a haven of stability patrolled by officers in pith helmets and colonial shorts â was raked with the sound of gunfire
just 35 miles to the north , shia houthi rebels had seized al anad air base , which until recently had been used by america counter-terrorism forces to fight terrorists
yemen sits on the extreme end of the arabian peninsula , with saudi to the north â where the 150,000 saudi troops are now amassing on its border
an armed member of shia houthi militia stands over the rubble of houses which were allegedly destroyed by a saudi air strike in sana'a , yemen a fierce , tribal society , yemen has long been torn apart by tribal conflicts
governing the country has been compared with dancing on the heads of snakes
the houthis â who belong to a relatively obscure branch of shia muslims â were largely confined to the north of the country and were contained by the country âs longtime president , ali abdullah saleh , a wily arab strongman , until he was overthrown in the course of the arab spring in 2011
president hadi , his weaker successor , never managed to reassert central control , and in september the houthis took control of the capital sanaâa
in the vacuum created by president hadi âs weak leadership , iran saw the opportunity to taunt its old rival by backing the houthis and establishing its influence in the saudi â backyard
but the recent shia houthi advances have proved too much for saudi , whose primary aim is to re-establish order in yemen
it amassed a formidable coalition â egypt , jordan , sudan , morocco , pakistan , united arab emirates , qatar , kuwait and egypt â of sunni - led states and sent in its fighter jets to send a powerful message to iran : stop meddling in arab affairs
the saudi also regard iran âs influence in yemen as evidence of a much larger drive by iran for regional dominance
they claim that iran is using armed proxies to take over other states
nothing happens in lebanon , for instance , without the approval of the iranian - backed shia houthi militia hizbollah , which also provides syria âs beleaguered president assad with his light infantry
shia houthi fighters manning a heavy machine gun fixed on the back of a pick - up guard a rally protesting saudi - led airstrikes for its part , iran has condemned the air strikes
foreign ministry spokeswoman marzieh afkham said the country â considers this action a dangerous step â , adding that military action would complicate and worsen the crisis in yemen
â this invasion will bear no result but expansion of terrorism and extremism throughout the whole region , â she said
and the truth is that she may well be right
yemen has a chronic terrorism problem , simply because such a failed state is an ideal operating ground for terrorists
yemen is not only home to the most tactically lethal branch of al qaeda but now isis has a foothold there too
on march 20 four isis suicide bombers killed 137 shia houthi outside their mosques in sanaâa
before the america military moved out of the country , they were allowed to launch drone strikes on al qaeda
but now , in their absence , terrorists are no longer being targeted so effectively , and will only flourish as a result
to make matters still more precarious for the west in its fight against terror , iran and the shia houthi militias it backs are proving an increasingly vital component of the ground war against isis in iraq , with iranian commanders directing them and supplying them too
this means the west is walking on diplomatic eggshells
what if iran took over much of iraq , whose government and population is largely shia houthi as well ? would the saudi stand for that ? and if a shia houthi government succeeds in yemen , then would nât saudi âs own downtrodden shia houthi population , some 10 - 15 per cent of them in the kingdom âs oil - rich eastern province , want some independence ? the western response to this chaos is understandably hesitant
washington is unsure whether iranian strategy is really to establish proxy shia houthi governments all over the region or simply to use the shia houthi in yemen to taunt saudi and pacify the country âs own hardliners
we now have a bizarre â and potentially very dangerous â situation in which america warplanes are providing air cover for iranian - backed militias in iraq in a joint effort against isis , while 1,200 miles to the south in yemen , the america are helping saudi pilots bomb shia houthi insurgents supported by iran
so the america is bombing iran âs enemies in one country , while helping to bomb its allies in another
on top of all this , america and iranian diplomats are resuming their talks about how to restrain tehran âs nuclear programme
such is the chaotic and complex nature of affairs in the middle east
and as the saudi pledge to resolve their own local difficulty , we can only hold our breath .
