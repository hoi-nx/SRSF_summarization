as the second republic of ireland training session of the week wound down on tuesday , a number of giddy international footballers lined up at the edge of the penalty box for a bit of shooting practice
robbie brady , showing no ill - effects from the thigh injury which had threatened his involvement , made a beeline for the head of the queue , while wes hoolahan , jonathan walters , shane long , anthony stokes , stephen quinn and kevin doyle all waited their turn to receive a pass from steve guppy and fire a volley at one of the four goalkeepers in the squad
taking his place at the end of the line was new boy arter
arter celebrates his goal against middlesbrough during bournemouth 's 3 - 0 victory on saturday the 25 - year - old has bided his time to reach this juncture in his career , so he could wait another few moments to take on shay given between the sticks
up he stepped and , with his new teammates watching on , the bournemouth star found the net
it was greeted with roars of delight and the shots kept coming
arter may have been happy to take his place at the back of the queue but he will put his best foot forward to earn a place in o'neill 's plans for poland on sunday
' i 've been picked because the manager was impressed with the way i play and if i come here and i 'm not confident , then i wo n't show the best of my ability , ' explained arter
' so be yourself , that 's what you 're picked for
' it was a little bit nerve - wrecking meeting the lads for the first time but i 've settled in really quick and they made me feel welcome

he is n't a total outsider , though
the english - born midfielder , whose grandparents hail from sligo , represented ireland at under 17 and u19 level and always pined for the green jersey over the three lions , despite advances from england to join their underage set - up when he was a promising academy player at charlton
' i chose my country then and that was to stay with republic of ireland
they gave me the opportunity to play at international level at 15 and i was really thankful for that
i learned a lot from that experience and from then on i was always going to stick with republic of ireland
' on his last appearance for the u19s in 2007 , he was sent off against portugal , and his club career also took a nose dive when he was released by charlton and dropped out of the football league to rebuild his confidence with woking
' playing international football was out of the question
in my head , it was n't even something i spoke about , ' arter , who has a solid sounding board in brother - in - law and former england international scott parker , remembered

' arter 's experience of life in the doldrums has helped shape his current outlook on the game and fighting his way back from obscurity means he is now relishing rather than fearing the next stage in his career
' there are probably loads of players who go to non-league and end up staying there
' it 's easy , when you 're down at that level , to blame other things or point the finger at other people as to why you are there , but there 's a reason for it , you have failed at the level you were at and you have to prove yourself again
' one thing i felt i had to do was work hard , and i am doing that now , working hard to try and achieve my goals
the key to success is working hard
' ' james mccarthy is a top player and he 's at the level that i want to eventually get to , ' he continued
' these players have earned the right to play in the premier league and have the international experience which i have n't had yet
