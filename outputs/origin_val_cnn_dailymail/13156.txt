the campaign to retake the city of tikrit from isis , also known as the islamic state , involves a curious mixture of iraq forces -- the army and air force , federal police , powerful shiite militia as well as sunni tribal fighters
it 's a cast of about 30,000 fighters with an opaque command structure
and that makes it tough to be precise about numbers -- but by several estimates only one - third of those fighters are from the regular army
a cnn team that 's seen the offensive at close quarters noted that iraq army commanders appeared to be taking a subordinate role to leaders of the shiite militia , notably hadi al ameri , leader of the badr organization
iran military advisers are on hand , and highly influential on the battlefield
as isis fighters in the area probably number in the low thousands , it might seem odd that the iraq army is unable to take them on alone
after all , the security forces ( security forces ) received $ 20 billion of u.s. money between 2005 and 2012 -- for equipment , bases and training
so just why are the security forces incapable of reclaiming territory seized by isis ? and how long will it be before they can stand on their own feet ? the answers go back to the u.s. invasion of iraq in 2003 ; iraq 's military is starting over -- for the second or third time in a decade
one of the most controversial acts of the u.s. - led coalition provisional authority , which ran iraq following the ouster of saddam hussein , was to disband the iraq army
the decision , taken in may 2003 , " immediately created a large pool of unemployed and armed men who felt humiliated and hostile to the u.s. occupiers , " as james p. pfiffner put it in 2010
president george w. bush told his biographer robert draper in 2006 : " the policy had been to keep the [ iraq ] army intact ; did n't happen
" the reasons have been disputed ever since
in some places there were riots among demobilized soldiers ; at the same time training of iraq police was a desperately slow process because of the rapidly growing insurgency
in 2004 , as in 2014 , the security forces buckled as a sunni insurgency spread through northern and western iraq
billions of dollars were spent creating a new iraq army from scratch
but it took two years to build a force of just 40,000 men in three light infantry divisions , so unofficial sectarian militia filled the vacuum -- militia that never quite went away
over a seven - year period , more than $ 4 billion was spent on renovating and building iraq bases
logistical and maintenance support : $ 2.6 billion
supply of equipment : $ 3.4 billion ( in addition to what the iraq bought themselves
) training and staffing the iraq police : a cool $ 9.4 billion
with u.s. assistance and the " sons of iraq " program to coax sunni tribes into fighting al qaeda in iraq , violence did diminish in 2009 and 2010
but once u.s. forces left at the end of 2011 , and with them intelligence - gathering and training programs , things began to unravel
by then , the iraq security forces in their many guises had become an unwieldy machine that was more a welfare program than a fighting force -- providing wages to soldiers who lacked motivation and were frequently absent from duty
the only effective units were special forces such as the golden division
sophisticated u.s. equipment , such as m-1 abrams battle tanks , was not maintained
corruption was rife -- and political interference in the military grew exponentially
as then prime minister al-maliki tightened his grip on power between 2006 and 2013 , the high command of the iraq military became a political football -- with loyalty to al-maliki prized above competence
he bypassed the defense and interior ministries and used elite units to pursue political enemies
the institute for the study of war reported in 2013 , " the lack of oversight on military appointments has allowed al-maliki to choose his preferred officers ( nearly all shiite ) to head the most significant command positions in iraq
" al-maliki also began integrating shiite militia into army units
at the same time , the phenomenon of " ghost soldiers " went unchecked -- men who were either dead or awol but whose wages were still being paid , often to corrupt commanders
so the army , in numbers , looked much stronger than it was
in fact , by the time isis rolled south , the effective fighting force was less than a quarter of its peak strength of 400,000
nearly half the army -- four divisions -- collapsed in short order as isis fighters stormed south from syria in the early summer of 2014
isis used speed , discipline and ruthlessness in equal measure -- attributes the iraq army did n't have
it had also cultivated allies among members of sunni tribes ready to act as a fifth column , and its fearsome reputation for wholesale executions of prisoners led many soldiers to strip off their uniforms and flee
the desperate situation in the summer of 2014 and an imminent threat to shiite shrines in samarra prompted a rapid mobilization of shiite militia that had already been active around the elections -- including the badr organization and the asaib ahl al-haq
some members of these militia had gained combat experience fighting for the al-assad regime in syria
in june , the most respected religious authority among iraqi shi'ites , grand ayatollah ali al-sistani , appealed to iraq to mobilize against the enemy
the call was directed at and answered by hundreds of thousands of shiite , determined to protect gains made since the overthrow of saddam hussein 's baathist regime
the militia -- called al hashed al shabi or pmu ( pmu ) -- were trained , equipped and most importantly led by iran military advisers and quickly became battle hardened
what they lacked in military skills , they made up for in determination
the iran have invested heavily in the pmus
the commander of iran 's revolutionary guards quds force , gen. suleimani , seems to have spent more time in iraq than iran since last summer and has been photographed around tikrit
according to several analysts , it is suleimani that has been organizing and directing the shiite militia in what appears to have been a more deliberate and better planned assault than previous operations
harmer of the institute for the study of war says the role of both the iran and the shiite militia are evidence of the enduring weakness of the security forces
and he says that " if the tikrit operation is successful it presents a lot of problems for the iraq government 's legitimacy -- somewhere down the road the iran and the pmu are going to demand payback
" the role of suleimani and al quds -- a foreign terrorist organization in washington 's view -- means that u.s. airpower has not been made available
" the u.s. may not like iran influence in iraq , " says harmer , " but what it absolutely can not do is provide direct support to an iran - led military operation
" the chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff , gen. dempsey , alluded to the dilemma when in baghdad on monday
" what i 'm trying to sort out , actually , is the degree to which their near - term embrace of the assistance they 're receiving from iran is a reaction to the existential threat [ posed by isis ] , or whether it is something longer - term , " he said
soon after taking office , iraq prime minister al abadi fired 26 commanders and pushed 10 others into retirement
at the time a statement on his website stressed " the need to restore confidence in the security forces through real action and by combating corruption at the individual and institutional levels
" u.s. - led efforts to train a new iraq army designed to defeat isis are well underway
the aim is to stand up 12 brigades each of about 5,000 troops -- including three brigades of kurdish peshmerga
these should be ready for operations by the end of this year ; the first brigade has already completed basic training
but as harmer notes , " the security forces are yet to go head - to - head with isis and win without help from the pmus
isis is demonstrably more capable than the security forces
" isis from well - entrenched defenses around mosul , iraq 's second largest city , seems well beyond the army 's capability
in november , gen. dempsey said that roughly 80,000 effective troops would be needed in any attempt to win the city
that 's problematic for several reasons
kurdish officials told cnn last month that the longer the battle for mosul is delayed , the tougher it will be
they claim that they can not maintain the siege of the city on three sides indefinitely
the iraq government is under political pressure to reclaim the city and re-establish its authority there
but above all , the need for shiite militia outside the direct control of the government to help retake largely sunni cities is fraught with peril
hrw has already cataloged incidents of sectarian retaliation against sunni communities by the militia
tikrit is an especially sensitive area : in june last year , isis massacred by its own account as many as 1,600 air force cadets , the vast majority shiite , at camp speicher
some families of the murdered recruits , and a few survivors , have claimed local sunni tribes may have helped isis or even handed over the recruits after promising them safe passage
hrw middle east deputy director joe stork says that " past fighting raises grave concerns that tikrit 's civilians are at serious risk from both isis and government forces , and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter
" tit - for - tat atrocities are fuelled by a stream of social media videos showing abuses committed by all sides
isis ' use of children : propaganda and military training during the tikrit operation , both prime minister al abadi and hadi al ameri of the badr organization have publicly called for civilians to be spared and human rights to be respected
only when the city is taken , will we know whether their appeals were heeded
harmer says he believes a majority of iraq want to see their country survive ; far fewer want a return to sectarian conflict akin to civil war
but it remains a possibility
one of the greatest challenges -- politically -- will be to absorb the shiite militia and sunni tribal brigades into the security forces , rather than have them operate as independent armies
they are meant to constitute a new national guard , but the mechanics and timing remain problematic
the leaders of these militia have tasted power ; their men have shed blood
they are not going to just hand over the reins -- even if and when isis are beaten
and they wo n't have to fear a strong army for a long time to come
