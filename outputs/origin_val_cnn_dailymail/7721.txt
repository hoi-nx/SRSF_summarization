he said the boy was trying to act out what he had become obsessed with from watching pornography , which was to grab her bottom , but as he started acting out his fantasy it escalated
mr hylton quail described the teenager as a ' silly young boy ' whose parents had since stopped him from accessing the internet on his own at night
prosecutor genevieve cleary said the attack was premeditated but unsophisticated because the teenager was wearing his school uniform and could be easily identified
