warning : glyphosate is most commonly used in the popular weedkiller roundup a weedkiller used in millions of gardens has been identified as a potential cancer risk
the world health organisation âs cancer agency asked a group of 17 international scientists to decide whether glyphosate posed a risk to humans
the iarc ( iarc ) declared that the chemical , which is the world âs most widely used weedkiller , is a â probable human carcinogen â
glyphosate is most commonly used in the popular weedkiller roundup , which is made by the american agro-chemical giant monsanto
the firm â which strongly disputes the iarc âs findings â sells the herbicide to farmers in the american , where crops can be genetically modified to give them immunity to glyphosate
american gm plants like maize and soya beans can then be blanket - sprayed with roundup to get rid of weeds without killing the crop
use of the chemical has soared in the past decade , and it has been found in water and food on the shelves in the uk , including bread and cereal bars
the iarc report points out that 750 products contain glyphosate , and its use has increased sharply with the development of gm glyphosate - resistant crop varieties
the research looked at evidence from studies published in the american , canada , and sweden since 2001
it concluded that there was evidence that glyphosate can cause tumours in mice and rats in laboratory experiments â and could cause dna damage to human cells
iarc panel chairman blair , from american âs national cancer institute , said : â there was sufficient evidence in animals , limited evidence in humans and strong supporting evidence showing dna mutations and damaged chromosomes
â dr blair said concern is growing about glyphosate
but he pointed out that the iarc panel did not prove that glyphosate definitely caused cancer
he went on to say : â we have looked at , â is there evidence that glyphosate causes cancer ? â and the answer is â probably â
that is different to â yes â
â monsanto has issued a fierce defence of roundup , accusing the iarc group of relying on â junk science â and calling for the report to be retracted
the firm âs head of global regulatory affairs philip miller pointed to a four - year evaluation of glyphosate which was carried out for the eu by the german government , and concluded that the chemical was â unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk in humans â
american plants like maize ( pictured ) and soya beans can be genetically modified to give them immunity to glyphosate
they can then be blanket - sprayed with roundup to get rid of weeds without killing the crop he added : â unfortunately this review does not meet the standards used by respected agencies around the world
â some academic experts were also critical of the findings
dr oliver jones , from rmit university , said : â this sounds scary and iarc evaluations are usually very good , but to me the evidence appears a bit thin
â the warning has triggered calls for food watchdogs in the eu to investigate whether they will now need to impose controls on glyphosate
andreas kortenkamp , a professor of human toxicology at london âs brunel university , said : â eu authorities must now consider whether measures are sufficient to protect consumers and pesticide applicators from cancer risks
â home gardeners especially should exercise the utmost care when they use weedkillers that contain glyphosate
