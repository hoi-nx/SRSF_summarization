with their silver hair and kind smiles , smith , sheila henderson and senior look like three normal grandmothers , enjoying a quiet drink and a chat
but their innocent looks bely a wilder reality and when the trio , who are aged between 61 and 64 , travel abroad on one of their regular grannies â trips , all thoughts of a quiet life are left behind
instead of enjoying quiet days out with their grandchildren , fancy dress , colourful cocktails and spain party spots are the order of the day for the three barnsley pensioners
now the trio are to appear on a new documentary called oaps behaving badly , a channel 5 series that follows the nation âs craziest pensioners
the trio 's party plans swung into action as soon as they retired , with smith and sheila henderson joining june in tenerife for a huge party to mark her retirement
the riotous trip to the spain holiday island included nights out wearing comedy wigs and boobs , plastic penis noses , and flirtations with much younger male holidaymakers
innocent : june , seen here in an everyday ensemble , likes to zip between bars on her mobility scooter getting ready : although the trio like to go out in barnsley , they save their biggest parties for holidays unusual look : smith ( far right ) says she wore a prostitute 's outfit for her son 's 40th birthday party ' on holiday no man is ever safe because i can guarantee i always feel somebody âs bottom or something else , ' explained smith , a grandmother of three
; my behaviour is a bit erotic sometimes
if i âve had a drink especially
' but husband tony , 67 , does nât mind being left behind or his wife âs flirty behaviour and indulges in several solo weeks in spain himself
according to smith , â what happens in tenerife , stay in tenerife â , with all three ladies happy to make the most of their time abroad
' when i went to tenerife for my son âs 40th i got dressed up as a hooker , ' reveals smith , admitting she got into trouble with a local woman , who thought she was a rival escort invading her patch
leading the charge : smith is the ringleader and says ' no man is safe ' when she is out and about propping up the bar : the trio have long been fans of wild all - night parties apologies : june says the trio often have to apologise when they return to bars following a booze - fuelled night just as excitable is june who rides a mobility scooter as a result of having had 10 leg operations
not that she has any plans to slow down
' when she gets on that scooter , you âve got to watch out because you âre never safe , ' says smith
' she can be a tearaway when she gets speeding on that scooter
' but despite her tearaway nickname , june says smith is the wildest of the group
' once we âve been somewhere , we âre never forgotten
' we go back for the second time and we have to apologise for what smith âs done the first time
