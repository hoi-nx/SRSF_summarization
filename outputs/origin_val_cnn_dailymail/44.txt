the clasico will never be quite the same after sunday night
amid the flying challenges , the overload of passions , the bickering and the bad blood one man has kept his head while all those around him have been losing theirs â xavi
but after 750 games for barcelona it looks almost certain that after what will be his final barcelona vs real madrid on sunday the world cup winner and brain of the greatest barcelona in history will confirm he is off at the end of the season to play in qatar
xavi has a contract until 2016 but could now play for al-sadd next season instead of the club he grew up supporting as a boy
the al-sadd offer includes a coaching role at qatar âs aspire academy with the aim of playing a part in bringing through a bright generation of qatar internationals
xavi is approaching the end of his contract at barcelona and will consider his future at the end of the season the 34 - year - old midfielder has been offered a coaching role with qatar 's aspire academy however , newly formed mls side new york city fc have also expressed an interest in signing the player the football world has always speculated over how good xavi would be as a coach and these could be his first steps in finding out
the director of the aspire academy is former spain goalkeeper roberto olabe and xavi , who has experience in organizing training camps in spain , would work alongside him as well as continuing with his playing career
he also has an offer from manchester city 's new york city franchise on the table and looks set to announce his decision after the sunday 's game
if xavi plays a part in sunday âs showdown it will be his 29th clasico
he has 12 wins , seven draws and nine defeats in that time scoring four goals
he pulled the strings in midfield when barcelona regularly got the better of real madrid both before and after the arrival of mourinho
he played in perhaps the greatest clasico for barcleona when they beat real madrid 6 - 2 at the santiago bernabeu in 2008
and he was the epicenter of another devastating barcelona display two years later when mourinho lost his first barcelona v real madrid 5 - 0 at the nou camp
it was during the mourinho era that tensions between the two clubs really came to a head and as the captain and long time friend of real madrid keeper casillas the two came together in reconciliation after a phone call from the goalkeeper to the midfielder that was not well received by mourinho
xavi celebrates after scoring one of his four career clasico goals against at the nou camp in 2010 xavi 's barcelona team - mates swamp the passing maestro after his goal against real madrid it was a lofted goal over casillas 's head in a clasico in 2004 that was perhaps xavi âs best individual moment from all his meetings with real madrid
that game was also his now boss luis enrique âs last clasico
he was brought on in the second half at the bernabeu with real madrid leading 1 - 0 and it was xavi âs goal that won it for barcelona four minutes from time from a move that he had started by playing a pass to ronaldinho
when the brazilian clipped it over the top of real madrid âs defence xavi finished past his pal and barcelona took the spoils
regardless of who wins on sunday , football will lose because , with an estimated television audience of 400m xavi âs poise and perfect passing will be seen in the clasico for the last time .
