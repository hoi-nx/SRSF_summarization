moscow russia was ready to put its nuclear forces on alert over the crisis in crimea last year , such was the threat to russia people there , president putin said in a documentary that aired on state tv on sunday night
asked if russia was prepared to bring its nuclear weapons into play , putin said : " we were ready to do it
i talked with colleagues and told them that this ( crimea ) is our historic territory , russia people live there , they are in danger , we can not leave them
" it was n't us who committed a coup , it was the nationalists and people with extreme beliefs
" but this was the worst - case scenario , he added , in the documentary broadcast on state - run channel rossiya one
" i do n't think this was actually anyone 's wish -- to turn it into a world conflict
" it was n't known when the interview was originally taped
it aired even as speculation mounted about putin 's health , following an absence of several days from the public stage
he reappeared in public monday
russia formally annexed ukraine 's crimea last march , after ukraine 's pro-moscow president yanukovych was ousted following street protests that turned bloody
russia called his ouster a coup by radical ukraine nationalists
before crimea was formally absorbed by russia , unidentified armed men had taken control of its administrative buildings and key military sites
a referendum was held on march 16 , 2014 -- a year ago to the day -- on secession from ukraine
ukraine officials at the time denied there was any threat to russia citizens in crimea
on monday , russia 's defense minister shoigu said putin had ordered russia 's northern fleet and other military units to be placed on full combat alert for snap checks , state media reported
" the main aim ... is to evaluate the capabilities of the northern fleet to fulfill tasks on ensuring russia 's military security in the arctic , " shoigu is quoted as saying by russia 's tass news agency
the exercise will involve 38,000 military personnel , 41 warships , 15 submarines and 110 planes and helicopters , shoigu said , according to tass
in the documentary , titled " crimea : way back home , " putin said moscow had had no choice but to act
" crimea is n't just any territory for us , it is historically russia territory , " he said
crimea , a black sea peninsula that has been part of ukraine since 1954 , has a majority russia population and strong cultural and historical ties to russia
it is also home to russia 's black sea fleet , at the sevastopol naval base
but putin said he had never thought of " dismembering " the peninsula from ukraine until yanukovych 's ouster
" we can not leave this area and the people who live there to whims of fate , to let the people of crimea be thrown under the wheels of this nationalist bulldozer , " he said
" i set certain tasks
i did say what and how we should do , but immediately stressed that we would do so only if we are absolutely convinced that the people who live in the crimea want it
" the vast majority of people who voted in the referendum approved secession from ukraine
but the vote , staged while armed men controlled the region , was dismissed as illegal by ukraine 's then - interim government in kiev , the european union and the american
the west responded with financial sanctions against selected russia figures and crimea secessionist leaders
german chancellor merkel , meeting with ukraine president petro poroshenko in berlin on monday , reiterated that europeans does not consider russia 's annexation of crimea to be legal
" it is important that we work for a peaceful solution , and we will not give up before the full sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine has been restored , " she said
" this not only includes crimea but also now in our daily work the areas around luhansk and donetsk
" unrest broke out in ukraine 's eastern donetsk and luhansk regions following russia 's absorbing of crimea
a fragile truce is currently in place but the conflict between pro-russia separatists and ukraine forces there has claimed thousands of lives
merkel warned that the european union was ready to impose more sanctions if necessary against russia interests to help ensure that a peace plan hammered out in minsk , belarus , last month is fully implemented
putin told the documentary - makers he was certain the american was behind the ouster of yanukovych , which moscow views as an illegal armed coup
" formally , the opposition was primarily supported by europeans , but we knew very well ... that the real puppeteers were our american partners and friends
it was them who helped prepare nationalists ( and ) combat troops , " he said
he also said that sanctions should have been imposed against those who orchestrated what he called a coup , rather than those involved in crimea 's annexation
putin insisted in remarks to reporters last month that there was no chance crimea would be returned to ukraine
and it appears russia is taking no chances
in the documentary , putin said russia 's bastion high - precision coastal missile defense systems had been deployed to crimea to protect the territory -- " in such a way that they were seen perfectly well from outer space
" this can only be done following a decision by the supreme commander in chief , he said
" so , at a certain point , we deployed these coastal systems bastion to make it clear that crimea was under safe protection , " he added
