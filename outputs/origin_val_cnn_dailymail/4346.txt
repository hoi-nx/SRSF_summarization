pilot cocheret wrote at the beginning of the year about his fear of being locked out of the cockpit after visiting the aircraft 's toilet a dutch pilot ' predicted ' the germanwings crash several weeks ago in an article written in a specialist flight magazine posing the question : ' i seriously wonder who 's sitting next to me
' chillingly cocheret , who flies a boeing 777 for emirates airlines warned : ' i hope i never find myself in the situation where i go to the toilet and return to find a cockpit door that wo n't open
' mr cocheret was writing for dutch flying magazine piloot en vliegtuig ( cocheret and plane ) where he expressed his fears
his article warned that someone could use the security procedures introduced in the aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities to prevent an aircraft 's captain re-entering the flight deck after a rest break
french prosecutors have determined that andreas lubitz waited for his captain to leave the flight deck before disabiling key pad controlling access to the cockpit
he then selected an altitude of 96 feet on the aircraft 's flight computer before setting it on its collision course with the alps
investigators revealed that the aircraft 's captain sondenheimer can be heard banging on the cockpit door urging his colleague to open up until the jet hits the alps at more than 400 miles per hour
audio leading up to the crash revealed that captain sondenheimer had complained that he did not have enough time to use the toilet while the aircraft was on the ground in barcelona
as soon as the aircraft achieved its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , captain sondenheimer can be heard leaving the cockpit
as soon as the door closed behind him , andreas lubitz flicked a switch which disabled the keypad on the cabin side of the door for five minutes and initiated his descent
the door lock override is switched off after five minutes as an additional safety measure in case the flight crew become incapacitated
andreas lubitz is believed to have flicked the switch a second time during the eight - minute descent
mr cocheret later wrote on his facebook page : ' unfortuantely , this terrible scenario has become a reality
he said : ' i seriously sometimes wonder who âs sitting next to me in the cockpit
how can i be sure that i can trust him ? perhaps something terrible has just happened in his life and he âs unable to overcome it
' there indeed does exist a way to get back into the cockpit , but if the person inside disables this option ( the security code to get in ) , one could do nothing but sit with the passengers and wait and see what happens
' german airline lufthansa has set aside $ 300 million to deal with potential civil claims against the company following the germanwings disaster
the french crash investigators bea said they will look into methods of preventing a similar incident in future
a spokesperson said : ' ( we will study ) systemic weaknesses ( that ) might possibly have led to this aviation disaster
' german officials have revealed that andreas lubitz , 27 , received psychotherapy before gaining his pilot 's licence after expressing suicidal tendencies
crash investigators are trying to build a road to the site of the crash to help speed up recovery efforts and attempts to find the second black box
lufthansa has so far refused to say whether they were aware of andreas lubitz 's mental health history although they said he had passed all the required medical tests to work with germanwings , its low - cost subsidiary .
