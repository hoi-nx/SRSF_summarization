french 's ruling socialists suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections last night - as three years of left - wing rule was branded a ' massive failure '
exit polls showed nicolas sarkozy 's opposition ump party controlling up to 70 departments , compared to 37 for the socialists
this meant a loss of 30 of the regional councils for francois hollande 's party , which came to power nationally in 2012
former president mr nicolas sarkozy said : ' tonight , the republican right , and the centre , has won the departmental elections
' referring to the ump 's electoral alliance with the centrist udi ( udi ) , mr nicolas sarkozy said : ' never in the history of the fifth republic has our political family won so many departments
' mr nicolas sarkozy said ' three years ' under the most outdated socialist party in european had brought the country to its knees , and the electorate had had enough
exit polls showed the opposition ump party under nicolas sarkozy ( pictured ) controlling up to 70 departments , compared to 37 for the socialists ' a new era is starting
hope is reborn for french , ' said mr nicolas sarkozy
' the road will be long and hard , but change is coming and nothing can stop it
' also highlighting the ' failure ' of the socialists , was the far - right fn ( fn ) leader marine le pen
although the fn was expected to win up to one department maximum , they were on course to win more than 200 seats on regional councils
calling on valls , the socialist prime minister , ' to resign ' , ms le pen said her anti-immigration and anti-europe party had a huge part to play in the future of french
valls , the socialist prime minister , conceded ' incontestable ' electoral defeat soon after the polls closed at 8pm
far - right fn ( fn ) leader marine le pen ( pictured ) also highlighted the ' failure ' of the socialists noting increased extremism in his country , mr valls said : ' far - right gains in local elections are a sign of lasting change in the french political system '
the election will choose 4,108 local councillors and - crucially - shape the political landscape in the run - up to the 2017 presidential race
the vote was also a key test for mr nicolas sarkozy who , despite a series of corruption scandals , is convinced he can return to power in two years ' time
according to the exit polls , the ump and its centrist allies could end up with nearly twice as many seats as president francois hollande 's socialists
. yesterday represented the socialists ' third political battering in a year - they were roundly beaten in municipal and european elections last may .
