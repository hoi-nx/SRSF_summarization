if you do n't have the time to make chocolate from scratch , you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs
once your chocolate is melted , it will need to be tempered
the cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along , just pop your chocolate into the freezer ( no longer than 30 seconds )
place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it
keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process
stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature
bittersweet / dark chocolate should reach a temperature of 28c-29c ; milk chocolate should reach 27c-28c ; and white or coloured chocolate should reach 26c-27c
once the first batch has melted , add more chocolate to your bowl , stirring as you go along
as soon as the correct temperature is reached , start building your easter egg layers
spoon some chocolate into a mould ( you can get them from lakeland , denny craft moulds or party delights ) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould
you can make it as thick as you like , building each layer as the previous one cools
once the final layer has been built , leave aside to cool and harden before decorating .
