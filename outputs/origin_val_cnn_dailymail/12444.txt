if you enjoy laughing at the england football team -- calling all germans and scotland -- and you have a spare $ 900,000 , then sotheby 's has the very thing for you
the auction house is offering an untitled work by italy sculptor maurizio cattelan that chronicles -- in painstaking and painful detail if you are england -- every defeat suffered by the england team between 1874 and 1998
maurizio cattelan has carved all the defeats into a large ( and it would have to be , would n't it ? ) piece of black granite , meaning the lucky buyer can be constantly reminded of a succession of ignominious afternoons and evenings
the artist says of his memorial stone - style work simply : " i guess it 's a piece which talks about pride , missed opportunities and death
" known for his humorous and satirical art , maurizio cattelan had plenty to work with as he recorded defeats starting with a 2 - 1 loss to scotland in glasgow in 1874 and ending with another 2 - 1 setback against romania at the world cup
since then , of course , he 'd have had a fair few more to immortalize , including the two to italy and uruguay in brazil last summer that were part of the worst - ever england display at a world cup
the artist , whose other works include la nona ora ( the ninth hour ) , which depicts pope john paul ii being struck down by a meteorite , first put his football piece on display at an exhibition in london in 1999
it 's not known whether any england managers and players , past or present , came along to have a sneaky look
current england boss roy hodgson is known to be a bit of an italophile , but the former inter milan coach needs to be quick if he wants catch a glimpse -- maurizio cattelan 's work is on public exhibition at sotheby 's new bond street galleries until tuesday 10 march
it will then be offered as part of the single - owner ' bear witness ' sale .
