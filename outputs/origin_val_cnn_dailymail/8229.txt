perched out of a helicopter with his camera in hand , new york - based photographer milstein has captured spectacular views of giant cruise ships from above
milstein 's cruise ships series gives a bird 's - eye view of the huge floating holiday vessels
the new york - based photographer uses high - resolution camera equipment to capture views from a helicopter with an open door
they include the disney dream , which features a nine - hole mini-golf course , 11 nightclubs and lounges and the first ' water roller coaster ' : a 765 - foot long winding waterslide called the aquaduck that goes through the ship 's funnel
the $ 800 million vessel can accommodate 3,634 passengers and 1,300 crew on 15 passenger decks
mr milstein said : ' giant cruise ships , over three football fields long , have become unique floating cities
photographed symmetrically from directly above in very high resolution , the large gallery prints , up to 74 inches , show the viewer a detailed view not commonly seen
' the ships can be seen with their passengers lounging on deck chairs , playing on water park slides , putting greens , running tracks , and basketball courts
they have a curious beauty and tell us something about how we as a culture form instant communities for shared recreation and relaxation
the disney dream cruise ship is radiant in the sea with a nice clash of lighting , while right , the carnival victory can cater for 2,754 people and is an awesome sight at night disney dream looks somewhat different when viewed from land , showing its height and the navy and red livery , and right , the carnival victory is an imposing sight the caribbean princess has a giant poolside movie theatre that will impress , while right , the carnival victory has fine dining throughout the modern caribbean princess ship offers all the comforts of home and more , with space for 3,082 guests and all of the signature features ' the ships which continue to be built larger and larger are fascinating to ponder as engineering marvels
seen as a typology , they share a common symmetry derived from function , yet juxtapose design elements both decorative and functional that set them apart
' this ongoing series which began in 2013 , is related to the aircraft series which i have been shooting for over 15 years
i take most of these photos using an 80 mpxl digital medium format camera with a gyro stabilizer , shooting from a helicopter with the door off
' the large highly detailed gallery prints will be on exhibit at benrubi gallery in manhattan , from july 9 until august 22
