the tsarnaev brothers reportedly learned how to build a pressure - cooker bomb from a jihadi magazine , but apparently that guide did n't include a step instructing them to throw out evidence of their purchases
on wednesday , the jury deciding accused boston bomber tsarnaev 's fate were shown pictures of inside his family 's honda civic as well as his older brother tamerlan 's wallet , which contained receipts for bomb - making ingredients
tamerlan was killed in a dramatic shootout with police , but his brother escaped for several hours before being caught hiding in a dry - docked boat
tsarnaev , 21 , faces the possibility of the death penalty for his role in the 2013 deadly bombings
three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two pressure - cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon
on wednesday , the jury deciding tsarnaev 's death penalty trial were shown pictures taken from inside his family 's honda civic
they were also shown images of older brother tamerlan 's wallet ( above ) observing : tsarnaev ( center ) is seen in court on wednesday in this sketch , as a fingerprint expert testifies a bomb expert also testified in court on wednesday , about the improvised weapons found at the scene of the tsarnaevs ' shootout with police in watertown , days after the bombing members of the jury look at one of the unexploded bombs in court on wednesday tamerlan 's ( left ) wallet contained receipts from a gun and ammo store and for two backpacks at target
defense attorneys for dzhokhar ( right ) focused on the receipts in order to paint tamerlan as the mastermind of the plot tsarnaev 's lawyers showed the jury a photo of receipts tamerlan had from a gun and ammunition store and for two backpacks and a soldering gun purchased in the days and weeks before the marathon bombings , apparently in an attempt to show that tamerlan had a larger role in the bombings than dzhokhar did
also in the wallet was a moneygram receipt reflecting a $ 900 transfer to russia by tamerlan
but the prosecution made a case for dzhokhar 's equal participation on wednesday , as they tried to connect him to the death of mit police officer collier
the two brothers shot dead the campus police officer on april 18 , after investigators released pictures of them as the primary suspects in the bombing
two bloodied gloves were found near the gas pedal of the honda civic , and matched the dna of slain mit police officer collier fingerprints experts also revealed that dzhokhar 's prints had showed up throughout the honda civic
it 's still unclear whether he was driving the car that night forensics experts testified that dzhokhar 's fingerprints were found throughout the honda civic
jennifer montgomery , a dna analyst with the state police crime lab , testified wednesday that blood was on a pair of gloves found near the gas pedal and driver 's seat
the blood on the glove matched mit police officer collier , but the defense pointed out on cross-examination that all of the blood tested on dzhokhars 's sweatshirt was his own
an mit graduate student who was riding his bike by the scene of the shooting identified dzhokhar as the man he saw leaning into collier 's police cruiser the night he was killed
collier was shot six times , including three times in the head at close range
while it was n't determined in court on wednesday which brother was wearing the glove , the chance that dzhokhar was the shooter could damage the defense 's claim that he was just following his older brother
tsarnaev 's lawyer admitted during opening statements that he participated in the bombings but said his older brother was the mastermind in hopes of convincing the jury to give him a lower life - in - prison sentence as opposed to the death penalty
on cross-examination , the defense pointed out that none of the blood tested on dzhokhar 's sweatshirt matched officer collier a mit graduate student has identified dzhokhar as the man he saw leaning into collier 's car on the night of the shootout after collier 's killing , the tsarnaevs had a wild shootout with police in watertown
tamerlan tsarnaev died following the gunfight and being run over by his brother as he fled
dzhokhar was found hours later , wounded and bloodied , hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in watertown
during earlier testimony wednesday , jurors were shown two pipe bombs hurled at police during the shootout
neither of those bombs exploded , but a third pipe bomb did
a pressure - cooker bomb similar to the bombs used in the marathon attacks caused a powerful explosion that shook houses on the street and sent debris raining down on police
trooper robert mccarthy also showed the jury a tupperware container filled with explosive powder and fuses found in a car stolen by the tsarnaevs just before the firefight with police
testimony is scheduled to resume thursday the tsarnaev family honda civic seen on the left
it was apparently first purchased by their father
