he 's out : city unanimously voted on a resolution to part ways with city manager shaw , 39 , effective immediately the city manager of ferguson , missouri , has resigned in the wake of a justice department probe that found a wide range of systemic racially biased practices by the police and municipal court
this evening , the city unanimously voted on a resolution to part ways with city manager shaw effective immediately
shaw , 39 , was among several individuals heavily criticized in the scathing justice department report issued last wednesday
shaw had held the position in the st. louis suburb since 2007
the justice department launched an investigation into ferguson 's police department and municipal court after the august 9 shooting death of unarmed black teenager brown by a white police officer
a news release from the city said the city had reached a ' mutual separation agreement ' with shaw , the city 's chief executive
the statement also said a nationwide search for shaw 's replacement would begin immediately
' i believe that the city of ferguson has the resolve to overcome the challenges it faces in the coming months and emerge as a stronger community for it , ' shaw , 39 , said in a statement included in the release
since brown 's death seven months ago , mayor james knowles has been the public face and voice of ferguson 's city government
but shaw held the legal power to make personnel and policy changes in the police department â not james knowles , a part - time officeholder who earns less than $ 5,000 annually
he had previously worked as city clerk and assistant to the city administrator in shrewsbury , another town in st. louis
online biographies indicate that he grew up in north st. louis and lived in ferguson before working for the city
he was honored in 2013 as a distinguished alumnus of a public policy administration program at the university of missouri-st. louis , which is located near ferguson , and was listed as an adviser for the university 's student group for aspiring city managers
shaw has not spoken publicly about the shooting , protests , grand jury inquiry or justice department investigation
he stood silently beside two city members at james knowles ' wednesday news conference responding to the justice department report and declined , through a city spokesman , a subsequent associated press interview request
he was not at tuesday 's meeting
the justice department report repeatedly cited shaw 's role in encouraging his police force to aggressively ticket motorists as a means to generate revenue
in one instance , he responded to a jackson email about a record - setting month for court revenue â nearly $ 180,000 in february 2011 alone â with the exclamation , ' wonderful ! ' catalyst : the justice department launched an investigation into policing practices in ferguson after officer wilson ( left ) shot and killed 18 - year - old brown in august city divided : analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed african - african-american make up 93 percent of arrests and when jackson told shaw in january 2013 that municipal court revenue had exceeded $ 2million the previous year , the city manager was similarly excited
' awesome ! ' he said , according to the federal inquiry
municipal judge ronald brockmeyer stepped down to help the divided city ' begin its healing process ' but in a statement issued after the announcement of his departure , shaw said his office ' never instructed the police department to target african-american , nor falsify charges to administer fines , nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor
any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false , ' shaw said
shaw 's resignation comes a day after ferguson municipal judge ronald brockmeyer stepped down to help the divided city ' begin its healing process ' and to promote public confidence in the court system
last thursday , two ferguson police department commanders also quit after racist emails were released during the justice department 's investigation into the police department
sgt. william mudd and capt. rick henke resigned thursday and city court clerk mary ann twitty was fired wednesday
us attorney general eric holder called the justice department 's report ' searing , ' saying the investigation found the ferguson community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be ' disproportionately harmful to african-american residents
' ' this investigation found a community that was deeply polarized , ' eric holder said
' a community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents
' a community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue
' embarassement : last thursday , two ferguson police department commanders also quit after racist emails were released during the justice department 's investigation speaking out : us attorney general eric holder called the justice department 's report ' searing ' ferguson mayor james knowles said friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the justice department , reuters reports
speaking at a town hall event in south carolina two days after the release of the justice department report , president obama said the ferguson probe exposed a ' broken , racially biased system
' a st. louis grand jury and the justice department both declined to bring charges in the brown shooting against officer wilson , who left the department
the justice department report said wilson acted in self - defense when he shot brown
but the agency said in its report last week that ferguson 's police and court systems functioned as a money - making enterprise that heightened tensions among residents
strong words : president obama said the ferguson probe exposed a ' broken , racially biased system ' the justice department report cited cases of racial profiling and bigotry by the predominantly white police force in the mostly black st. louis suburb
brown 's shooting prompted protests in the st. louis area and across the nation
analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed african - americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in ferguson
african - americans also made up most of incidents in which officers used force and all incidents where police dogs bit citizens .
