her parents also demonstrated their unwavering support for her early on , something transgender children ca n't always count on , connelly said
jazz and her family first appeared in the public eye in a 2007 television interview with abc news ' barbara walters
she was 6 years old and had just started appearing in public as a female , in what the report called " one of the youngest known cases of an early transition from male to female
" the segment with barbara walters said jazz was diagnosed with " gender identity disorder , " a term long considered stigmatizing by mental health specialists
it was eliminated from the american psychiatric association manual in 2012 and replaced with " gender dysphoria , " a condition in which people feel strongly that they are not the gender they physically appear to be
jazz and her parents said she began gravitating to " girl things " at an early age and insisting she had the wrong genitalia
at home , she wore dresses but in public she wore pants to maintain a " gender neutral appearance
" that all changed at her fifth birthday party , when she wore a one - piece bathing suit and told her friends she was a girl , her parents told abc
the interview catapulted jazz and her family into the spotlight
jazz has appeared on various television networks and news outlets , including an abc update with barbara walters at age 11 , a segment with katie couric , a report on 60 minutes , and an oprah winfrey network documentary , " i am jazz : a family in transition
" the exposure has shaped jazz into a transgender advocate and spokesperson who uses social media to connect with fans and followers
she has more than 20,000 instagram followers and 33,000 subscribers to her youtube channel , where she posts her speeches , diy craft tutorials and musings about being a transgender youth
occasionally , she responds to questions in video q&as , fielding tough questions about her hormone treatment and bullying with grace and ease
she began using testosterone blockers at age 11 to stop her from growing body hair , " or else i would have a hairy beard right now , which i do n't so i 'm thankful for that , " she told fans in her most recent q&a video
her outreach has earned her recognition from some of the country 's top lgbt advocacy groups
in 2012 jazz became the youngest person ever to be recognized in the advocate 's annual list of " top forty under 40
" she was honored at the 2013 glaad awards and named a human rights campaign youth ambassador in 2014
she also made time magazine 's " top 25 most influential teens of 2014 " and huffington post 's " 14 most fearless teens of 2014 " list
it may seem like a charmed life but jazz says she still faces bullying and mistreatment from people who do n't understand her
the comments on her social media accounts are littered with profane attacks on her and her family
the question came up in her q&a : " how do you feel when people judge you ? " clearly , it 's a topic she 's given some thought to
" i do n't care what people think
the only opinion that really affects me is my own opinion of myself because i determine the way i am , not anyone else , " she said
" if someone says something hurtful to you or makes you feel down on yourself then you just got ta stay positive and keep moving forward because they might not know much about you or they may not understand the situation
