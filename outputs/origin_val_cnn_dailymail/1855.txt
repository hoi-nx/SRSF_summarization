hamilton enters the new campaign , which gets underway in australia on sunday , as the favourite to defend the crown he clinched so dramatically at the season finale in abu dhabi last year
speaking at mercedes headquarters in brackley last week , hamilton spoke of his motivation to emulate senna by winning a third world title
hamilton could become an all - time f1 great if he secures a third world championship hamilton wants to emulate boyhood hero aryton senna and brundle said he could with another title hamilton ( centre ) with f1 legend jackie stewart ( left ) and prince harry in 2011 when he was with mclaren and brundle believes the 30 - year - old briton must be considered in the same bracket as the great brazilian , and sir jackie stewart , also a thrice - world champion , should he defend his title in 2015
' if hamilton had finished his career with one championship it would have been a travesty , but if he wins a third he is up there with sir jackie stewart and senna ' , said brundle , a veteran of 156 grands prix
' he becomes one of the all - time greats

the silver arrows won 16 of the 19 races last year and boasted more mileage than of their rivals over winter hamilton and team - mate nico ( left ) will renew their battle for the championship in melbourne but hamilton 's preparations for the new term have been hampered by his very public break - up from girlfriend nicole scherzinger , the popstar singer who was in abu dhabi to celebrate his title triumph last year
brundle however , does n't expect hamilton 's off - track issues to trouble him as it has appeared to do so in the past
' i think he will be in a better place
i sense he is hungry and i think the nicole scherzinger thing happened a lot time before it became public , ' said brundle
hamilton 's preparations were hampered by his public split from nicole scherzinger , who was in abu dhabi to celebrate his second championship victory with hamilton brundle does n't believe hamilton 's off - track issues will be a problem - ' i think he will be in a better place ' ' there is no doubt about it , that he wears his heart on his sleeve and he very open about that , but his speed and his skill are so great he just drives through that
' he has got to win consecutive championships which is always perceived to be particularly difficult , but he is going to have a dominant car again , so it is nico who he has got to race
' hamilton was unlucky with reliability last year and if he just does the same thing again he will beat nico
so , unless nico has found a way to raise his game , what is going to put hamilton under pressure apart from himself ? ' f1 is the only place fans can watch all 20 grand prix weekends live across tv , sky go and now tv
