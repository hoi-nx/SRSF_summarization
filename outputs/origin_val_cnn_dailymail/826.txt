a woman who created a popular app promoting an alternative lifestyle after she was diagnosed with cancer has not donated the funds raised through sales of the app to charity as promised , it has been revealed
gibson , 26 , is the entrepreneur behind the whole pantry recipe and health app , which she created after she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer
she shunned traditional treatments to combat her cancer and instead opted for a wholefood and holistic approach after trialing chemotherapy and other modern medical procedures
however despite publicising that large amounts of the profits from her app were going to charity , the money was never handed over according to fairfax
the app , which has been downloaded over 300,000 times , proved so popular she was flown out to silicone valley last year where she was told her app was to be included on the apple watch
the 26 - year - old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business ' profits were being donated to charity , last year claiming that $ 300,000 had been donated
however ms gibson told fairfax this week that those donations had never been made , citing disappointing app sales and miscalculated profit margins
neither melbourne âs asylum seeker resource centre and one girl - who were donated $ 1000 after questions were raised - received any money from ms gibson and the former were not even aware money was being raised in their name
ms gibson , pictured with her son oliver , created the app after she was diagnosed with brain cancer she has also released a cookbook version of the creations following the success of the app there have been revelations that the whole pantry business nor ms gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises apparently only $ 7000 had reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated
there were also revelations that the business nor ms gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises , which could draw huge fines and potential jail time
daily mail australia has contacted the whole pantry for comment and while they could not be reached at the time of publishing , they had earlier posted a lengthy response on social media addressing claims made in the original article
in the post to their facebook page the company clarified they were a ' for - profit ' company to the surprise of many of their followers , and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry
' we have , like all start ups , struggled with managing all facets of a new business , biting off more than we could chew , juggling internal and external priorities with little staff
' we have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external business manager and accounts team , an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses
ms gibson has appeared across a number of networks ( pictured on sunrise ) speaking about her approach to healing last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new apple watch apparently only $ 7000 of a projected $ 300,000 has reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated ' they have been working over our finances for the last five months , and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight
we were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward , ' the post read in part
' our books are taking longer to bring up to date than anticipated
twp forecasted income in october 2014 which was not fulfilled , creating cash - flow issues and unforeseen delays on finalising three discussed charitable donations , ' another section of the post read
also citing ' cash flow issues ' as ms gibson did when explaining the business model and why charities had received no donations , the lengthy response garnered harsh criticism from commenters
' appalling - your organisation not the media
money for charity does n't go into " cash flow " - that is beyond unethical , surely it 's illegal ? ' , one angry subscriber posted
' you have skipped the entire point in your very long and wordy response
you took money from people who gave you the money believing it would go to said charities , you failed to forward on the money , ' another poster wrote
' ... that my friends is dishonesty / theft in the highest degree and takes advantage of peoples good natures
shame on you , ' the comment continued
daily mail australia has contacted the whole pantry , and a number of charities who were to receive donations , for comment .
