above , image of embryos being selected as part of the process the businesswoman , who is representing herself at the hearing , says there is ' no merit ' in her ex-husband âs claim
barrister brudenell , who represented the man at central london county court , said his client was claiming damages for ' deceit '
he said the man did not know at the time that his wife , who is in her 50s , had used her ex-boyfriend 's sperm , although it was ' now quite clear what had happened '
mr brudenell said the little boy was born in late 2005 and when he was around six months old the couple separated
divorce proceedings began and their divorce was finalised in 2008
he addded the man looked after the child when the woman was working and paid more than Â£ 80,000 in maintenance over the following few years the mother , whose child is now nine years old , told central london county court that there is ' no merit ' in her ex-husband 's claim
above , the royal courts of justice in london , where the court is located in 2011 a dispute arose over the amount of contact he was having with the child - and the woman then told him that he was not the ' biological father '
shortly afterwards that was confirmed when he took a dna test
a lawyer told the judge today that the case was thought to be the first of its kind
the judge was told that the man was in his 60s , the woman was in her 50s , and the little boy was nine
she heard that the man and woman lived in different parts of the london area
the hearing continues and is expected to end tomorrow
