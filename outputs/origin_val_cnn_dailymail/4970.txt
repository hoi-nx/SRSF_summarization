' jeanne lanvin had a taste for black and white designs with geometrical effects - a trend which dominated the thirties the exhibition will be open until 23 august and lanvin 's current creative director elbaz hopes people will come away saying " i love jeanne lanvin " elbaz himself commented : ' for this exhibition , we began to look at the clothes , the dresses , the inside of the dresses , and the feelings that we picked up from them
the whole question was to work out how to display them
' for many years i 've worked on the windows of our boutiques , and i love doing it
but doing an exhibition in a museum is a different kind of undertaking , because it involves a different vocabulary
' never having done an exhibition , i wanted to learn all i could from olivier saillard and his team
we had two options : either to be historical and do a very academic retrospective with a succession of dates ; or to follow our feelings , to love and admire the clothes , touch the visitors â heart through the sheer beauty of these garments , and finish the exhibition kind of up on a cloud
' i think we have managed to create an exhibition around the dream of fashion
what i am hoping for is to hear the visitors say " i love jeanne lanvin "
