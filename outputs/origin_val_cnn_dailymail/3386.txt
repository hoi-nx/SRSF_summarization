it 's a feast of epic proportions
hungry sharks , dolphins , gannets and even a whale take part in a feeding frenzy of a staggering nine million sardines
the huge cluster of sardines form a ball as a defence mechanism to try and look bigger but that does n't stop the predators attacking them
the frenzy was 25 metres beneath the surface and lasted for over a staggering seven hours
wildlife photographer michael aw was underwater and managed to capture the spectacular feeding frenzy which took place in the wild coast , on the east coast of south africa
michael aw , 59 , who is from sydney , australia , said that seeing this mass feast , called the ' sardine run ' , was ' the greatest show on earth - the pinnacle of wildlife adventure
' the huge cluster of sardines form a ball as a defence mechanism to try and look bigger but that does n't stop the predators attacking them this shark must have thought all its dreams had come true as around nine million sardines swim past around 300 dusky sharks , bronze whale sharks and sand tiger sharks all got in on the action and were joined by 150 dolphins and 1000 gannets - as well as a bryde 's whale
