spain goalkeeper and captain casillas is unlikely to lose his place in the national side despite a recent poor run for his club real madrid , coach vicente del bosque said on wednesday
casillas is one player , along with wales winger gareth bale , who has been blamed by real madrid fans for the european champions ' slump and he was again the target of their ire during tuesday 's 4 - 3 champions league loss at home to bundesliga side schalke
although they squeezed through to the quarter - finals 5 - 4 on aggregate , casillas and his team mates were whistled off the bernabeu pitch by their angry supporters , already fuming after real madrid gave up the la liga lead to barcelona with a loss to athletic bilbao
casillas was blamed for this goal as schalke 's huntelaar pounced on his poor parry huntelaar buried his finish and the real madrid fans booed their keeper after the 4 - 3 champions league loss ' he did not play well and he admitted that , ' vicente del bosque said in an interview with radio marca
' he also saved real madrid at the end , ' added the 64 - year - old , who coached casillas when he was in charge at real madrid between 1999 and 2003
' we do n't have to make a change unless the dip in form is alarming
i think he is in good shape
' vicente del bosque has plenty of options if he decides to call time on casillas 's international career , with the likes of david de gea ( manchester united ) and kiko casilla ( espanyol ) pushing for a starting place
casillas 's apparent drop in form does n't bother spain coach vicente del bosque who 's back his keeper casillas ( left ) shows his disappointment alongside toni kroos after real madrid 's loss to schalke however , he has consistently backed his captain during several difficult periods in recent years and is unlikely to drop him unless he suffers a sustained slump
casillas has made 160 appearances for spain , more than any other player , and led the side to back - to - back european crowns in 2008 and 2012 with the nation 's debut world cup triumph in between in 2010
spain 's next game is a euro 2016 qualifier at home to ukraine on march 27
with four matches played , spain are second in group c on nine points , three behind leaders slovakia , who beat them 2 - 1 in zilina in october , and level with ukraine
