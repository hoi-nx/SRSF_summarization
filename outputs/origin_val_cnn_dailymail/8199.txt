martin harper has unexpectedly backed pheasant shooting , causing outrage among the group 's supporters as uk âs leading bird charity , you might expect the rspb to oppose pheasant shooting
but one of its bosses has unexpectedly backed the practice , causing outrage among supporters of the group
some threatened to cancel their membership while others spoke of their â disappointment â
the row began when martin harper , conservation director of the rspb , wrote a blog saying the charity supported â progressive â shoots as they were good for the countryside
mr martin harper wrote : â yes , we condemn wildlife crime including any persecution of protected birds of prey
â and yes , we continue to work with the police to end illegal killing which remains prevalent in the uplands , threatening the future of hen harrier , and still occurs on some lowland estates
â but , the contribution progressive shoots can make to supporting threatened wildlife is significant , and we are delighted to help them further
â defending his view on the topic , mr martin harper went on to write : â this is nât a contradiction
we simply do whatever nature needs and will work with anyone that wants to help wildlife
â he added that pheasant shoots were responsible for creating or maintaining 7,000 hectares of hedgerows
twitter users reacted angrily , with one writing : â after 30 + years , i think it âs time to cancel our membership ! ! # itsall - aboutmoney
â lee clements wrote : â very disappointed to learn that @ natures_voice â has always been neutral on the ethics of shooting birds
â â but the british association for shooting and conservation praised the rspb for putting â long - term conservation goals before short - term politicised campaigning â
in 2008 , the department for environment food and rural affairs ( defra ) estimated that 40 million gamebirds were bred to be shot each year in uk
the figure includes pheasants and partridges and is now believed to be higher still
the rspb estimates the total to be 50million
in a report on the industry released in 2008 , defra stated that they had welfare concerns surrounding the shooting of game
the report addresses the â extent and duration of confinement of semi-wild species , sometimes within systems offering a barren , restricting environment
â the rspb boss said that pheasant shoots were responsible for creating or maintaining 7,000 hectares of hedgerows
but twitter users reacted angrily to the comments you do not need a licence to hunt pheasants or grouse in the uk but a firearms or shotgun certificate is required
the pheasant shooting season runs from october to february each year
it is illegal to shoot the birds outside of that time frame
in an interview with the observer , mr martin harper added that is was too simplistic to say that the rspb is â anti-shooting â
he said : â it âs more sophisticated than that
we are ready to work with landowners and farmers to look after farmland wildlife
â we are not an animal welfare organisation
our primary interest is stopping common species becoming rare
â spokesman simon clarke told the observer : â when organisations are prepared to put evidence before opinion and long - term conservation goals before short - term politicised campaigning , then there is much common ground to be found
â stuart housden , a director at the rspb , said : â this is what we have been saying for a hundred years
â the rspb was set up 1904 and has been consistently neutral on the ethics of field sports
we are not allowed to be in support of field sports , nor are we allowed to be against them
â we are always firm on wildlife crimes and other bad practises such as the destruction of wildlife habitats
we will condemn bad practice and if it is illegal practice we are very effective in combating it
â what we are simply saying is that there are people who are doing some good things and what we are trying to do is give praise where it is due and criticise those who do bad things
â sixty per cent of uk wildlife is in decline
nature needs friends who will invest in wildlife in a sensitive and thoughtful way
â we would like to see more people go the extra mile to give nature a home on their farms
