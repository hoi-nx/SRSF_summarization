o'neill must outwit his old boss paatelainen to maintain northern ireland âs bid to qualify for a major tournament for the first time in 30 years
it was finland manager paatelainen who gave the 45 - year - old irishman his first break in coaching at cowdenbeath
oâneill revealed that the two old friends have been reluctant to compare notes so as to avoid giving away any more information about their tactics
â we âre similar to players , i think , â he said
northern ireland boss o'neill faces his old mentor on sunday , the manager of finland paatelainen is the manager of finland , and he gave o'neill his first break in management northern ireland team to face finland : carroll ; c mclaughlin , mcauley , evans , baird ; ward , davis , norwood , brunt , mcginn ; lafferty â when you âve played at a club with someone and then you âve worked briefly with them as a coach there âs obviously a relationship there
â obviously we are less inclined to discuss the opposition because he does nât want to tell me things i perhaps do nât know and vice versa
but we both know each other inside out and how our team will play
â regardless of what happens it wo nât affect how close we are
â northern ireland have never qualified for the european championship finals , and last appeared in a major tournament at the 1986 world cup in mexico
oâneill added : â i think paatelainen has done a great job
his job is quite similar to mine , you have a limited pool of players to choose from and he has got them playing in a nice style
there âs no doubt finland are a good team but there is a dependence on five or six players
