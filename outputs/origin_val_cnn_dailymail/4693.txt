a controversial spain aquarium trainer who was accused of abusing dolphins has been found dead following a suspected suicide
barbero , 59 , who was due to arrive in the us to work at the georgia aquarium at the beginning of march believed to have taken his own life in spain after he started receiving death threats when video emerged of him apparently kicking and hitting the animals
the 59 - year - old was working on the resort island of mallorca in the mediterranean sea when he vanished on friday after the damning footage surfaced
' it was with sadness , outrage and frustration that i received the news this morning that barbero was found dead in spain
' initial reports suggest that he allegedly ended his own life
he was a husband , a father and a grandfather who dedicated nearly four decades to caring for animals
we at georgia aquarium were proud to have had him serve periodically as a consultant to our organization over the past eight years
his service with us was exemplary
' after allegations were levied against him , we took the situation very seriously
georgia aquarium began a search for truth in hopes of disproving these unsubstantiated claims
' sadly , he and his family received death threats , and groups and individuals rushed to judge him
he was not given the right or the privilege to be considered innocent until proven guilty , a principle i hold dear
his death is untimely , unnecessary and unjust
' we were not given the chance to thoughtfully and thoroughly review the allegations against him before activists , consultants and some in our own community tortured him with enough hatred to cause him to allegedly take his own life
' i hope the death of barbero teaches those who were quick to condemn him a lesson about being hasty to charge and indict
' we will continue to operate georgia aquarium with dedication , devotion and pride in how we care for and about our animals -- as well as the people affiliated with our organization
we will continue to serve the community and be advocates for animals around the world , as we have done since our founding
we will never condone any injustice , such as the one done to barbero
' we mourn with his family , his friends and all those who must contend with this terrible loss
