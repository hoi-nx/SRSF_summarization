the figure of speech ' a chip off the old block ' appears to an apt one for henrik larsson 's son , jordan following his recent stunning strike
the son of former celtic , barcelona and manchester united striker henrik larsson scored a sublime solo effort for norwegian side helsingborg against syrianska on wednesday night
larsson jnr 's strike is certainly one that his dad , and the current manager of helsingborg , would have been proud of as he opened the scoring in their 2 - 2 draw during the swedish cup encounter
according to some reports in sweden after the goal , helsingborg fans sang : ' he 's better than his dad ! ' and judging by that striker henrik larsson could well emulate his father 's goalscoring talents that illuminated europe for 25 years
henrik larsson is probably best remembered for his seven - year spell at celtic where his honours included four league titles and two scottish cups
on thursday the scottish giants announced that they have signed a long - term deal with sports manufacturer new balance - who will become their official kit supplier from the 2015/16 season onwards
