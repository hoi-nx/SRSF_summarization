relatives of those killed on the germanwings flight have been offered up to Â£ 40,000 from lufthansa immediately , amid speculation they could receive multi-million pound compensation settlements eventually
the german airline , which owns the budget carrier , offered to pay up to 50,000 euros per passenger , for immediate financial assistance
however , the relatives could receive multi-million pound compensation settlements if they can prove that lufthansa knew about the co-pilot 's mental health difficulties
sicknotes found at lubitz 's apartment in dã¼sseldorf by german police could form a key part of any legal case launched by the families
legal experts claim that the level of awareness the passengers had in advance of the crash would also influence any compensation payments
lufthansa , which owns germanwings , has so far refused to comment on whether they had any concerns over lubitz 's mental health
ordinarily , the families of air disasters are entitled to a maximum of around Â£ 100,000 under international agreements
but if a family decides to sue , this figure could rise dramatically depending on the degree of negligence by the airline and the level of awareness their loved ones would have had on their impending doom
as well as looking at lubitz , lawyers for the families could question the airline 's policy of not requiring at least two crew on the flight deck at all times once the aircraft is airborne
relatives of some of tuesday 's victims have reacted angrily to the discovery of the torn up sick note and questions over lubitz 's mental health
lufthansa 's chief executive carsten spohr refused to respond to questions about lubitz 's mental health christian driessens , whose 59 - year - old brother , claude , died in the crash said : ' when you first learn that , you do nât believe it , we try to tell ourselves that it âs not possible
' looking back , i slowly start to be angry
i do nât understand how a serious company can let a depressed man pilot a plane
â because the boy was depressed , it was necessary to say he was
on this point i am opposed to the company not having introduced rules saying there must always be two people in the cockpit
â i âve fallen over backwards
it âs not normal to leave somebody by himself in charge , and who shuts the doors , i âm very angry
' passengers would have been soon aware of captain patrick sonderheimer 's attempts to break into his own cockpit after lubitz deliberately locked him outside
lubitz enabled a post- 911 safety system designed to stop hijacking to bolt the cockpit door shut
lufthansa chief executive carsten spohr admitted yesterday that lubitz had broken off his training in 2008 for several months , however , he refused to elaborate on the details
french prime minister valls , second right , said the airline should release all information on lubitz the latest revelations come as air crash investigators continue to search for the second ' black box ' french prime minister valls said the airline must hand over all information they have on lubitz to investigators
mr valls held a crisis meeting this morning where tuesday 's disaster was the main item on the agenda
he told itele : ' we must wait for the end of the inquiry
i am careful when there is a judicial inquiry , but everything points to a criminal , mad , suicidal action that we can not comprehend
' it is up to this company to provide a maximum of information so that we can understand why this pilot committed this dreadful act
' air crash investigators confirmed that lubitz , 28 , programmed the airbus a- 320 's autopilot to descend from 38,000 to just 100 feet , while the aircraft crossing the french coast towards the french alps , after his captain patrick sonderheimer left the flight deck to go to the toilet
however , french pilots ' union snpl said it is suing prosecutors who leaked information on ongoing developments in the case to the press
pilots fear that they will lose the public 's confidence after it emerged that lubitz deliberately flew into a mountain
hundreds of students from the joseph-koenig gymnasium school arrived at a memorials service today schmid of french 's snpl union told the associated press on friday that the lawsuit is over violating a french law on keeping information about investigations secret while they are ongoing
the lawsuit does n't name an alleged perpetrator , a method in french law that leaves investigators to determine who is at fault
mr schmid said : ' we can understand there is a certain pressure , a wish to know
' he warned that leaking information too early can mislead the public instead of informing accurately
eca also expressed concern about the leaks and urged further investigation before drawing final conclusions
in a statement , the eca said : ' our thoughts are with the victims and their relatives
as trusted professionals , who invest a lifelong career in making air travel safe , this is a very difficult day for us
' relatives of the victims have been all asked to give dna samples in an effort to identify their loved ones who died in the crash
lubitz , from montabaur in western german learned to fly gliders in his teens before starting work with germanwings in september 2013
klaus radke , head of the flying club said : ' i got to know him , or i should say reacquainted with him , as a very nice , fun and polite young man
' however , one friend said he used to go to movies and clubs together , but had noticed a considerable change over the past twelve months
the friend said : ' flying was his life
he always used to be a quiet companion , but in the last year that got worse
' knipping , a toronto - based specialist in aviation medicine , said it was extremely difficult to conduct screening for psychiatric problems among pilots , in part because they can put their careers in jeopardy by admitting to such problems
he said : ' if somebody wants to withhold or conceal , there 's no reasonable test
' mr knipping said unless a family member comes forward and reports their concerns , then it is possible for cases such as lubitz to ' slip through '
