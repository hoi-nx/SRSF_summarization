even the world - renowned composer himself might have struggled to orchestrate better than arsenal 's ' rosicky ' on his day
rosicky earned that nickname during his five years with borussia dortmund , yet it was in germany where he was labelled ' wasted talent ' and arsenal gladly signed the maestro in may 2006
' when he is fit ... ' seem to be the same , old four words that crop up when rosicky becomes the topic of discussion yet , even at the age of 34 , he still knows how to make arsenal tick
rosicky earned the nickname ' rosicky ' in germany and he continues to make arsenal tick at 34 olivier giroud celebrates with rosicky during their premier league win against queens park rangers rosicky has found minutes hard to come by at arsenal previously but injuries can prove problematic pulling on the yellow of borussia dortmund from 2001 , the all - round midfielder 's potential was recognised
remember nike 's scorpion advert in 2002 ? francesco totti , thierry henry , patrick vieira , paul scholes , ruud van nistelrooy , ronaldo , roberto carlos , luis figo and ronaldinho , among others , playing in a ' secret tournament ' hosted by eric cantona
then , among the world 's finest footballers , was a 20 - something rosicky
more than a decade on he is in his mid-thirties , and getting better with age
take the former sparta prague youth 's cameo against everton on march 1 , for example
there was a moment when rosicky chased the ball from phil jagielka , to barkley , to steven naismith , then back to barkley , and won the tackle
it merited a standing ovation , before he settled the bag of nerves the emirates had become with an 89th - minute goal to make it 2 - 0
' this geezer 's unreal , how is he 34 ? still producing moments of class like that , he 's a brilliant player , ' one supporter said in his analysis on arsenalfantv afterwards
rosicky scores against everton previously as he came on as a substitute with just eight minutes remaining rosicky shoots to make it 2 - 0 to arsenal against everton on march 1 and settle their nerves rosicky should start against manchester united but is not guaranteed to do so under arsene wenger rosicky mocked up as his nickname ' rosicky ' 87 - vs queens park rangers ( march 4 ) 8 - vs everton ( march 1 ) 9 - vs monaco ( february 25 ) 14 - vs crystal palace ( february 21 ) 18 - vs middlesbrough ( february 15 ) that 's exactly how it comes â in ' moments '
the czech republic captain does n't devastate week in , week out yet he is guaranteed to put in a shift
the mentality to pass sideways is lost on rosicky , who prefers to move the ball quickly and forward , showing as much energy and pace as those with years on him in the premier league
yet rosicky â a one - two kind of player , who bleeds the arsenal way â has averaged just 19 games per premier league season under arsene wenger in his nine years in north london
the injury - prone playmaker has been unlucky , rupturing his knee tendon in 2008 before requiring surgery on an achilles tendon in 2012
it cost him more than two years , and a niggle has always seemed to be round the corner since
minutes have been hard to come by
eighteen against middlesbrough in the fa cup , 14 against crystal palace in the premier league , and just nine in the 3 - 1 defeat by monaco in the champions league at the emirates
his eight minutes against everton led to a rare start against queens park rangers , and arsene wenger should persist with the playmaker
there is no doubt the arsenal manager likes the man due a testimonial next year if he signs a contract extension
' if you love football , you love rosicky , ' purred arsene wenger after their 3 - 2 win against brighton in the fa cup fourth round
rosicky treated that match as an exhibition
his assist for mesut ozil 's first half goal was ridiculous enough before a no - look pass led to a one - two that allowed rosicky to score a volley in the second
you may remember it better for phil neville declaring he would ' two - foot him ' if he tried that in his neck of the woods , but most saw it as sheer class from a thinker that views football akin to chess
rosicky makes a no - look pass against brighton which pundit phil neville found disrespectful the czech republic midfielder used the same move a number of times during arsenal 's 3 - 2 defeat of brighton during interviews rosicky can look uneasy , like a teenager making a television debut , not a player just one cap short of a century for czech republic
modesty , can be another way to put it
this week we heard zlatan ibrahimovic , 33 , has years left
can rosicky keep being his tireless self ? well , a jaguar land rover may be aged but , when it 's only got so many miles on the clock , it runs as good as any
rosicky has been seen to by mechanics on the treatment table far more than he deserves but , with him now fit , arsene wenger should start the 34 - year - old against manchester united on monday , then watch him go .
