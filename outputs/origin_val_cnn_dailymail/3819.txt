the madness that is lfw has just left the capital
we 've not even hit summer and yet we 're already being told what to wear come autumn
but at astylealbum.com we love a fashion fix and lfw gave us exactly that
we ca n't help but get excited for what the best of fashion has to offer
erdem , christopher kane and antonio berardi were high lights for us
all playing with colour and texture , using rich colours - deep purple , burnt orange and vibrant reds
a style album team at somerset house ( lr - ) jessie young , patricia dowling , emma , louise redknapp louise redknapp and emma at the aspinal x etre cecile presentation with creative director mariya dykalo ( left ) , and ( right ) louise looking chic in navy with animal - print heels at lfw preen combined a multitude of colours for their collection resulting in a bright , boho vibe
temperley also stayed true to their bohemian roots , creating a nomad - themed collection
of course the catwalk looks are not easy to recreate head to toe
take from the shows snippets of what you love , use the catwalk for inspiration and ideas to carry over into your own wardrobe
louise redknapp loved the bright , bold colours being showcased by christopher kane on the catwalk we loved temperley london 's grey and yellow colour palette ; erdems textured opulent skirts teamed with soft knits and preens cool mix of folklore prints layered with lumberjack coats
thanks to high demand these looks tend to filter through from catwalk to high street in as little as three weeks , so those of us who do n't have a bottomless budget can achieve a designer finish
a style album get just as excited for the street style images as the catwalk
antonio berardi 's show was another picked out by a style album for its vibrancy and textures street style is a massive part of fashion month with street style photographers heading to the four fashion capitals to cover outside the shows
favourite looks from london for us were laura of wardrobe icons.com
we love petro 's bright yellow oversized coat from new label raey , available at matchesfashion.com
and laura , matching her lipstick with her valentino clutch a great combination set of by her cream alice & olivia coat
and top marks for the stylish lady in the isabel marant patchwork coat worn over a neutral colour palette
we got the style album team together to take in the atmosphere during lfw
we stayed at the luxurious rosewood hotel , which was great for it 's close proximity to somerset house , the hub of lfw
street style : a style album picked their favourite looks off the catwalk - including petro 's bright yellow coat top marks for the stylish lady in the isabel marant patchwork coat worn over a neutral colour palette ( centre ) it was a real treat to take in some shows and also check out the upcoming designers showcasing their collections at somerset house
we popped by the aspinal x etre cecile collaboration showcasing at the saville club and fell in love with the stunning collection of cool bags and accessories
it was a hectic but enjoyable few days , if a little stressful deciding on outfits ! trying to look smart , stay comfy and practical all while it 's pouring down with rain is n't as easy as tommy ton 's street style stars make it look
we chose a mix of british high street and designer pieces for our london fashion week looks , head to astylealbum.com to shop the looks
