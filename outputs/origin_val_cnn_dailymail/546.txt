the sterling contract situation at liverpool is coming to the boil , after the latest snub from the player âs representatives , and an indication that talks wo nât resume until the summer
brendan rodgers says he âs relaxed but i find that hard to believe
he wo nât want to lose sterling , a talent that he can rightly be proud of , and justifiably claim he has helped turn into a star quality player
but i ca nât understand why liverpool have consistently put the message out that there will not be a problem with the sterling situation
the outcome of that policy is that sterling looks greedy â why do the football club want to make one of their star players look bad in the eyes of the supporters ? sterling 's contract situation at liverpool is unlikely to be resolved until the summer sterling and his representatives are understood to have knocked back the latest Â£ 100,000 - a - week offer chelsea look knackered ... jose mourinho must start putting his faith in youth or he 'll blow the premier league if you view wayne rooney as anything other than a fantastic player then you have no passion for football so now there is a situation locally with fans and the press are questioning his representatives , with the liverpool echo declaring this week that sterling â needs to ask who is looking after his best interests
â the answer to that question is simple
in football terms , liverpool have looked after him
in the same way qpr looked after him before he was snapped up by the reds , and in the same way real madrid might look after him if they choose to pay big money
liverpool ca nât expect too much loyalty from a player who was happy to leave qpr after seven years at loftus road
what goes around comes around , i guess
in financial terms - his agent is looking after his best interests , obviously
he âs got a family , he wants to set himself up comfortably for the rest of his life , and i ca nât think of a reason why a player should nât be allowed to do that
brendan rodgers says he is relaxed about sterling 's contract situation at liverpool sterling left qpr after seven years at the club sterling âs contract runs out in 2017 and there is no way liverpool will want this impasse to continue
if he even approaches the final year of his current deal without this being resolved , liverpool could lose out
the days of a player accepting less than he feels he is worth because he is at a great club that gave him a big opportunity are long gone
it âs naive to think otherwise
a five - year deal of Â£ 100,000 a week has been rejected by sterling
daniel sturridge is on Â£ 150,000 a week
is there a reason why sterling should nât be on the same as daniel sturridge ? sterling is younger , but i âm not sure why age should come into it
sterling has proved he can be a match winner , a key player and is a regular starter for liverpool â same as daniel sturridge
sterling âs fitness record is considerably better , which is unfortunate for daniel sturridge , but when an agent is negotiating on behalf of his player it is definitely something which counts in sterling âs favour
the big difference between the careers of daniel sturridge and sterling is that sterling has proved himself at a much younger age
why should he accept a less lucrative deal because of that ? makes no sense
if a player is committing to a club long - term , then the deal has to be right
the figures are ridiculous â but this is the premier league where players ' salaries are abnormally high
and to expect sterling to launch his own one - man crusade for fairer wages in football is laughable
daniel sturridge is on a contract believed to worth Â£ 150,000 per week at liverpool video rodgers has eye on second place it âs a harsh reality for some who have nât quite caught up with how modern football works , but sterling is an excellent footballer , and his agent is working for his player to get the best deal for him
by making the offer of Â£ 100,000 a week , liverpool have told sterling that he is two - thirds of the player daniel sturridge is
if the agent had accepted that then sterling would surely have sacked him .
