these are the faces of a continent - africa up close and personal
the tight frames they are shot in barely seem to hold these people as they stand proud and stark against deep black backgrounds
the images are the work of kenny , a 38 - year - old photographer who has spent much of the past decade travelling around south , east and africa , pointing his camera at the most unforgettable faces he can find
there is the young mumuhuila girl from angola who illustrates the obsessive pride the women of the tribe take in their hair thanks to the colourful beads , shells and animal oils woven into its strands
a girl from the oromo tribe in eastern ethiopia wears a striking , sequined headscarf
one day she will likely carry an umbrella to shield her from the sun like many older oromo women
the girl on the right is from the wodaabe tribe and is pictured in niger
they are traditionally nomadic cattle - herders and traders in the sahel a girl from the oromo tribe in eastern ethiopia wears a striking , sequined headscarf ( left )

some of the colours worn by the subjects like the girl on the right are stunning a woman from the rendille , a cushitic - speaking ethnic group inhabiting kenya 's north eastern province ( left )
a lady from ethiopia 's hamar tribe ( right )
along with the two countries kenny has also travelled to namibia , ethiopia , kenya , mail , angola , niger , togo and burkina faso and there is a young hamar girl , also from ethiopia , whose neck is festooned with hundreds of tiny glass beads and dainty white shells
it seems as if there 's no room for any more jewellery but as she has yet to find a husband or have a proposal accepted by her father , there are none of the metal necklaces worn from engagement onwards that denote the social status of married women
kenny has travelled round 13 african countries photographing traditional tribesmen and women
these include namibia , ethiopia , kenya , mail , angola , niger , togo and burkina faso on an odyssey which began in 2006 when he made his first six - month trip to africa
the end result of these years of work in tribal african societies is a book , â facing africa â , that was released in late 2013
back in 2006 , he says , ' at the very start of my africa journey , i was buzzing with energy having met people of real magnetism just days into my trip
these young mumuhuila girls from angola illustrate the obsessive pride the women of the tribe take in their hair thanks to the colourful beads , shells and animal oils woven into its strands
kenny travelled through 13 countries to capture intense subjects like these this mother and child are from the dassanech ethnic group in ethiopia
the man is from the nyangatom people in the same country
there are only around 30,000 of them and many are nyangatom are nomadic , residing in mobile livestock villages that may migrate several times a year this lady is also from the nyangatom people ( left )
the girl on the right from niger is a member of the hausafulani people ' i was excited by extraordinary people and fascinating cultures and wondered how i could possibly communicate and express these feelings of excitement to friends and family back home
' kenny 's solution was to remove his subjects from all context , shooting them indoors away from what he calls the ' dull and dusty backgrounds of their immediate environment '
he adds : ' i started to imagine each of these people in front of me emerging from the nothingness of darkness , with no distractions , hoping that this would provide a real feeling of proximity between the viewer and the person in the picture
' the result is to bring out the vividness of the colours and the immediacy of the people 's expressions - sometimes playful , often intense but always arresting
kenny says : ' it 's simply the illumination of natural sunlight , and sun on dry earth , that reaches into the darkness of huts and lights up these remarkable people

this girl from the himba tribe in namibia ( right ) has n't reached puberty yet so she is wearing two plaits ' sun and dry earth are the only ingredients required for the lighting in my prints
' in africa i seem to have made it my goal to travel through some of the remotest areas of the continent where the reaches of urbanisation and 21st century living are barely detectable
' kenny was shot at in northern kenya in 2009
he and his guide were driving along a highway one evening when they glimpsed tiny white flashes ahead of them and were soon engulfed in gunfire
kenny ducked down just in time as a bullet missed his face by only a few inches
but the experience has done nothing to dampen his enthusiasm for capturing the rural people of the continent in all their startling beauty
