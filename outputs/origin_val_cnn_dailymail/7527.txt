in of deadliest and most destructive storms in america history , when the storm hit , photographer taylor , 59 , lost more than 30 years worth of photography work
the 59 - year - old had photographed some of the biggest stories of the 20th century ( from princess diana âs pregnancy to mick jagger âs relationship with jerry hall ) , but when hurricane sandy struck new york in october 2012 , flooding taylor âs entire storage facility , almost all of his work was destroyed
but the pulitzer prize nominee salvaged a fraction of it by dipping hundreds of negatives in alcohol - resulting in them taking on a new psychedelic form
' it also froze the image at that moment in time
it was like taking a snapshot of the picture in that damaged state
taylor said the entire experience has ' been a roller coaster of emotions
' â [ it ] started off as a sense of total loss and devastation
but ultimately this has been a wonderful experience ; a lot of great art came out of it and i 'm happy with what was saved
' taylor , from new york , america , has enjoyed an amazing career that has seen him cover some of the most dramatic events of the 20th and early 21st century
some of his photographs include a photo of a soldier standing guard over wall street after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and a pregnant princess diana walking along a beach in the bahamas

he said : ' it was a pretty amazing moment
i had the honor of being nominated for the pulitzer prize for that one
' i then traveled around the world and i covered all kinds of major stories , celebrations , politicians , sporting events - it was an amazing era
' i had done a number of travels with the pope , i had covered the olympics in moscow , the world cup in argentina , and the invasion of grenada
' but his legacy of work was swiftly destroyed by hurricane sandy , which struck new york in october 2012 , flooding the lockup where taylor kept his archive

he said : ' there was 300 square feet of storage and everything had been floating for a while and then had sunk down to the bottom
' thirty years of my life was down the drain and gone and it had a big impact on me
' there was also the loss of my family 's legacy
i was designated as the family archivist and told my family to give me their pictures so i could take care of them and restore them
' to recover his work , taylor first attempted to wash them , but found it washed away the emulsion leaving a blank negative
he then dipped them in rubbing alcohol to clean off the mold and halt the deterioration
it also resulted in giving them a new psychedelic appearance

' you did n't really see what was going to happen until after it truly dried
' there was then a moment of transition from it being an entire loss to realizing that some of this could actually be quite artistic
' out of the 30,000 photos in his collection , taylor was only able to save about 300
more than 70 examples of his art will be displayed at the ulm , in ulm , germany , from march 26
