coco rocha , 26 , announced the birth of her baby girl on twitter on saturday and shared a snap of her bundle of joy , wearing only a nappy and mittens , with the caption : ' james & i are so proud to welcome into the world our healthy and beautiful baby girl , ioni james conran ! # ioniconran '
james is traditionally a boys name meaning ' supplanted ' , and is derived from the hebrew name jacob
in an interview with the today show reynolds ended months of speculation and finally confirmed his daughter 's name
he joked : ' it is butternut summersquash
no , it 's out there ! it 's out there
everyone knows and i told everyone who would listen that
' coco rocha with her daughter james finally ! ryan reynolds revealed he and wife blake lively have called their daughter james james reynolds , who has been kept tightly under wraps since her birth in december , could be ' jamie ' for short like the actress jamie king , who answered to james earlier in her career
and as well as choosing a non-gender specific name sports illustrated model robyn lawley says she plans to raise her daughter ripley , born in february , in a ' gender neutral ' environment with unisex toys and clothes
in her first interview since ripley 's arrival robyn lawley told brands exclusive magazine : ' i think we separate the genders too greatly by the toys and hobbies
' actors mila kunis and ashton kutcher have gone down the same unisex route by naming their daughter wyatt , an anglo-french surname that means ' brave at war '
the couple came up with the moniker at a lakers game
sixteen girls were named wyatt in america last year compared to almost 8,500 boys , according to the baby name website nameberry.com model robyn lawley says she plans to raise her daughter ripley in a ' gender neutral ' environment mila kunis and ashton kutcher , left , chose wyatt for their baby daughter while kim and daughter north west , right , both have unisex names but reality tv stars the kardashians trump the lot with four unisex names between them
there 's ' momager ' kris , kim , who shares her name with north korean dictator kim jong-un , her daughter north west and model half - sister kendall
and the kardashians , like taylor swift , cameron diaz , reece witherspoon and drew barrymore , prove that having a traditionally male name does n't hinder future success
yet baby name experts and nameberry.com founders pamela redmond satran and linda rosenkrantz say once boys names are adopted for girls , parents tend to abandon them for boys altogether
the duo told the huffington post : ' it 's been a truism that once unisex names become widely used for girls , parents abandon them for boys
' now we see a welcome reverse of that sexist trend with boys reclaiming names that had long been going toward the girls
' ' most recent statistics see boys taking back ground on such popular unisex names as alexis , carey and casey
' and it seems james could become an even more popular choice before the year is out
ladbrokes have 6/1 odds on james being the name given to the new royal baby when prince william and the duchess of cambridge welcome their second child next month
and as we all know , where the duchess of cambridge leads , millions follow
sarah with her daughter robyn , who she says strangers sometimes mistake for a boy unless she is dressed in pink first time mum sarah , pictured , and her husband adam , 32 , decided to call their daughter robyn because robin is sarah 's dad 's middle name and adam 's dad is called robert , which is derived from robin
but six months after little robyn was born in september 2014 sarah , 28 , from rotherfield , east sussex , says unless she dresses her daughter in anything other than pink strangers think she 's a boy
sarah says : ' i do get asked a lot whether she 's a boy or girl , and i 've stopped correcting people sometimes when they think she 's a boy
' we did n't even think about that when choosing her name - i just thought robyn was such a cute name
' we wanted a name that nobody had and i do n't regret our decision
when she 's at school and spelling it everyone will know she 's a girl
it 's just when you 're speaking to people that they do n't realise
