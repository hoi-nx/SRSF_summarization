independent economists such as soumaya keynes have urged both the tories and labour to be more straightforward about spending plans independent economists have urged both the tories and labour to be more straightforward with voters about their post-election tax and spending plans
researchers from the ifs ( ifs ) said that osborne should spell out exactly how he plans to cut welfare spending by Â£ 12billion
they also said that labour âs ideas to deal with britain âs deficit were â less explicit â than the other main parties , and could see ed miliband rack up tens of billions a year in borrowing
yesterday ifs director paul johnson criticised both the major parties over their lack of clarity ahead of may âs general election
referring to the chancellor âs planned Â£ 12billion in welfare cuts , he said : â it is now almost two years since he announced his intention of cutting welfare spending by Â£ 12billion
it âs time we knew more about what that might actually involve
â the chancellor signalled yesterday that a future conservatives government would freeze benefits paid to people of working age for two years from 2016

last week the daily mail also revealed that other measures likely to be included in the conservatives manifesto include restricting child benefit to three children for new claimants , cutting the cap on welfare claims from Â£ 26,000 to Â£ 23,000 per household and removing the right of under - 25s to housing benefit and jobless payouts if they refuse offers of work , training or education
researchers from the ifs said that osborne should spell out exactly how he plans to cut welfare spending by Â£ 12billion multi-billion pound plans to â revolutionise â travel in the north of england will be unveiled today
part of osborne âs â northern powerhouse â strategy , they include new rail routes that could see 140mph trains reduce liverpool to manchester journey times to around 20 minutes
a so - called â transnorth â rail network would link liverpool , manchester , leeds , sheffield , newcastle and hull
the liverpool - manchester route could cost as much as Â£ 13billion , while a plan to reduce journey times between sheffield and manchester from the 48 to 27 minutes could cost up to Â£ 19billion
other plans include new east - west road connections and introducing oyster - style travel cards across the north of england
however even those measures would fall well short of the Â£ 12billion mr osborne needs to find
yesterday ifs economist soumaya keynes also warned that labour âs rules were so loose that the party could end austerity next year and open the public spending tap again
she claimed that labour could increase real - term spending by more than Â£ 9billion a year by 2020 , compared to conservatives plans to lower it by Â£ 14billion by that point
labour has promised that it will balance day - to - day spending at some point during the next parliament , but has not yet specified when that will be
and unlike the conservatives , the party has not committed to balancing all government spending â leaving it free to borrow tens of billions for â investment â
this means that under labour , britain âs Â£ 1.5trillion national debt could continue to grow indefinitely , while the tories would begin to pay it off by the end of the next parliament â meeting david cameron âs pledge to â fix the roof while the sun shines â
yesterday the prime minister said it was clear that labour would borrow , spend and tax more than the conservatives

osborne âs tax boost for orchestras fell flat yesterday when mps claimed brass bands could be excluded
a consultation paper published in january suggested that to qualify , ensembles would have to include string , woodwind , brass and percussion sections
but labour said it would leave out brass bands popular in the north of england and swiftly branded the policy a â trumpet tax â
labour said osborne 's tax boost for orchestras would exclude brass bands ( file picture ) shadow culture minister chris bryant said it would exclude string orchestras like the london sinfonia and accused osborne of being â out of tune â
the treasury later insisted brass bands would be included , insisting the decision had been agreed weeks ago
it said the 25 per cent tax relief from next year will apply to any group of 12 or more musicians playing instruments in any of the four orchestral sections
interest rates could be slashed even closer to zero to keep britain âs economic recovery on track , a senior bank of england official suggested yesterday
chief economist haldane said rates may need to be cut again â having been frozen at 0.5 per cent for more than six years â if inflation threatened to stay too low for too long after it tumbled to 0.3 per cent â its lowest level since 1960
his intervention sent sterling tumbling on global currency markets and came days after bank governor mark carney said a cut would be â extremely foolish â
mr haldane said : â the chances of a rate rise or cut are broadly evenly balanced
