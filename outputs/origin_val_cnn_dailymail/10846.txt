a teenager who went out for a street fight armed with a knife has avoided jail â but boasted of his â ankle rolex â after being given an electronic tag by a judge
saward , 18 , was baited by former friends who called him asking for a scrap outside his home in herne bay , kent , and grabbed a knife to confront the gang
but his father disarmed him before any fight could take place and called police
then , at canterbury crown court last week , he was ordered him to stay indoors overnight for the next four weeks

lesson learned ? do nât play with knives
â judge heather norton said the father âs actions last december prevented the incident from escalating
and phil rowley , defending , said : â his dad should be commended for his behaviour
â the judge told saward : â what you did was a very stupid act
it was not just stupid ; it was also dangerous - not just to others but also to yourself
â people who take knives on to the street should realise the consequences could be fatal
there is a lot of concern about young people arranging fights and then taking knives with them
sentenced : at canterbury crown court ( pictured ) last week , saward was ordered him to stay indoors overnight for the next four weeks
he was also given a community order by the judge â i know you were confronted by a larger group , but you could have stayed inside
â your father âs action in taking that knife away and calling the police may have landed you in court , but probably prevented something more serious from occurring
â possessing a knife in public usually results in an immediate jail term , but the judge gave the teenager a community order
she also took the unusual step of refusing to issue a destruction order for the weapon and returned the kitchen knife to the father , who was present at the court .
