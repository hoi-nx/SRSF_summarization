baghdad , iraq joint iraq forces have started what they believe will be the conclusive push to retake the iraq city of tikrit from isis , a paramilitary force participating in the offensive said tuesday
the forces have started " the decisive operation " to liberate tikrit just over a week after the overall operation began , advancing toward the city from several directions , according to a statement from the predominantly shiite paramilitary force hashd al-shaab
isis was n't making it easy , however
the sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near tikrit , preventing the joint iraq forces from using it to cross the tigris river to approach the city from the east
iraq prime minister haider al-abadi ordered iraq forces on march 1 to retake tikrit and salahuddin province
tikrit , best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraq dictator saddam hussein , fell in june to isis , which has captured parts of iraq and syria for what it says is its islamic caliphate
in the past few days , forces progressed roughly 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) down one road toward the city and , by monday , were about a mile from its center
isis fighters have retreated toward the city center from frontline positions , hashd al-shaab 's media office said tuesday
al-shaab 's forces appear to be leading the fight for tikrit , with support from the iraq army and sunni tribesmen
also assisting is iranians , which has provided advisers , weapons and ammunition to the iraq government
according to the pentagon , there may be iranians operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well
there have been several failed attempts to recapture tikrit since the second half of 2014
if iraq regains control of the city , it could mean that retaking mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible
the tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters
