a california teenager used a little help from a horse named romeo when he rode into his high school to ask a girl to the prom
but gonzales got a little more than he bargained for when he won the girl - and a two - day suspension
gonzales , 17 , borrowed the horse from a friend 's ranch and galloped right on up to catalina hernandez 's first period class , holding a sign that said ' will you ride with me to prom ? ' gonzales , 17 , got a little help from a horse named romeo to ask catalina hernandez to the prom the milpitas high school got the idea from the school 's spirit day theme , which was ' salad dressing day '
he dressed up as a cowboy , boots and all , to represent ranch dressing
hernandez was dressed in a toga to symbolize caesar salad
hernandez and her peers ran out of their classrooms , phones in hand , and she quickly said yes
but the students ' principal was hardly excited by the grand gesture
' i was there for a bit and i knew people would come like security so i tried to leave , ' gonzales told the san jose mercury news
the milpitas high school senior was suspended for his grand gesture , as the school deemed the horse was a ' potential threat ' to other students walking in the same path
but gonzales will still be able to attend the prom ' but on my way i heard the principal screaming ... i kind of knew i was going to get into trouble
' gonzales said he expected to get detention or saturday school , but had no idea he could face suspension
district superintendent cheryl jordan said gonzales was suspended because the horse was a ' potential threat ' to other students who where ' walking in the same path
' the teenager said his only regret was not talking to the principal beforehand about his grand plan and ' trying to figure out a way to do it where i would n't get into trouble '
despite the suspension , gonzales will still be allowed to go to the prom with his date by his side .
