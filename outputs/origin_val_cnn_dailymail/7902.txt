a 13 - year - old girl who underwent gastric sleeve surgery after gaining more than 150lbs and barely being able to move her body has completed her first 5k race a year after the life - saving weight loss procedure
alexis shapiro , from cibolo , texas , who suffers from hypothalamic obesity , a condition that leaves her constantly hungry and unable to lose weight , weighed 203lbs in 2014 despite being only 4 ' 7
after she was denied weight loss surgery by her health insurer because she was ' too young ' , her parents started an online crowdfunding campaign and raised more than $ 86,000 to cover the medical costs
' i still really believe the surgery saved her life , ' her 35 - year - old mom jenny told people
' i do n't even know if we would be here
seeing her do a 5k was just icing on the cake
last year , the 13 - year - old underwent gastric sleeve surgery to help her lose more than 50lbs last year , competing in a race would have been impossible for alexis shapiro , who was almost always in pain because of her size
she began rapidly gaining weight after she sought treatment for her rare brain tumor in 2011 ; the surgery to remove the benign tumor caused damage to her hypothalamus and led to the development of hypothalamic obesity
after gaining 150lbs over the course of two years she developed type 2 diabetes and other obesity - related problems
alexis shapiro had the life - saving surgery last march , but due to complications doctors were forced to perform a gastric sleeve surgery instead of the scheduled gastric bypass

but managing alexis shapiro ' weight is still a constant struggle
her mom , who said ' hypothalamic obesity is a beast ' , admitted to the outlet that her daughter had since put eight to 10lbs back on her frame
alexis shapiro continues to take steroids and growth hormones every day because her brain tumor surgery also left her with panhypopituitarism , a syndrome marked by decreased secretion of most pituitary hormones
getting stronger : the teen was photographed working out in the gym last may vacation time : alexis shapiro was all smiles during a trip to the beach although the treatments make her feel ill and cause her to miss school at least once a week , alexis shapiro is happier than she has been in a long time
' alexis shapiro has a confidence about her that she did nât have before , ' jenny said
' she 's gaining independence little by little and becoming her own person
' jenny also noted that her daughter , who was once home - schooled , now has friends in her class
she maintained that , despite the ongoing complications alexis shapiro is forced to deal with , the surgery was ' really good ' for her
' i 'm baffled by how well she does , especially at her age , ' jenny said
' she 's such a tough girl
