halal involves cutting through arteries in the neck halal halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade , while a muslim butcher recites a religious verse
all blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under islamic law
under islamic law , an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious
non-halal in comparison , the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed
it means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death , as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn - out pain and suffering
once the animal has been killed at the abattoir , it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered
