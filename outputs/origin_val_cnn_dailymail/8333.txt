defender olsson insists blackburn have still not given up hope of a late charge into the championship play - offs and the prospect of an fa cup semi-final place will not distract them from that aim
sunday 's goalless draw at anfield to earn a replay back at ewood park - where they have already dispatched premier league sides swansea and stoke - may have improved their chances of booking a trip to wembley
however , they are likely to have at least five league matches to play before the expected return leg against the reds in early april and , even though blackburn are 14 points adrift of the play - offs , olsson stressed they have to give it one last push
olsson ( right ) says him and his blackburn team mates are only thinking about gaining a play off place ' we do n't really think about the fa cup , ' he told press association sport
' we try to give 100 per cent every game as there is still a chance of getting into the play - offs but we have to concentrate in the last 11 games of the league
' we have a big game at home to liverpool which we will take on when it gets closer but going to anfield , with them on form and being a strong team , will give us a boost
' the full back had a busy game trying to deal with the skill of liverpool 's adam lallana in the fa cup clash rovers matched what fellow championship sides middlesbrough ( in the capital one cup ) and bolton ( fa cup ) have done this season in not getting beat in 90 minutes at anfield
they enjoyed the better of the play before the interval and - but for a brilliant save from simon mignolet - could have won the match with alex baptiste 's header early in the second half
that has given them hope they can claim another premier league scalp at home in a few weeks ' time
' i think playing at anfield we did well and at least deserved another chance at home , ' olsson added
alex baptiste ( 15 ) sees his close range header tipped over the bar brilliantly by simon mignolet ' we had two big chances to score , one of which the goalkeeper made an unbelievable save from , but we play at home now and we are strong there
' we thought we could come here and shake them up a bit
we did very well as a team , defending all over the pitch with the midfielder 's and ( striker ) rudy gestede as well
' we did n't give them too many chances to create in 90 minutes and it was a good day
' rudy gestede ( top scorer this season with 14 goals ) on his day will give any defender a hard time as he is good in the air and hopefully next game he will score against them
