a police officer told the hillsborough inquest if a big gate had not been opened to relieve the crush at the turnstiles , â we would have been dealing with bodies outside the ground â
john morgan , a south yorkshire police sergeant on duty on the day of the football disaster , also said he would have opened the gates himself if more senior officers had not given the order
some 96 liverpool fans died after a crush on the leppings lane terrace of sheffield âs hillsborough ground as the fa cup semi-final against nottingham forest kicked off on april 15 , 1989
but many fans headed straight for the tunnel under the seated upper stand and leading directly to the already - packed central pens of the terrace behind the goal
the tunnel was not closed off by police beforehand and the numbers of fans in each pen was not restricted - with police and club officials having a policy of allowing supporters to â find their own level â by distributing themselves along the terraces
in the run - up to kick - off mr john morgan was in charge of a serial of officers inside the ground at the leppings lane end when a massive crowd built up at the turnstiles with those at the front being crushed and â screaming for help â
he said : â i just could not understand what i was seeing because it was unprecedented
what i would say , i froze , in fact i was gobsmacked
it was an alarming situation
â one guy i remember getting hold of my anorak and saying , â do something , people are getting crushed , open the gates â

â i thought people were going to die
there was imminent danger , â he added
mr john morgan said he had â formed an intention â to open the gates to relieve the pressure but would have first had to get permission from more senior officers first
later he made a statement , saying if gate c had not been opened , â we would have been dealing with bodies outside the ground â
he said he â assumed â there would be a controlled opening of the gates to allow fans to filter into the ground , but was left surprised when gate c was â flung open wide â at 2.52pm
a police officer stands outside hillsborough as jurors on the inquest into the fans ' deaths visit the stadium the former officer told the jury : â at that stage , that took me by complete surprise and i âm forced through the gates and i turn around in mid-stream and try to force my way back outside
' i thought i was going to be trampled under the press behind me
â christina lambert qc , counsel for the inquest , asked mr john morgan if he had himself instructed stewards to open the gates - a suggestion dismissed by the witness
ms lambert continued : â why are you confident you did not give the instruction ? â mr john morgan replied : â because i ca nât remember it
it âs not within my memory , that i knocked on that door and spoke to anybody
i just did not do it
i do nât think i had the rank to be able to issue that order
