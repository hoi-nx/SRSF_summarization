brook has called khan 's bluff regarding a potential grudge fight between the pair - telling his british rival : ' it 's not about money for me
' the calls for khan to finally settle his long - running feud with brook have grown stronger in the last few days , but the bolton fighter insists he has more pressing issues
while khan is keen to meet the ibf welterweight champion ' one day ' , he added he would be keen on a winner - takes - all fight
brook called out khan in an interview after beating dan in sheffield on saturday night khan 's last fight came against devon alexander in december , whom he beat to take his record to 30 - 3 brook , though , is unfazed as he told sky sports news : ' it 's not about money for me
it 's about everywhere i go , ( people asking ) " when are you going to fight him ? "
' it 's public demand now
i think that he 's getting forced in to this fight if he gets in
' brook defended his world title with a four - round demolition job of mandatory challenger dan over the weekend and is supremely confident he could do a similar job on khan , whose much - maligned chin is still considered to be a major weakness
' he 's been knocked down to the canvas by super-featherweights in his career , ' said brook
' he 's fighting a big , strong welterweight in myself who 's a world champion , who 's very confident , who 's never lost , who 's determined to flatten him
' do n't get me wrong , khan is a very , very , very good fighter ; very fast hands , most definitely the fastest hands i will have been in with
but the fact is when i connect on his chin , it 's good night vienna
' i 'm all wrong for him
i 'll find a way to catch him , we 've got 12 rounds
we 'll have the perfect gameplan
' brook demolished dan in sheffield , beating him in just four rounds to retain his ibf world welterweight title khan has previously refused a fight with brook but now promises it will take place within 12 months khan , though , is chasing a showdown with the winner of the mayweather - pacquiao super-fight and told brook earlier on tuesday that he would have to wait his turn
' i 'd love to fight brook because it could be his last fight - i 'd give him so much of a beating that it could end up being his last fight , ' khan told sky sports news
' maybe he wants it because he knows that one fight against me will financially secure him for the rest of his life
' but it 's all about timing
if i 've got a different route and i want to face the likes of mayweather or pacquiao out there ; brook will have to wait
' it 'll happen one day and if brook really wants to fight me , i 'll fight him , but the winner takes all
i 'll do a huge bonus because i know he 's going to lose the fight
' give him a little guarantee , but the guy who wins the fight takes a big lump sum
that 's how confident i am against brook
' brook , pictured celebrating his win over dan on saturday , appears to have got his wish to fight khan promoter eddie hearn has responded to khan by claiming the olympic silver medallist has no interest in meeting his boxer
' khan seems to have this thing in his head about brook not respecting him , ' eddie hearn told sky sports news
' brook does n't want to respect him - he wants to knock him out
brook does n't like him
' it 's a tough fight
you ca n't take anything away from khan - he 's a quality fighter
' i just always felt that brook would win the fight
i do n't think khan would deal with brook 's power
' right now , brook is golden and khan is struggling to find an opponent
whatever opponent he 'll choose on may 30 is n't going to be brook and that 's not what the public want
people will be disappointed with the opponent
' khan has put himself under pressure saying the fight will happen in the next 12 months and we hope so but unfortunately for him , brook 's stock continues to rise and the split is probably getting worse and worse as days go by
' winner takes all ? i 'll believe that when i see it because they have no desire to fight brook
