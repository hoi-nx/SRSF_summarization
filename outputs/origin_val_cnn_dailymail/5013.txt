a natural reaction for a mother is to want to alleviate their child 's pain but just two doses of a mainstream painkiller saw a seven month old baby almost lose her short life
shaw , from toowoomba , about 120km west of brisbane in queensland , is no stranger to motherhood , having had six children in 13 years
however , nothing could have prepared her for the emotions she experienced over her youngest child in the past few weeks
what started out at as a head cold quickly left doctors completely baffled as precious little chasely rapidly deteriorated with her skin burning , swelling and blistering so much that she became unidentifiable to her mother
' ms shaw , a whole food chef who blogs on health and wellbeing , gave chasely two doses of nurofen on tuesday february 26 as she was miserable after battling the head cold for the past week
this was the first time that the seven - month - old had ever taken any medication before but ms shaw thought nothing of it as all of her other five children had taken nurofen in the past
' she seemed a bit better after the first dose and seemed a bit more content but after the second dose she was very cranky and irritable , ' she told daily mail australia
' not what you would expect from a child who has just been given pain relief
' ms shaw immediately had a gut feeling that her little girl has reacted to the medication and read the back of the bottle for potential side effects
' i remember scouring the nurofen bottle for a list of symptoms that might signal an allergic reaction , but could n't find much at all , ' she said
' if i can tell you one thing that has become solidified from this whole experience it is trusting your mama gut
' the nasty blister on her ear ( left ) and her precious skin shedding off all over her body ( right ) the seven - month old became unidentifiable to her own mother who was told by doctors to expect the worst casely needed to be given the powerful painkiller endone to ease her excruciating pain after a very restless night with her unhappy little one - ms shaw knew they had to go to the hospital
' she was waking up every 15 minutes squealing in pain , fists clenched , balling over and clamping down every time i would try to feed her , ' ' by the time we got to the emergency room she had a red ring around her eyes , nose and mouth , her neck also was red and had what i thought was bad nappy rash
' after several tests including an ultrasound they were sent home with a diagnosis of a viral infection
but the next morning , chasely had several nasty blisters on her face and neck , and a very painful one on her ear which was weeping , her nappy rash had become even worse and she had become pale and very ill. they went back to the hospital , where anxieties were even further heightened when the doctors had no idea what was wrong with poor chasely
' the day in emergency was quite scary , i remember reading the faces of the staff and seeing worry , but more than anything seeing confusion , ' she said
' a kind of look that they had no idea what was going on with my baby girl
' ' i hugged her , i whispered in her ear that i needed her to fight on , ' ms shaw said to her sick little girl finally a specialist paediatric doctor suggested it may have been an extremely rare condition called steven johnson âs syndrome - a potentially deadly skin disease that usually results from a drug reaction
' doctors came from all around that afternoon to see chasely and her skin , it terrified me that all these doctors had never seen anything like it before , ' she said
' i mean how could they fix her if they did n't even know what it was ? ' chasely was treated with a high dose antibiotics and panadol for her excruciating pain
' through thursday night she was checked almost hourly , her entire skin was red and hot , she was in such agony and squealed in so much pain
' she would n't sleep away from my arms and even the slightest movement could hurt her
' when ms shaw woke on friday morning , she said she could n't even recognise her own baby
' a doctor told me to prepare for the worst , that my baby girl was extremely sick and extremely fragile
' my heart completely shattered - i thought we would lose her
' it was at this point that ms shaw broke down unable to comprehend a life without her beautiful little girl
' once i got baby chasely to sleep , i escaped to the bathroom and sobbed , ' she said
' i did n't know how to fix this , what do i do next ? i could only give myself over to the hospital , and to a higher power
' but ms shaw decided they were not giving up without a fight
' i returned and i hugged her , i whispered in her ear that i needed her to fight on , just fight this off and we will go home
i gave her all my energy and all my love , ' she said
ms shaw cried when she saw chasely catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing by monday chasely 's fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself numbing gel was used in chasely 's mouth so she could continue feeding and breast milk was used on her wounds along with lukewarm baths with paraffin and later with paw paw
the pain was so bad that she had to be given endone which ms shaw said was extremely frightening as it 's such a heavy duty pain killer but knew she had no choice
finally , by saturday afternoon , chasely started to improve - she was able lay on a bed and look around
' my sister and eldest daughter came to visit and danced for her with toys , and though she could n't smile and laugh i could see she was amused , ' she said
the following day , her swelling started to go down and parts of her body that had blistered first started to heal and ms shaw began to recognise her little girl again
by monday her fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself
' i cried when i saw her catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing
' chasely was released from hospital on tuesday where her skin could be treated at home
almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed chasely of her young life , you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl
' we are absolutely blessed - it puts everything into perspective and everything else just drops away - nothing else in the world matters
' almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed chasely of her young life , you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl she does n't know how she could have gone on if chasely did n't courageously bounce back from such a debilitating state
' i 'm not sure i would have coped very well - i ca n't imagine going through what some parents have , ' she said
chasely must now avoid all steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ms shaw says that they still have a long journey ahead to learn more about her daughter 's condition
but she insists she feels no animosity towards nurofen
' i 'm not waging a war on pharmaceutical companies - i just want to educate and empower people on what can happen , ' she said
' but there is a list of 300 different medications , antibiotics and even vitamins that she can never have so there a lot more to learn on our journey
' ' nurofen is very sorry to hear about chasely shaw âs condition and are glad to hear she is recovering
