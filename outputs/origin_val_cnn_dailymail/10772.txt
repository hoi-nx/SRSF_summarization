a prototype of the highly - anticipated model x has apparently been seen cruising around california
a video by youtuber â nbkagzw13 â claims to show the pure electric vehicle , slightly covered to hide design features , on the road near palo alto
it comes as tesla confirmed to dailymail.com the new model will include autosteering and self parking capabilities announced by elon musk last week
a video by youtuber â nbkagzw13 â claims to show the pure electric vehicle , slightly covered to hide design features , on the road near palo alto the concealment hides its grille , headlights , rear window and taillights , but the car is otherwise undisguised
tesla first unveiled the model x in 2012 with the original prediction of having the luxury crossover ready for sale in 2013
but the launch date has been pushed back several times , and the tesla website currently states that it should be ready in 2016
however , a number of reports suggest the sighting of this test vehicle could mean the model x will hit dealerships as early as this year
and this is nât the first time the model x has been spotted on the roads by tesla enthusiasts
the concealment hides its grille , headlights , rear window and taillights , but the car is otherwise undisguised
a number of reports suggest the sighting of this test vehicle could mean the model x will hit dealerships as early as this year electric vehicles are a useful tool for fighting city summers , according to a new study
switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug - in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island , it said
the term describes what happens when city temperatures are driven higher by heat from traffic and air conditioners and by warmth , stored during the day in roads and buildings , which is released at night
the researcher 's simulation was based on the weather in the chinese capital in the summer of 2012 , when the city was three degrees celsius ( 5.4 degrees fahrenheit ) warmer than the surrounding countryside
switching vehicles to electric would have caused this to fall by 0.94 c ( 1.7 f ) , according to their model
' heatwaves kill , and in terms of climate change , even one degree can make a difference , ' said jianguo liu of michigan state university , who took part in the study
earlier this year , a video emerged of the model x doing handling , braking and acceleration in a private lot
the model x is expected to weigh around 10 per cent more than the model s , but will share 60 per cent of its parts
tesla claims the performance model will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph ( 0 to 97 km / h ) in about 4.4 seconds
last week , the california - based company revealed two key software updates for the tesla model s sedan and the model x that he claims will end ' range anxiety '
the first is a ' range assurance ' app that communicates with tesla 's supercharger network , warning drivers if they are about to run out of power , and pointing them to the nearest supercharger
the second is a trip planner , which will combine the supercharger network with the network of model s cars to improve long - distance journeys for drivers
other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the model s , which should be available in the next three months
the technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel , acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway
in the future , the company will also give driver 's the ability to summon their car to any location .
