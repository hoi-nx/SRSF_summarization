with voices hoarse and complexions pasty after a few snatched hours of sleep , players grinned and sometimes grimaced as their team mates battled to communicate their elation to a relentless mc and a large media throng
' a little hungover , ' australia 's retiring one - day captain clarke said at melbourne 's federation square , when asked how he felt a day after his team 's crushing seven - wicket win over new zealand in the final

' no , look , i think we 're extremely proud
the fact there was a lot of expectation and added pressure put on us at the start of the tournament being a home world cup was something we embraced from the first ball of the tournament
' and i think the boys should be really proud of what we 've achieved
' clarke enjoyed a fairytale finish to his one - day career , hitting a team - high score of 74 in front of a record crowd of over 93,000 and making bowling changes that led to immediate wickets
australia have yet to name a successor but smith , who led the test team against india and enjoyed a fine world cup with the bat , is expected to take the reins
' ( clarke ) was a great captain
he 's been an aggressive captain on the field , sets aggressive fields
he 's got to be somebody that we 'll definitely miss , ' australia paceman johnson told reporters

along with clarke , who will continue to captain the test side , a number of seasoned players are likely to have played their last world cups , including johnson , all - rounder shane watson and wicketkeeper brad haddin
but australia will be able to retain the bulk of their squad and such is their record of regeneration and innovation , they will back themselves to defend their title in england in 2019

australia may not want for batsmen either , with warner , glenn maxwell and smith all easily young enough for a tilt at back - to - back trophies
though the personnel will be important , australia 's drive to remain top of the heap will be essential as teams plot their downfall over the next four years
opening batsman warner laid any doubts about that quality to rest
' our goal is to be number one in all formats , ' he said
