balls today ambushed osborne on live tv by forcing him to agree to take part in a head - to - head election debate on the economy
the tories had tried to argue that they would not discuss the idea of a clash between the would - be chancellors until the leaders ' debate had been resolved - which seems unlikely
but appearing together on bbc one , mr balls forced mr osborne to shake on the deal , raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day
appearing together on bbc one , balls forced osborne to shake on the deal , raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day mr balls insisted prime minister david cameron may be ' scared ' of a one - on - one debate with labour leader ed miliband but he was up for the showdown with mr osborne
after he was put on the spot , the chancellor shook mr balls 's hand but suggested danny alexander , lib dem chief secretary to the treasury , should be included
speaking on bbc one 's the andrew , mr osborne said he was sure an election debate between the different finance spokesmen of the parties would take place
asked if he was keen on the debate , shadow chancellor mr balls replied : ' of course , and i would like to go further
osborne and i do n't need the broadcasters to sort these things out
mr osborne tried to claim that his lib dem deputy danny alexander should be included as well ' osborne is not a coward
david cameron does n't want a head - to - head with ed miliband but i 'm very happy - i will have a head - to - head debate , just the two of us , the potential chancellors during the election campaign
addressing mr osborne , he said : ' you can say now - are you up for it ? ' the chancellor replied : ' as i say , happy to have these chancellors ' debate , just as we did in the last election
' mr balls extended his hand out to mr osborne to shake on a one - on - one debate , telling the chancellor : ' come on george , let 's go for it
' mr osborne appeared hesitant , saying he would be happy to meet mr balls in a debate
he shook the shadow chancellor 's hand , adding to mr balls : ' we 're going to see who else wants to be part of it
i have got a very effective chief secretary who i think would also want to be part of that debate
' mr balls added : ' if only david cameron was up for a one - to - one debate like osborne , it would be alright - for some reason david cameron is running scared
' mr osborne said : ' i think we should include danny alexander
' mr balls countered : ' no , one - to - one
we just shook on it
' speaking on bbc 5 live 's pienaar 's politics , mr balls said he was unsure if mr osborne had agreed to the debate or not
he said : ' he started shaking hands and he was agreeing to a head - to - head debate with me
by the end of the handshake it sounded like he wanted to bring along his deputy danny alexander
' it was clear and then it was unclear
i thought osborne was going to do what david cameron has ducked for weeks and weeks
' he started the handshake doing it - by the end , constructive ambiguity i think
' labour 's balls squirmed today as he repeatedly refused to rule out entering a power - sharing deal with the snp
a surge in support for the scottish nationalists looks set to deprive labour of a majority and leave nicola sturgeon 's mps holding the balance of power
lib dem leader nick clegg today vowed never to enter coalition with a party which wanted to break up the union
uncomfortable : shadow chancellor balls appearing on bbc one 's the andrew today but mr balls refused to match the promise , despite being challenged as many as 12 times during a tv interview
he would only say that labour has ' no plans , no need , no desire ' for a pact with the snp
challenged on bbc one 's andrew show , mr balls said parties who ignore the need to tackle the country 's deficit are ' completely wrong ' and ' irresponsible '
but his opposition to the snp did not stretch to categorically ruling out sitting in cabinet with them
told by mr andrew to say the words " i rule it out " , mr balls replied : " ed miliband said it 's nonsense
it 's not part of our plans
' you know andrew , you 've been covering politics for 30 years , parties , large parties at this stage say we 're fighting for a majority and we are
' i 'm not going to get involved in speculation about post-election deals
' we 're fighting for a majority
