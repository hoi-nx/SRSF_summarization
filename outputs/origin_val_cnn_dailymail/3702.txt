it had to be james milner , did n't it ? the man who already has social media history woke up this morning to find himself , once again , the unwitting subject of sniggers around the globe when a video of him being nutmegged by messi before awkwardly tumbling on the nou camp went viral

messi made james milner famous ' bolton 's on - loan midfielder barry bannan wrote messi ' ai n't human ' after his ridiculous skills the inference behind the giggles was loud and clear - the dour englishman was shown up by the silky - skilled argentinian master and he really had no right to be on the same pitch
but who does ? not many on the planet could have lived with messi as he waltzed and weaved through the parting sky blue seas on wednesday night
at times it appeared as though he was playing a different sport
james milner was not alone in being made to look foolish
messi was in stunning form , producing an incredulous nutmeg that drew gasps from the football world stoke city goalkeeper jack butland echoed gary neville , tweeting ' watching the game with my legs closed ' the argentina ace leaves james milner on the floor after passing the ball through his legs and skipping past him he will , however , take all of this in his stride
the latest twist in a season which , for him , has been far from boring

but show me a player who does all the things that james milner does well and there is nât one

i used him this season as a forward and the team was scoring three goals a game
â you leave him on the bench and he is furious , but watch him during the game , encouraging and shouting
and in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes
' it âs very difficult to find another james milner â an intelligent player , with big balls and a massive heart
â manuel pellegrini insists that it would be difficult to find a more ' complete ' player than james milner james milner has only started 15 premier league games , making most of his appearances from the bench all of the above counts for nothing when the twittersphere goes into a mean meltdown
but it matters to others who are ready to pounce should manchester city fail to reach an agreement to extend a deal that runs out in the summer
at home , liverpool and arsenal have registered an interest
at the turn of the year there were approaches from clubs abroad and offers of pre-contract agreements
none were signed because james milner , as always , wants to do the right thing and to him that is honouring the deal he signed at the etihad
manuel pellegrini is keen to get a new deal done
but the man with big balls is playing hard ball - and he has every right to do so
