older women are dying needlessly from breast cancer because they are not offered screening on the nhs , mps warn
they say it is wrong that women are no longer invited for mammograms once they reach 70 when they are more likely to die than those in their 50s and 60s
the all-party parliamentary group on breast cancer also warns that an age - bias in the nhs is denying thousands of older women life - saving surgery and chemotherapy
they say attempts by ministers to end this culture have been â limited â , â disappointing â and â too slow
â the all-party parliamentary group on breast cancer says it is wrong that women are no longer invited for mammograms once they reach 70 when they are more likely to die than those in their 50s and 60s ( file image ) although the risk of breast cancer slightly declines once a women reaches 70 , she is actually more likely to die from the illness than younger age groups
this is because the illness is often diagnosed in the late stages when it has already spread to the liver , brain or lungs and is difficult to treat
experts say older women are less mindful of the symptoms than younger generations and tend to have a stoical attitude so do nât want to bother their gp the nhs âs screening programme invites women for three - yearly mammograms between the ages of 50 and 70
older women can still have x-rays for free but they must go to the trouble of finding a clinic and booking an appointment on their own initiative
mps also fear that thousands of older women are being denied life - saving surgery or chemotherapy tory mp steve brine , chairman of the group , said this led women to wrongly assume that once they had passed 70 they were â in the clear â
he added : â there are generational issues
young women are quite comfortable about talking about this whereas the older generation are nât
â we are concerned at the slow pace of change
whilst some progress has been made , there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care , treatment and support that is most appropriate to them
' women should be given treatment on their fitness , not their age
â there are 8,300 cases of breast cancer in the uk a year in women in their 70s , compared to 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s
' but more than half of the 12,000 women who die of breast cancer a year are over 70
dr fran woodard , of macmillan cancer support , said : â too often older people do nât get treatment when they need it
' also , older women are more likely to have the perception that they are wasting a doctor âs time , which means they can delay visiting a doctor and are therefore more likely to be diagnosed later
â scientists have developed a scoring system to predict the risk of developing heart disease or a stroke within ten years
the globorisk calculator , developed to work out risk in any country , can be used for adults aged 40 and over using information about their individual health and from national databases
the us team that developed the system tested it in 11 countries , including england , where the proportion of men found to be at high risk of having a fatal heart attack or stroke within ten years is 12.9 per cent and of women 10 per cent â on a par with mexico
dr goodarz danaei , of the harvard th chan school of public health in boston , who led the research , said the system could help identify those at risk who are most likely to benefit from lifestyle changes or preventive drugs
the study , using data from 50,000 people , was published in the lancet diabetes & endocrinology journal .
