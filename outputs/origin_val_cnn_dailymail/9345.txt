updated : but the new edition of fowler 's dictionary of modern english usage fiercely opposes some of the foibles of the english language today do n't say ' like ' , avoid the word ' awesome ' and never drop your aitches - the latest edition of the ultimate guide to the english language has been revised for the 21st century
the new edition of fowler 's dictionary of modern english usage has just been released , and has been revised to take on the language battles of the current generation
compiler jeremy butterfield has inserted some strident views into the dictionary - saying that people who use the word ' like ' deserve to face physical violence
he also risks charges of snobbery , by writing that anyone who says ' haitch ' instead of ' aitch ' appears ' unspeakably uncouth ' to older generations
but the new fowler 's does make some concessions to the modern world - traditionalists may be angry to discover that the book accepts the use of the world ' literally ' to mean ' metaphorically '
fowler 's dictionary was first published in 1926 , written by fowler , and it rose to fame as the definitive guide to what is and is n't acceptable in the english language
however , in the intervening decades the book has fallen out of fashion , as modern trends have reacted against notions of ' correct ' and ' incorrect ' language use
mr jeremy butterfield 's new edition , published by oup last week , attempts to re-establish the reputation of fowler 's guide
among the words which he says should be banned are ' challenging ' , ' awesome ' and ' issue ' , because they have all become clichÃ©s , according to the times
he also outlaws the use of the word ' achingly ' when attached to ' trendy ' or ' hip ' , saying it should be reserved for situations where someone is actually in pain
similarly , he insists that the word ' nubile ' should mean ' marriageable ' , not ' sexually attractive ' as it is often used nowadays
but he reserves his most furious broadsides for the word ' like ' , used by younger generations to pepper their sentences regardless of whether it serves any linguistic purpose
author : the first edition of the work was published by lexicographer fowler , pictured left , and the latest edition has been revised by jeremy butterfield , right mr jeremy butterfield - who admits to sometimes being a ' grumpy old man ' - writes : ' overuse will cause listeners outside the speaker 's immediate social circle , wider social group or age cohort to ignore the content of the message , to assume that the speaker is little short of brain - dead , or , in extreme cases , to wish they had a discreet firearm to hand
' in an even more contentious passage , the author suggests that people who drop their aitches or pronounce the letter as ' haitch ' are marking themselves out as socially inferior to others
he points out that george carey did not pronounce aitches when he was young , but changed his speech as he grew older , eventually reaching the top of the establishment as archbishop of canterbury
' there would be no doubt that george carey would not have risen to that position if he had continued to do so , ' mr jeremy butterfield writes
the dictionary is available from the oup as a hardback or - in a sign of the times - as an e-book for kindle and other devices .
