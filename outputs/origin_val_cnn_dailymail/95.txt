' upon leaving , she met two young men
one of them grabbed her hair , pulled on her veil and insulted her
' after the final few blows and a some more insults - including death threats - the two boys ran away , leaving her extremely shocked
' the assailant 's friend reportedly stopped the attack from continuing before the pair shouted racist abuse and threatened to kill her
33 - year - old munir described himself and his wife as ' french and muslim ' said the men took offence to the headscarf even though she was dressed conventionally in tracksuit bottoms and a jacket
their local mp christophe borgel was outraged after hearing about the attack and claims that it was ' without a doubt ' racially motivated
he told the local : ' i was shocked to learn of this attack
this french woman of muslim faith was attacked because she was wearing the traditional headscarf

racially motivated : her husband munir says they grabbed her hair and pulled at her veil while yelling ' none of that here ' at the woman who is nine months pregnant ( file photo , victim not pictured ) banned : islamic clothing has been a divisive issue in french and the country banned full - face veils from all public areas in 2010 ( pictured in 2010 ) ' i condemn this act of extreme cowardice and inhumanity in the strongest terms
' there was a similarly violent incident in june 2013 when a pregnant muslim woman was assaulted in the suburbs of paris by two alleged ' skinheads ' for wearing a face - veil
the woman tragically suffered a miscarriage but it remained unclear with she lost her baby directly because of the attack
islamic clothing has been a divisive issue in french and the country banned full - face veils from all public areas in 2010 after outlawing headscarves from all state schools in 2004
but french authorities have been concerned by a rise in islamophobia since the horrific terror attacks in paris in january
in the two weeks following the shootings there were 128 anti-muslim incidents registered , which is almost the same number as in the whole of 2014 .
