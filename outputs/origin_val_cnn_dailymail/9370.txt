the head of the catholic in england today said he was ' dismayed ' that immigration is a major concern for voters ahead of the general election
cardinal vincent nichols , the archbishop of westminster , insisted parts of uk would ' grind to a halt ' without immigrants , the vast majority of whom ' work hard and make a very positive contribution '
cameron 's promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands was left in tatters last week when it emerged the figure reached almost 300,000 in the year to september
cardinal vincent nichols , the archbishop of westminster , insisted parts of uk would ' grind to a halt ' with immigrants , the vast majority of whom ' work hard and make a very positive contribution ' mr cameron has admitted that his failure to fulfil his pledge has fuelled public concern about the numbers of people moving to the uk
in a letter sent to catholic churches across the country , the church 's bishops warn : ' there is a great danger of blaming immigrants for the ills of society
' vincent nichols told bbc one 's andrew marr show that ' every party has to be tested on its approach to immigration '
' no government in the last three decades has solved the problem of immigration , so it is a really difficult issue
' asked if he was dismayed that immigration is such a big issue in the election , he replied : ' well i am because i do think we need to go back and say what is our stance towards the world around us ? ' do we see ourselves genuinely as a player , as a contributor wanting to build something that is better for everybody ? ' net long - term migration to the uk was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending september 2014 , a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier mr cameron has claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue polling data shows the level of public concern about immigration is higher when the numbers coming to uk have risen
vincent nichols added : ' what i want to keep saying is these are people we 're talking about â the people who drown in the mediterranean trying to get into europe , the people who are caged in calais because they 're desperate
' we have to somehow keep the human person at the front of all of these issues and remember that this city , for example , would grind to a halt without the contribution of people who 've come to this country
labour 's cooper warned immigration into uk is too high but claimed setting a target is the wrong approach ' the vast majority of immigrants come here and work hard and make a very positive contribution
that 's the tone in which we should be having this debate
' a record 624,000 arrived in uk in a year , up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months
at the same time , 327,000 left , a figure which has barely changed since 2010
a total of 37,000 romanian and bulgarian arrived in the uk , up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months
of these , 27,000 were coming for work , a rise of 10,000 on year , after work restrictions were lifted in january 2014
despite the humiliation of his broken promise , the prime minister has vowed to stick to his target of cutting net migration below 100,000
mr cameron said last month : ' back in the 1980s when we had an open economy , we had migration in the tens of thousands , and do you know what immigration ceased to be for many years a political issue on our country
' he added : ' i believe that we would be a better , stronger country if we had net migration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands
' today labour 's cooper warned immigration into uk is too high but claimed setting a target is the wrong approach
the shadow home secretary said her party would focus on illegal immigration and short term student visas in an effort to bring net migration down
asked whether immigration was too high , ms cooper told bbc one 's andrew marr show : ' yes and we have said that before and we would like to see it come down
' pressed on whether labour would set a target for net migration , she said : ' he ( mr cameron ) failed in that approach
' i think that is the wrong approach to take because what he 's done is he set a target for net migration , he said no ifs no buts he was going to meet it , and in fact the actual level is three times the target that he set
' and also a net migration target puts all immigration in together , so it treats students , alongside people coming to work alongside people who are looking for work alongside people who might have come for family reasons , alongside refugees
' it puts all of those different kinds of immigration together
i think that is the wrong approach
