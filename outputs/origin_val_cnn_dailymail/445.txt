last week she was unveiling her new clothing collection for dorothy perkins in newcastle and today she 's modelling her summer range , so is amy essex 's most successful export ? it would appear so
the beautician - turned - designer , who found fame on towie , became a millionaire thanks to her burgeoning brand - and there 's just no stopping her
speaking to femail about her chic new range of springtime skater dresses , peplums , strappy tops , and feminine blouses , amy , 23 , said : ' i âve really branched out for ss15
' i wanted to give more options for all the girls out there who are going on holiday , going out , going to a lovely spring wedding - all of those things
i always sit down and think about what everyone wants in a collection , i look on twitter , ask my friends and my mum and look at trends
it âs a long process but i love it
' amy has certainly been shaking things up in the wardrobe department and says while she believes people sometimes see her as one dimensional , she says that behind closed doors she 'd love to go wild with her style
' i âd love to be a style chameleon , ' she said
' i âm always looking in magazines at celebrity style and campaign shots
i style my friends sometimes and they style me ; i love trying new things
' amy says that she wanted to give the ' lovely ladies ' something to dress up in that updated their wardrobe but also flatters and admits she 's been thinking long and hard about her new designs while her former towie co-stars do support her fashion career , amy has her sights set on hollywood and would love to dress khloe kardashian and dakota johnson in her designs despite her successes , amy still believes that , like victoria beckham , it 's difficult to be taken seriously as a designer after finding fame in another industry
' i âve tried hard to break out of that towie box and i think i âve done that , ' she said
' i was only on there for two seasons but people instantly pigeon hole you as " essex " , but that âs not what i âm about and my collection is for everyone ; i do nât just design for towie fans
' while her former co-stars do support her fashion career , amy has her sights set on hollywood
' i âd love to dress dakota johnson , ' she admitted
' she âs so stunning
she has such striking features that she can really have fun with her fashion and still look elegant
khloe kardashian is another one - she has such amazing curves and is so stunning
i would love to have her in one of my dresses ; she would look amazing
' amy believes that , like victoria beckham , it 's difficult to be taken seriously as a designer after finding fame in another industry amy loves looking at celebrity style and campaign shots for design inspiration and loves to style her friends for now , amy will be donning her own designs as she jets off on holiday with friends for some ' sun , sea and sangria '
' i âm really looking forward to relaxing somewhere sunny with friends â i spend most of the year being businesswoman amy so it âll be nice to kick back and just be fun amy , ' she said
' i go on holiday with my best friend usually ; i would love to share it with someone special though , maybe in the future ? , ' she teased
she does , however , admit that men ' definitely ' struggle to approach her because of who she is
she said : ' some of my guy friends say they âve heard that guys have not come and said " hi " to me as they were intimidated
i do nât get it though
' so what kind of relationship is amy looking for ? ' one like the beckhams ' , ' she said
' they have their own businesses and things going on yet they still make time for each other to be a family
that âs the perfect relationship : still doing what you love and having that person to come home to
' amy will be donning her own designs as she jets off on holiday with friends for some ' sun , sea and sangria '
