ed miliband today admitted the race for number 10 is ' neck and neck ' as he launched labour 's election campaign at the olympic park
the labour leader used a speech at the top of the orbit tower overlooking the london 2012 stadium to urge a ' spirit of optimism ' and a belief that ' britain can do better ' he signalled once again that the nhs will be at the heart of his bid for power , announcing a new cap on the profits private firms can make from the health service
polls suggested david cameron secured a narrow victory over his rival , but labour strategists believe it exposed the prime minister 's refusal to go head - to - head in a debate
mr ed miliband sought to counter claims his leadership has been too negative , vowing : britain can do better than this '
he told activists gathered at the top of the 114metre sculpture at the heart of the olympic park : ' as we go out to fight this election , just remember : ' they 're the pessimists
i know this election is going to be tough
' like so many races here during the olympics , it may come down to the wire
' i know our opponents will throw everything they have our way
' but he insisted that labour has ' a better plan , a better future '
introducing mr ed miliband , deputy leader harriet harman said he had ' put us within touching distance of winning this general election '
mr ed miliband laid out his pitch for power the morning after his mauling at the hands of jeremy paxman in the first tv contest of the campaign mr ed miliband announced a labour government would act to ensure health services are no longer ' threatened ' by privatisation mr ed miliband announced a labour government would act to ensure health services are no longer ' threatened ' by privatisation
but he was forced to defend himself against claims that he was scaremongering by referring to ' privatisation ' when no patients are expected to pay for their treatment up front
under labour 's plans , a new profit cap - usually 5 per cent - would be set on outsourced healthcare contracts worth over Â£ 500,000 , private companies would be blocked from ' cherry - picking ' lucrative treatments and the nhs would become the ' preferred provider ' for all services
mr ed miliband said of the profit cap : ' we do think it 's right to say , when private sector companies are involved , we do n't get excess profits which is draining money away from the national health service
' look , i think this is going to be common - sense thing that people will think is the right thing to do
i hope other parties adopt this because it 's the right thing to do for the future of our nhs
' mr ed miliband set off on his campaign battlebus , urging supporters to be ' optimistic ' for the future senior shadow minister ed balls , ivan lewis , sadiq khan , rachel reeves , harriet harman , tristram hunt , yvette cooper , douglas alexander and chuka umunna posed with mr ed miliband outside the bus on people paying for private healthcare , he added : ' what is the real lesson of the past on this - the lesson before 1997 and a lesson i fear for the future if david cameron were to get back in ? ' it 's that people end up having the option of either waiting for an unacceptably long time or having to go private - that that becomes the offer on the table for people
' so i think there is a real fear that that becomes the option for people and you do n't have a health service that is properly serving people so there 's a big choice at this election and a big choice about the health service on the ballot paper
' tory health secretary jeremy hunt said : â if you bankrupt the economy like labour did last time â then you âll put our nhs at risk
we can only have a strong nhs if we have a strong economy , but ed miliband does nât have an economic plan
â we all know labour want to â weaponise â the nhs but this is another policy from ed miliband that looks ill - thought through
it risks higher infection rates , higher waiting times and chaos for our nhs
this incompetence is exactly why ed miliband is simply not up to the job
