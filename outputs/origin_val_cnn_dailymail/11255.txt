a star that is travelling fast enough to escape the gravitational clutches of our galaxy has been discovered by a team of astronomers
the amazing stellar object attained its rapid speed when a nearby star exploded as a supernova , sending it out of the milky way
at its current speed it would make the journey from earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the apollo spacecraft three days
scroll down for a video showing an artist 's impression of the event astronomers in hawaii have found the fastest ' unbound ' star in the galaxy
called us 708 it is moving at 745 miles ( 1,200km ) per second
it will leave the galaxy in about 25 million years
this artist 's concept shows a star ( left ) being ejected from the galaxy , although in reality the supernova would have been faded long ago the star , known as us 708 , was first discovered in 1982 by dr peter usher of pennsylvania state university but had since then remained ignored
however , a team of astronomers led by the university of hawaii at manoa has now re-examined the star , and found that it breaks the galactic speed record for an ' unbound ' star
us 708 is almost 62,000 light - years from earth , and is on a path that will take it out of the milky way in about 25 million years
type 1a : a white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes
non-standard type 1a : two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion
type ii : a star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a core collapse as its fuel runs out , causing it to explode
type 1b and 1c : a star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds
hypernova : extreme type of supernova , 50 times as energetic as other supernovas , resulting in a black hole
the exact cause of them is unknown
using the 10 - metre keck ii and pan-starrs1 telescopes in hawaii , the astronomers calculated that the star is moving at about 745 miles ( 1,200km ) per second
this makes it the fastest â rogue â star in the galaxy - one that is no longer orbiting the centre
â at that speed , you could travel from earth to the moon in five minutes , â said dr eugene magnier of the university of hawaii at manoa
â by observing the sky repeatedly over several years , the pan-starrs1 survey , let us make a movie of the motions of the stars in the sky
â that enables us to study the behavioirs of extremely rare and weird stars like us 708
â while a handful of other stars escaping the galaxy are known , this is the first to have been found that was ejected by a thermonuclear supernova explosion
us 708 , which is a helium - rich white dwarf , was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up
at the speed us 708 is travelling it would make the journey from earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the apollo astronauts three days
pictured is the view of earth seen by the apollo 8 crew as they circled the moon in december 1968 this particular class of supernova is known as type 1a , where material is transferred between one star and another until one reaches a critical mass , and explodes
often , the secondary star is obliterated in the resulting explosion , or pushed away at a more sedate speed
it is ' pushed ' away because the loss of its companion means it no longer has a star to orbit , but retains its forwards momentum , so it is flung into space
the specific characteristics of this binary system , its distance and the mass of its companion , allowed us 708 to remain intact while still achieving record speeds for an unbound star
stars like the sun are bound to our galaxy by its gravity , and orbit its centre at relatively moderate velocities , typically tens to a few hundreds of kilometres per second
only so - called hyperveolocity stars are known to travel so fast that they are unbound to the galaxy
us 708 , which is a helium - rich white dwarf , was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up ( illustration shown )
it is the first star found to be leaving the galaxy caused by such an event , and could provide an insight into these types of supernova in addition , to escape from the milky way an object needs to exceed the â escape velocity â - the strength of its gravitational pull
the escape velocity of our galaxy is about 375 miles ( 600km ) per second , which us 708 easily exceeds
astronomers hope that studying the star could help reveal how such helium - rich stars and thermonuclear supernovae are linked .
