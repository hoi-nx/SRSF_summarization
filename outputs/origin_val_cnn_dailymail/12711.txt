sen. harry 's harry reid 's perfunctory announcement on friday that he wo n't seek re-election next year -- leaving a vacancy for leadership of the senate -- was followed , hours later , by a matter - of - fact statement in an interview with the washington post : " i think schumer should be able to succeed me
" that would usher in a whirlwind of activity on capitol hill in the next year as new york 's senior senator prepares to seize the reins of power -- and retool the party as a center - left powerhouse that can win and hold a majority in 2016 and beyond
left - leaning activists have begun scrambling to block schumer 's rise
the progressive organization democracy for america is calling for sen. elizabeth warren to seek the leadership post , and the left - leaning daily kos website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing schumer as too close to the " wall street wing " of the democratic
with more than a year to go before senate will choose a new leader , anything can happen
but after watching schumer in action for more than 20 years , i 'd be surprised if he gets outsmarted in a political moment he has literally been working for a generation to create
with more than $ 13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers , schumer has more money than all but one member of the senate -- and is the only democrat in the top 10 in that category
he ran the democratic senatorial campaign committee when it took the majority in 2006 -- and while senate lost the majority during his second stint in the job in 2012 , the field looks far more promising for them in 2016 : republicans must defend 24 seats , while senate need to protect only 10
schumer brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight
even among the 100 - member senate -- home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos -- schumer has long operated at a high - octane level of smarts and media - savvy brashness that impress and occasionally startle his colleagues
republican bob dole , a longtime lion of the senate , once quipped that the most dangerous place to be in the capitol hill is between schumer and a television camera
the joke stuck -- but behind the gag is a sign of grudging respect for a man who excels at the basic block - and - tackle necessities of political life
schumer is attuned to television and radio ( growing up in the world 's media capital will do that )
in fact , he popularized a practice of holding press conferences on sunday , a slow news day guaranteed to draw reporters -- and ensure him prominent placement in the monday newspapers
but he is also a consummate street politician : at 64 , he maintains a habit of biking around new yorkers neighborhoods without fanfare or an entourage , quietly noting local problems and occasionally inviting himself into a block party or parade
when a reporter once casually asked him to name all 62 counties of new york , schumer did her one better , and hand - sketched a map of the state with all the counties filled in
( he visits every county in the state every year
) schumer is n't the only politically ambitious kid from brooklyn -- before attending harvard , he graduated from a public school , james madison high , whose alumni include supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg , sen. bernie sanders and ex- sen. norm coleman of minnesota ( a childhood pal of schumer 's )
but schumer 's political climb been a long - term work in progress
he emerged on the national stage as a prime sponsor of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 , a law that banned assault weapons ; in the run - up to the final vote , new yorkers practically could n't turn on television without seeing schumer , then a congressman , on the floor of the house , waving a rifle over his head as he argued for the ban
the higher profile served him well a few years later , when schumer took on -- and defeated -- three - term incumbent sen. alfonse d'amato
as a senator on the rise , schumer attracted politically ambitious staffers who moved on to high - profile positions where they can help their former mentor
a very partial list of those includes howard wolfson , phil singer and blake zeff , who went on to help run hillary clinton 's 2008 campaign ; ben lawsky , who is now shaking up the world of finance as new york 's top banking regulator ; preet bharara , who has become an anti-corruption powerhouse as a america attorney ; and rodney capel , who is executive director of the state 's democratic
with allies , money and the blessing of harry reid , schumer is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book , " positively american , " which lays out a vision for how senate should lead america
like schumer himself , the book is savvy , hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle - class voters
those who wonder what a schumer senate leadership would look like should take a look as senate prepare for what could well be the start of the schumer era on capitol hill .
