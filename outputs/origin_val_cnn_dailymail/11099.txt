apple has unveiled its watch today in what is the company 's first completely new product since the death of founder steve jobs
a press event held in san francisco revealed the collection that will range in price from $ 349 to $ 17,000 ( Â£ 299 to Â£ 13,500 in the uk )
it comes in three models : the apple watch , sport and lg , and all are sold in either 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions
the devices are due to go on sale on april 24 , but how do they compare to rivals ' smartwatches ? and can apple crack the market that has only seen limited sales to date ? here mailonline looks at its main competitors in the increasingly crowded market
apple 's watch is available in three models : the watch , sport and lg ( shown ) and all models will be sold in 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions
apple watch is made of stainless steel , sport is made of aluminum and the premium edition comes in 18 - karat rose gold and yellow gold moto 360 the moto 360 watch launched in september 2014 and won praise for its stylish , circular design that was seen as being a move away from the bulky and computerised - looking pebble steel , samsung and lg
it features a 1.5in lcd touchscreen encircled by a thin metal band and is powered by google 's android wear operating system
the moto 360 360 - which is available now in the us - is also $ 100 cheaper than the apple watch
despite its impressive design and promises that the watch lasts for 24 hours , tests have shown this averages at around 12 - six hours less than the apple watch and almost two days shorter than the samsung gear s. like with apple 's watch , batter life depends on usage
the device reviews at the time of its launch were mixed
' like all other watches in this class , you 'll have to get used to charging every night , and occasionally you 'll need to top off during the day , ' wrote android central
' the display resolution is n't as good as other choices
and the android wear software itself is still is in its infancy
' the moto 360 launched last year and is available for $ 250 in the us and Â£ 199 in the uk gear s samsung - the world 's biggest smartphone manufacturer - was early to launch a range of smartphones to counter slow earnings in its mobile sector
this included the galaxy gear that was released in september 2013
despite their early foray into the market , their appeal and functionality was limited and the galaxy gear was too big for even the largest wrists
the gear s was unveiled in august 2014 its new watch is called the gear s and has a larger curved amoled screen than its predecessors at two inches ( 5cm )
it is designed to fit more comfortably on the wearer 's wrist than its previous models
the watch is large enough so that users will be able to read messages and notifications at a glance
the screen can be customised â as well as the colour of the straps
it offers 3g , bluetooth and wi-fi connectivity , so that users can receive notifications from social networks , calendars and apps , without needing to use their smartphone
people wearing the device can reply to messages by using an onscreen keyboard or 's voice functionality ' so they can dictate a message
engineer and tech expert sami mughal from oxgadgets told mailonline : ' apple are marmite at the moment ; you either love them or hate them
' most android wear fans fall in the latter category , and they 'll probably go straight for anything that comes with the samsung badge on it
' the watch is the cheapest on the market at $ 199 and has an impressive battery life of two to three days , meaning users do not have to charge their watch every night
however , the watches run on tizen os , a fledgling mobile operating system , rather than google 's android wear software
lg g watch r lg joined motorola as the latest manufacturer to release a smartwatch with a round face in september last year
it runs android wear , has a 1.3in diameter touchscreen and comes with 4gb of storage
as well as being waterproof , the watch features a heart - rate sensor on the rear , but does n't have a gps sensor
it connects to any android wear phone running 4.3 or higher , via bluetooth , and can also be controlled using voice commands
at $ 332 it is more expensive than the moto 360 and the samsung gear s , but is still cheaper than the apple watch
' android wear needs more work , ' said john mccann at techradar
' it feels odd talking to your wrist and the price tag is hard to swallow
the lg watch r is available with a choice of two straps , the first is made from leather , while the second is a metallic - link strap huawei watch the huawei watch is powered by android wear , has a 1.4 - inch touchscreen and comes with a built - in heart rate monitor
the crown , frame and hinge are made of scratch - resistant stainless steel and there will be 40 watch faces to choose from when it launches later this year
the watch will be available later this year across europe , asia and the us although the exact date and price information has not been announced
the 1.4 - inch display has a resolution of 400 x 400 pixels , giving it a 286 pixel - per - inch ( ppi ) density
by comparison , the moto 360 which also has a circular screen has a ppi of 205
ppi is an indicator of image sharpness , clarity and colour and the higher the number , the better
the firm has not yet revealed battery life details but said it would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with the device
last week , mailonline 's victoria woollaston tested the gadget at mobile world congress in barcelona
' the screen is bright and clear , but its size and the fact it is predominantly used to show notifications means there is little added benefit to this , ' she said
' there will be a range of straps available when the watch launches and i can see it being popular with both sexes
previous watches such as the moto 360 feel more masculine , for example
' huawei would not be drawn on battery life or pricing and these will be key to its success , but it is certainly the most stylish and luxurious smart watch i âve seen
' huawei chief executive richard yu , pictured , unveiled the watch in barcelona earlier this month
