a stately - home has been transported back to its condition in the second world war after six months of painstaking restoration
today , the hard work paid off as the time - capsule building was re-opened by the great british bake-off 's mary berry
mary berry opened the warwickshire stately home to celebrate the house 's incredible transformation and to mark the seventieth anniversary of the end of the conflict
mary berry re-opened upton house in warwickshire that has been restored to the state it was in 1939 upton house , a national trust property located in the parish of ratley and upton , has been transported back in time to 1939 , when london - based bank m.samuel & co moved into the building as they were at risk of having their premises demolished in the london blitz
the house became one of only two country house banks during the war , the other being the bank of england
mary berry , 80 , opened the newly - refurbished house after a team of 80 volunteers went to extraordinary lengths to recreate the manor , even sourcing two rolls of 75 - year - old toilet paper
other fastidious details include second world war toothpaste , oil from that era that would have been used in typewriters and the team even made lipstick from boiled beetroot , which was common practice at the time
london - based bank m.samuel & co moved into the property as they were at risk of having their own building demolished in the london blitz the house took six months of painstaking restoration to restore it to its former state rachael , head of museum collections manager at warwickshire county council who oversaw the project at the national trust property , said it was essential to include the tiny , everyday objects in the faithful recreation of the house , which took six months
the 37 - year - old said : ' we do need the ephemeral details like toilet paper and i got a bit obsessed with 1940s toilet paper
' we searched high and low and eventually some toilet paper came up on ebay
we did eventually get two rolls of wartime loo roll that i was very happy with
' mary berry opened the stately home to celebrate the house 's incredible transformation and to mark the seventieth anniversary of the end of the second world war although rachael was able to get hold of the hard - to - find product she admits that even when they were available in 1939 , not many people would have had access to it
' it 's very rare as , at the time , people would generally not have used it , they would have used scraps of paper or even newspaper in some households
' this level of intricate detail has permeated every aspect of the recreation of upton house
sourcing loo rolls : among the objects bought were two rolls of 75 - year - old toilet tissue costing Â£ 30 each many of the props were sourced online but the team had also received donations from collectors the bathrooms are stocked with toothpaste and toothbrushes from the era
even pens and pencils have been found from the 1940s to fill the desks in the house
rachael says that a lot of the material has been discovered online through six months of research , but they have also been fortunate enough to receive invaluable donations
she said : ' there are some things that you do not know that you want and then when you get them they are perfect
rachael who oversaw the project said it was important to gather everyday items girl of her time : mary berry would have been just four - years - old in 1939 ' one instance would be 1940s tea that came in a cardboard box in wrapped up packets with hand written notes
they had been in somebody 's attic for 70 years and was in a pristine condition
' a lot of the items we received were from the kindness of strangers
' in order to create a high level of accuracy the team had to be prepared to spend more than one would usually on household items
the toilet paper alone cost Â£ 60 for the two rolls
rachael says that the project would n't have been possible without people who had decided to preserve such items
' there are some glorious people out there that keep everything and if it were n't for people who kept things in their loft or their attics , we would n't have these objects and that window into a world that 's gone
' she said finding the everyday items for the house was vital to faithfully recreate the home 's wartime story
she added : ' i honed onto things like the toilet paper because it 's ordinary peoples ' lives and that 's important to our story because it 's a mansion where for that period during the war , ordinary people took over this extraordinary place
