when you go on safari , you want to get a good view of the animals , and experience nature up close
one motorist , in the kruger national park in africa got more than they bargained for , when they were trapped right in the middle of a pride of lions and a ginormous elephant
the small blue car was powerless to move as more than a dozen large cats from the vurhami pride lay in its path , with a tusked elephant blocking the route behind
the nail - biting moment when a pride of lion gazes at a small car unable to move round them as it is trapped by a giant elephant behind the photographs of the incident were taken by a housewife in another vehicle , who witnessed the scary encounter just lion around ! the driver 's path is blocked by a dozen cats , part of the vurhami pride , relaxing on the safari road thankfully the car owner was in no danger , and waited for the elephant to continue its stroll , before managing to escape round the lazy cats
the dramatic photographs were taken by housewife stella stewart in 2013 and have only recently come to light
the 59 - year - old housewife who took pictures from the car opposite , said the motorist was in no danger
she said : ' there was no aggression from either the elephant or lions so i was more interested on how long she would have to wait for the lions to move over
' she was n't ever in danger
the elephant did n't even give it a second glance
' but the lions on the other hand were very wary of both the car and elephant
' i 've seen lions and elephants road blocks but never together and a car stuck between them
' as the elephant slowly ambled to the other side of the road the driver , who has not been identified , calmly swerved round the side of the pride to avoid the lethargic cats
phew ! thankfully the giant elephant ambles across the road allowing the small car to reverse and escape round the pride of lions
