a listed victorian rectory is in danger of collapse after its millionaire cocaine addict owner allowed it to become overgrown and delapidated
the home in columb major , cornwall is considered one of the most important buildings from the gothic revival movement , but it is now uninhabitated and has fallen into a state of extreme disrepair
its owner , a property dealer who was jailed for drugs possession , has refused to renovate it - but the local council has not exercised its legal powers to force him to take action
overgrown : the old rectory in columb major , cornwall is almost inaccessible because it is so neglected rubbish : the house is full of old furniture and other debris despite its grade ii * listing from english heritage damage : holes in the roof and ceiling are causing water damage to the historic victorian structure the old rectory , which is grade ii * - listed , was built in 1851 by architect william white , who trained with the great gothic revival master george gilbert scott
it was originally designed to be a palace for a bishop , before being downgraded to a rector 's home and later becoming a hotel in recent years
but despite the building 's heritage , it is now derelict , filled with piles of rubbish and surrounded by overgrown plants , while major water damage has been caused by holes in the roof
photographs taken a few years ago show broken furniture piled up inside , with peeling walls and exposed ceiling beams
greenery has grown up all around the outside of the house , potentially threatening its structure
council has not taken legal action against the old rectory 's owner , property tycoon brown , who was sent in prison in 2012 after police found a large haul of cocaine hidden in his bentley convertible
neglected : the home was built in 1851 by william white and is considered a gothic revival masterpiece warning : campaigners are lobbying council to force the rectory 's owner to make repairs debris : photographs taken a few years ago show the shocking state of the listed building the victorian society , which promotes the cause of 19th - century architecture , recently launched a campaign to save the building from its ' shocking state of disrepair '
director chris costelloe said : ' council must take action now or this irreplaceable grade ii * - listed example of domestic gothic revival architecture will be lost
' further delay will result in much of the historic fabric being unsalvageable and the repairs will become enormously expensive
' the society claims that council has been aware of the threat to the building for at least four years , but has failed to act
officials insisted that they could not take action while brown was in prison , because it would breach his human rights
peeling : paint is coming off the walls in the 19th - century home , which was built as a bishop 's palace abandoned : no one is living in the house and plants are climbing up around the walls heyday : this historic postcard shows how the old rectory looked in its prime owner : property tycoon and cocaine addict brown is the legal owner of the old rectory the council has the power to impose an ' urgent works notice ' which would force the owner to repair the house , but it has done nothing more than try to talk to the owner
a spokesman said : ' the council is once again trying to make contact with the proprietors of the building to open a dialogue in regard to its current state
as yet the council has not had a response from the proprietors of this building
' english heritage has joined the calls to save the old rectory , calling it ' an incredibly important site and an architectural gem ' , and has been urging the council to take action
inspector simon hickman said : ' the site is on our english heritage south-west heritage at risk register and we are doing everything we can to ensure it is saved
' now the owner is no longer in prison we have advised council serve a repairs notice as soon as possible
we have offered to underwrite the repairs notice and to support them any way we can
' locals in the small village say they are scared to speak out about the derelict house - one told mailonline that he had been harassed on the internet after raising awareness of the issue
brown retired at the age of 26 after making millions of pounds as a property developer , but his life spiralled downhill when he became addicted to cocaine
the businessman took so much of the drug that his nose collapsed , and in 2012 he was sentenced to five years in prison for possession of class a drugs and a collection of handguns .
