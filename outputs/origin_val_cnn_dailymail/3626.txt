the prosecution of journalists is the hallmark of â oppressive regimes â such as russia and egypt , which try to crush free speech and a free press , the old bailey heard yesterday
the claim was made by burke , qc , in his closing speech on behalf of sun chief reporter john kay , who is accused of paying a ministry of defence official for stories
mr burke described kay , 71 , as a â legend of fleet street â who is being prosecuted â for simply doing his job â
the prosecution of journalists is the hallmark of â oppressive regimes â such as russia and egypt , which try to crush free speech and a free press , the old bailey ( pictured ) heard yesterday his articles revealed bullying , crime and sexual assault within the military , the jury was told
his qc said : â please recognise how disturbing a development it is that journalists that only report the news accurately , honestly and fearlessly now face being prosecuted in our criminal courts
â from john kay âs perspective that is exactly what âs happening right here
â mr burke told jurors they would be â all too familiar with journalists being silenced by courts â and spoke of oppressive regimes such as russia and egypt that sought to crush a free press and free speech
â you might be aware of events in moscow over the weekend , where a free press has long ceased to exist , â he said
â it never did in china
â and we have seen in recent years protests â people demanding a fraction of the rights we enjoy here , which include but are not restricted to a free press
â mr burke said the jury would have to rule on public interest
â it is the very basic function of a journalist in a free society to report the news without fear or favour , â he said
â to expose hypocrisy and to reveal the truth
â mr burke told the jury how the press had exposed child sex abuse in rotherham as well as the mps â expenses scandal
the public official who leaked the documents revealing the expenses story has not been prosecuted , the court heard
â nobody could ever conceivably justify a prosecution of the official because of the overwhelming public interest , â mr burke said
â paying an official can be trumped by a public interest defence
â mr burke said kay saw it as his â fundamental duty to hold the powerful to account and to speak for those who have no voice â
â he saw it as his role to expose , to correct , to reveal the very truth , â he said
â if john kay and his profession do not do it on your behalf who will ? â the trial has heard that ministry of defence official bettina jordan-barber , 42 , was paid Â£ 100,000 by the sun while working as a strategy officer who briefed the defence secretary and that kay knew she was a public official
mr burke described the sum paid to jordan - barber as â compensation â for the risk she ran in losing her job if her bosses found out she was leaking information to the press
â the public interest was part of her motivation , â he added
also on trial is sun royal correspondent duncan larcombe , 39 , who is accused of paying ex-sandhurst colour sergeant hardy , 44 , for details about the army base where prince harry trained
hardy funnelled some of the 34 payments totalling Â£ 23,000 through his 41 - year - old wife claire , the court has heard
sun executive editor fergus shanahan , 60 , is accused of plotting to pay a public official for stories and deputy editor geoff webster , 55 , is accused of authorising payments worth thousands of pounds to public officials in return for information
all four sun journalists deny charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office
hardy , of accrington , lancashire , denies misconduct in public office
his wife claire denies aiding and abetting misconduct in public office
