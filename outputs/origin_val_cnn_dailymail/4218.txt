there are currently more than 16,300 nuclear weapons in the world â enough to kill everyone on the planet 100 times over
now an interactive infographic has been created that tracks the number and history of nuclear weapons in the nine nations responsible for many of these warheads
they include the us , uk , russia , france , china , india , pakistan , israel , and north korea
between them , these nations possess 10,000 nuclear warheads , 4,100 of which are active

now an interactive infographic has been created that tracks the number and history of nuclear weapons in the nine nations responsible for many of these warheads the latest infographic uses data from the ' nuclear notebook ' , which since 1987 has tracked the number and type of the world 's nuclear arsenals
' i do n't think people truly understand just how many of these weapons there are in the world , ' said rachel bronson , executive director of the bulletin , who publishes the notebook
' the interactive is a way to see , immediately , who has nuclear weapons and when they got them , and how those numbers relate to each other
' it is a startling experience , looking at those comparisons
' russia and the us have most nuclear weapons , followed by the uk and france , according to the graphic
it creators , hans kristensen and robert norris , from the federation of american scientists say that in the past , host countries have learned of foreign nuclear weapons on their soil from the nuclear notebook

there are currently more than 16,300 nuclear weapons in the world â enough to kill everyone in on the planet 100 times over
pictured on the right is a mushroom cloud rising above the nevada desert in 1953 ' for instance , japan - which was the target of two atomic bomb attacks and has a law against nuclear weapons on its territory - learned from the notebook that there were us nuclear weapons on chichi jima and iwo jima , ' the authors write
' [ it also learned ] about an enormous and varied us nuclear arsenal on okinawa , us nuclear bombs stored on the mainland at misawa and itazuki air bases , and nuclear - armed us navy ships stationed in sasebo and yokosuka
' data for the us on the interactive map has been compiled using declassified documents from the us government , many of which were obtained using freedom of information requests
they combined this with figures from congressional hearings , specialty magazines , and confidential sources
' creating estimates for other nuclear - armed states can be more challenging because not all provide as much information as the us , ' the authors write
for instance , uk and france have published some information about their arsenals , but much is still unavailable
a self - propelled suface to air missile during a drill shown in a north korea drill north korea appears poised to expand its nuclear program over the next five years and in a worst case scenario could possess 100 atomic arms by 2020 , us researchers warned last week
and cutting - edge european companies could be unwittingly contributing to pyongyang 's suspect nuclear program with their equipment diverted to the isolated country via china , they said
unveiling the first results of what will be a 15 - month study , joel wit , senior fellow at the us - korea institute at johns hopkins university , said some of their conclusions were very ' disturbing
' using satellite imagery , north korea media reports and their deep knowledge of nuclear programs , wit , and veteran nuclear non-proliferation expert david albright , have drawn up three possible scenarios based on the progress that pyongyang from 2009 to 2014
in the first scenario , pyongyang would almost double its stockpile to about 20 weapons , including plutonium - based weapons which have been miniaturized sufficiently to be mounted on its rodong - class medium - range ballistic missile , capable of reaching japan
in the second - and most likely scenario - north korea continues its current trajectory and manages to produce 50 weapons by 2020
it would also make significant advances in miniaturisation technology enabling it to mount warheads on intermediate - range ballistic missiles
in what wit dubbed ' the worst case scenario , ' the north korea stockpile would grow more rapidly to 100 weapons and make ' significant advances ' in weapons designs to enable it to potentially deploy battlefield and tactical weapons
for russia and the remaining nuclear - armed , estimates rely on information from western intelligence organisations , expert studies , news media reports , and satellite imagery
since the us unleashed the first nuclear bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki back in 1945 there have been a staggering 2056 nuclear tests recorded worldwide
it took almost a year until the next substantial tests took place but by the mid- 50s and 60s , nuclear experiments were being recorded across the globe on almost a monthly basis
the threat of nuclear war that once hung over the world has eased since the cold war amid sharp reductions in warheads but russia and the us , nato 's main military power , retain massively destructive nuclear arsenals
earlier this month nato officials said russia 's nuclear strategy appears to point to a lowering of the threshold for using nuclear weapons in any conflict
meanwhile a separate report found that north korea is poised to expand its nuclear program over the next five years and in a worst case scenario could possess 100 atomic arms by 2020
unveiling the first results of what will be a 15 - month study , joel wit , senior fellow at the us - korea institute at johns hopkins university , said some of their conclusions were very ' disturbing
' although the north korea 's nuclear program remains shrouded in uncertainty , pyongyang is currently believed to have a stockpile of some 10 to 16 nuclear weapons fashioned from either plutonium or weapons - grade uranium .
