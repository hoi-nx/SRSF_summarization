right now , the solar impulse 2 plane , covered in 17,000 solar cells , is making its way around the world on a five - month trip to highlight the benefits of solar technology
but if you want to see a more everyday benefit of solar power , one company has an answer - a bag strap that harnesses the energy of the sun. imaginatively called the sun strap , it uses flexible solar panels made from waterproof materials to allow you to charge your phone , or any other gadget with a usb port , while out and about
weight : 5.8oz ( 165 grams ) size : 3 â x 15 â ( 7.6 x 38 cm ) battery : 5,600 mah lithium - ion outputs : 5v/1a input : 5v/1a compatible with : apple , samsung , htc , motorola , lg , gopro and most others usb devices
as you walk around in the sun , the strap converts the sunlight into energy and charges an internal battery
that battery then charges anything connected to the usb or micro usb ports on the bottom of the device
when the device is fully charged on solar power it has enough energy to charge an an iphone three and a half times or fully charge an ipad mini tablet
it can also be used as a camera strap to keep a camera charged even as it is being used
the lightweight device , weighing just 0.37lbs ( 165 grams ) , is designed to fit around any strap and can also be mounted to the frame of a bike to power electronics when on the move
the sun strap uses solar technology to store charge for various devices
the Â£ 65.50 ( $ 99 ) device , annotated here , was part of a successful kickstarter project by skajaquoda in minnesota that raised Â£ 12,678 ( $ 19,111 ) on the crowdfunding website as you walk around in the sun , the strap converts the sunlight into energy and charges an internal battery
it can be used on a variety of bags , including backpacks and a camera strap ( shown ) agustsson , 33 , created the sun strap with his 25 - year - old brother agust
mr agustsson , who lives in clarkfield , minnesota in the us but is originally from iceland , said : â when we looked at the portable solar products that were on the market we saw they either spent most of their time inside a bag while you were walking or they were very unattractive to wear
â we designed the sun strap to both be aesthetically pleasing and to always be exposed to the sun , and therefore always able to charge something
â anyone can use the sun strap : cyclists , students or ordinary people going about their day
â the sun strap can be used in many different ways and its only limited by your imagination
â he is now selling the sun strap on his website , janulus.com , along with other products including a universal cable which can be used for any function , called a tob cable
