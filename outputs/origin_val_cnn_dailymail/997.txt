a 21 - year - old man has undergone the world 's first successful penis transplant
the ' ground - breaking ' operation took south africa surgeons nine hours to perform , and allowed the patient to urinate normally and become sexually active again
three years ago the man , who remains unidentified , was forced to have his penis amputated after a botched circumcision
each year thousands of young men , mainly from the xhosa tribe in south africa , have their foreskins removed in traditional rituals , with experts estimating around 250 losing their penises each year to medical complications
they said the procedure allowed the man to regain all function in the newly transplanted organ
nine more patients will now receive penile transplants
professor merwe , head of the university 's division of urology , said they were surprised by the patient 's rapid recovery
he said : ' our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery
professor frank graewe , another of the hospital 's surgeons who assisted on the operation , said : ' it 's a massive breakthrough
we 've proved that it can be done â we can give someone an organ that is just as good as the one that he had
' ' it was a privilege to be part of this first successful penis transplant in the world
' professor van der merwe said having a penis amputated is known to have a seriously adverse psychological effect on men
' this is a very serious situation , ' he said
' for a young man of 18 or 19 years the loss of his penis can be deeply traumatic
as part of the procedure , doctors transplanted a new penis , donated by a deceased man
the pictures , left and right , show the veins and blood vessels they connected after the nine hour operation , the man recovered rapidly
the procedure has allowed him to become sexually active again
the picture shows how the nerves of the donated penis were joined to the man 's genital region he does n't necessarily have the psychological capability to process this
there are even reports of suicide among these young men
' he added that finding a donor organ was one of the main challenges to the procedures , and called the man who donated his penis , and his family , ' heroes '
the procedure was performed as part of a pilot study to develop a penile transplant procedure that could be performed in a typical south africa hospital
the planning and preparation for the study started in 2010
after extensive research professor van der merwe and his surgical team decided to use techniques developed for the first facial transplant
the operation was the second time that this type of procedure was attempted , but the first time in history that a successful long - term result was achieved

this was the first successful operation of its kind , as a previous attempt did not lead to long - term recovery a man in china received a transplant in 2005 but that man asked surgeons to remove the new organ two weeks later
professor van der mewe said the procedure could eventually also be extended to men who have lost their penises from penile cancer or as a last - resort treatment for severe erectile dysfunction due to the side effects from medication
the south african government praised surgeons who performed the operation
dr beth engelbrecht , head of western cape government health , said : ' we are very proud to be part of this ground - breaking scientific achievement
' it is good to know that a young man 's life has been significantly changed with this very complex surgical feat. ' from experience we know that penile dysfunction and disfigurement has a major adverse psychological effect on people
