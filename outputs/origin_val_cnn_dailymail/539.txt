the fictional killer invites his enemies on to the flight , including a lover who jilted him and a colleague who was hard on him at work , so he can kill them
despite protests the highly - acclaimed movie will be shown in uk cinemas from today , however , it was released in spain and germany last year although it is not known if andreas lubitz had seen it

reports in germany this morning suggest the locked - out pilot may have resorted to using an axe in a desperate bid to get through the armoured door as the plane hurtled towards the ground
prosecutors said the screams of passengers aware of their fate could be heard in the final seconds
andreas lubitz was said to have been depressed for years , which he may have kept secret from his employers , and may have had a breakdown before crashing his plane from barcelona to dusseldorf
movie fans say what happened with the germanwings plane has terrifying similarities with the wild tales movie , and have asked whether it should be pulled off the big screen
it is a set of six short stories , meant to be black comedies , but the first 15 - minute section where a pilot crashes a plane to kill everyone on board has taken on a new meaning

twitter users had noted the similarities between the film , and the horrific events of tuesday
sarp yelkencioälu â wrote : ' the similarities between the # germanwings crash & the scene in damian szifron 's movie , ' wild tales ' is mind boggling ! ' andrea newell tweeted : ' an awful morbid coincidence ... the first story of the film ' wild tales ' and the germanwings aircraft crash
steve summers â wrote : ' i wonder if the oscar nominated ' wild tales ' will be pulled from uk cinemas given the sad unfolding events in the # germanwings tragedy '
but it was cinema - goers in birmingham - only half an hour away from wolverhampton , where martyn matthews , one of the three uk victims , lived with his family - who were left disgusted with the decision to go ahead with the release
slipped through the net : germanwings co-pilot andreas lubitz had suffered from depression and â burnout â which had held up his career search : teams working in the difficult alps terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings receptionist josie callow , 28 , from birmingham , said : ' you would think there would be common sense and they could delay it for the sake of the families and people affected by the shock of such a tragic accident
' but they probably care about making money from the release and people would have already booked to see it so that is much more important to people than bereaved family 's feelings
' her words were echoed by abdul rajid , 33 , a cleaner from smethwick , west midlands
' i heard about it and think it is disgusting if anyone goes to see it after the crash , ' he told mailonline
' the fact that it mirrors it so closely means they surely should have waited just a little bit before releasing it here because even though it is n't on purpose , it is going to get criticised for not being sensitive at all
' retired teacher jeff baxter , 67 , from birmingham , added : ' to release it in the uk so close to the incident when a few people from this country died is very insensitive
' surely they could have delayed it for a few days or even weeks and then no - one would have noticed ? ' but student thomas harris , 23 , who is originally from surrey , was more cynical
' maybe they have n't changed the release date because the publicity helps , they say there is no such thing as bad press , ' he said
' but i do think it is very distasteful , especially to the families involved , it is n't something you want to be seeing advertised at such a horrible time personally
' but distributor artificial eye told mailonline it will still be shown in a number of cinemas across uk from today
it is already out in the america .
