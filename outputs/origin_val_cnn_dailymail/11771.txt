but what appeals as a dream working location comes at a price , for the area has become notorious for assaults , robbery and rip - off merchants
interior minister sar khen has already sent a team of high - level police to sihanoukville to investigate a spate of recent violence - including stabbings , brawls , a drive - by shooting and even explosions - in which foreigners have been victims
reports of the attack on mr michael hay and mr jooni huhani nleml come in the wake of an extraordinary story that has emerged in phnom penh in recent days and which has resulted in intense discussion on the khmer440 ex-patriates â website

martin gates , 24 , and nicholas mclernan , 40 , they told the khmer times in a story that has since been pulled that they lost $ us3000 in cash , a laptop computer , two smartphones , bank cards and all their clothes apart from the ones they were wearing
they told the newspaper that they had managed to make their way to phnom penh to ask the embassy for help in getting home to the uk , but the embassy had turned them away
writers on the forum have questioned their story , some claiming the photo has been manipulated - which has turned out to be not the case - but asking why it appeared the colours on their t - shirts made it look as though they had taken part in a paint - gun battle
some writers believed the pair âs story , while others said it looked like they were on drugs and were pulling a scam
the debate , which has been running for several days since the photo was first published , includes a recent post that declares that â anyone defending these moronic meth - heads needs their own head checked
