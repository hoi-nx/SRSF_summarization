' it 's certainly a big deal for adelaide because it 's being funded by taxpayers
' mr o'leary said it was difficult to assess costs of the project and how they would pay off in future
' there 's no way to know if it 's value for money without comparing it to other similar projects , ' he said
' probably what 's missing from that list is there must be other big hospital projects in the pipeline around the world that are quite expensive
' ' the list does not seem to be comprehensive , as similarly priced hospitals such as the gold coast hospital in queensland and the fiona stanley hospital in western australia have been omitted , as have other high profile buildings from around the world , such as the london shopping centre ( cost approx. $ 3bn ) , ' said a statement from south australian health
' upon completion the new royal adelaide hospital will deliver state of the art care in one of the most advanced hospitals in the world , ' the statement said
other recently built australian hospitals missing from the list include the fiona stanley in perth , which opened in 2014 and cost $ a2 billion and the gold coast university hospital which opened in 2013 and cost $ a1.76 billion
on wednesday the former gold coast university hospital project director was appointed temporary manager of the adelaide project after program director andrew nielsen stepped down
this comes after the australian government said the state budget would need to account for an extra $ 177 million in funding in december last year
the palazzo - a luxury resort on the casino strip in las vegas - was completed in 2007 and cost $ us1.9 billion the shard skyscraper in london was completed in 2013 for $ us1.9 billion the 800 - bed hospital due to open in april 2016 but an independent review has concluded the project wo n't be finished until the second half of that year
mr o'leary said cost blowouts were to be expected on any large project
' any billion dollar construction project is an extremely complex undertaking , ' he said
' original estimates and budgets tend to blow out because of the complexity
' dubai 's burj khalifa is the tallest building in the world and cost $ us1.5 billion to build another adelaide building - myer centre â was the next australian construction on the list at number 13 the next most expensive australian buildings were sydney 's chifley tower at number 16 , costing $ us1 billion , and sydney 's anz bank centre ( pictured ) , costing $ us800 billion
