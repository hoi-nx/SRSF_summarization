an ornate scabbard chape belonging to admiral lord nelson - discovered on the bed of the river thames by a police diver in the 1970s - has surfaced at auction for Â£ 70,000
it is believed the 6in long enamel and diamond decoration that fixed onto the bottom end of the naval hero 's sword case was tossed into the water by thieves decades before
it was discovered in 1973 purely by chance by a police diver searching for a weapon used in a crime
admiral lord nelson 's sword scabbard ( pictured ) is set to sell at auction for up to Â£ 70,000 the chape was from a scimitar sword presented to lord nelson by the sultan selim iii of the turkish empire to commemorate the british victory over the french fleet at the battle of the nile in 1798
it is decorated in diamonds with the star and crescent which matches the ottoman order of the crescent granted to lord nelson in 1799
the locket no longer exists as it was melted down years ago but the chape is now coming up for auction in london with a pre-sale estimate of Â£ 50,000 to Â£ 70,000
the one - armed naval hero ( illustrated ) was famed for his victories at sea , mostly notably the 1805 battle of trafalgar moorcroft , of auctioneers bonhams , said : ' the chape would have been a super-expensive item of the day
' we can associate it with lord nelson through the star and crescent at the centre of the decoration which matches the ottoman order of the crescent conferred on lord nelson in 1799 and as seen in a portrait of him in 1801
' the sheer quality of workmanship that has gone into it is quite stunning
' it is an object that is pretty fabulous
' five years before its discovery , an ornate locket with an identical decoration that was used on the top part of lord nelson 's scabbard was found during dredging work of the river wey in surrey
the location was n't far from the river thames at windsor where the chape was found , nor from lord nelson 's palatial home at merton
both discoveries were featured on bbc 's blue peter
mr moorcroft added : ' both the locket and the chape were found at the bottom of rivers just five years and a few miles apart
the locket was found about 20 miles from lord nelson 's estate at merton
