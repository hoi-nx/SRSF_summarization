it is a common problem for airlines , ferries and cruise ships - how do you make passengers pay attention to the safety briefing ? condor believes it has found the solution , producing a video complete with a rapping captain and dancing staff that certainly attracts attention
doing away with the monotone yet informative messages usually portrayed in safety briefings , the portsmouth - based company said it wanted to inject some ' fun ' into this year 's offering
but not everybody is a fan , with some commentators saying they would prefer to jump overboard than listen to the song
the captain introduces the rap for a very different safety demonstration condor ferries have produced the safety rap as part of their ' good times ' branding slightly out of sync and with some incredibly cringeworthy dance moves , the video seems to have done the trick and has already been viewed nearly 20,000 times since it was posted on youtube several days ago
the video begins with a captain sporting blue sunglasses and some questionable moves as he announces : ' to ensure you have good times on board , please listen up to the following safety message from condor
' it 's soon time for the crew to get involved as they raise their hands in the air singing , ' life jackets , life jackets , they 're right beneath your seat
' the pair then instruct those watching how to operate the life jacket
' it clips together so easily just listen for the click , ' sings the female
' that means you 've done it properly and you look so very hip
' that may be a matter of opinion
the steward raps how to fix the life jacket on and blow the whistle , all out of sync all you have to do is just ' listen for the click ' says the stewardess , and that means you 've done it right the male then takes the lead when notifying of where the emergency exits are , complete with some cringeworthy dance moves that involve bouncing on the spot and hilarious hand signals
but it only gets worse
it 's back to the captain , as he comes into shot singing ' now ladies , hey ladies , ' while making what can only be described as an ' uncomfortable ' facial expression
however , rather than flirting , he is simply advising that ' sharp objects ca n't go on our slides , so leave those heels behind
' the steward then bounces on the spot and uses amusing hand gestures to warn of the emergency exits the emergency slide is then shown , at least in graphic form , as the stewardess demonstrates how , well , to slide down it
the video then uses graphics to show how the staff can help passengers from wheeling their luggage , to using a resuscitator and defibrillator , as ' you name it , we have it
' the star of the show then comes back , the captain , as he sings : ' so who would have thought that the condor could bust out such good rhymes ? ' the video is being broadcast on all sailings between poole and the channel islands
he 's back ! the captain then makes a somewhat unnerving re-appearance as he warns ladies not use heels down the emergency slides the idea was conceived and produced by bournemouth - based walker agency , working closely with the condor safety , marine operations and marketing teams
alicia andrews , executive director â commercial at condor , said : ' we 're really proud of the new safety video , it 's been a very fun project to work on , and we 're delighted with the results
' our brief was simple , we wanted something a little bit different , something that our passengers would sit up and take notice of , and which would appeal to all members of the family
we think that the rap , with the good times messaging does just that
the stewardess demonstrates how passengers would use the emergency slide ... not too difficult ' ferry travel is very family - friendly , there are no restrictions on the amount of luggage you can bring â you can pack everything in to your car , and off you go
' we hope that our passengers , whether they are frequent travellers or joining us for the first time this summer will enjoy the video and their good times experience onboard condor liberation as we set sail to jersey and guernsey
' however the video has been met with less - than positive comments by users on youtube , where it has been hosted
the staff are there to help with passengers ' every need , according to the safety video liam gilheany wrote : ' i want to pour lava into my ears , ' while james lund added : ' i 'd want to jump into the harbour if this is for real
' nathan thomas is somewhat dubious as to the authenticity of the captain writing : ' i hope they keep a look out for fishing boats better - now they seem to have employed a stripper as a captain
' condor are believed to be the first ferry operator to produce an onboard safety video to feature a rap
the release has coincided with the launch of its brand new state - of - the - art condor liberation with a new mission statement of ' good times
' the video has been met with pleasure by senior executives at condor
