a two - year - old boy with a condition so rare that doctors have never seen it before has celebrated christmas three months late after being too ill to mark the festive period
milo browne suffers from a condition that is so unique there is no diagnosis and he spent christmas in the great north children 's hospital at newcastle 's royal victoria infirmary fighting for his life
however , the family were determined to wait until milo browne was home before they celebrated christmas , meaning presents have remained unopened and the decorations have stayed up
milo browne along with his siblings mia , 7 and felix , 3 unwrapped a whole host of presents yesterday including frozen toys for mia , cars and tractors for felix and sensory toys for milo browne
milo browne 's father stephen , 29 , said : ' i have had to give up my job to become a full time carer for milo browne but it 's days like this that make it worthwhile
' santa claus made the day even more special and the kids were all in awe that he knew so much about them
' milo browne is home for now but we have to take him back to the hospital in six weeks time

' doctors had previously only gave milo browne a few hours to live after he fell ill last year
but the toddler was determined to prove them wrong and since then he has continued to baffle doctors across the country
his rare condition means he has vision delay and severe development delay
he also has to be fed directly through his stomach via a machine , his arms and legs are stiffer than normal and his co-ordination is poor
the two - year - old also suffers from central hypotonia which leaves him unable to hold his weight

' he is such a happy boy and is always smiling despite what he 's going through
' the family have set up a website to raise funds for milo browne 's treatment and equipment and have built a huge support network up of people inspired by their son
mr milo browne added : ' for a child that was expected to live only a few hours he has showed determination not to give up
' we take everyday as a blessing
we are n't naÃ¯ve , we know milo browne will not always be here but we will make sure milo browne will live on long after all of us are gone
