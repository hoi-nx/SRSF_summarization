taking statins can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent , research has shown taking statins can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent , research has shown
the cholesterol - lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly , which can trigger type 2 diabetes
the risk , which is far higher than previously believed , has prompted fresh concern about the side effects of the pills
the findings are particularly worrying as last year the nhs recommended that up to 17million adults should be on statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes
the drugs â rationing body nice published guidance last july urging gps to prescribe them to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease in a decade
this represents around 40 per cent of adults in the uk , and academics said the advice was â foolhardy â when so little was known about the side effects
in the latest study , scientists from the university of eastern finland studied 8,749 men aged 45 to 73 over a six - year period
just under a quarter were taking statins when the study started
some had only been on the pills for a few months , others for several years
over the course of the study , the scientists found that taking statins increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 46 per cent
their research , published in the journal diabetologia , found that statins reduced the ability of insulin to break down blood sugar
this is known as insulin sensitivity , and was on average 24.3 per cent lower in men who were taking statins
the cholesterol - lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly , which can trigger type 2 diabetes the researchers believe that if insulin does not break down blood sugar , and the body âs sugar levels rise too high , then it can trigger type 2 diabetes
they concluded : â statin therapy was associated with a 46 per cent increased risk of type 2 diabetes
' the association of statin use with increased risk of developing diabetes is most likely directly related to statins decreasing both insulin sensitivity and secretion
â dr aseem malhotra , a consultant cardiologist in london , said that contrary to the nhs guidance , healthy adults should not be taking statins , adding : â i personally would nât take it or recommend it to friend or family member who is otherwise healthy but let them make up their own minds after giving them all the information
â eating a handful of nuts or four tablespoons of olive oil may be a more effective way at reducing risk of a heart attack , stroke or death and without the side effects
â professor peter weissberg , medical director at the british heart foundation , said healthy patients prescribed statins to prevent heart disease should take the â lowest possible dose â
he went on to warn that people with existing heart conditions should not stop taking the pills , saying : â it is important that people taking statins because of existing cardiovascular disease should continue to take them as the benefits will outweigh the risks
