motorists will get new â mini-motorways â as part of a Â£ 15billion overhaul of the nation âs highways
busy a-roads will be revamped â with roundabouts and traffic lights stripped out â to cut delays and transform them into â mile - a - minute expressways â
details , included in a strategy by the highways agency presented to parliament , also include new slip roads to make the roads flow and banning slow moving vehicles such as tractors and bicycles
new roads : busy a-roads will be revamped â with roundabouts and traffic lights stripped out â to cut delays and transform them into â mile - a - minute expressways â up to 18 a-roads are likely to be transformed in the first tranche with seven more to follow
the strategy document says : â our ambition for the next 25 years is to revolutionise our roads
â our busiest a-roads will become expressways , providing improved standards of performance , with technology to manage traffic and mile - a - minute speeds
â users of motorways know they can expect a broadly consistent standard from the whole of their road , and that this ensures they have a safe , free - moving journey
â but it notes : â the same is not true of a-roads , where piecemeal upgrades have often resulted in inconsistency and substandard stretches of the road that are often less safe and a regular cause of congestion
â by 2040 , we want to have transformed the most important of these routes into expressways : a-roads that can be relied upon to be as well - designed as motorways and which are able to offer the same standard of journey to users
â ' vital part of the long - term economic plan ' : transport secretary patrick mcloughlin ( pictured ) said the government is ' investing Â£ 15billion in the biggest upgrade to highways england âs strategic roads in a generation ' these will be â largely or entirely dual carriageway roads â that are â safe , well - built and resilient to delay
the first group of nine expressways is expected to include the a303 and a30 from the junction with the m3 in hampshire to exeter
the a1 north of newcastle , which motorists have long campaigned to be made into a motorway , is another , as is the a14 from huntingdon to cambridgeshire
these will also link with up to 400 miles of â smart motorways â where hard shoulders are used at peak times to reduce jams
a dual carriageway is planned for â the entire a303 from the m3 to the m5 at taunton â , as well as building a tunnel as the road passes stonehenge
there will also be a new bypass on the a27 at arundel together with improvements at worthing and lancing in west sussex
also featuring will be construction of the mottram moor link road together with overtaking and safety improvements and duelling the a61 to improve trans-pennine connectivity
a range of duelling and junction improvement schemes on the a47 / a12 corridor supporting growth at peterborough , norwich , great yarmouth and lowestoft is also planned
they will be built so that â traffic on the main road can pass over or under roundabouts without stopping â
the strategy document seen by the daily mail says : â an expressway will be able to provide a high - quality journey to its users
â most expressways should be able to offer mile a minute journeys throughout the day , particularly outside of urban areas
â the highways agency has presented the road investment strategy to parliament ahead of it being transformed on april 1 into the new private sector roads operator called highways england
ministers say the new government - owned company marks â a step change â in how highways england âs roads are maintained and managed and will be responsible for delivering more than Â£ 15billion of investment by 2021
it will have longer - term funding to be able to plan ahead and invest in skills and equipment to speed up essential work
a dft spokesman said : â the move is part of a radical package of road reform that is expected to save the taxpayer at least Â£ 2.6billion over the next ten years
â transport secretary patrick mcloughlin added : â infrastructure is a vital part of this government âs long term economic plan to secure a better future for this country , that is why we are investing Â£ 15billion in the biggest upgrade to highways england âs strategic roads in a generation
â â the creation of highways england will mean better value for money , improved customer satisfaction , more road capacity , improved safety and a better quality of service for millions of people who use the strategic road network every day
