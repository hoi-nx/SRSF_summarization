an extremely rare teddy - bear lookalike mammal has been spotted in china for the first time in 20 years
the tiny ili pika , an eight - inch long rabbit - relative , is one of the world 's most endangered animals with less than 1,000 animals believed to be left in its natural habitat
the ili pika population is believed to have declined by almost 70 per cent since its discovery in 1983 , scientists say
adorable : the ili pika is one of the world 's rarest mammals , and has been spotted for the first time in 20 years in its natural territory in the xinjiang region of northwestern china the ili pika , formally known as ili pika , was discovered by conservationist li weidong in 1983 , who named it after his hometown
the animals can only be found in the tianshan mountain range in the xinjiang region of northwestern china , and its territory is under threat , with the population rapidly declining
when the ili pika was first discovered , mr li and his team estimated that there were around 2,900 animals living in the tianshan mountain range
nearly 20 years later , in 2002 , mr li conducted a new demographic , which found that the population had dropped to 2,000
last year 's fresh census , which is when the ili pika was spotted for the first time in 20 years , concluded that the population is down to less than 1,000 pikas
rare animal : china scientists believe that there are less than 1,000 ili pikas left in the world disappearing : ili pika population is believed to have declined by 70 per cent since its discovery in 1983 ' i discovered the species , and i watched as it became endangered , ' mr li told cnn
' if it becomes extinct in front of me , i 'll feel so guilty
' very little is known about this rare species , as no successful observations about its ecology , behaviour or reproduction has been carried out
mr li believes global warming is the cause of the decline in ili pikas as the altitude of permanent snow in the tianshan mountain range has risen
' this tiny species could be extinct any time , ' mr li added
' they do n't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore
' the ili pika was discovered by conservationist li weidong in 1983 , and it was he who photographed the adorable animal for the first time in 20 years last summer
