blair filed another suit in 2007 against another man which had the same result
her brother blair told the detroit news earlier this week : ' it 's too early to even say what this could be , or to make any judgments

neighbor shanetria lanier , 21 , told the detroit news blair home - schooled her children and ' that 's why no schools were wondering where they were '

people did notice that two of her children seemed to disappear about a year ago
lanier told the newspaper : ' when people asked her where her other two kids are , she said they were at their aunt 's house
' or sometimes she 'd tell people they stayed inside because they did n't like to be around people
' craig said the detroit news that police were still ' trying to determine what happened '
the cause of death wo n't be known until after autopsies are conducted
tori childs , who also lives in the complex , told the detroit news she often saw the children and sometimes gave them clothes or food
