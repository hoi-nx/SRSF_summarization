when her beloved dog collapsed and had to be rushed to the vet , heather goddard was horrified
the grandmother was left grief - stricken when tests showed clover , an eight - year - old crossbreed , had lung cancer and would have to be put down
but the biggest shock came when she was told that her dog âs death was caused by passive smoking â the result of being in the house as she and her husband keith puffed through 30 cigarettes each a day
she and mr goddard , 67 , of seaton delaval , northumberland , were walking clover in a park when the rescue dog became ill. they took her to a veterinary practice in morpeth , where they were told she had black spots on her lungs and was also suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
the vet said nothing more could be done for clover , adding that the cause of her cancer was passive smoking
â knowing my smoking was to blame was like somebody had just put a bullet into my heart
it was a nightmare that had come true , â said mrs heather goddard , a retired cleaner who has another dog , roger , as well as two cats and a rabbit
â clover was a lovely dog
she was friendly and there was nât a bad bone in her body
fond memories : she says thinking about clover ' brings a tear to my eye just thinking about the damage my smoking was doing ' - she is now hoping to inform others about the dangers of second - hand smoke clover had to be put down after a scan showed up black spots on her lungs â she showed no signs or symptoms of being ill. we had no idea why she had collapsed until we took her to the vets
it was such a shock
â you do nât think about your animals but they are just like us
they can get illnesses like diabetes and cancer the same as us
â mrs heather goddard says she now regrets exposing her family and her animals to years of cigarette smoke in the house and the car
she added : â i think i would have tried to give up earlier if i had known the damage it was doing to my animals
as long as the animals were fed i would be happy to go without food but i had to have my cigarettes
â i did nât connect passive smoking with animals
you do nât realise how much of it they are taking in
my grandchildren are only here once or twice a week but our pets are with us 24 hours a day , 365 days a year
â it still took her nearly three years following clover âs death before she managed to quit her 30 - a - day habit â and by then she too had been diagnosed with chronic lung disease
her husband has also given up smoking , much to the delight of their three children and eight grandchildren
mrs heather goddard , who had smoked for 40 years , said : â i feel a lot healthier now i have stopped
â i can walk to the end of the path without getting as out of breath and i do nât use my inhalers as much
new start : ms heather goddard pictured with her grandchildren - who are ' always happy that i no longer smoke ' â my grandchildren tell me they are glad i stopped smoking because i do nât smell of smoke any more
when i gave up smoking that stopped my illness from getting any worse
â she hopes by speaking out she will alert other animal owners and help protect more pets from the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke
â i would tell anyone who smokes and has animals to think twice , â she said
â i know how difficult it is to give up but they need to think about their animals
do nât give up trying , even if you have two cigarettes less a day
â the british veterinary association has long warned of the dangers of smoking around pets , saying it can lead to incidents of cancer , asthma and bronchitis in cats and dogs .
