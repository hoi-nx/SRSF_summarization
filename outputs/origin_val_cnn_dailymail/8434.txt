up to 80 per cent of women fake orgasms , according to recent research - and that might not be a bad thing
turns out some women fake it in order to make it a real orgasm happen
researchers surveyed 481 heterosexual females , all sexually active but not in serious relationships
the women gave four main reasons for faking orgasm
the most common reason was â altruistic deceit â - to protect the man âs feelings
second , fear and insecurity
wanting the sex to be a positive experience , rather than a negative one
fourth , was faking it to end the sex session
no surprises there ( though it âs usually further up the list ! ) the most interesting reason came third on the list
â elevated arousal â - faking orgasm to make yourself feel more turned on
the women said by pretending to orgasm , they were attempting to increase their arousal levels
and do you know what ? i believe them
the â fake it till you make it â theory is based on the assumption that if you act out the thing you want to happen , sometimes it will
psychologists use the same technique on depressed patients : the act of smiling triggers hormones which make us feel happier so a forced smile eventually turns into a real one
sexpert tracey says for some women pretending to climax could actually bring on the real thing the women in the study said if they pretended to orgasm , their partner got more excited , which got them more excited
by reenacting the lead - up to a real orgasm - breathing faster , making noise , moving your hips , tensing your muscles - you might just push yourself over the threshold to the point where orgasm becomes involuntary
but there are two crucial points that need to be made here
first up , the study was based on women who were nât in relationships so the overall percentage of â fakers â ( 80 per cent ) is hopefully lower in couples who are more comfortable with each other
it âs also best not to use the â fake it to make it â technique at the beginning of relationships ( unless you explain that âs what you âre doing , which is unlikely )
how is your partner ever going to learn to give you a real orgasm if they think they âre doing it already ? the absolute worst time to fake an orgasm is at the start of a relationship , which is , of course , when most women ( and some men ) do it
keep on doing it and you âve set up a pattern of behaviour that âs based on deception and dissatisfaction
he âll keep on using the same ineffectual techniques because he thinks he âs turning you on ; you âll remain frustrated and irritable every time you have sex
having the courage to say â actually , that does nothing for me , â is nât easy but you really must
communication is the key to good sex - and faking orgasm ( for reasons that are nât so helpful ) is nât necessary if admitting to not having one is nât a problem ! read more about love and relationships at traceycox.com
