the striker , who suffers from vasovagal â a medical condition that can lead to fainting â was taken straight to the white hart lane medical room where he was given more treatment
however , good news emerged from swansea at half - time that gomis was fine and had not been hospitalised
â he is fine , â said a swansea spokesperson
â he is in the medical room.it is something we have been aware of â it is something called a vasovagal condition
we have always been aware of it and it has happened before
he has had all the medical and cardiology tests with us
â the condition occurs when the body overreacts to certain triggers , such as physical or emotional distress
this can then cause a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure , which reduces the blood flow to the brain
a brief loss of consciousness can follow
the french striker later tweeted in french and then english , saying : ' i wanted to reassure you concerning my health , it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous and i am feeling well now
' i have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father health that requires me to go back and forth to france ' i was disappointed that i could n't help my team tonight but now everything is back in order ' i also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages
