' the arsenal manager said last friday that i would have loved to have played alongside ozil â and that would be right , as long as ozil played every week as well as he did at old trafford
' arsenal impressed me against manchester united , and that has been a rarity in recent years
there were similarities with their performance against manchester city in january
' they looked sharp and hungry , full of energy in midfield where they overpowered manchester united
they looked physically commanding too , and danny welbeck âs pace and power were important

i never had them down as so strong
they were quick and aggressive and got the better of manchester united
' they showed van gaal âs team what they were lacking in midfield and , funnily enough , they were not afraid to be direct with their attacks when it suited them
