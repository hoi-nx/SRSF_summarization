england could recall two lions forwards to their starting line - up as they prepare to step into the path of a juggernaut at twickenham on saturday â driven by france âs â big dudes â up front
stuart lancaster âs team are bracing themselves for a fearsome onslaught in the latest instalment of â le crunch â as they aim to clinch the six nations title and there is a significant chance they could turn to hooker youngs and lock geoff parling
lifted by their win over italy in rome on sunday , philippe saint-andre âs french side will come to london with a monster pack and orders to grind english ambition into the earth
yet the home forward unit , marshalled by graham rowntree , have stood toe - to - toe with all - comers and trumped most rivals in recent years , even if their dominance of the close - quarters combat has not always brought the deserved results
england forward courtney lawes described the french pack as ' big dudes ' along with youngs and parling , flanker tom wood is another established figure pushing hard for a place in the starting xv
one man who will be at the forefront of the home resistance is northampton lock courtney lawes , whose comeback from injury against scotland was a resounding personal triumph
he was laid back on monday when considering the magnitude of a title decider
when asked about his french counterparts yoann maestri and alexandre flanquart , he said : â they âre big dudes
it âll be an interesting game
â it will be interesting for those who relish a thunderous encounter and courtney lawes is certainly in that category
he added : â i âve played against many french sides
obviously we âve got to stay with them and show them they ca nât just roll over us
then we can play some good rugby , get them moving around us and hopefully our fitness will tell come the end

there is pride in their reputation and they will protect it with gusto
â we âre not the biggest pack but we certainly bring physicality , â said courtney lawes
â we like the contact and i do nât think we âve ever really been shoved around
we âve got a great pack , very dynamic , and we âve got a lot of different things we can do which is great
we certainly do nât expect to get pushed around
â physicality is a massive part of the game for french sides and it âs going to be a big challenge up front â something we âve got to match , at least

yoann maestri ( lock , 35 caps ) at 6ft 7in , maestri is nât as tall as his fellow lock , but the 27 - year - old has more caps and a 9lb weight advantage
uini atonio ( prop , 5 caps ) the heaviest of the lot , new zealand - born antonio is 6ft 5in and tips the scale at a whopping 24st 6lb ! lancaster is well aware of the heavyweight threat
many of the biggest visitors are likely to be substitutes unleashed in the second half in an attempt to blast through a tiring england defence â giants such as debaty ( 19st ) , romain taofifenua ( 20st ) and centre bastareaud ( 19st )
â they are a huge team ; very powerful and rely a lot on the bench at around 50 minutes â guys like ( benjamin ) kayser and debaty , â said the head coach
â it will be interesting to see if bastareaud starts
he adds a huge physical presence to their back line
they are big and athletic
â asked if england are equipped to withstand the battering , he added : â yeah , i think so
â england also need enough points to seal the title but will not worry about chasing elusive targets , at least initially
â if we start obsessing about the scoreline , then we âre not going to win the game , â said stuart lancaster .
