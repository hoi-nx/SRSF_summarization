the original investigator in the case has been dead for 20 years
police admitted there was no indication that schulze and durst had ever met or interacted
however chief hanley said that durst was ' a person who had a proximate connection with the missing person ' and that they were cooperating with other agencies , including the fbi , for an opportunity to talk with the 71 - year - old real estate scion
' when it involves durst , it 's a broad scope we have to deal with on this , ' hanley said
he added that police had been ' following the news ... and trying to get as many memories going as possible '
the student 's disappearance was classed as an open missing person case and a possible homicide
chief hanley said there was ' assumed wrongdoing '
the schulze case had been reopened in 1992 after police received several leads but they came to nothing

two women disappeared in california , his first wife vanished in new york , another woman went missing in texas and now the latest , a teen college student in vermont
durst 's lawyer , dick deguerin , did not seek bail but argued his client 's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier this month in new orleans were improper , and that investigators wrongly interviewed him without counsel present
durst 's attorneys want to expedite his extradition to los angeles county , where he has been charged with the 2000 murder of longtime friend susan berman and could face the death penalty
the hbo documentary broadcast durst being presented with evidence his handwriting appeared to match that of susan berman 's likely killer
