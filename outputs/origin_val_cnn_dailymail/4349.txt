a former nyse managing director has filed a lawsuit claiming he was fired for appearing on the satirical newscast ' the daily show ' to discuss obamacare because his bosses objected to the program 's politics
in a lawsuit filed thursday in california state court , wilemon says his supervisors at intercontinental exchange inc ( intercontinental exchange inc ) , which owns nyse and other financial exchanges , had allowed him to appear on fox news , al jazeera and other television stations without receiving permission in each instance
after appearing in a 2014 segment about the obamacare on the popular comedy central show without permission , however , wilemon was promptly fired , the suit says
he claims that while he knew the interview would be edited to poke fun at his opposition to ' obamacare , ' he thought it would be an effective way to draw attention to controversies surrounding the law
he is now suing the company an intercontinental exchange inc representative , also speaking for the nyse , declined to comment on the suit on friday
the march 6 , 2014 segment of ' the daily show ' challenged the notion that the u.s. has the best health care system in the world , with wilemon , a managing director for intercontinental exchange inc from 2009 to 2014 , playing the foil
his comments , particularly his exhortation that ' if you 're poor , stop being poor , ' were widely criticized by left - leaning websites and news outlets
the popular website alternet , for example , placed wilemon at the top of a list of ' 8 colossal jackasses from the right - wing fringe
' before he was fired , wilemon provided information to investors and firms listed on the nyse 's exchanges , as well as making regular television appearances to discuss investing and politics
days after the segment aired , wilemon 's supervisors chided him for ' mocking the one percent , ' according to the suit , and he was fired
