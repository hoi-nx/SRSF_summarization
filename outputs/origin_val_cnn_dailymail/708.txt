the conservatives are planning a â kill ukip â campaign in the kent constituency where farage is standing for parliament after he vowed to quit as party leader if he loses tories hq is planning a â kill ukip â campaign in the kent constituency where farage is standing for parliament after he vowed to quit as party leader if he loses
mr farage declared yesterday that it would be â curtains â for him if he fails to win the ukip target seat of south thanet
he conceded it would be impossible for him to continue to dictate ukip policy without a seat in the house of commons
ukip is aiming to win around half a dozen seats , but mr farage appears to face a tougher fight than carswell , the tories defector who won a big majority when he stood for ukip in a by - election
polls suggest he is in a three - way battle with labour and the conservatives
the tories hold the seat , while labour previously held it with slightly different borders
conservative strategists believe mr farage has made a significant blunder by tying his fortunes in south thanet to his future as party leader
â this is a great opportunity , â said one
â we can now make this a decapitation campaign
if voters who have previously backed other parties want to stop ukip , they can vote for us and cut the head off the snake
â the strategist said that if mr farage stood down after losing the seat , mr carswell was likely to take over and â that would be the end of ukip â
other candidates to succeed the ukip leader include communities spokesman ukip and former journalist patrick oâflynn , both euro mps
mr farage appears at odds over several areas of policy with key members of his team , mr carswell , who has expressed concern about the â ugly nativism â of some ukip supporters and spoken in favour of immigration
the clacton mp is also seen as lacking in the broad popular appeal of mr farage by tories campaign chiefs
a survation poll commissioned by a ukip donor in south thanet found mr farage to be ahead , but one previous survey had him neck and neck with the tories and another put the tories ahead
in an extract from a new book by the ukip leader , the purple revolution , serialised in the daily telegraph , mr farage made clear he would quit as party leader if he fails to become an mp
â it is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a westminster seat , â he wrote
â what credibility would ukip have in the commons if others had to enunciate party policy in parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest ? â was i supposed to brief ukip policy from the westminster arms ? no â if i fail to win south thanet , it is curtains for me
i will have to step down
â yesterday ukip won a boost when broadcasting regulator ofcom awarded it a second party election broadcast on commercial tv and radio on the basis that it is now a â major party â
david cameron 's strategists hope that defeating mr farage would ' cut the head off the snake ' of ukip the bodys guaranteed ukip a minimum of two broadcasts in england and wales on itv , channel 4 and channel 5 , alongside the conservatives , labour and liberal democrats
but it said the greens had not demonstrated sufficient electoral support to justify a similar elevation in status
mr farage said : â this confirms that ukip is now a major party in britain politics
voters should now know that despite what all the other parties are going to tell them , the truth is self - evident : if you believe in britain , and want to vote ukip , you âll get a ukip mp
