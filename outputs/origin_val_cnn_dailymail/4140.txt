a tiny puppy who was found covered in 2kg of matted , petrol - coated fur after being abandoned has found a loving new home
bentley , a white shih tzu , was so timid when first taken into vets ' care he flinched whenever a human tried to touch him
a team of vets spent five hours shaving off the thick matted fur from his coat after he was dumped at the west yorkshire by an owner who ' could n't bear to touch him
it was love at first sight for matthew and catherine stroh , from skipton , north yorkshire who have now taken bentley home - weeks before rescue centre staff believed the dog would be re-homed
rescuer kathy trout said : ' he was flinching from the human hand - he suddenly seems to have brought himself round into trusting people again
the shih tzu is completely unrecognisable after vets shaved off his matted fur and his found happiness with a new family bentley has been rehomed after being abandoned and covered in 2kg of petrol covered matted fur , by the catherine stroh family from long preston , north yorkshire : ( l-r ) harvey ( 13 ) - mother catherine-father matt and oliver , 10 with their other little dogs lhasa apso dexter ( lhasa apso ) and cavapoo daisy ( cavapoo ) vets had to sedate the dog to be able to shave off the mass of smelly , petrol - coated fur he arrived with ' the surprising thing is that bentley was so incredibly affectionate with the family , especially matthew
when i took him on a few weeks ago he was so frightened and biting me - it was fear aggression
the neglected dog , pictured with catherine stroh , has been given a new lease of life with his new family ' but he seems to adore these people and their children
he 's gone from a mess of a dog and a shell of himself to a really confident , bouncy thing
' accountant matthew , 43 , said bentley settled right in with the family and even sits at the front window waiting to welcome new people to the house
' he 's a little daddy 's boy
he seemed to take to us straight away
he was all over me
' i 'm thrilled we could give him a new home , especially after what he had been through
he 's very happy a settled with us
' he still seems very puppy like
the children love playing ball with him - he just wants attention and to be loved
' matthew and wife catherine stroh , 45 , have sons harvey , 13 , and 10 - year - old oliver , as well as three - year - old lhasa apso dexter and cavapoo daisy , also three
matthew added : ' he even sits at the window waiting for people to come to the door
' he 's come so far out of his shell - he 's nothing like the dog in those horrible pictures of him all matted and covered in petrol
' vets had spent hours shaving off the matted , petrol - coated fur when bentley first arrived to the rescue centre
he then had to be sedated to allow them to put a jacket over his tiny body to keep him warm
bentley the shih tzu arrived at a dog rescue centre in meltham , west yorkshire , with fur so matted vets spent five hours shaving two kilograms of it off bentley 's condition was so dire when he arrived at the centre , owner kathy trout was reduced to tears rescuer kathy trout said she had been reduced to tears by his condition
' his coat was so covered in petrol , she said , a drink of water may have poisoned him if any fur had got in his mouth , ' she said
' he came into our rescue from a member of the public
his fur was very , very long and matted like felt and all his legs were like tree trunks with chemical smelling fur
' it looked like he was thick with oil , fuel or petrol
he really , really stank
when bentley arrived at the centre , his previous owner could not touch him , said mrs kathy trout
petrol and oil that was staining his coat meant the dog , who had never been groomed , gave off a strong stench after spending time recovering at the centre , bentley has overcome his fear of interaction with humans , and plays happily with the other dogs in its care ' cases like this keep me awake at night and in tears - we are not trained to handle the emotional strain of taking in rescue dogs
' his owner , who arrived in a ' shiny 4x4 ' could not even bear to pick him up , she added
' she handed him over on a lead because she would n't even touch him
it is clear he has never been groomed
' ' it 's wonderful to see him so happy again , ' she added
the dog would not allow any carers to remove a fleece jacket for weeks after they had put it on to keep him warm bentley has now fully recovered thanks to his loving new owner catherine stroh and her family , from north yorkshire kathy trout said caring for abandoned and abused dogs was a difficult job for which nothing can prepare you
