is your libido flagging ? if so , then a lack of sleep may be the reason why , researchers claim
a study has found a direct relationship between how much sleep a person gets and their level of desire the next day
the amount of shut - eye also affects how aroused they will become
the study , involving 171 women , showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent
poor sex drive ? getting more sleep is directly linked with an increase in libido , new research has shown sleep was also important for genital arousal , according to the research , published in the journal of sexual medicine
specifically , women who slept longer experienced fewer problems with vaginal arousal than those who obtained less sleep
' the influence of sleep on sexual desire and arousal has received little attention in the field , ' said dr david kalmbach , of the university of michigan
' but these findings indicate that insufficient sleep can decrease sexual desire and arousal for women
he added : ' i think the take - home message should not be that more sleep is better , but that it is important to allow ourselves to obtain the sleep that our mind and body needs
' and it 's not just women - previous research found men with poor sleep patterns have significantly lower levels of testosterone , which results in a lack of sex drive
experts say that reduced levels of the hormone can bring a host of other negative consequences for young men , including reduced libido and poor reproduction
they can fail to build enough strength through muscle mass and bone density , leading to low energy levels , poor concentration and fatigue
low testosterone levels are also linked to the metabolic syndrome - a cluster of metabolic risk factors that increase the chances of developing heart disease , stroke , and type 2 diabetes
scientists from the university of chicago found men who get less than five hours sleep a night for a week or longer suffer have far less levels of testosterone than those who get a good night 's rest
the study showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent - and increased levels of arousal their study found that the levels of the hormone are reduced dramatically to levels more akin to someone 15 years older
' low testosterone levels are associated with reduced wellbeing and vigour , which may also occur as a consequence of sleep loss , ' said professor eve van cauter , who led the study
other reasons for low libido include poor diet , being overweight and low iron levels
an estimated one in four british women does nât get enough iron from their diet , and iron deficiency is known to leave your libido lagging , says dr radha modgil , a gp in west london with a special interest in sexual health
â low iron levels are thought to reduce the quality of blood flow and so sap energy , â she explains
â if you âre exhausted , sex is obviously the last thing you feel like doing
â â the best source of easily absorbable iron is a nice juicy steak , â adds dietitian helen bond
â red meat like steak helps release key amino acids from the brain which are important for good mood
â other reasons for low libido include poor diet , being overweight and low iron levels
dietitians say red meat such as steak is a good , easy - absorbed form of iron â red meat is also a good source of b vitamins , which help convert the carbohydrates we eat into energy
it âs also a rich source of zinc , important for the production of the sex hormone testosterone , which women also need for sexual desire
other good sources of zinc include beans , nuts and oysters
â eating too much white bread and other refined carbohydrates can sap your sex drive , says helen bond
â foods such as white bread release the sugar more quickly than their wholegrain counterparts â and too much sugar is associated with energy slumps , which mean you wo nât have the energy for sex , â she adds
too much sugar also makes you fat , raising the level of oestrogen in the body , in turn reducing testosterone levels in men , says gynaecologist peter bowen-simpkins , â if you âre obese , you feel less attractive
you also have reduced blood flow to the sex organs
