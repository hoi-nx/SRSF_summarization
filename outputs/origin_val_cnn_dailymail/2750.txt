the identity of the man who lost out on a $ 1million powerball prize has finally been revealed
hung nguyen , a mechanic from south el monte , california with a 5 - month - old baby , was unable to claim his $ 1,098,624 prize last week because he had lost his ticket after purchasing it in september
what 's more , nguyen knew he had won the prize , as did california lottery officials who released footage of him purchasing his ticket in hopes he would come forward before the six months the winner has to claim the prize had lapsed , but powerball prizes can only be claimed if the individual has the physical ticket
' the owner mentioned it to him and he thought that the owner was joking around with him , ' a translator for nguyen told abc 7
nguyen then tried to come forward even though he did not have the ticket , but the winnings ultimately went to the california public school system
the other big winner , the rosemead supermarket that sold the ticket , was still able to collect their $ 5,493 bonus
as for unclaimed winnings , it happens more than people might think , with $ 20million going unclaimed during the last fiscal year in california alone
despite all this , nguyen said he will continue to play the lottery and hopes that he wins big again
he then added that he will never again throw away one of his tickets .
