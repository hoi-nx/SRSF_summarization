' i think it was supposed to be funny , but seeing this status made me feel angry
' as someone who has struggled with and overcome disordered eating , i know what it âs like to " feel " fat
i have spent years of my life consumed with negative thoughts about my body , and far too many days starving myself in an effort to lose weight
' but even worse than the skipped meals and the hours spent obsessing in front of the mirror was the fear of what others thought about me and my body
' when facebook users set their status to " feeling fat , " they are making fun of people who consider themselves to be overweight , which can include many people with eating disorders
' that is not ok
join me in asking facebook to remove the " fat " emoji from their status options
