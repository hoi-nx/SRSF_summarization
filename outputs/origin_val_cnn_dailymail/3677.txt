keane has the â broad shoulders and mental toughness â required to manage manchester united , according to his former old trafford engine room colleague , ince
ince , 47 , a double - winner with keane at manchester united in 1994 , on thursday hailed the irish assistant manager as â a leader of men
â â i speak to keane and he does want to get back in ( to management ) but at the right establishment , with the right project
keane is not a number two , keane is a leader of men , â said ince
keane has the â mental toughness â required to manage manchester united , says ince ince slides in for a tackle during manchester united 's game against sheffield wednesday in 1992 â and if the right thing ( job ) comes along then i âm sure he will get back into it ( management )
â keane was last in charge at ipswich over four years ago but even so ince is convinced the 43 - year - old will â be a top , top manager â and could even return to the front - line at manchester united
â to be manchester united manager you need broad shoulders and take a lot of criticism
keane has broad shoulders and he is mentally tough
things do nât affect him , â said ince
â he has a poker face , does nât show if things are affecting him , and there is no reason why keane could nât go back to manchester united ( as manager )
â â you can not lose people like him from the game , â warned ince
â he knows so much about football , no matter what your cup of tea is
ince is convinced keane , who was last in charge of ipswich four years ago , will â be a top , top manager â â some people love him , some people hate him
you always try to guess what keanie âs like but he does not let people into his head
â â he âs got a vast knowledge of football and he sets the highest standards
you do nât get the players anymore with keane âs standards , â he added
â you do hear people say â keane rules by fear
â maybe , that âs keane and the way he is
maybe , that âs how he feels he can be a success in what he does and he did it at sunderland
â â keane has an ego
we all had egos at manchester united because that âs what made us who we were , â he added
ince rejected any suggestion that ryan giggs ( left ) might succeed louis van gaal as manchester united boss ince rejected any suggestion that ryan giggs might succeed louis van gaal at manchester united
â no chance , â he said
â you âve got to go to a club that you can learn from and get experience
he âs not ready for manchester united
â ince did nât rule out keane succeeding martin as irish manager
â maybe he ( keane ) thinks that when martin âs done , then he âs the next one to step up
that âs the logic i see in it , â he said
â international football is hard because it âs once every month or two months
i think keanie would like to be on the training ground every day , â cautioned ince .
