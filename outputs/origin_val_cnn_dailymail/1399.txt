a five - year - old boy is recovering after a sea lion that washed up on a san diego beach bit him in the face
the boy was with his family at la jolla cove when he tried to pet the sea lion on sunday
the animal , which was probably starving , ' snapped back its neck and lunged ' at the boy
the san diego fire and rescue department says the boy suffered a ' minor puncture ' to his jaw
his family took him to a local hospital for examination
the incident was reported to the national marine fisheries service , the la times reported
there have been a record number of sea lions washing up on southern california beaches in 2015
nearly 2,000 of the animals have washed up on the state 's shores in sick and starving conditions so far this year
last week , the noaa ( noaa ) sounded the alarm over the surge in famished pups , saying there has been ' an unusually large increase ' in sea lion strandings
in january and february , strandings were 20 times the average rate for those two months
experts believe warming sea temperatures might be responsible for the enormous rise in strandings because the availability of fish and other sea lion food sources has been affected
beachgoers are advised to stay away from mammals , some of which are emaciated and distressed .
