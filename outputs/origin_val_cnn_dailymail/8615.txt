bait : the experienced handler was taught a painful lesson during a stunt for visitors at colorado gator farm ' i was in disbelief when it bit me and i was a little mad and disappointed in myself that i had allowed it to happen
' but i 've seen plenty of other people getting bit so i did n't panic at all
' he added employees tried to help him by wedging the creature 's mouth open with stick - but it only led to the gator clamping down harder
' i knew i had to control the head and keep the gator from rolling or shaking its head and causing me further injury , ' he said
