a melbourne woman has proved that a car on a hot summer âs day really can be hot enough to fry an egg
actress katherine moss incredibly baked cookies , eggs , pasta and grilled cheese successfully on the dashboard of her car on a hot day with frightening results
the ' car cooking ' series has a very important message , indicating that when a child or pet are left in a car on a hot day they are essentially being put in an oven
â the message is clear : do nât cook your pet , â ms katherine moss told daily mail australia
â it started as a bit of fun but when the food started cooking so well and really quickly i thought â can you imagine a kid or a dog in the car ? â it âs nuts to me
â â it âs so important for people to realise what happens inside a hot car
maybe people do nât know and there âs a level of ignorance about just how hot a car becomes
leaving the window down a few centimetres does little the smaller the child or animal , the greater the risk
a young child will quickly dehydrate , lapse into unconsciousness and may never fully recover
the cause is particularly close to the 29 - year - old âs heart as she owns a beautiful two - year - old pug named gil and is often startled when she sees dogs left in cars with the window ajar
ms katherine moss first started by putting a tray of dough on the dashboard , curious about the results
she was amazed when she had well - cooked cookies in just an hour and a half
â the cookies made my car smell amazing so i thought â maybe i should do this more often , â â ms katherine moss laughed
the same could not be said for the egg and grilled cheese experiments
â i had to air my car out after that and was scared i âd develop an ant problem so i think i âm done with car cooking for a little while , â she said
however an interesting result was the awful taste of the food cooked by sunlight
â i ate the cookies but i learned quickly not to eat the car food
i did nât feel very good afterwards ! â i definitely would nât promote it as an alternative method to cooking
more just as a demonstration , ' she joked
the experiment started as a joke to prove how hot her car became in the melbourne sun in just fifteen minutes the chocolate was able to melt and become fondue on the first day of autumn ms katherine moss quickly realised that the car was effectively an oven on a hot day
she decided the images could become a powerful way to send an message about the danger of leaving children and pets alone in hot cars the nida - trained actress also quickly learnt the importance of putting down a tea towel when the tray left a melted mark on her dash
â i had to use oven mitts because the pans got that hot , â she said
in february a 22 - month - old boy died when he was left inside a hot vehicle parked on the driveway of a kyneton daycare centre in victorian
ambulance victorian would not comment on the case , but had issued repeated warnings against leaving children in cars
in the first five weeks of 2015 paramedics were called to 200 cases of children overheating in cars
the website series has quickly gained interest and ms katherine moss was even able to prove that it really can be hot enough to fry an egg in a hot car ms katherine moss could n't believe that the egg had cooked so well that it was brown when she flipped it ms katherine moss ca n't believe that some people are thoughtless enough to leave their pets alone in cars with the window cracked open advanced life support paramedic ben dalton said two children have died in the last few years after being left in hot cars in victorian and says it 's frustrating the message is n't getting through
' children ca n't regulate their body temperature like adults can , which puts them at significant risk , ' he told daily mail australia
' it 's never okay to leave a child locked in a car , even for a minute or two
' the victorian state government said it will increase penalties for leaving children in hot cars , with fines up to $ 3700 and jail time increased from three months to six months
ms katherine moss argues that it is never okay to leave a child or animal unattended , even during the cooler months of the year
' a typical australian summer day that we âve all experienced is sitting in the car and burning yourself with the seatbelt buckle
' â but what âs scary is that some of the car cooking days in melbourne were n't even sunny days , it was just hot
â ms katherine moss herself has a beautiful two - year - old pug named gil ms katherine moss was able to grill cheese on the dashboard of a car , but learned to put down a tea towel after the tray left a ' melted ' mark on her car ms katherine moss could n't believe how quickly and thoroughly the cheese melted and the bread became toasted ms katherine moss was also able to cook the eggs and fondue on an autumn day in sydney , proving that there is a danger of a stuffy car quickly becoming overheated on seemingly cool days
within just 15 minutes she had melted chocolate for fondue
the egg took around an hour , but when katherine moss flipped the egg she was amazed to find it had already become brown
the spaghetti was the most astonishing result
the 29 - year - old left a pot of cold water and hard spaghetti strands in the car
by morning she had uninviting but nonetheless cooked pasta
she has quickly gained a following as well as a range of interesting remarks from friends
â you âre not living in your car , are you ? â asked a friend
â and a car gets you from a to b. so versatile ! â another person mused
â get a stove already , â another quipped
â i do nât understand how people could have a dog and not treat it like a person , like part of the family , ' she said her car cooking has been referred to as â meals - in - wheels â and her â solar oven
â â how good ! go to work , finish and get in your car with your meal cooked already ! winning ! â remarked another friend
however , the realisation that a vehicle can become so intensely hot so quickly is also startling
â i still see animals in cars with a cracked window and it baffles me that it still happens in this day and age when there âs enough literature and information about not doing that sort of thing
â â i do nât understand how people could have a dog and not treat it like a person , like part of the family
â there are no government funded ads to explain what actually happens when children and pets are left in hot cars
â it âs tragic when children die in the back of cars
people need to be aware , it needs to be at the forefront of people âs minds
the first experiment was with cookie dough and was a massive success when they baked in just over an hour ms katherine moss was also impressed when her car smelt delicious thanks to the aroma of baked goods â i think these images are powerful because they make an impact without being grotesque or in poor taste
â the photos , initially intended as a joke , have taken on a life of their own as a way of raising awareness about the reality of a hot car
â i think it âs a really good demonstration of what not to do with your children or your pets , â said ms katherine moss
â if it helps raise any kind of awareness it âs taken an activity that i did with too much time on my hands and turned it into something quite helpful
â the hilarious photos , initially intended as a joke , have taken on a life of their own as a way of raising awareness about the reality of a hot car
