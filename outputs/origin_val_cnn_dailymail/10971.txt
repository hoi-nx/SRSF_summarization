phoenix said : ' if you buy leather gloves , belts or shoes , remember there no easy way to tell who 's skin your really in
' if you love dogs like i do , the please never buy or wear leather , whether it comes from a dog , a cow or any other animal
' in december , peta founder ingrid newkirk said : ' peta is sure that britain , australia and the u.s. are not exempt from the dog leather trade
' many britain high - street retailers are importing cheap leather from china , so products made from dog skin are almost certainly on the shelves and in people 's wardrobes
' skin looks the same , whoever it comes from , and china dog killers are not likely to advertise their skins honestly , so it 's impossible to tell if those leather gloves or wallets are made out of dog , cow , pig , or goat skin
' peta is calling on britain shoppers to consider the terror that dogs and other animals endure when they 're mercilessly slaughtered and make the safe , vegan choice in clothing and accessories for the holidays and every day
' without conducting expensive dna tests , it is virtually impossible to know exactly what kind of animal leather is made from

news agency reuters confirmed the use of dog skin during a visit to an open - air leather processing workshop , where workers stretched washed hides to dry in the sun. with dog meat restaurants popular in many parts of the country , several establishments later sell the animals ' skin to leather producers , workers at the hebei workshop said
' there are restaurants that sell dog meat and people that eat dog meat , ' said one leather producer , who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media
' these places have a person who specially comes and collects the skins ; they 'll go to each place and take a few , ' he said , referring to the producers
' it happens all over the country

the plants peta visited were producing leather for export , said haleigh chang , one of the organisation 's representatives
' one owner of a processing plant told us they export dog skin as lamb skin , ' she said , adding that lack of transparency on the part of producers made it hard to estimate the size of the dog skin sector within the overall leather industry
china has faced criticism for its treatment of animals , including bears , whose bile is used in traditional medicines
tigers are also bred and killed , in some areas , for their pelts and bones
