hull have been charged by the fa for failing to control their players in saturday 's goalless barclays premier league clash against leicester
the charge appears to relate to an incident where a number of tigers players reacted furiously to alex bruce being booked by referee jon ross for a robust but ultimately fair challenge on riyad mahrez
an fa statement read : ' hull have been charged by the fa for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion
' the allegation relates to an incident which occurred in or around the 68th minute of their fixture against leicester on 14 march 2015
' the club has until 6pm on 23 march 2015 to respond to the charge
' hull have been charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion the incident came in the middle of a highly - charged period as michael dawson had been booked two minutes earlier for a challenge on vardy , and huddlestone was dismissed for the visitors just four minutes after , earning his second booking for a foul on vardy
the issue of players applying pressure to referees came to the fore last week with chelsea being accused of being over-zealous during their champions league clash again paris st germain
and following the match at the king power stadium , tigers boss steve bruce launched a thinly - veiled attack on the leicester players for their behaviour towards the officials
' i 've got no problem with huddlestone 's two yellow cards , but is every challenge now a yellow if you mis - time it ? ' he said
alex bruce reacted furiously to being booked by referee jon ross for a challenge on riyad mahrez hull manager steve bruce was unhappy with the behaviour of leicester players ' it got a bit angry towards the end , but for me the referee booked my two centre - backs for ( fair ) challenges
' there 's a raging debate about chelsea in midweek and if we 're not careful ... i saw everyone surround alex bruce for a red card for his challenge
' there was n't a nasty challenge in the game yet we 've had five yellow cards and a sending off
i never saw that coming
' the reason we enjoy the barclays premier league is its honesty and integrity and if we 're going to go down the route of every other league - jumping around and whinging and trying to get people yellow and red cards - for me that 's not right
' foxes manager nigel pearson strongly disagreed , and when asked for a response to alex bruce 's statement said : ' how many times have you seen us play this year ? ' you 're not in a position to judge my players on that
you 're asking me and i 've told you , " no , i do n't think it 's a fair assessment "
