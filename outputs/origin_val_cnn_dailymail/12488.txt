boko haram , the nigeria - based islamist terror group , has pledged allegiance to isis , according to an audio message purported to be from boko haram 's leader , shekau
in the audio , which was posted online saturday , the speaker says boko haram is announcing its " allegiance to the caliph of the islam , ibrahim ibn awad ibn ibrahim al-husseini al-qurashi , " which is another name for isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi
cnn has not been able to independently authenticate the message
but zenn , an expert on the terror group and is with the jamestown foundation , said the recording appeared to be authentic
he said that while other messages have been faked , the speaker in this one is shekau
" boko haram joining the isis fold makes sense to both groups , " he said from abuja , nigeria
" boko haram will get legitimacy , which will help its recruiting , funding and logistics as it expands into ( french - speaking ) west africa
it will also get guidance from isis in media warfare and propaganda
previously boko haram was a sort of outcast in the global jihadi community
now it is perhaps isis 's biggest affiliate
" isis gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate
" zenn said the allegiance will be official when an isis leader such as spokesman abu mohammed al adnani issues a statement
boko haram has had two main factions -- one led by shekau and the other comprising former members of ansaru , a boko haram offshoot
ansaru had been operating from around 2012 as the nigeria wing of al qaeda ( al qaeda )
after the french - led intervention in mali in 2013 , a significant number of ansaru members re-integrated with shekau , zenn told cnn
the prerequisite for boko haram joining isis coalition was a coming together of two factions
isis connected with former ansaru fighters within boko haram and pressed them to further unify the group 's ranks
the result was the formation of a unity general command between the two factions
that involved bridging of some ideological differences between the al qaeda - like ansaru and the ultra extreme " takfiri " - like shekau
the pledge follows a period during which shekau 's faction had been mimicking isis , including praising al-baghdadi and featuring his image in their videos and photos
zenn said that until recently there had been little feedback from isis , apart from a few references to nigeria jihadis in recent issues of the english - language dabiq magazine
it appears that a month ago isis set up a twitter account on which saturday 's message was linked , zenn said
the twitter handle was mutually promoted by boko haram and isis
in july , shekau voiced support for isis , and declared a overtaken town in northeast nigeria to be part of an islam caliphate
but he also said he was praying for al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri and taliban leader mullah omar
u.s. intelligence officials have some doubts the two groups would get along
the cia 's analysis has been that boko haram is very african and rooted in that region 's islam practices , even if they have similar fundamentalist interpretations of islam
and isis 's arab leadership and membership tends to have racist attitudes toward blacks , not unlike the society they come from
isis leaders view shekau as inferior , partly for racist reasons , the cia indicated at a briefing for reporters
boko haram , whose name translates as " western education is sin , " has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of sharia law
boko haram 's tactics have intensified in recent years , from battling nigeria government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages , mass kidnappings , assassinations , market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques
much of this violence has taken place in nigeria
but neighboring countries , such as cameroon and chad , have also been hit increasingly hard
