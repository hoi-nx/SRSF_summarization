mata finished off a sumptuous move in some style as manchester united beat liverpool 2 - 1 at anfield on sunday
the spanish midfielder latched onto angel di maria 's lofted pass , and twisted his body to volley a spectacular effort past despairing goalkeeper simon mignolet
we 're not calling it an ' overhead kick ' , but his finish was sublime
so , what other scissor kicks have we seen over the years ? mata fires home a spectacular effort for manchester united against liverpool on sunday the spaniard 's goal was the second of his double and secured a 2 - 1 victory for louis van gaal 's side paolo di canio ( west ham vs wimbledon , 1999 ) as casual as it was genius
when trevor sinclair lifted the ball into the box , he would not have imagined the enigmatic italy forward would have executed the volley to find the corner
paolo di canio 's scissor kick flew past wimbledon goalkeeper neil sullivan , and deservedly won west ham 's player of the season award
his goal of the season gong for 1999/00 in the premier league was no surprise , either

on the first day of the campaign , the uruguayan midfielder sprinted to meet gianfranco zola 's lofted pass and spectacularly volleyed home
his goal was one of four at stamford bridge against the hapless sunderland
and that was n't the last time sunderland fans would lose their cool with gus poyet
guti ( real madrid vs villarreal , 2001 ) guti 's scissor kick was one that we had n't seen before , and have n't seen since
standing upright , similar to paolo di canio and gus poyet , the real madrid star side foots his volley into the top corner
the bernabeu faithful have seen several special players this century , but not many goals as unique as this ( 3minutes , 10 seconds )

in the last 32 of the uefa cup , the 24 - year - old dutch striker showed incredible technique from the edge of the box to divert this wayward pass into the bottom corner
luis suarez ( barcelona vs levante 2015 ) the former liverpool striker has now forged his legacy at barcelona with the winner in el clasico on sunday night , but as recently as last month , luis suarez was struggling to hit top form at the nou camp

luis suarez bends back to fire home a scissor kick during barcelona 's 5 - 0 victory against levante last month sebastian coates ( liverpool vs qpr , 2012 ) sebastian coates has endeared himself to liverpool fans defensively , and is now struggling on loan at sunderland
so this acrobatic attempt against qpr certainly came out of the blue
his first goal for the club , the centre half jogged up for a corner and his volley flew past paddy kenny in goal
however , his flaws at the back were later highlighted as the hosts at loftus road came back to win 3 - 2
sebastian coates netted his first goal for liverpool against qpr in 2012 - a stunning volley past paddy kenny kermogant ( bournemouth vs ipswich , 2014 ) down to the championship now , and with runaway leaders bournemouth
four months ago , the cherries took just 111 seconds to net first against ipswich
french target man kermogant lashed home a magnificent scissor kick , sending the goldstands stadium faithful wild
peter crouch ( liverpool vs galatasaray , 2006 ) the scissor kicks of all scissor kicks
peter crouch 's semi-overhead effort defied belief

after taking two touches to bring the ball down , manuel negrete fed javier aguirre and then met the quick return pass with a mesmeric left - foot volley which had the host nation in raptures .
