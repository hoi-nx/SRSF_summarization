activists : members of the union have asked for jazz hands rather than clapping in case it caused anxiety young student union activists have asked other conference delegates to wave with ' jazz hands ' instead of clapping or cheering speakers in case it ' triggers anxiety ' among nervous members
hundreds were asked to wave in silence because other people found ' whooping ' to be ' super inaccessible '
the request was made at the national union of students ' annual women 's conference in solihull , west midlands , which started yesterday
union women 's campaign tweeted : ' whooping is fun for some , but can be super inaccessible for others , so please try not to whoop ! jazz hands work just as well
' they then followed that with : ' some delegates are requesting that we move to jazz hands rather than clapping , as it 's triggering anxiety
please be mindful ! # nuswomen15 '
critics have said the messages had ' damaged feminism '
tara hewitt tweeted : ' this damages real equality nothing from conference will make a difference today but " jazz hands " nonsense damaged feminism '
others lampooned the instructions online
@ jlat55 tweeted : ' open palms can be triggering
well , so can closed ones ... you should just ban any outward expression of approval
' the suggestions got more ridiculous and ironic with @ bookgeek-t tweeting : ' @ nuswomcam @ little - g2 hi , jazz hands can be triggering because of the quick movement of the hands
i vote blinking rapidly instead
despite the jokes the union has said that it is important that they are inclusive
nona buckley-irvine , general secretary at the lse su , said : ' jazz hands are used throughout union in place of clapping as a way to show appreciation of someone 's point without interrupting or causing disturbance , as it can create anxiety
' i 'm relatively new to this and it did feel odd at first , but once you 've used jazz hands a couple of times it becomes a genuinely nice way to show solidarity with a point and it does add to creating a more inclusive atmosphere
' practical example : this woman shows how jazz hands should be done - but union delegates were urged not to make any noise doing it lse su women 's officer gee linford-grayson added : ' as someone who is new to the union conference culture it surprised me at first , but actually within a few rounds of jazz hands applause it began to make a lot of sense , as loud clapping and whooping can be intimidating and distracting when you 're speaking on stage
' plus who does n't like jazz hands ? ! ' the annual event decides the female issues for the union to campaign on , and elects the campaign 's representatives
an union spokesperson said : ' the request was made by some delegates attending the conference
' we strive to make union events accessible and enjoyable for all , so each request is considered
