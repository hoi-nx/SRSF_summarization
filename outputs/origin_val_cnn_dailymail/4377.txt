diary : the new guidance from nice suggests keeping a diary of everything you eat to help keep those extra pounds off they are pastimes that millions of us do every week to keep relatively fit and healthy
dancing , gardening and walking up hills are all well - known as simple exercises that would help to fight the flab
but the health watchdog nice believes we should be given official guidance to remind those who do nât bother - and that we should keep a daily diary alongside details of meals , snacks and drinks
the watchdog warns to pay particular attention to lattes , high protein drinks , nuts and alcohol which contain hidden calories they may not realise they have consumed
it is estimated that a quarter of adults in the uk are obese although this is projected to increase to almost two thirds by 2050
the condition is thought to cost the health service and economy Â£ 16 billion a year through medical treatment , sick days and benefits
officials from nice hope that encouraging adults to â self - monitor â their activity and food intake will prompt them to adopt healthier lifestyles
they are particularly concerned that the emergence of a â coffee culture â in recent years has led to uk consuming calorie - laden lattes and muffins on top of their meals and snacks
guidance also points out that many adults who do exercise underdo the good work immediately afterwards by â refuelling â on high sugar sports drinks and protein shakes
additionally , the watchdog instructs parents to avoid giving children sweets at weekends , the school holidays or even for good behaviour
even in small amounts , they can â disrupt â everyday healthy eating habits and lead to obesity , they state
other recommendations include urging adults not to drink too much alcohol as this also contains high numbers of hidden calories
it points out that even if a woman sticks within the recommended safe limits of 2 to 3 units a day â a large glass of wine â this contains as many calories as mars bar
do n't undo good work at the gym by drinking protein shakes or high sugar sports drinks afterwards
avoid calorific coffees like lattes â and the muffins and cakes that come with them
remember nuts and alcohol have ' hidden calories '
do n't allow children more than two hours of ' screen time ' a day â which includes watching tv or playing handheld video games
have ' tv - free ' days and go on a walk or cycle - ride instead
