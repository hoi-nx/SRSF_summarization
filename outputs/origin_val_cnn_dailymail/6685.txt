sorry : bob jones iii ( pictured left and right in 2005 ) has apologized for saying gay men and lesbians should be stoned ' as the bible commands ' in 1980 speaking to the associated press at the time , he said : ' i 'm sure this will be greatly misquoted
but it would not be a bad idea to bring the swift justice today that was brought in israel 's day against murder and rape and homosexuality
' i guarantee it would solve the problem post-haste if homosexuals were stoned , if murderers were immediately killed as the bible commands
' in an apology issued on saturday he said the comments were ' antithetical to my theology and my 50 years of preaching a redeeming christ
' according to nbc , he added : ' i take personal ownership of this inflammatory rhetoric
' this reckless statement was made in the heat of a political controversy 35 years ago
regret : in an apology issued on saturday , bob jones iii ( pictured in 1974 ) said the comments were ' antithetical to my theology and my 50 years of preaching a redeeming christ
' ' i can not erase them , but wish i could , because they do not represent the belief of my heart or the content of my preaching
neither before , nor since , that event in 1980 have i ever advocated the stoning of sinners
' the apology has been sought for three years by bj unity , an lgbt group made up of alumni from the evangelical college
in a statement they accepted his apology , saying : ' we are grateful that bob jones iii has taken responsibility for these words ; words that have caused deep harm for many more people than any of us knows
' this means a lot to us because it represents the beginning of a change in the rhetoric and conversation
