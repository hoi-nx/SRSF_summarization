he 's a good man
' prosecutors claim that mitchell followed his victim into her apartment at 5.30am on the day of the attack
however , ms tyneka hudson questions the verdict
she said : ' no one knows the real story
only she and him know
i ca nât say he did it
i ca nât say he did nât do it
he told me he did nât rape the lady
he said they were drinking and he put a hickey on her
i do nât know what he was doing in her apartment
' manhattan district attorney cyrus r. vance jr said : ' this lengthy prison sentence reflects the extremely violent nature of this attack , in which mitchell raped a woman in her own home
' i would like to thank the survivor for coming forward , and my office âs sex crimes prosecutors for ensuring that this predator will serve years behind bars
' prosecutor carty told manhattan supreme court that mitchell surreptitiously entered the woman 's apartment on september 19 , 2013 at 5.30am and threatened her with a knife and said he had a gun
after the attack , the victim rang 911 and nypd 's warrant squad arrested mitchell four days later
ms carty read the victim 's statement into the court record in advance of mitchell 's sentencing
she said on behalf of the victim : ' this man has completely ruined my life
i have tried to rationalise what i could have done in my life to have deserved what happened to me
the only conclusion that i have come up with is that some people in this world are truly terrible
' ' i can not understand why the man did this to me
why he told me he would kill me if i did nât do what he said
' i do not know if he raped me because i only had $ 24 , or if that was the initial reason that he broke into my apartment
if he had broken into my apartment to assault me , then why did he make me talk to him for so long ? ' i was trapped in my own home for what felt like forever talking to this man and not knowing if he was going to kill me or my dog â he made it clear to me that he was very capable of both
' mitchell has been told he can remain on rikers island , pictured , until next month so he can marry his girlfriend tyneka hudson and receive conjugal visits when he is sent to a prison in upstate new york the statement added : ' i gave him so many chances to leave
i told him multiple times that if he left right then nothing bad would happen
' it is claimed that mitchell was drinking at the time of the attack and told his victim ' i 'll slit your throat
this is going to happen either way
' as well as receiving a 14 - year jail term , mitchell was ordered to undergo 10 years ' post release supervision .
