a baby gorilla who fought for her life after being born via a rare emergency c - section has celebrated turning one at san diego zoo safari park
the ape , known as joanne , received yam cupcakes , a giant ice sculpture cake and a cardboard doll house for her birthday on thursday
she was caught picking pieces of fruit and vegetables out of her frozen treat as it melted in the morning sun. san diego is currently experiencing highs of 30 degrees celsius
joanne was born on march 12 2014 via c - section
her mother , an 18 - year - old named imani , had never given birth and apparently got distressed after going into labor
that 's when vets decided a natural birth was not possible
a neonatal specialist from uc san diego medical center helped veterinary surgeons perform the touch - and - go operation

one year on , zookeepers say joanne is active and plays with other young gorillas in the troop
commenting on her progress , animal care manager peggy sexton said : ' as a one - year - old gorilla she 's at the stage where she âs exploring everything
she 's learning to climb
' climbing up is easy , harder is to get down
but she âs got that figured out
rocky start : after her birth , joanne had to spend her first 11 days in a veterinary hospital with pneumonia before she was reunited with her mother ' she 's interacting with more of the troop other than just her mom
' while joanne 's primary source of nutrition is still from nursing , she is gradually moving towards solids
the growing gorilla is curious of any food items that her mother imani is eating and will watch as she forages , to mimic those behaviors on her own
joanne was named in honor of joanne warren , the first chairwoman of the foundation of san diego zoo global , which aims at bringing species back from the brink of extinction .
