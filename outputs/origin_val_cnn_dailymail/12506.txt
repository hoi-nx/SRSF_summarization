with its snow - capped mountains and picturesque deserted hamlets , the bleone valley , where a germanwings jet crashed tuesday , is a stunningly beautiful but sparsely populated spot
tiny villages are scattered along the gorge , which rises from the apple and pear orchards and the gray stone riverbed of the valley floor to heights of more than 2,000 meters ( 1.2 miles ) above sea level
many of these villages , which were bustling communities in the 19th century , now lie abandoned or survive with just a handful of inhabitants
one dead - end road , the d107 , winds its way through prads-haute-bleone , passing churches and a campsite that offers a peaceful retreat for summer hikers
but the remoteness -- which appeals to small numbers of holidaymakers looking to ski in winter or take restorative walks through the green hills in the warmer months -- may make reaching the wreckage of the germanwings plane difficult
gilles gravier , director of the tourist office in val d'allos , told french newspaper liberation the crash occurred in a particularly steep spot on the trois eveches mountain , and may have been witnessed by skiers on the area 's slopes
" there is no access by road ; emergency crews are coming in by air , using helicopters , " he said
capt. benoit zeisser from the gendarmerie in the nearby town of digne told cnn the aircraft was lying in " difficult terrain
" sandrine boisse , the president of the tourism office at the pra loup ski resort , said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened
" it was about 11 ( a.m. ) here
i was outside the garage , and we heard a strange noise , " she said
" and at first we thought it was an avalanche , but it was strange at this time because it was 11
... we did n't know what
" her husband was skiing nearby and saw a plane flying at low altitude , she said
french president francois hollande warned " it will take some hours for the emergency services to reach the crash site
" photographs posted on twitter hours after the plane disappeared from radar showed helicopters preparing to take off , and emergency vehicles lining up ready to receive the victims ' remains
the bodies of those on board the plane are expected to be taken to the gymnasium at the local high school in seyne les alpes , some 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) from the crash site , which will be used as a temporary morgue
french police in the region have pleaded with locals and visitors to stay away from the site , urging them " not to clutter the roads , " leaving them clear for emergency vehicles .
