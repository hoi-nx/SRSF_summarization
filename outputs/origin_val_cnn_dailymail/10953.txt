it is known as one of the happiest countries in the world , but vietnam 's population is somewhat shy about smiling for the camera
as french photographer , rã©hahn , was travelling through the south east asian country , he observed that many people conceal their smile with their hand , as a mark of modesty or politeness
he decided that the shy gesture would make an interesting subject for to focus on and travelled through the country snapping portrait photos for a series he called hidden smiles
he has been travelling round on a motorbike there since 2001 he noticed that a lot of people cover their mouths when they smile , either out of shyness , or elegance , if there was a lack of teeth he noticed the effect the smile has on the whole face , when the mouth is concealed from view
his portraits focus on the eyes and lines of the face caused by the happy emotion since giving up his hectic life in french , the photographer has spent three years in hoi an , vietnam , ranked the happiest country in the world , and says he has discovered their true meaning of happiness through his pictures
in particular , rã©hahn was keen to highlight how the smile is translated throughout every inch of the face , even when the mouth is covered
born in 1979 in normandy , the photographer has enjoyed life travelling around vietnam on his motorbike and has so far taken over 40,000 pictures
for rã©hahn , a smile is more than mere muscle twitching and his hidden smiles project aims to celebrate the corners of the face etched by a lifetime of happy emotion
' vietnam people are the most positive and optimistic people i 've ever met in my life
it gives me a good energy everyday , just when i cross the small village where i live and meet many smiles
it 's feng shui : only good energy ! ' he said
looking past old age , or the wearing of poverty , the photographs reveal an energy and life behind the eyes of the individuals , through their concealed smiles
when asked why many subjects cover their mouths rehahn said young girls do it out of embarrassment , and old women tend to do it out of elegance to cover their lack of teeth
' i think a good photography is when you can capture the soul , read a story in the eyes
capture emotion is not an easy thing , time is the key ! spending time with people always gave me better photos ! ' he said
rehahn states he has only travelled to a quarter of the country , despite being a permanent resident there since 2011
of the many photographs he has taken , 145 have made it to his first photo - book ' vietnam â mosaic , ' which aims to show vietnam in a natural and spontaneous light
' i tried to understand why people covered their mouth
when they cover the mouth , we focus on their eyes and wrinkles
it 's photogenic ! ' rehahn said the photographer uses canon 5d mark iii to capture his subjects , and spends time talking to the individuals to put them at ease the photographer has gained much recognition since publishing his book in january 2014
the 35 - year - old has been featured in numerous newspapers and magazines , and has gained over 182,000 fans in one year on his facebook page
rehahn is travelling to india in april to complete the collection and then will go to mongolia in june
his heart , however , lies in the happy nation of vietnam
' every month i am travelling in vietnam by motorbike , to record the vanishing culture of ethnic minorities , ' he said
' i have 45 000 photos , 45 000 stories ! one of my secrets is when i ask them " khong co rang " which translates as " you do n't have teeth
" the vietnam are very direct and like to joke , ' he commented ' vietnam people are the most positive and optimistic people i 've ever met in my life
