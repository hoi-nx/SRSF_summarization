england proposals for men âs team gb football at the rio olympics have already been kicked into the long grass by the other home nations â and the women âs hopes are going in the same direction
there were strong hopes that a women âs team could still represent team gb in brazil in 2016 when the strength of the opposition for wales , scotland and ireland soon made it obvious that the men âs initiative was a non-starter
team gb are unlikely to reform for 2016 olympic games after coming together for london 2012 but the celtic countries , having been promised that the two football sides at london 2012 were a one - off , have informed the fa that they see no reason to treat women âs football any differently because it still threatens their independence â however many times they âre reassured by fifa that it wo nât
the fa will announce imminently that both team gb football sides have been scrapped
such are football âs sensitive politics that after fifa president sepp blatter had praised uefa âs work in his opening speech at the uefa congress in vienna , the president of the europe body , michel platini , left out his one dig at sepp blatter contained in advance copies of his speech
michel platini ( right ) seemed to bite his lip during his speech about sepp blatter 's fifa at the uefa congress michel platini , in an obvious nod to sepp blatter âs regular references to steering the world football ship , was due to say : â i regard myself as a simple team - mate , at most your captain
but not the captain of a ship that is being battered by a storm , clinging to the helm for dear life
â but he skipped the bit about â clinging to the helm for dear life â
nothing sums up sepp blatter âs presidential election trickery more than the decision to have a special meeting in zurich to decide future numbers of world cup places â the day after the uefa congress vote in may
this will allow sepp blatter at least to make promises about more world cup places to the confederations who support him
fifa say the issue has to be debated afterwards as candidate luis figo ( right ) has increasing world cup participation as part of his manifesto
england return to dublin for a friendly against ireland after riots saw the last game abandoned in 1995 there is confidence england âs powderkeg friendly against the republic of ireland at the aviva stadium on june 7 â the first time england have played in dublin since a riot forced the abandonment in 1995 â will pass without trouble
all the focus in ireland is on the crucial euro 2016 qualifier with scotland on june 13
no whitewash for gill there was no surprise about david gill being elected british vice-president on the fifa exco at the uefa congress on tuesay
but fa â outspoken president trefor lloyd-hughes , who has made increasingly outlandish claims about fa skulduggery , received 10 votes out of 54 which is nine more than many expected
meanwhile , gill said that rather than ask â awkward â questions of the zurich regime which fa chairman greg dyke wants him to do , he will be putting â relevant and appropriate â ones
luis figo ( left ) and the more impressive michael van praag are unlikely to oust sepp blatter as fifa president the worry for all three uefa - endorsed rivals for sepp blatter âs crown â prince ali of jordan , holland âs van praag and portugal âs luis figo â is that the fifa president still enjoys backing in europe
estonia football president aivar pohlak claims as many as half of uefa delegates could back sepp blatter
that seems unlikely but at least 15 out of 54 countries could
meanwhile , van praag was easily the most impressive of the three challengers when they were given the uefa congress floor
fa chairman greg dyke âs demand for radical changes in top - flight clubs â 25 - man squads to ensure young english players get more game time has irritated the pl
greg dyke said : â we âre open to discussions and i âd like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue
â fa chief greg dyke has angered pl clubs with his plans for more home - grown players there could now be tension between greg dyke and the pl at the clubs â summit on thursday , particularly given greg dyke was last week advised not to go public by the professional game representatives on the fa board
but the extent to which wembley were determined to get maximum publicity for greg dyke âs proposals was shown by them bringing in expensive pr firm milltown partners to lobby media to attend the press briefing
it was also held at the start of international week so the pl could have no complaints about it deflecting attention from their competition .
