luis enrique says english 's lack of a winter break may have given barcelona an advantage against manchester city â and he hopes the premier league do n't change their fixture list
pellegrini suggested after manchester city 's 1 - 0 defeat in the nou camp that the number of games english clubs played in december and january meant they struggled in the latter stages of the champions league

luis enrique conceded barcelona may have an advantage over english sides due to the winter break ivan rakitic ( right ) scored as barcelona beat manchester city 1 - 0 in the nou camp on wednesday city manager pellegrini believes the games his team play over christmas hinder them in europe and luis enrique has some sympathy for pellegrini
' we are used to resting during winter with our families , ' luis enrique said
' i heard ( southampton manager ) ronald koeman complaining about the number of fixtures in english , so maybe it is an advantage for us
' i do n't know , it is impossible to say , but we do enjoy watching the english teams playing on boxing day
' speaking after the game , pellegrini suggested the heavy fixture scheduling played a part in manchester city 's demise
lionel messi 's barcelona eliminated manchester city by beating them 3 - 1 on aggregate in the champions league for the second time in three years , there are not any english teams in the last eight of the champions league pellegrini said : ' it is difficult to analyse because the premier league is strong , with money and very good players
' we play so many games in december and january and we are not fresh in february
in spain , italy and germany they stop playing
last year we played nine games in december and nine in january , and that was before we played barcelona
