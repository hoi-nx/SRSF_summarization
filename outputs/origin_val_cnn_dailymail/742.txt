he was left with a fractured eye socket and severe bruising all over his body the attack , which mr nagarajah says has left him ' traumatised ' , took place after the three men walked into mv supermarket in arnold , nottingham , just as the shop was closing on march 3 ' i have two children
will the next one come to my house ? i 'm worried about their safety
' it was around closing time , i had gone out to close one of the two metal shutters , then just popped back into the store to turn off the cctv screens , and then turned round and the men were there
' it was so traumatic and horrendous that i think i have blacked out several parts of it
' he added : ' they had metal things on their hands
one of them was holding me
he sat on me and punched me
i remember being hit and kicked and trying to escape
i thought i was going to die
sickeningly , a third man , who does not appear to be involved in the beating , is seen stepping over mr nagarajah , as his two accomplices continue with the brutal assault the video shows the three thugs knocking over stacks of cans , before one of the men begins punching the father - of - two to the ground ' they caught me and i do n't know what happened next , but then i remember trying to crawl away and they were shouting about giving them money
' but we do n't keep money in the shop , so they started stamping on my head , and i remember my energy leaving me and i thought this could be the end
that 's when i passed out
' apparently when they had left i phoned the police , but i do n't remember that and i do n't remember going to hospital
' i looked back at the cctv afterwards and a man actually stops a few metres after walking past the shop , because he has obviously heard something , but then after three or four seconds he walks off again
' the three attackers have been described by police as being of ' muscular build ' and being between the ages of 22 and 28

i thought i was going to die ' the father - of - two has owned and run the supermarket ( pictured ) for eight years detective inspector rich monk , from nottinghamshire police , said : ' this was a particularly violent and cowardly attack on a man who had no chance to defend himself
' the injuries he suffered , as nasty as they were , could have been so much worse

' perhaps you recognise something about their clothing or the way they carry themselves
or maybe you have heard someone bragging about the robbery
' if you know something then we hope you take one look at this cctv footage and pick up the phone
you can help us get these men off the streets today
