family members of three boys and their grandmother killed in a house fire the morning after christmas now have hundreds of photos salvaged from the blaze to help preserve memories of their loved ones , thanks to the work of college students
about 260 photos , which were about the only items rescued from the december 26 fire in washington court house , ohio , were painstakingly restored by art conservation undergraduates at the university of delaware
many of the photos were charred , covered in soot and stained by the water used to fight the blaze that took the lives of 60 - year - old harris and her grandsons : kenyon , 14 , broderick , 11 , and braylon , nine
police had said the boys wanted to spend christmas night with their grandmother so she would n't be alone
the state fire marshal 's office said friday that the cause of the blaze has n't been determined
the restored photos were delivered to the family friday in a tear - filled gathering in their hometown about 75 miles north of cincinnati
the boys ' father , ricky harris , told those gathered for the delivery of the photos that he was very grateful to have the photos that include ones of his sons and mother
many of the photos were charred , covered in soot and stained by the water used to fight the blaze that took the lives of 60 - year - old harris and her grandsons : kenyon , 14 , broderick , 11 , and braylon , nine but after a range of restoration techniques were applied , the images were revealed in their former glory ' it is hard to see the photos , but it was always hard to look at old photos even when they were here because of the reminder of the time i had already lost with my boys and mom , ' he told the washington court house record herald , saying he ca n't help but lament all the good times they had gone by
debra hess norris , chairwoman of the university of delaware 's art conservation department and a photograph conservation professor , delivered the photos to the family
she told the associated press in a telephone interview afterward that it was an emotional day and an honor to meet the family after working so long on their photographs
