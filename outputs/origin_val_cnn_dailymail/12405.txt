a criminal ? a sanitation worker in an atlanta suburb already served two weekends in jail -- and faced several more until officials relented monday -- after authorities charged him for doing his job too early in the morning
mcgill , a garbage collector in sandy springs , georgia , had been sentenced to a total of 30 days in jail for violating the city 's noise ordinance that states that " trash collection must be conducted between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. " he was cited one recent morning after starting work about 5 a.m. mcgill said that when he appeared in court , he was " stunned " when he learned he 'd have to serve time for collecting garbage too early
" the solicitor said , ' it 's automatic jail time , ' " mcgill told cnn affiliate wsb
mcgill said it was the first time he 'd violated the ordinance , but the solicitor " did n't want to hear nothing i had to say
" " i was shocked , " mcgill told wsb
city spokeswoman kraun said mcgill appeared in court with his employer and agreed to a plea deal , which included a 30 - day jail sentence
the court said the sentence could be served on weekends , and kraun confirmed monday that mcgill already spent two weekends behind bars
after news of mcgill 's punishment went viral , the solicitor 's office announced monday that prosecutors would amend his sentence , saying in a statement , " the actions of the court with regards to mr. mcgill 's sentence for violating the city 's noise laws was disproportionate to a first - time offense
" " as such , the court has amended its sentence to time served and further probation ( is ) suspended , " the statement said
chief prosecutor bill riley told wsb that the jail sentence was his idea because , he said , " fines do n't seem to work
" " the only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail , " mcgill said
still , mcgill said being locked up with " real criminals " was hard , and so was being away from his family
" i just want this to be over with , " he told wsb before getting word of the " time served " adjustment
" i 'm away from my family , my wife , and she 's got to take care of the two little boys and i have four dogs
