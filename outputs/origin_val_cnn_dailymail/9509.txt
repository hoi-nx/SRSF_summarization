she 's famous for her colourful hats and now , a fascinating collection of previously unseen letters to her milliner has revealed just how much the queen adores them
the letters , written to long - serving hat - maker somerville over 25 years , the missives also touch on queen 's passion for corgis and her knowledge of running a business
others contain thanks for hats made by mr somerville and a touching sentence in which the queen describes herself as ' almost the only person ' who wears hats all the time
but it is the letters that are likely to attract the most interest , with auctioneers saying they could fetch as much as Â£ 2,000 when they are sold later this month
in one of the notes , which was written to mr somerville and dated january 5 , 2009 , the queen thanks him for a sandringham christmas present of a china corgi
' thank you so much for the charming china corgi you gave me for sandringham christmas , ' she wrote
' i am so pleased to have it and it is a good portrayal of the breed
it will join my assorted collection of them ! ' she added : ' can i once more express my great gratitude for all the help and the fine hats i have had over the years from you

' i expect there will be a need for a few hats in the coming months ! ' somerville began making hats for the queen in the early 1980s , a role he held right through to his retirement in 2008
famous fan : princess princess diana was among the flock of celebrities and royals to wear mr somerville 's creations stunning : mr somerville 's designs also appeared on the red carpet and in fashion magazines taking over : most of the queen 's hats , including the one pictured , are now made by angela kelly he also made hats for princess diana , the duchess of kent , queen silvia of sweden , and members of the dutch and greek royal families

his hats were also worn by a string of bond girls including famke janssen in 1995 film goldeneye , and sophie marceau in the world is not enough from 1999
' the letters are fascinating because they give a very rare glimpse of the queen âs personal side , revealing her to be very sweet , humble and funny , ' says lydia wilkinson , co-ordinator of the auction , which takes place at fraser 's autographs in london on 20th march
' the majority of people only ever see the queen in her official role where she is required to be formal and quite serious , but these letters show a completely different side to her
' queen is a big fan of hats and it âs quite clear from the correspondence that she and mr somerville , as her milliner , were very close
' the market for royal memorabilia is always strong so we are expecting a large amount of interest in these letters , not just from the uk but from the us as well where the royal family are much loved
' from colourful cocktail numbers to elaborate feathered headpieces , the queen is almost as famous for her hats as she is for her constitutional role
in france , her headgear is looked upon with total fascination , while in the uk , her majesty 's hats are traditionally the subject of bets during royal ascot week
since the death of mr somerville , most of the queen 's hats are the work of her dressmaker , angela kelly , who was also responsible for the ivory number worn to greet the president and first lady of mexico earlier this week
but regardless of who is making them , as these photos reveal , her majesty is never anything less than beautifully turned out
