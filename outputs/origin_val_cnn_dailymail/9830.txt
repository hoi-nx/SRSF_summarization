in the aftermath of a remarkably freakish manchester united winner at st james ' park on wednesday night , an unusually animated louis van gaal pinched giggs hard on the cheek and stared hard in to his eyes as if to say : ' i told you so '
the only problem was that giggs was n't buying it
giggs has been at manchester united for two decades and did n't even crack a smile
he knows that football like this will not take his football club where it needs to go
not in the long run , anyway
giggs has seen plenty of late winning goals for manchester united over the years
he has been part of teams that have won when they have n't deserved to , who have somehow grabbed something from games that seemingly had nothing to offer
ashley young fires home the winner for manchester united to earn his side a valuable three points at newcastle young peels away in celebration as manchester united remain on course for a top - four finish despite playing below their best ashley young runs over to celebrate in front of the manchester united fans after his late strike at st james ' park rooney , carrick and danny blind are among the manchester united players to celebrate with ashley young rooney was involved in the build up as his pressure forced the newcastle defence to panic before krul gifted the chance to ashley young krul lies on his back in dejection after his error allowed ashley young to slam home manchester united 's winner against newcastle manchester united manager louis van gaal reacts to ashley young 's winner by knocking his assistant giggs on the cheek ... ... but giggs shows absolutely no emotion after ashley young 's winner gave manchester united a crucial victory in their champions league push newcastle ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : krul 8 ; janmaat 6.5 , mike williamson 6.5 , fabricio coloccini 6 , r taylor 5.5 ( gutierrez 64 , 6.5 ) ; obertan 6 , mehdi abeid 6 , sissoko 6 , ameobi 5.5 ( gouffran 81 ) ; emmanuel riviere 5.5 ( ayoze perez 59 ) , papiss cisse 5 subs not used : anita , armstrong , satka , woodman

his manchester united , though , the one that he knows , used to bully teams late in games
as his old manager sir alex ferguson has admitted , manchester united teams of yore used to practice scoring late goals in training
they won games like this by sheer force of will , belief and personality
this manchester united team , on the other hand , the one with van gaal 's uncertain hand on the tiller , stumbles its way in to opportunities
somehow it manages to win despite itself
if it continues like this for another two months then it may yet find itself in the champions league places come the season 's end
at the moment , though , it is hard to see it
this , in many ways , was the modern manchester united at their worst
facing a home team devoid of purpose , energy and intelligence , manchester united really should have taken hold of this game , won it comfortably and used it as a platform ahead of tougher challenges to come
instead , they saw newcastle miss two golden opportunities and wasted their own with inept work in front of goal
the home team , meanwhile , were somehow denied a clear early penalty by a referee that we can only presume â generously â was unsighted
and then there was the winning goal
three points handed to manchester united on a black and white tray
there was no late cavalry charge by manchester united here
they had settled for a point
the game was drifting towards a conclusion that had seemed inevitable for so long
but then rooney 's run in to the penalty area was halted by mehdi abeid , the subsequent back pass sold goalkeeper krul short and when the clearance â born of panic and terror â landed at the feet of ashley young , the goal waited â empty â just ten yards away
marouane fellaini came close to scoring for manchester united but he was denied by a brilliant stop from krul ashley young had a chance to convert the rebound but took too long and was also denied by newcastle 's dutch goalkeeper angel di maria was replaced early in the second half by adnan januzaj as manchester united struggled to break down a stubborn newcastle side rooney has scored more premier league goals against newcastle than any other club , although he failed to add to his tally of 12 on wednesday night
it was an astonishing moment
this great stadium has witnessed plenty of drama over the years and no little pantomime
it has n't witnessed much like this , though
in the home dugout , manager john carver stood aghast
this was some way to lose a football match and it was hard not to feel some sympathy for him
his team had been pretty lousy but they did n't deserve to lose
his thoughts understandably were still with the early penalty shout , somehow denied him when chris smalling hacked down emmanuel riviere in the eleventh minute
' that would have set us up nicely , ' he said
had newcastle scored first then it âs questionable whether manchester united would have had it in them to respond
as it was , nothing much else happened in the first half , apart from what may have been an unpleasant exchange of saliva between jonny evans and papiss cisse
rooney , playing as a lone centre forward , missed two chances around the half hour mark , clipping one wide when face to face with krul and then falling over when a slip by fabricio coloccini presented him with another sight of goal
there was not a shot on target from either team , however , until marouane fellaini âs header required krul to parry in the 44th minute
newcastle were poor enough to allow manchester united the majority of the possession but van gaal âs team , not unusually , did nât have the wit to do much with it
emmanuel riviere ghosted in at the post but could not force the ball beyond manchester united 's goalkeeper dave de gea de gea made himself wide in the manchester united goal to deny newcastle the opener at st james ' park pappis cisse has words with jonny evans after the pair appeared to spit at each other during a heated exchange in the first half papiss cisse wipes his eye after he and jonny evans were later shown to have spat at each other during an unsavoury incident jonny evans appears to spit on papiss cisse ( left ) before the newcastle striker returns the favour ( right ) as tempers flared before half time on the right , angel di maria was having a decent game , relatively speaking
his night was ended on the hour , though , when van gaal replaced him with adnan januzaj
it seemed an odd move and di maria looked less than chuffed
at least by then the game was a little more alive
emmanuel riviere brought a save from david de gea after fabricio coloccini headed down a free - kick while at the other end krul saved brilliantly from a marouane fellaini half - volley and a ashley young follow - up that perhaps took a little too long to arrive
at last there was an atmosphere inside this great stadium and things improved further when gutierrez entered as a substitute
his first appearance since recovering from testicular cancer , it was soon marked by a booking but nobody really cared about
it was good to see him
soon newcastle could have had a goal
a break from another substitute ayoze perez found him and papiss cisse two - on - one with jonny evans but the pass from one team - mate to another was criminally over hit and , as such , the chance disappeared
perhaps that summed up the night for both teams
in sport , though , mistakes often decide contests and so it was here
krul won a game all on his own for van gaal with his penalty shoot - out heroics against costa rica during last summer âs world cup
here , he did it again in rather different circumstances
gutierrez made an emotional return for newcastle after recovering from testicular cancer gutierrez is given the captain 's armband by fabricio coloccini after coming on in the second half at st james ' park chris smalling battles with emmanuel riviere for the ball in the first half of manchester united 's narrow win over newcastle marouane fellaini throws his arm into mike williamson 's face in a clash during the first half
