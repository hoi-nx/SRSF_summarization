any overly refreshed visitors to hamburg should think twice next time they fancy relieving themselves up against a wall
that 's because residents of the pub - heavy area at the heart of the party town are fighting back against so - called ' wildpinkler ' , which literally means ' free pee - ers ' in german
members of the st pauli interest community ( ig st pauli ) fed up with drinkers weeing everywhere from back alleys to underpasses to childrens ' playgrounds are using a special paint to give them a nasty surprise
now public urinators can expect some splash back on their shoes and clothes should they decide to empty their bladders in the street
ig st pauli board member and owner of several local bars christiansen told the local : ' it was a real annoyance that was growing and growing ' ' we wanted to bring people to reason
' a man relieving himself in the street jumps back in horror when he gets splash back from the special paint so - called ' wildpinkler ' , or ' free pee - ers ' , have even been caught urinating in playgrounds in st pauli in a short video produced by the group , members can be seen putting up signs reading ' do not pee here ! we pee back ' on specially - treated walls
those falling foul of the clever ruse can be seen jumping back in horror as they get more than they bargained for when they unzipped their trousers
as julia staron of ig st pauli says at the end of the video : ' watch out ! from now on , it 's peeback time '
christiansen added : ' people were just tired of the peeing on walls , home entrances and playgrounds
' and visitors should take extra care as not every wall which has been treated has a warning sign
st pauli 's red light district
the area of hamburg gets 20 million often heavy - drinking visitors every year
