with millions of eligible men populating tinder , how can you ensure that you get a right swipe ? ex-coronation street star scott is convinced he has the answer after conducting a unique experiment to show just what men should be wearing to find love
the actor , who played stripper sam kingston in the soap and was previously crowned rear of the year , went on the world 's most popular mobile dating app with five very different looks
he wanted to see which profile would get the most ' matches ' - where women indicate they are up for a date
he wore five different outfits and discovered that going topless garnered the most matches ( it probably helps that he 's a personal trainer ) by far the most popular of 40 - year - old scott 's looks was when he stripped off for a topless profile picture
within minutes of his profile going live , scott had 28 matches from attractive women all eager to engage with the star , who now combines acting with a successful career as a fitness guru
this profile was seven times more successful that scott 's least popular profile - where he was dressed smartly in a work jacket and shirt , which attained just four matches
once he posted each profile , he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives to gauge the popularity of each look
the ' chav look ' was the second most successful of the five
right : scott concluded that the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture , which , he says , perhaps explains why the ' normal bloke ' look got 16 matches stylists created five different looks for scott : smart , chav , hipster , normal bloke and muscle man
once he posted each profile , he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives in manchester to gauge the popularity of each look - and waited to see how many matches he achieved
the experiment was carried out over two weeks at tinder 's peak times between 6pm and 8pm - with scott targeting different women so that the same women were not matching with him
scott reckoned the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture
scott 's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches that might explain why the ' chav ' look , where scott wore a zip - up top , tracksuit bottoms and trainers got 17 matches , and ' normal bloke ' got 16 matches
scott 's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches
if scott 's experiment is anything to go by , dressing smartly virtually kills your chances of dating success with scott 's profile picture in a jacket and shirt getting just four matches
scott made no mention of his previous tv fame because he just wanted to be judged on his pictures , though some tinder users may have recognised him
the least successful of the lot was scott 's suited and booted look , which landed him just four matches speaking about his experiment , scott said : ' obviously because of my work in fitness i am in pretty good shape , so i guess it is no surprise that going topless is the best way to get matches on tinder
' i am thinking this strategy may not be be quite as successful if you have a beer belly and man boobs !
' seriously , what it shows is that online dating is a minefield and by making small tweaks to your profile pictures , you can significantly increase your chances of dating success
' a spokesperson for theidleman.com , who provided the clothes for the experiment , added : ' what this shows is that men need to be comfortable in their own skin when they are dating online - and i think the same applies when they are dressing to look good
' what most men want to do is pass the pub test : find clothes that look sufficiently good that their mates wo n't take the mickey out of them in down the pub. ' if they pass that test with their mates , they will also adopt the right look when dating online
