the australian grand prix was nothing short of disastrous for mclaren , despite the fact the team spirit was clearly high before the first race of the season
pictures of preparations behind the scenes in melbourne show replacement driver kevin magnussen playing a clever practical joke on his team - mate , jenson button
as jenson button stood on the scales to take his weight ahead of the formula one curtain - raiser , kevin magnussen sneakily put his foot on the scale to add an extra few pounds on to jenson button 's weight
jenson button finished 11th in the australian grand prix and was the only driver not to take a point in the race kevin magnussen had engine failure on the formation lap as he deputised for alonso but the images show that kevin magnussen was caught in the act , as jenson button turned around to see his team - mate 's foot hanging in the air
kevin magnussen was standing in for alonso in the first race of the formula one season , after alonso was ruled out of the opener with concussion sustained in a crash in pre-season
the 22 - year - old kevin magnussen was left frustrated by his car at the race , though , as he suffered engine failure on the formation lap. alonso was absent from the first race of the season as he continues to recover from concussion alonso is scheduled to compete in the next race of the season in malaysian on march 29 and jenson button did not have too much more luck
he was the only man to finish the race and not take a point in 11th
mclaren will be hoping for better fortune providing alonso returns as planned from his concussion for the malaysian grand prix on march 29
