a oklahoma student has claimed today that the sick racist chant that brought national disgust on the sae fraternity is a longstanding tradition among brothers at the organization
a student spoke out to the today show to say that she had heard the ' there will never be a n * * * * * in sae ' chant from members of the fraternity at least two years ago and that the brothers all thought it was a gas
' i would definitely say this is not an isolated incident , ' the student , who did not want to be named , told today
