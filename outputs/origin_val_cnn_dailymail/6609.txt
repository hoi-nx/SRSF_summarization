silva leapt high , and powered a fantastic header looping over the head of thibaut courtois into the far corner of chelsea 's net , dumping jose mourinho 's team out of the champions league
it was , undoubtedly , a brilliant piece of play from the brazilian , but immediately the inquest began as to how chelsea had allowed the centre back so much space
the answer , it seems , is that captain terry , rather than marking his opponent , was tussling with his central defensive partner as the corner came in
as the corner comes into the box , terry grabs hold of cahill , who is running towards his own goal terry is clearly grappling with his team - mate as he attempts to move towards silva terry did eventually reach silva , but by then the brazilian had jumped high to head the ball home with the ball in the air , terry can be seen grappling with cahill , as both chelsea men get caught under the ball
terry did eventually find a way past his colleague , but arrived too late and could n't get off the ground , leaving silva free to head home
the goal drew psg level on the night , and in the tie , but the vital second away goal sent the visitors through to the quarter - finals
it was also the second goal chelsea had conceded from a corner to a psg centre half , after david luiz had sent the game to extra time
the psg captain still had plenty to do , but his looping header gave thibaut courtois no chance at all silva celebrates the goal that knocked chelsea out of the champions league at the last 16 stage the chelsea players trudge back towards the halfway line , despondent after twice conceding a lead
