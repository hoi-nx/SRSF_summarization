the implantation of memories is a common feature in sci - fi films , such as inception and total recall
but now , for the first time , conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while they slept
the feat gives hope that the same technique could one day be used to change human memories , which could help people who replay traumatic events over and over in their minds
for the first time , conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while the sleep
the technique could one day be used to change human memories , such in in films like total recall and inception ( a still from the film is shown ) the brain typically replays the day âs activities when people or animals sleep , which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity , for example
experts have found that when this replay process is disrupted in rodents , so too is their ability to remember what they learned â for example , a new area that they explored â the previous day , new scientist reported
scientists from the industrial physics and chemistry higher educational institution in paris , france , used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice , while they slept
the team , led by benchenane , focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about , or being in , a specific place â and help animals and humans form internal maps
the brain typically replays the day âs activities when people or animals sleep , which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity , for example
scientists used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice , while they slept - and say it could one day be used in humans while they sleep ( stock image ) in the same way that humans sometimes remember things that did nât actually occur , researchers have found that bees also misremember
it âs the first time that false memories have been observed in non-human animals
researchers from qmul ( qmul ) tested to see if bumblebees would confuse merged versions of patterns that had previously rewarded them with food , with the ones they had actually seen
they found that if they âd previously been shown a flower with black rings and then a yellow one , that they would later seek food rewards from a flower with yellow rings on it
this incorrect merging of long - term memories in bumblebees is similar to some types of misremembering information that have previously only been observed in humans
the researchers think that such memory errors are probably common in animals whose lifestyle involves regularly juggling multiple memories
professor lars chittka , from qmul âs school of biological and chemical sciences , said : â that people form false memories is well understood but it has never been seen in other animals before
â there are a lot of similarities between our own memories and those of other animals
â the more we know about the way that memory works in the animal kingdom the more we âll be able to understand our own memory and the problems we have with it
â he monitored the activity of these cells when the mice explored an â arena â using electrodes , isolating the cell that fired in a certain arena location
while the mice slept , they monitored the creature âs brain activity and when the specific place cell fired , an electrode stimulated the brain areas linked to reward
when the mice woke up , they immediately scurried to the location that was linked to the rewarding feeling , showing that a new pleasant memory of the place had been formed by the scientists
while this is the first time a conscious memory has been implanted during sleep , experts have already managed to create subconscious associations in the minds of sleeping people â so that smokers associate cigarettes with the smell of rotten eggs , for example
experts think that if subconscious learning has been forced on the mice while they slept , they would have explored the area in a more random way , instead of heading straight to the place they associated with reward
â the mouse develops a goal - directed behaviour to go towards the place , â dr benchenane said
â it proves that it 's not an automatic behaviour
what we create is an association between a particular place and a reward that can be consciously accessed by the mouse
â he thinks it could take years for the technique to be adapted to implant different kinds of memories such as skills , for example , but hopes that it could be developed to alter traumatic memories in people
he believes that positive thoughts could be attached to negative memories to stop people having nightmares or dwelling on upsetting events
â if you can identify where in the brain a person is reactivating a phobia - associated experience , you might be able to create a positive association , â he said
the study was published in the journal nature neuroscience .
