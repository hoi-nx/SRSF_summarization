it 's not known if she leaves the toilet seat up after she uses it , but johnie the crocodile loves nothing more than a good soak in the tub
that 's what was revealed in a recent video when the croc 's owner vicki lowing from melbourne captured bath time in her house
the video was uploaded to youtube this week , and shows vicki lowing calling to 18 - year - old freshwater croc johnie who is 1.5 metres long and weighes 12kg
' come on let 's have a bath , ' vicki lowing says
' there 's a girl
i 'll help you get in
' lowing is true to her word and once the croc gets to the bathroom she lifts it into the half full bath
' that 's better is n't it ? how 's that ? ' asks vicki lowing
johnie does n't have to answer - the image of her floating contentedly in the bath says it all
nicknamed ' croc lady ' in melbourne , lowing , has owned crocodiles for more than 30 years
she claims they have all been totally domesticated and that she can even communicate with them telepathically
are we nearly there yet ? lowing 's crocodiles have even ridden in her car over the years do you need your back washed ? lowing helps johnie get cleaned up in the bath tub vicki lowing said she first became fascinated with the animals after watching a film in the 1960s , and she has never looked back
amazingly , despite johnie nipping her a decade ago while ill , the 57 - year - old nurse has never sustained any injuries
she admits neighbours keep their distance when she has taken her pets for walks but on the plus side she has never had problems with burglars
over the years it would not be unusual for her son andrew , now 20 years old , to wake up with johnie on his bed - just like any family pet
vicki lowing 's son andrew would often wake up with johnie the croc lying on his bed
