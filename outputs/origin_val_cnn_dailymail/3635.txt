google 's ' on - body detection ' users the phone 's accelerometer to know when it 's being moved and will only lock when placed on a flat surface google has already experimented with unlocking phones using faces , but for some this just is n't immediate enough
a number of android owners have spotted a new feature that keeps the phone constantly unlocked as long as it 's in a person 's hand , resting on their leg or even just sitting in a pocket
the ' on - body detection ' feature uses the phone 's built - in accelerometer to know when it 's being handled or moved , and will only lock the screen when placed on a flat surface
on - body detection was first spotted by fan site android police in the smart lock menu of a nexus 4 running android lollipop
but there have since been numerous reports of the phone appearing on other lollipop devices , and not just google 's own nexus 4 range
it appears to be linked to the most recent version of play services - a tool used to update google 's built - in apps
the on - body detection menu explained : ' the feature uses your device 's accelerometer to detect whether your device is still being carried on the body
' if your device detects that it 's no longer being held , your device wo n't stay unlocked
' the phone has to be unlocked the first time it is picked up in the morning but once unlocked it will stay open until it is put on a table or similar
but as google added , if the user unlocks their device and hands it to someone else the phone or tablet stays unlocked as long as the other person continues to carry it
it is also unclear how active the screen will be in a pocket
google may shut down services but keep the screen unlocked , to avoid opening apps or accidentally calling people , known colloquially as ' butt dialling
' google offers passwords and pins to secure its phone , and more recently added face unlock ( pictured ) to phones running android ice cream sandwich and above
it recognises a person âs face and can establish whether or not the face being shown to the camera is real , or is a photograph these services may then be enabled once the phone detects it is in a person 's hand
it is also not clear what impact having the screen constantly unlocked will have on battery life
mailonline has contacted google for more information
a combination of special hardware and software will be used to accurately verify it is you , not a picture of you or someone trying to impersonate you
the cameras use infrared technology to identify your face or iris and can recognize you in a variety of lighting conditions
these security features are opt - in , meaning that users will be able to still rely on passwords and pins to unlock devices and features if they so desire

apple made the fingerprint reader , or touch id , mainstream on its iphone 5s and samsung added a reader on its galaxy s5
microsoft 's version is called windows hello , it will be part of windows 10 when it launches later this year
