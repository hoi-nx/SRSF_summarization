hodgson has gained a wealth of experience during almost 40 years as a manager and will have sat through thousands of interviews
the 67 - year - old boss , however , will never have been asked to have a conversation with an ipad on wheels while answering recorded questions from fans via an interactive ' fanbot '
hodgson reveals the toughest manager he âs ever faced in nearly 40 years in the dugout , which former england players he âd love to be able to call up to his current squad and who he 'd choose between lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo
hodgson will lead england out at wembley ahead of the euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania on friday hodgson reveals all in 4gee fan q&a what âs the best way for a young captain to get players playing together ? i do nât think it âs the captain âs total responsibility
to get all of the team together and playing off the same hymn sheet and playing together as a team , i think that it âs a question of what goes on in the training sessions , what the coach or manager is asking of the players and encouraging the players to do
the captain plays an important role of course , as the game starts the manager or coach will have less chance to influence what âs happening on the field of play and that âs where the captain comes to the fore
he very much needs to be in tune with what the team is trying to do , how they âre trying to play and what âs s been agreed upon and hopefully what âs agreed upon has been a matter of discussion and work amongst the players and training staff
hodgson believes as an england captain , wayne rooney must be in tune with the rest of the players it âs also important that the players feel as though they trust their captain , hopefully look up to him but most importantly can go to the captain with their problems or doubts and with fears
and if he ca nât answer himself with the problems they have he can at least point them in the right direction
it âs important for the captain to show he cares about all of the players and takes responsibility and , most importantly , accept that being captain puts more burden on him both before and after games , to lead from the front and if some of the unpleasant jobs sometimes need doing â with us at the level i âm talking about it can mean spending more time with the press or doing things for the commercial department
the captain sometimes has to take more of a share of that work than some of the other players , he is the captain , he is the one that everyone wants to see and talk to
he is the one of course who has the most responsibility
it âs a question of responsibility and making sure you âre a good listener
if you could pick one player from previous squads to be in your current squad , who would it be ? from previous squads , well i suppose that depends on how far back you would go
when selecting players , of course there âs a question of what you need most at any one time
one âs tempted to look to centre forwards of course and alan sheerer would be an obvious choice for his goal - scoring ability
also a guy like bryan robson was a fantastic captain for england and a tremendous midfield dynamo i would choose between those too
the england boss plumped for alan shearer ( above ) when asked to pick a player from previous squads who âs the best manager you âve competed against ? usually it âs teams that concern me the most , and the players within the teams , but i âve been lucky enough to have a long career to come across some very good ones
all the ones i âve come across over the last eight or five years before taking this job , when i was in the premier league , outside of that to national managers i would have to say arrigo sacchi
i would have to say he revolutionised italian football , he was a big fan of english football
he based a lot of his ideas on what he had seen english teams do in the past
i enjoyed my battles with arrigo sacchi when he was managing italy and i was managing switzerland and was lucky to get to know him and hear about his philosophies
hodgson believes former italy boss arrigo sacchi ( centre ) revolutionised italian football what âs the strangest thing that âs ever happened to you during a game ? it was during a qualifying match for finland
we were playing against serbia in the olympic stadium in helsinki when the game was held up for five or six minutes by an eagle owl , which was nested in the stands , decided it was going to fly up and down the pitch and land on the crossbar
it was an amazing sight because these birds are really , really big
it made the game all that more interesting for the spectators and luckily we won and the eagle owl was adopted as a mascot by the finnish national team afterwards
hodgson was answering recorded questions from supporters via a ' fanbot ' during a q&a at wembley the 67 - year - old manager also revealed his admiration for swiss tennis star roger federer outside of football what athletes do you admire most , past or present ? not an easy one to answer â there are so many great athletes that have done such great things outside of my own sport , the sport i understand most
i would maybe look to tennis which is the sport i have played most outside of football
the two sporting heroes in that regard that have had great achievements are firstly bjorn borg , swedish champion and latterly roger federer
who was your favourite football player when growing up ? i had three i guess going through the different stages of my youth
the first was at palace , johnny mcnichol , and then there were two who were fairly contemporary but both shared my affections , one was johnny byrne at palace and west ham and the second was george eastham when he came down to the arsenal
if you could steal a player from an international team , who would it be ? good question â lots to choose from
i would plump for lionel messi
hodgson chose barcelona star lionel messi as the one player he would steal away from their national team
