ferguson , missouri ferguson 's police chief and other city officials are already out
now some residents have told the missouri city they 'll try to oust the mayor , too
five residents friday filed an affidavit saying they 'll try to force a referendum on whether to remove mayor knowles -- capping a tumultuous week in a community grappling not only with last year 's fatal shooting of teenager michael brown , but also wednesday 's wounding of two police officers shot during a protest
a group supporting the filing , organization for black struggle , a 35 - year - old st. louis - based activist group , said the five would try to collect enough signatures -- 15 % of the city 's registered voters -- in the next 60 days
the five " initiated recall ( attempt ) due to mayor knowles ' failure to adequately rein in an out - of - control police department during the protests following mike brown 's death , " the activist group said
the city government acknowledged saturday that it received the affidavit
earlier this week , the police chief and the city manager resigned in the wake of a american doj report alleging institutionalized racism at just about every level of ferguson 's municipal government , including the police department
residents elect council members , who in turn appoint the city manager
the city manager directs and supervises all city departments , including police
the top municipal court clerk was fired earlier in connection with racist emails
this month 's doj report was initiated after one of ferguson 's police officers , wilson , shot and killed african - american teen michael brown in august , a shooting that spurred months of protests
wilson , a white officer who said he shot michael brown in self - defense , will not be charged in the case -- a grand jury declared it would n't indict him in november , and the doj said this month that it would not bring federal civil rights charges in the case
wilson resigned from the department in november , citing security concerns
knowles indicated friday he wo n't be stepping down
" i think it 's important to recognize that there 's a lot of people who may be angry at the situation ; there 's a lot of people who are frustrated in this community with the way things have gone down , " the mayor , who is white , told cnn
" but there 's a lot of people who still -- and who have expressed this to me -- express confidence in both my willingness , and members of the ( council ) council 's willingness , to listen , to be responsive , and to make changes as necessary , " he continued
" people in the community recognize this , now , not everybody
i did n't win every time with 100 % of the vote
but i can tell you there are ways to remove me if that is the will of the people , " the mayor said
ashby , a white resident of ferguson , said friday that he believed knowles has " consciously tried to reach out to all parts " of the city of 21,000 people
" if we lose mayor knowles , we lose a force for change , and it will be harder to make the changes that the doj ( doj ) is asking for , " ashby said
aldridge , a black member of a commission charged with recommending reforms in ferguson , said that knowles needed to resign in the wake of the doj report
" he knew what was going on during his watch , " said aldridge , a member of the ferguson commission , which gov. jay nixon formed last year
investigators still are seeking breaks in the case of two police officers who were shot wednesday night during a protest in ferguson
while the demonstrators ' focus was ferguson , neither of the wounded officers works for that police department
one is from webster groves , a st. louis suburb 13 miles south of ferguson
the officer -- a 32 - year - old with seven years ' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek , just under his right eye , police said
the other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back
he is a 41 - year - old officer with the st. louis county police who has been in law enforcement for 14 years
both were treated and released
" i can not tell you an arrest is imminent , and there 's certainly no one in custody , " st. louis county police chief jon belmar told reporters friday afternoon
" the detectives are working this investigation around the clock , and they will not rest until we have a conclusion in this investigation , " the chief said
police have " several leads , " he said
" i think we have a pretty good general idea of where we think the shots came from
