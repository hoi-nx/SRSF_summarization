spirit airlines has a new fare deal and is announcing it with sex jokes
the low - cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $ 69 round - trip fares in april and may that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply
round - trip purchase is not required , so you could actually pay $ 34.50 for a one - way flight
but the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy , which obliquely references a sexual act
" we 've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years , " reads the offer on spirit airlines 's website
" it 's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother 's bed ( the one with the fantastic articles )
use your mouth to spread the word : spirit is in an even better position to get you where you 're going
" some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste
" you ca n't object to that price point , but you certainly can object to the discount airline 's marketing strategy , which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if spirit airlines 's website was hacked , " wrote aaron rupar of kmsp in minneapolis
spirit spokesman berry , in a prepared statement , said the promotion reflects the airline 's quirky culture
" spirit airlines is n't your typical airline and we do n't want to be
we enjoy being different than other airlines , " said berry , spirit airlines 's director of corporate communications
" when it comes to advertising , different means we do n't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares
but we 're also different because our ads are fun , provocative , sometimes silly and often irreverent
they get lots of attention , " he added
" the vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are
we understand there is a small group of people who feel differently
" the $ 69 fares must be booked by the end of the day tuesday
questionable taste or not , the promotion may be working : people were complaining on twitter that they could n't access spirit airlines 's website to book flights
based in florida , spirit airlines is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can
the airline 's defense is simple : pay for what you want on your flight , and do n't pay for what you do n't want
