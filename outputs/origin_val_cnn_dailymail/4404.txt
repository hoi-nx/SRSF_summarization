residents living in a picturesque rural village with a population of just 613 have slammed plans to build a muslim cemetery on greenbelt land - for over 3,000 people
the proposed site in leafy catherine-de-barnes , near solihull , west midlands , will include a total of 3,333 graves for followers of islamic
this is despite muslim accounting for fewer than 3 per cent of the population of solihull and its surrounding areas
residents living in a picturesque rural village have hit out at controversial plans to build a muslim cemetery on rural land the proposed site of 3,000 graves ( edged in blue ) and the previous applications ( green and red ) that have been made for the sites near solihull , west midlands previous applications to build what would have been britain 's largest muslim - only cemetery put before solihull metropolitan borough have been unsuccessful
but cemetery development services have now submitted scaled down plans with fewer graves , which could be approved next month
it would mean the cemetery could eventually hold over five times as many people as catherine-de-barnes itself
the graveyard would be able to comply fully with sharia law which states muslim are traditionally buried in their own section of land , next to others of the same faith
islamic law also stipulates a method of bathing and shrouding the bodies before being buried with their heads facing towards mecca
yesterday villagers criticised the revised plans for the major development - which will also include 95 spaces for visitors - and said it would blight green belt land
locals are also objecting the plans for the cemetery based on concerns surrounding the impact it will have on traffic
grandfather - of - four gerry chauke , 55 , said : ' there is ample room for graves to accommodate the local population here
' i 'm a believer that these sort of developments should serve the local community , but we do n't have a massively large multicultural population here
' so plans to have a graveyard exclusively for muslim just seems a bit absurd to me
' leader of solihull council , bob sleigh councillor bob sleigh , who represents the bickenhill ward , said he also agreed the needs of local people could already be met by current plots
the proposal in catherine-de-barnes , near solihull , west midlands , would include a total of 3,333 graves for followers of islamic he said : ' this is simply not an appropriate place to site a cemetery
' planning permission was refused on substantial grounds last time and i will continue to oppose the scheme on the same grounds again
' there were a lot of environmental concerns with siting a cemetery on this land
this is just not the right position for this type of scheme
' there is no need for this extra site in solihull
we have identified our population need and made provision for that
' obviously people are concerned about the scale of the development and its threat to greenbelt land around catherine-de-barnes
' i do n't believe the case has been made to overcome the very special measures which apply to greenbelt land
' trevor eames , secretary of solihull ratepayers association , said the application was ' disappointing '
he added : ' at this stage we see no obvious difference in this application to the earlier plans or for planning to draw a different conclusion
residents in the surrounding are say it will have a great impact on traffic if given the green light ' the parking for 90 cars and access is much the same as is the impact on the openness of the green belt plus there was concern over pollution of watercourses
' conservative councillor alison rolf , who also represents bickenhill , added : ' my main concern is that they are building on the greenbelt land
' in solihull we do n't have a huge muslim population ' when the first application was taken down local people were delighted that it had gone away , but it 's come back with very little adjustment
' i understand people 's frustrations
' the cemetery has received backing from the muslim community in solihull , who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces
the first application for planning permission for the cemetery was made in july 2014 and was for 4,000 burial plots , which was refused
this was increased to 7,000 on an adjacent site a month later , but this application was withdrawn
the latest application is for a total of 3,333 plots
according to a report by cemetery development services , the site will be operated by a charity called thaqwa cemetery , which provides ' a low cost dignified burial at a freehold plot according to islamic beliefs and culture '
the report adds : ' after the departure of the soul , human being has been buried since beginning
' other methods of disposing of human remain are relatively new
being the oldest monotheists , muslim have always maintained the ancient burial system
' to preserve this centuries old tradition in this part of the world we acquired a plot of land in the catherine-de-barnes area of solihull after consulting and obtaining positive response from solihull metropolitan borough
the cemetery has received backing from the muslim community in solihull , who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces ' it is also an established fact that there is a shortage of burial places across the country
' birmingham and solihull regions are not an exception
thaqwa cemetery is a positive endeavour in meeting the community burial need
' funeral director mohammed khalil , of birmingham - based zuq funeral services , said even 3,000 burial plots would barely provide enough space for the next 50 years
he said : ' the local muslim population is growing rapidly
' do n't forget , the people who came here in the 1950s and 1960s are now old and dying fast
' before , they used to send people back home to their families in pakistan and bangladesh
' but apparently now all their families are here and they have no - one back home
' they are saying ' this is our country now
we are living here and dying here so we should be buried here
