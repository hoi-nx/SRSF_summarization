a former pennsylvania cop who retired after 25 years service to start an ammunition manufacturing and wholesale business has now developed vending machines that dispense ' pretty much everything ' when it comes to bullets
but while sam piccini , of rochester , says that gun clubs from all over are ' chomping at the bit ' for their pay - as - you - go dispensaries , complaints about the machines and their safety seem just as widespread
sam piccini has installed two at his local gun club , the beaver valley rifle and pistol club , which , like many , refuses to sell ' non-jacketed ' rounds of ammunition , making the machines popular among members
controversial : an ammunition salesman and former cop has installed two vending machines that dispense ammunition at his local gun club in rochester , pennsylvania ' it 's not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition ' : former cop sam piccini says the machines are perfectly legal and that he created them for the convenience of gun club members only the machines are kept behind locked doors that require a digital key fob - which all members have - to open
the swipe cards grant 24 - hour access to the club 's grounds shooting ranges , where the ammunition vending machine is located
all members have to be over 18 to get a swipe card
in pennsylvania , people ages 18 and over can buy long gun ammunition , and people over 21 can buy bullets for handguns
sam piccini has defended himself against cries that the devices will allow minors easy access to ammo
' it 's not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition , ' he told fox news
the machines sell nearly every caliber of bullet from .22 to .45
' the machine sells pretty much everything , ' said piccinini , ' from .22 long rifle to .45 long colt and every standard caliber in between except .32 and .25 automatic
' it 's got 380 , 9 , 38 , 40 , 45 , .357 sig. i manufacture all of it myself
' they keys are given to members 18 years and over , meaning people under 21 could possible purchase handgun bullets they are not legally entitled to
however local newspaper the beaver countian report receiving ' several tips ' from locals raising concerns about the machines
not candy : this vending machine - operated by sam piccini , a candidate for beaver county sheriff - which distributes firearms ammunition is raising some eyebrows a spokesman for the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives - which regulates the sale of ammunition - confirmed to the newspaper the machines could provide bullets to minors
' i do n't want to speculate as to what is or is not happening in this particular situation , but a licensee can not sell ammunition to anyone under the age of 18 , and importantly you can not sell handgun ammunition to individuals under the age of 21 , ' atf special agent stephen bartholomew told the paper
sam piccini said he had the idea years ago , and spent time modifying the machines so they could accept larger bills and credit cards , with the price of bullets much higher than that of candy
sam piccini , who is a current candidate for beaver county sheriff , said he consulted lawyers about the machines and maintains that operating them is perfectly legal .
