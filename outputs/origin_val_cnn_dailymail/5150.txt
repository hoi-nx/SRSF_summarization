despite shay given âs eagerness to return to the frontline again , ireland manager o'neill is reluctant to jettison david forde at this critical stage of the qualifiers

o'neill faces another massive call regarding robbie keane , ireland âs record goalscorer and most capped player
robbie keane , who was stationed by the manager âs side in wednesday âs squad photo shoot , is pushing for a recall after his shock omission against the scots last november
o'neill feels robbie keane is a lot fresher than he was four months ago and will be aware of the need for ireland to score on sunday at the aviva
o'neill must also decide whether to pick la galaxy striker robbie keane ireland 's leading goalscorer keane celebrates after scoring against houston dynamo last saturday robbie keane , 34 , has scored four goals in his last two starts at the stadium
after yesterday âs rest day , o'neill will be keen to assess the fitness of mcclean , whelan and ward at training in malahide today before finalising his strategy to face the poles , with david forde likely to retain the no 1 jersey

whelan , sorely missed against the scots in glasgow , had a tight hamstring but is expected to be fine
