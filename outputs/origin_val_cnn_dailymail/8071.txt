the 25 - year - old described how he would clean their maple shade , new jersey , home profusely , the court heard , and cook dinner starting at 2 a.m. â the same food every night : chicken , rice and beans

harrowing testimony : becky hernandez ( pictured arriving in court today ) said her father pedro ( right ) , who has been accused of killing six - year - old etan patz , said she was n't allowed to go out with friends unless she had a written invitation and he would hold her hand while crossing the street until she was 14 years old the defense is trying to show hernandez 's 2012 confession to choking the boy is a delusion
she told the court her father was hours early for everything and would not allow her to be home alone
he would sleep for hours during the day , rarely socialized and insisted on sitting in the same church pew every sunday , she testified
she also said he saw shadowy figures , a lady in white , and one time said he awoke to find a bald man choking him who then disappeared
she 'd come home to find him talking to himself
but they did n't call the doctors
' we knew he was n't well , and we did n't want to hurt his feelings , ' she said
' you know how children sometimes believe in something ? that 's the type of response we had
my mom always taught me that what he sees and what he believes is not what we have to see
' hernandez said stress over her father 's case prevented her from getting a master 's degree
' i was studying and every single time i had to take a test there was something related to my dad , ' she said , choking up
' i could n't concentrate
' she began crying when asked if she loved her father despite his behavior
support : pictured with her attorney harvey fishbein ( left ) and mother rosemary ( right ) , she told the new york court how she could n't get a masters degree as a result of the case because she ' could n't concentrate ' ' he 's protective because he loves me , ' she said
' ... it 's the little things that show that he cares
and that 's why i love him
' the defendant had no visible reaction as his daughter testified , but he smiled as she walked by during a break
earlier , he turned around to wave and smile at his wife , who was sitting in the benches
assistant district attorney joan illuzzi-orbon on cross-examination sought to show hernandez was strict and abusive and that he still tries to control her from prison
hernandez made a stunning confession in 2012 to choking etan in the basement of a convenience store where he worked , after police questioned him on a tip. over the years , he told a prayer circle , a neighbor and his ex-wife that he had harmed a child in new york
at least five people testified about what he said during the trial
family : stanley patz , father of etan patz , and his daughter shira patz , left , arrive at manhattan supreme court for another day of testimony etan vanished on his way to school on may 25 , 1979
his disappearance helped galvanize the modern - day missing children 's movement ; his picture was one of the first to appear on a milk carton
over the years , the case bounced around between detectives and units and from local police to federal agents and back
there 's been no physical evidence
during his confession , hernandez told detectives that he tossed the boy 's bag up onto a freezer in the basement of the convenience store
' if the freezer is still there , the book bag should be there , ' hernandez told detectives
but the shop was closed and cleared out in the early 1980s , its contents tossed , and it 's not clear whether police were present at the time
no body was ever found
hernandez 's attorneys are trying to show that his 2012 confession ( left ) to choking etan ( right ) following his disappearance in 1979 is a delusion
