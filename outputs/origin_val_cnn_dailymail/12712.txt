computer hacking was once the realm of curious teenagers
it 's now the arena of government spies , professional thieves and soldiers of fortune
today , it 's all about the money
that 's why chinese hackers broke into lockheed martin and stole the blueprints to the trillion - dollar f - 35 fighter jet
it 's also why russian hackers have sneaked into western oil and gas companies for years
the stakes are higher , too
in 2010 , hackers slipped a " digital bomb " into the nasdaq that nearly sabotaged the stock market
in 2012 , iranian ruined 30,000 computers at saudi oil producer aramco
and think of the immense ( and yet undisclosed ) damage from north korea 's cyberattack on sony pictures last year
computers were destroyed , executives ' embarrassing emails were exposed , and the entire movie studio was thrown into chaos
it was n't always this way
hacking actually has some pretty innocent and harmless beginnings
the whole concept of " hacking " sprouted from the mit nearly 50 years ago
computer science students there borrowed the term from a group of model train enthusiasts who " hacked " electric train tracks and switches in 1969 to improve performance
these new hackers were already figuring out how to alter computer software and hardware to speed it up , even as the scientists at at&t were developing unix , one of the world 's first major operating systems
hacking became the art of figuring out unique solutions
it takes an insatiable curiosity about how things work ; hackers wanted to make technology work better , or differently
they were not inherently good or bad , just clever
in that sense , the first generation of true hackers were " phreakers , " a bunch of united states punks who toyed with the nation 's telephone system
in 1971 , they discovered that if you whistle at a certain high - pitched tone , 2600 - hertz , you could access at&t 's long - distance switching system
they would make international phone calls , just for the fun of it , to explore how the telephone network was set up
this was low - fi stuff
the most famous phreaker , john draper ( aka " cap'n crunch ) earned his nickname because he realized the toy whistle given away in cereal boxes emitted just the right tone
this trained engineer took that concept to the next level by building a custom " blue box " to make those free calls
this surreptitious little box was such a novel idea that young engineers steve wozniak and steve jobs started building and selling it themselves
these are the guys who would later go on to start apple
wire fraud spiked , and the fbi cracked down on phreakers and their blue boxes
the laws did n't quite fit , though
kids were charged with making harassing phone calls and the like
but federal agents could n't halt this phenomenon
a tech - savvy , inquisitive and slightly anti-authoritarian community had been born
the next generation came in the early 1980s , as people bought personal computers for their homes and hooked them up to the telephone network
the web was n't yet alive , but computers could still talk to one another
this was the golden age of hacking
these curious kids tapped into whatever computer system they could find just to explore
some broke into computer networks at companies
others told printers at hospitals hundreds of miles away to just spit out paper
and the first digital hangouts came into being
hackers met on text - only bulletin board systems to talk about phreaking , share computer passwords and tips
the 1983 movie " war games " depicted this very thing , only the implications were disastrous
in it , a teenager in washington state accidentally taps into a military computer and nearly brings the world to nuclear war
it 's no surprise , then , that the fbi was on high alert that year , and arrested six teenagers in milwaukee -- who called themselves the 414s , after their area code -- when they tapped into the los alamos national laboratory , a nuclear weapon research facility
nationwide fears led the congress to pass the computer fraud and abuse act in 1986
breaking into computer systems was now a crime of its own
the damage of hacking started getting more serious , too
in 1988 , the government 's arpanet , the earliest version of the internet , got jammed when a cornell university graduate student , curious about the network 's size , created a self - replicating software worm that multiplied too quickly
the next year , a few german hackers working for the russian kgb were caught breaking into the pentagon
in 1990 , hacker kevin poulsen rigged a los angeles radio station 's phone system to win a porsche , only to be arrested afterward
the cat - and - mouse game between law enforcement and hackers continued throughout the 1990s
russian mathematician vladimir levin was caught stealing $ 10 million from citibank
others did it for revenge
tim lloyd wiped the computers at omega engineering in new jersey after he was fired
but hacks were still more of an annoyance than anything devastating , though it was quickly becoming apparent that the potential was there
the stock market , hospitals , credit card transactions -- everything was running on computers now
there was a bone - chilling moment when a ragtag group of hackers calling themselves l0pht testified before congress in 1998 and said they could shut down the internet in 30 minutes
the danger was suddenly more real than ever
the ethos was starting to change , too
previously , hackers broke into computers and networks because they were curious and those tools were inaccessible
the web changed that , putting all that stuff at everyone 's fingertips
money became the driving force behind hacks , said thomas , a member of l0pht who is known internationally as the hacker " space rogue
" an unpatched bug in windows could let a hacker enter a bank , or a foreign government office
mafias and governments were willing to pay top dollar for this entry point
a totally different kind of black market started to grow
the best proof came in 2003 , when microsoft started offering a $ 5 million bounty on hackers attacking windows
" it 's no longer a quest for information and knowledge by exploring networks
it 's about dollars , " thomas said
" researchers are no longer motivated to get stuff fixed
now , they say , ' i 'm going to go looking for bugs to get a paycheck - and sell this bug to a government
' " loosely affiliated amateurs were replaced by well - paid , trained professionals
by the mid- 2000s , hacking belonged to organized crime , governments and hacktivists
first , crime : hackers around the world wrote malicious software ( malware ) to hijack tens of thousands of computers , using their processing power to generate spam
they wrote banking trojans to steal website login credentials
hacking payment systems turned out to be insanely lucrative , too
albert gonzalez 's theft of 94 million credit cards from the company tjx in 2007 proved to be a precursor to later retailer data breaches , like target , home depot and many more
when the united states wanted to sabotage the iranian nuclear program in 2009 , it hacked a development facility and unleashed the most dangerous computer virus the world has ever seen
stuxnet caused the iranian lab computers to spin centrifuges out of control
this was unprecedented : a digital strike with extreme physical consequences
similarly , there 's proof that russian used hackers to coordinate its attack on georgia during a five - day war in 2008 , taking out key news and government websites as tanks rolled into those specific cities
the populist group anonymous hacks into police departments to expose officer brutality and floods banks with garbage internet traffic
a vigilante known as " the jester " takes down islamic jihadist websites
what exists now is a tricky world
was it the russian government or russian nationalists acting on their own ? or freelance agents paid by the government ? in the digital realm , attribution is extremely difficult
meanwhile , it 's easier than ever to become a hacker
digital weapons go for mere dollars on easily accessible black markets online
anonymity is a few clicks away with the right software
and there are high - paying jobs in defending companies like google or jpmorgan chase -- or attacking them
as a result , law enforcement tolerance for hacking has fallen to zero
in 1999 , the hacker space rogue exposed how fao schwarz 's website was leaking consumer email addresses and forced the company to fix it
when andrew auernheimer ( known as " weev " ) did the same thing to at&t in 2010 , he spent more than a year in prison until his case was overturned on a technicality
the days of mere curiosity are over .
