my visit to kimberley in australia was my first â big â trip down under
i âve been to the country for a couple of short visits â i went to a friend âs wedding in melbourne , for example â but this latest experience was something else
i was there to film part of my new series for more4 called australian food adventure
my tour involved seeing local producers , meeting the farmers and looking at what they are doing â to get a picture of the whole food culture
i wanted to understand what it was like when the first settlers arrived , to talk about aboriginal dishes , and how all of that has had an effect on the country âs modern cuisine
during his tour , jimmy went to crocosaurus cove in darwin , where there are lots of different species of crocodiles , including the large , troublesome saltwater crocs food in australia has been greatly influenced by the second wave of immigrants : the greeks , the italians and , more recently , those from various parts of asia
until fairly recently , australia was best known for pies and barbies â but now it âs at the forefront of international cuisine
it also produces some of the world âs leading wines and , with its diverse climate , it can grow pretty much any vegetable and fruit â from bananas to potatoes â nearly all year round
the other interesting thing is that australia can produce all the vegetables needed to make vietnamese and sri lankan dishes , for example
that âs not something we can do in the uk , so we have to import them instead
australia was best known for pies and barbies â but now it âs at the forefront of international cuisine , and also produces some of the world âs leading wines there are some fantastic chefs and some very interesting restaurants
if there is a problem with international recognition , it âs down to the fact it âs hard to define what exactly australian cuisine is â there is a coming together of lots of different influences
jimmy was in australia was to film part of his new series for more4 called australian food adventure however , i âm not sure this is actually a â problem â
for example , in south australia i met an italians market gardener who had emigrated and i was amazed at the variety of vegetables he was growing
everything he would have produced back home on the amalfi coast , including cavolo nero and squashes , was there
in addition , he was growing different oriental vegetables which then go to farmers â markets in adelaide
at my farm in suffolk , we have a farm shop , we run a farmers â market , and we have a restaurant â we âre part of a food culture that can perhaps be accused of being slightly elitist
but in australia , that attitude does nât exist because if people are snobby , they soon get shot down
this is nât to say you wo nât find fine dining down under
we went to ayers rock â ayers rock â and i met a chef who cooked some wonderful beef
he did great fine dining , but following aboriginal cooking styles and using native herbs and spices
the dishes included native thyme and garlic grilled wagyu fillet from darling downs , wattleseed - rubbed kangaroo carpaccio , bunya nut and shallot - crusted polenta fondant , and bush yogurt foam
jimmy went to ayers rock â ayers rock â and met a chef who cooked some wonderful beef
he did great fine dining , but following aboriginal cooking styles and using native herbs and spices in kimberley , we visited cape leveque , where i went crabbing with an aboriginal elder called brian lee
you pull these huge mud crabs out of the mangroves , then cook them right there on the estuary
in darwin , i met matt wright , a real - life crocodile dundee
he farms saltwater crocodiles not just for the leather , for which they are renowned , but also for the meat
there are reasons to be concerned about some managed farming of what are perceived to be wild animals , but it can be a force for good
in the pantanal in south america , the farming of caiman has helped to protect the wetlands
crocodile strips are a popular local dish in parts of australia in australia the population of the saltwater crocodile is up to the highest level since the 1970s
crocodile is an interesting meat which you see a lot at farmers â markets where they serve â croc in a wok â
during my tour , i went to crocosaurus cove in darwin , where there are lots of different species , including the large , troublesome saltwater crocs
here they can put you in a big perspex tube called the cage of death , and lower you into the tank with this beast
it âs only then you see their sheer majesty
aboriginal elder brian lee looks untroubled by this feisty - and fairly large - mud crab it was frightening , but awe - inspiring
another great food place was margaret river in australia
there i discovered a company called manjimup truffles
australia is the fourth largest truffle - producing country , after france , italians and spain
but the australian are nât content with that â they reckon in ten years they will be the largest producers
my favourite city is adelaide
many rave about melbourne but adelaide is trendier â the streets are lined with restaurants and there are fantastic farmers â markets
i âm already looking forward to my next trip
it âs a long flight but once you âre there , it âs such a vibrant country you soon forget about the jet - lag
