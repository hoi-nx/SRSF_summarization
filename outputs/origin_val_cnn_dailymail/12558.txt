in fairy tales , it 's usually the princess that needs protecting
at google 's headquarters in silicon valley , the princess is the one defending the castle
meet parisa tabriz , the 31 - year - old with perhaps the most enchanted job title in engineering -- " google security princess
" her job is to hack into the most popular web browser on the planet , trying to find flaws in the system before the " black hats " do
indeed , much like the good and bad witches of the wizard of oz , hackers are described as having " white " or " black " hats
to defeat google 's attackers , parisa tabriz must firstly think like them
in this cyberspace battle , the data of around a billion chrome users hangs in the balance -- and parisa tabriz was n't going to settle for any old moniker
" when i started , my official job title was ' information security engineer , ' which i thought was a bit boring and not really meaningful , " said the iranian - polish-american , speaking a million miles an hour over the phone from google hq
" so i changed it to ' security princess ' as more of a tongue - in - cheek thing
i 've never been exceptionally girly or fit the stereotype of a princess , so it was a bit ironic for me to go by that name -- and then it stuck ! " parisa tabriz 's role has evolved dramatically in the eight years since she first started working at google
back then , the young graduate from illinois university was one of 50 security engineers -- today there are over 500
" our users include presidents of foreign countries -- i hope obama uses chrome too
it includes really highly - targeted individuals , political dissidents , journalists , and people who just want to casually use the internet , " she said
" google depends on those users trusting us with their data
so if we ca n't protect it , we have no business
" cybercrime has come a long way in the past decade -- from the cliched nigerian prince scam to credit card theft , and suspected government surveillance over emails
parisa tabriz 's biggest concern now is the people who find bugs in google 's software , and sell the information to governments or criminals
to combat this , the company has set up a vulnerability rewards program , paying anywhere from $ 100 to $ 20,000 for reported glitches
" what we 've seen in the last couple of years is what we suspect to be governments trying to intercept communications , " said parisa tabriz
" in one case , there were iranian - region gmail users whose connection was being intercepted
" " these incidents are especially scary since they seem to be carried out by large , well - funded organizations or governments , " she added
it 's a world away from parisa tabriz 's computer - free childhhod home in chicago
the daughter of an iranian - american doctor father , and polish - american nurse mother , parisa tabriz had little contact with computers until she started studying engineering at college
gaze across a line - up of google security staff today and you 'll find women like parisa tabriz are few and far between -- though in the last few years she has hired more female tech whizzes
she admits there 's an obvious gender imbalance in silicon valley , but for once is stumped on the fault
" clearly the numbers make you think ' what is the problem that there are n't more women working in security , that there are n't more women working in technology ? " she said
" and it does make me think what is the problem here ? is it the culture or the atmosphere ? " funnily enough , during training sessions parisa tabriz first asks new recruits to hack not a computer , but a vending machine
" there 's this idea that you need to be a super genius computer geek to be a hacker
but in reality , i think anybody can be a hacker in the real world -- just think of all the non-software examples , " said parisa tabriz
" a lot of people ask me what 's the best answer i 've been given to the vending machine problem , and the real answer is there is none
some people think about how they 'd steal their favorite snack ; some people figure out how to steal the entire machine of snacks ; and some people figure out how they could add some sort of functionality to the machine that was n't there before " parisa tabriz 's job is as much about technological know - how , as understanding the psychology of attackers
" anybody who 's working in defense -- police officers , security , or law enforcement -- has to stop and think ' what is the enemy or the attacker going to do ? ' " she said
" because you always want to stay one step ahead of them
