this year âs renewal of the queen mother champion chase could double as an episode of casualty given the two chief protagonists have hauled themselves off their sick beds to face the starter
both sprinter sacre , successful in 2013 , and last season âs hero sire de grugy have suffered well - documented issues , with connections striving to return their charges to the form which saw them dominate consecutive runnings of this feature
as the preparation of both horses has not been smooth â despite their trainers issuing upbeat bulletins â it might be worth opposing them with champagne fever ( cheltenham festival , 3.20 )
champagne fever , ridden by ruby walsh ( right ) wins the william hill supreme novices hurdle in 2013 racemail tipsters got off to a stunning start on the opening day
robin goodfellow ( turner ) and captain heath ( townend ) napped 8 - 1 national hunt chase winner cause of causes , while townend also landed his next best bet ( the druids nephew 8 - 1 ) to complete an 80 - 1 double
turner also picked winners douvan ( 2 - 1 ) , un de sceaux ( 4 - 6 ) and champion hurdle winner faugheen ( 4 - 5 ) , while peter scudamore went for the first two willie mullins â winners
but for an agonising defeat in the arkle chase 12 months ago at this meeting , the eight - year - old would have an undefeated record in three starts at the cheltenham festival after successes in the bumper and supreme novices â hurdle
admittedly , he can be a hit - and - miss character on occasion , falling at thurles two starts ago before repairing his confidence with an easy win at gowran
a fine effort in the king george chase in december , when finding the three miles on soft ground beyond him , suggests the drop back to the two - mile trip will suit
and his stable are bang in form , with trainer willie mullins enjoying a memorable day on tuesday
if the rain stays away , i could see simply ned out running his price as he has been kept fresh for this and has already finished in front of dodging bullets at prestbury park this season
arabian revolution ( right ) ridden by jockey tony mccoy wins at sandown in january 2015 earlier on the card , don poli ( cheltenham festival , 2.05 ) has looked awesome in his two chase starts to date and is strongly fancied to lift the rsa chase
he repelled a classy rival in apache stronghold with a degree of comfort at leopardstown last time and looks a gold cup horse in the making
apache stronghold has gone on to boost that form with an accomplished defeat of valseur lido , and don poli has a great opportunity to follow up his triumph in a handicap hurdle at last year âs meeting
arabian revolution ( cheltenham festival , nap , 4.40 ) is a sporting selection to win one of the season âs fiercest handicaps as he looks to have plenty in his favour in the fred winter handicap hurdle
like three previous winners , the selection boasts a victory at sandown and the form of his recent run at ludlow has since taken a marked boost with the winner beltor , a triumph hurdle contender , hacking up at kempton
i also like the move to equip arabian revolution with headgear for the first time , while the booking of barry geraghty is another huge positive
