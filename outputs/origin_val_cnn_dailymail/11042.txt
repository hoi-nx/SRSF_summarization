the glasgow pub where 10 people were killed when a police helicopter crashed through the roof is planning to reopen 18 months after the tragedy
the the clutha in glasgow city centre has been shut since november 29 , 2013 , when the eurocopter ec 135 crashed into the building , killing seven customers and three police officers
much of the pub had been left untouched since the night of the disaster , but building work is now underway and owner crossan hopes to reopen by may
he has not yet decided what to do with the area of the building where the police scotland helicopter crashed
he said : ' it 's difficult , it 's taken me a year and a bit to even get to this stage
maybe in six months , maybe in a year , i 'll know better what to do with this
' obviously , when we get people back in and the music starts again , we 'll get a better idea of what we can do
' the name will stay
the the clutha , before the accident , was pretty famous anyway , so the name will always stay
the the clutha means the river clyde and we 're right next door to the river clyde , so we 'll retain that
' he added : ' obviously in its day it was a pub that was really happy and it was always a good pub , there were never any issues in it , so it 's got a feeling now where it 's strange , i could take a long , long time to figure out what to do with it
' the bar area of the clutha took the main impact of the crash , while those in the area where a band was playing were initially unaware that a helicopter had crashed into the building
thick dust covers much of the pub 's original features and debris is strewn across the premises following the tragic helicopter crash many drinks and glasses can still be seen in the bar area , which was ripped apart when the helicopter crashed through the pub 's roof mr crossan said it could take a ' long , long time to figure out what to do ' with the pub but currently has plans to reopen it by may 1 many glasses can still be found half - empty dotted around the pub , while food menus and live music posters are also scattered around glasses , many still half - filled with drink , could still be seen all around the pub today - some on the bar , some overturned on crates ( above ) mr crossan said building work is now underway to clear the rubble and debris and help refurbish the pub ahead of a reopening in may customers were forced to flee the pub when the helicopter plummeted through the roof , but many were killed instantly by the aircraft crash the pub was hosting a live music event at the time of the helicopter crash in november 2013 and the pub was packed with customers inside the clutha today , the scene looks largely as it would have done on the night of the disaster , when customers fled the building in panic

it has helped foster glasgow âs bustling music scene and has played host to the occasional celebrity
named after the latin name for the river clyde , which runs through glasgow , it was twinned with the nearby scotia bar , the oldest drinking establishment in the city
it was once the final stop for the the clutha boats , or â penny steamers â that would take people to and from work in the forth of clyde , once the centre of the world âs shipbuilding industry
more recently it has counted glasgow residents including comedian billy connolly and socialist politician tommy sheridan as patrons
it is now a noted live music venue , with performances most nights
ska band esperanza were playing on the night of the performance
the pub even plays a bit part in the story of war hero private jimmy stokes , who charged into an occupied germans building on his own in 1945
it was his last stop in his hometown before heading to war , where he bested the germans but was fatally wounded and died overseas , being posthumously awarded the victoria cross
the the clutha was also a favoured haunt of scottish socialist tommy sheridan , who led protests against the poll tax in 1989 and was jailed twice
although tee - total , he spent hours in the clutha drinking coffee before handing himself over an unpaid court fine for causing a disturbance at a protest
another tee - total star often spotted in the pub was scottish comedian billy connolly
the entertainer , who now lives in the u.s. , was even linked to an alleged assault at the venue in 1997 in the wake of a footballing triumph by local team celtic
the comedian reportedly lashed out when a press photographer tried to take a picture of him .
