families will enjoy the biggest boost to their finances for more than a decade as inflation is set to tumble to zero while wages rise
inflation has already plunged to 0.3 per cent â its lowest level since 1960 â after a big fall in the cost of essentials such as food and fuel
and bank governor carney told parliament yesterday that it would â likely fall further to around zero in the coming months , and remain near there for much of the year â
that means uk households can expect their biggest boost in spending power since 2001 , experts say
chancellor george osborne hopes that the easing pressure on family finances and the continuing economic recovery will help the conservatives at may âs general election
conservative strategists believe the party âs move ahead of labour in recent opinion polls shows more voters are starting to feel the benefits of the economic turnaround
labour planned to make a â cost of living crisis â a major election issue , but the news seems to support conservative claims that their economic plan is working
last night the treasury hailed mr carney âs inflation forecast as â good news â for households
mr carney , giving evidence to the house of lords economic affairs committee , said : â the combination of rising wages and weak headline inflation will strengthen household finances and boost real take - home pay growth this year to the fastest rate in a decade
in turn , this will support continued solid growth in consumer spending
â inflation has already hit the lowest level on record - hitting just 0.3 per cent in january - but mr carney said it would be ' extremely foolish ' to slash interest rates to try to get inflation back to its target rate of 2 per cent mr carney warned that interest rates are likely to rise at some point â but said that when that happens the increases will be â gradual â and â limited â
rates have been frozen at a record low of 0.5 per cent for more than six years
there has been speculation that the bank could cut rates even further â towards zero â if inflation threatened to fall too far and turn into a dangerous bout of deflation
such a move would spell misery for savers â who have already missed out on around Â£ 130billion in interest payments because of ultra-low rates â but would be welcomed by borrowers
but mr carney yesterday insisted that it would be â extremely foolish â to cut rates to counter the uncontrollable fall in global oil prices
he said it would risk adding â unnecessary volatility in inflation â and that he expects inflation to return to its 2 per cent target â within two years â
a report by the bcc , published today , predicts interest rates will rise to 0.75 per cent â no earlier â than the first three months of next year
the bcc is also raising its uk growth forecasts from 2.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent for this year and from 2.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent in 2016
that follows expansion of 2.6 per cent last year â when the uk was the fastest growing economy in the g7 group of leading nations
growth is expected to pick up to 0.7 per cent in the first three months of this year following a 0.5 per cent rise in output in the final quarter of last year
john longworth , director general of the bcc , said : â businesses up and down the country are doing well despite international and domestic uncertainty
â while 2015 has got off to a good start , there is no room for complacency
the uk is still a long way from achieving the great , sustainable , long - term growth we want to see
â a treasury spokesman said : â the latest economic forecasts from the bcc are yet further proof that our long - term economic plan is working , with the strongest growth of any major advanced economy last year and showing upgrades to uk growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016
but the bcc are right to say the job is not yet done so we must keep working through the plan that is delivering economic security in an uncertain world economy
â inflation as measured by the consumer prices index was last at zero or below between december 1959 and march 1960 , according to the office for national statistics .
