it 's a job that would make a chocoholic green with envy - eating up to 130 bars of chocolate a week working as an easter egg tester for marks & spencer
that 's what alex emerson-white has to munch her way through , consuming up to 13lbs of the brown stuff in just five days - and getting paid for it
but it 's all in a day 's work for the 27 - year - old , who lives in london , as she travels the world selecting the perfect ingredients for the store 's confectionery - most of which is hand - made in the uk and ireland
alex emerson white travels the world as an easter egg taster and can get through 6kg of chocolate per week however , alex emerson-white , who so far this year has been testing the luxurious 1.5kg giant golden lattice and children 's favourite the percy the pig egg , does admit the job does come with a risk - and confesses to going to the gym four times a week to keep off the pounds
and , of course , her friends are always asking her for freebies
alex emerson-white said : ' it varies in terms of week - to - week but i can eat 50 or 60 pieces of chocolate , it all adds up to about five kilos
' i go to the gym before work four times a week to keep fit and healthy
' although she can get through about 130 bars of chocolate a week , the 27 - year - old goes to the gym before work four times a week to ' keep fit and healthy ' ' but i ca n't complain , i have a brilliant job where i get to eat chocolate all day
my friends are always asking for samples
' alex emerson-white said she is now planning for easter but this year marks & spencer has some star attractions both for the kids and the big kids
she said : ' this year we thought a lot about giving a single easter egg rather than as many as possible , especially for the adults
' this year we have the golden lattice egg
we wanted a show - stopping egg that not only looked amazing but tasted divine
alex emerson-white tested the 1.5kg golden lattice egg and the children 's favourite , the percy the pig egg ' we 've been working on perfecting the egg for years but the intricate structure and time it takes to make the egg means we can only make so many
' we 've made the chocoholics ' dream come true this easter - make sure you snap it up before it sells out
' it weighs a whole one - and - a - half kilos and only 7,500 have been created
each egg takes over an hour to make and is hand - made and decorated by twelve skilled chocolatiers who are trained to work solely on this egg
