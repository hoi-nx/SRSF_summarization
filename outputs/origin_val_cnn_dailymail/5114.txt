murray celebrates during his win over john isner that clinched the brits a quarter - final place she says it shows huge appetite for tennis in scotland and highlights massive opportunity for sport to grow speaking ahead of the event , she said : ' i was a young mum when i started out volunteering at our local club and we had no track record of success in tennis in scotland - in fact , we had very little tennis in scotland and no indoor courts when i started out
' now there is a massive , massive opportunity to capitalise on the buzz about tennis that 's been created by andy and jamie 's success , and of course i really want to try to grow the game up here
' former wimbledon champion murray sealed the davis cup quarter - final place for great britain at the weekend with a straight - sets win over american john isner
' the davis cup was a phenomenal success , ' said judy murray
' the atmosphere at the emirates arena was incredible , there was about 8,000 people there
i 've never seen anything like it and andy and jamie said they 'd never played in an atmosphere like that
murray was quick to stress that scotland was full of talent but it needed to be nurtured in the right way james ward acknowledges the crowd after being forced off injured during day three of the davis cup ' you can see there 's a huge appetite for it in scotland , and for tennis it 's the perfect time to capitalise
' she added : ' for them to play it in scotland was very , very special
i think it was the first time andy had played in scotland since he won his grand slam
he found it very emotional
' i think he gets fantastic support from scotland , but he 's rarely in the country to feel it because when he does something big or is in a big final , obviously he 's not here
' i think when he walked out and heard that roar , it was goosebumps for him
' murray said it is a ' huge time for sport ' following a major 2014 for scotland
she said : ' i think last year with the commonwealth and the ryder cup - massive events in our country , run extremely successfully and extremely popular - and with what we saw last weekend at the emirates , we have a lot of role models in scotland and it is the perfect time to invest in sport and physical activity
' one of the academy 's aims is to develop the region 's workforce by providing training and professional development to those working in the leisure industry
the importance of growing an accomplished sporting workforce and encouraging more women to think about careers in sport are also topics close to murray 's heart
murray watches on while his brother jamie serves ( left ) and the gb team discuss tactics ( right ) she believes murray is a brilliant example of the talent scotland has from a country with no track record she said : ' andy and jamie were just two wee boys from a local club in dunblane , in a country where there was no track record of tennis , who went on to both win grand slam titles
' i think what that shows is that anything is possible if you have the talent , somebody creates the opportunity and then you work your socks off to get as far as you can
but we 've got to believe and we 've got to be ambitious
