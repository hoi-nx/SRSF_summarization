a reporter for fox 5 in washington dc has come under fire for telling very different versions of a home invasion story that she has repeated while advocating gun ownership
emily miller , the chief investigative reporter for wttg-tv , has previously claimed she fell victim to a terrifying home invasion on new year 's day in 2010 while dog - sitting for friends at their house
in one interview for the nra , she said she returned to the home to find it being robbed before trying to take a photo of the suspect - and being chased by a group of 15 men
but a police report has now revealed a very different - and far less harrowing - tale than the one she has shared publicly
she asked him why he was there and he told her he was delivering firewood , the police report noted , and left
emily miller , who had forgotten to lock the door behind her when she took out the dog , went into the house and ' felt that something was not right ' , according to the report , so left to take a photo of his car
outside , the suspect gave her a business card showing a tree service company before leaving , and emily miller saw that he was driving a silver truck showing the name of a landscaping company
but later that evening , her credit card company called her about fraudulent activity on her card and she checked her wallet and saw the card and $ 50 were missing , according to the report
she had left the wallet out on a table inside the unlocked home while walking the dog
the police report shows that after she told police about the fraudulent activity on her card , they tracked down the purchases to a wal-mart and a tattoo shop
harrowing : in one retelling of the story , for a 2014 video for the nra ( pictured ) , emily miller said she returned to find the home being robbed and the man took off with her wallet terrifying : a reenactment of the crime in the nra video shows it happened at night , rather than at 3pm but when police tried to contact her to take the case further , she did not return messages they left on her phone on three separate occasions and the report was suspended
the tale is far more dramatic when she re-tells it
in one example , she recounted the story on a video for the nra
a reenactment of the robbery in the video shows the robbery unfolding at night , rather than at 3pm as shown in the police report
tale : in her book , emily miller says she attempted to take the man 's photo in the street but he stopped her ' a man - the police believed to be a drug addict - got into the house and started robbing it , ' she said on the video
' so when i came back into the house he was in there robbing
' he took my wallet but i was able to talk him out of the house without hurting me , thank god
' she claims she then decided to follow him to get a picture - ' which was really stupid ' - and came across 15 men standing around two pickup trucks in the street
when they saw her , they started running towards her and she fled back to the house , where she called the police , she said
' going to bed that night in this house , it was the first time in my life i thought " i just wish i had a gun by my night table then i can defend myself if those men come in " , ' she said
emily miller has also said she was a ' victim of a home invasion ' on other occasions , including in speeches
and in a series for the washington times , ' emily gets her gun ' , she said the man told her he had come to service the swimming pool before leaving
she followed him with her phone
' i walked down the street , and as i turned the corner , i saw about 15 scruffy young men standing around two pickup trucks , ' she wrote
when she held up her phone to take a photo , a man blocked her shot and demanded to know what she was doing
' " nothing , i 'm um , just going now , " i said as i put my blackberry down instead of taking the picture around him and went home , ' she wrote - not mentioning a chase
she later turned her washington times series into a book , ' emily gets her gun ... but obama wants to take yours ' , which was published in september 2013
advocate : she has shared the story while advocating for gun rights in washington dc in a recent series on fox5 , she charted her attempts to get a gun in the state according to wemple of the washington post , the discrepancies in her story are important because she ' has hitched her career ' on it
she has cited the incident as a driving force behind her wish to get a gun in washington dc , and has charted her attempt in a series on fox5
in a report on fox5 last week , she revealed that she had been approved for the gun permit after providing the state two police reports showing threats on her life , she said
in another questionable move , she has been described as a pro-gun advocate while still working as a journalist
fox 5 identified her as ' a proponent of second amendment rights ' when it published her recent stories
when reached by dailymail.com for comment , emily miller , 44 , directed requests to fox 5 's public relations team , who have yet to respond
before working for fox 5 , she worked for the washington times , aol 's politics daily and abc news , according to her online bio .
