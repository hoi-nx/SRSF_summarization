an egyptian widow lived her life as a man for 43 years so she could earn enough money to support her children and grandchildren , it has been revealed
sisa abu daooh , 65 , was six months pregnant with her first child and living in a highly conservative community in the city of luxor when her husband died
unable to support her family as a 21 - year - old single mother and unwilling to marry a man she did n't love , abu daooh decided to shave her head , dress herself as a man and seek employment - first as a brick - maker and then as a shoe - shiner once she got older
' my brothers wanted me to get married again ... all the time they kept bringing new grooms to me , ' she told egypt
however abu daooh decided she could not marry somebody she did n't love and set about shaving her head and purchasing loose - fitting male clothing in order to become the breadwinner herself
the decision shocked and angered her family , but abu daooh ignored their pleas to remarry and instead set herself up as a brick - maker
by her own account she was as ' strong as 10 men ' in her 20s and 30s , but as she got older her strength began to fade and she started a new business , this time as a shoe - shiner

the mother ( pictured right ) was just 21 - years - old and six months pregnant with her first child when her husband died no other option : unable to support her family as a 21 - year - old single mother and unwilling to marry a man she did n't love , abu daooh decided to shave her head , dress herself as a man and seek employment abu daooh 's decision to live as a man was made purely so she could support her young daughter
' when a woman lets go of her femininity , it 's hard
but i would do anything for my daughter
it was the only way to make money
what else could i do ? i ca n't read or write - my family did n't send me to school - so this was the only way , ' she said
she had initially planned to give up the disguise as soon as her daughter married , but unfortunately her son in law fell seriously ill shortly after the wedding and was unable to seek employment
as time went by she grew to enjoy spending time around men and drinking at the local male - dominated cafes without suffering she kind of sexual harassment she claims she would have experienced if she was living openly as a woman
despite this , abu daooh says she never actually lied about her gender and never denied being a woman if she was asked
she also says that a large number of people in luxor always knew she was a woman and called her by a feminine name - and that the disguise was largely to avoid attracting abuse or prejudice from strangers or people who did not know her well
now abu daooh has been given an award for her sacrifice , with luxor 's local government naming her the city 's most devoted mother
over the weekend she met egypt 's president , abdel fattah al-sisi to receive an award marking 40 - years of self - sacrifice .
