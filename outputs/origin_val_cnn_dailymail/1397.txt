but we were determined not to leave anything out there or waste any chances
it âs not very often you score seven tries , beat france and walk off feeling pretty sick
â but at least we have the consolation of winning a big game at twickenham and showing people that we can finish off moves and score plenty of tries when we play this way
â head coach stuart lancaster admitted : â it âs disappointing to miss out on the title by a small margin again
it âs becoming an unfortunate habit and a not very nice one
but i ca nât fault the guys for the total commitment and effort
â we played some cracking rugby and scored some great tries
but credit to ireland for winning the title
it was another case of what might have been had we got this try or that one last week
