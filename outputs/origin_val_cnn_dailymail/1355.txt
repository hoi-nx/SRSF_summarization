the german shepherd mix captured in the heartbreaking image showing her being abandoned at a gas station has been taken into care
butterbean , was taken into custody by the humane society of louisiana after the owner released her for $ 400 this is the heartbreaking moment from last week when butterbean was seen desperately chasing after a car where it appeared she was being abandoned at a gas station on the side of a road in slidell , louisiana butterbean is currently at the furry friends animal hospital in harvey , louisiana , according to abc
' we 're delighted that this story will have a happy ending , ' said dorson , the human society 's founder and executive director , in a memo on tuesday
the agency has already received applications to adopt butterbean , and prospective applicants will be interviewed as they work to put her in the best suited home
the dog was captured in the photograph that surfaced last week by witness lorie hollis , who said she saw a man drop off the dog near a gas station on highway 11
she said the man yelled ' go ! go over there ! ' hollis said the animal was confused and jumped up , putting her paws on the tailgate of the man 's pickup truck before giving chase after the truck sped off , trying desperately to keep up
after the animal took off after the truck , hollis got into her car and tried to follow the dog and vehicle , watching the shepherd cross two lanes of traffic as the animal attempted to reach the man
but after driving for a couple of miles , hollis lost sight of them both
' my heart is broken , ' she told wdsu at the time of the incident
' i am in shock that someone would treat a dog like this
' dorson said when animals are abandoned in a ' random location ' they have ' almost zero ' chance of survival
butterbean is currently at the furry friends animal hospital in harvey , louisiana , and she will be put up for adoption soon applications to adopt her have already been submitted , and prospective applicants will be interviewed as the agency works to put her in the best suited home employees at the gas station and neighbors told wdsu last week that the dog was not being abandoned and that the man driving the truck lives in the neighborhood
the humane society wrote a post on facebook about successfully locating butterbean on march 20
' when butterbean was found , she was on the property of a family claiming to have owned her for 6 - 7 years , ' the post said
' they admitted to allowing her to roam at large during that time and reported that the man in the truck is actually a neighbor who the dog is attached to , who she follows routinely to the gas station
' given this information , we are truly amazed that butterbean has survived these many years
' after butterbean was found , pearson said that she intended to keep the dog tethered outside
but following the agency bringing the case to the attention of st. tammany animal control , the owner was issued a warning , and agreed to release the dog for cash
the humane society wrote a post on facebook about successfully locating the animal on march 20 the owner also signed an agreement not to chain or tether any animal in future or allow them to roam at large
' we certainly do n't like to reward this kind of behavior , but sometimes it simply takes too long for cases to move through the legal system , ' said dorson
' our first concern was butterbean 's safety
we were convinced she could be let loose again to run in traffic at any time , and we might miss our opportunity to intervene
' by claiming ownership , the family in question may still be held accountable for violating several ordinances relating to the dog 's behavior
following the incident , the humane society is launching a butterbean 's buddies campaign , which will run for a year , and will help reach more deserving dogs in need
dorson said butterbean 's story can help shed light on the fact that other louisiana dogs are chained , abandoned or neglected each year
