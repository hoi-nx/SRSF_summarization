the prince of wales described becoming a first - time grandfather as â a unique moment in anyone âs life ' , pictured at george 's christening in 2013 following the birth of prince george , the prince of wales described the experience of becoming a first - time grandfather as â a unique moment in anyone âs life â
but nearly two years after this very public display of affection , charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young prince of wales âs life
at the heart of the heir - to - the - throne âs frustrations is the so - called â middletonisation â of his son william âs life â specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in - laws michael and carole , with whom he recently holidayed in mustique for carole âs 60th
in fact , so vexed is charles about the so - called â march of the middletons â that he has complained to friends : â they never let me see my grandson
â adds a source : â carole has rather taken over , dictating when george naps , when and what he eats
all in all , behaving like she âs queen carole
â it is certainly true there have been few , if any , trips to charles âs gloucestershire home highgrove over the past year
some think it âs a deliberate move on william âs part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff , and often unhappy , upbringing he endured
certainly , carole , who is the granddaughter of a miner and was brought up in a council house , is not thought to enjoy any particularly strong bonds with charles âs wife , camilla
most of william and kate âs time is spent at their norfolk home , anmer hall , on the queen âs sandringham estate , where the prince of wales has been busy revising for his air transport pilot âs licence
the middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household
they stayed there over christmas day , when william pointedly hosted lunch for them on christmas day rather than eat with the queen , as is traditional
last month , it emerged that william âs housekeeper and gardener had abruptly quit after just five months at anmer
â staff have complained that anmer is not run like a proper royal household , â says my source
â it is too middle class
â yesterday , when asked when charles had last seen little george , a clarence house spokesman unusually issued a statement : â we would not comment on the specifics of private arrangements
â his royal highness enjoys an excellent relationship with his grandson
