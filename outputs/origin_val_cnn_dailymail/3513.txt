cats can sometimes be a mystery , even to their owners
but our felines friends may not be as difficult to understand as you might think , with clues to their personality hidden in their features
this is according to a california - based cat behaviourist who has identified three different types of cat face shape that she says can accurately reveal personality
' square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head - butts , ' said cat behaviourist , arden moore ' cat face geometry is one of the best tools for matching a cat to a person , ' says arden moore , author of ' fit cat : tips & tricks to give your pet a longer , healthier , happier life '
' it especially helps with " mutt " cats whose breed can not be determined
' while arden moore 's theory is not based on any scientific study , she says experience has revealed there is a strong link between looks and personality
this may be because different breeds of cats , with distinct behaviours , often have the same face shape
for instance , some cats , such as main coon , can have square faces and bodies
these cats are often keen to please their owners
' square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head - butts , ' said arden moore
triangular cats have been referred to as ' the herding dogs of the cat world
' triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy , curious , smart and vocal cats with round faces have flatter features , large eyes , circular heads and rounded bodies
arden moore describes them as the ' lap dogs ' of the feline world
' they tend to be low - energy , easily frightened , submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members , ' she said according to a report in the new york post , the best type of owner for these cats is one that has a a social life , works a 9 - to - 5 job and has a family who will play with the pet

arden moore describes them as the ' lap dogs ' of the feline world , and ' library cats '
