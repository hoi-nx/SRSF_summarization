at one minute to three , mowbray walked from the spacious ricoh arena tunnel , gave a thumbs up to the photographers clicking away and returned to the capricious game that is football management
by five oâclock , he must have been wondering quite what he âd thrown himself back into after a rollercoaster afternoon that did nothing to soothe coventry âs acute relegation anxieties
mowbray had not stood on a touchline since october 19 , 2013 , when his middlesbrough team were beaten 3 - 2 by barnsley at oakwell
the game has certainly not grown any kinder or more predictable in the meantime
coventry 's jim o'brien opens the scoring for the home side in just the fourth minute of the match coventry : burge , aaron phillips , pennington , martin , stokes , jim o'brien ( jackson 77 ) , , barton ( sanmi odelusi 62 ) , john fleck , nouble , tudgay ( williams 63 ) , samuel subs not used : webster , turgott , finch , charles - cook booked : jim o'brien scorer ( s ) : o'brien 4 , sanmi odelusi 70 vale : neal , veseli , inniss ( mcgivern 36 ) , robertson , dickinson , byron moore ( daniel 81 ) , michael brown , michael o'connor , mark marshall , williamson ( dodds 77 ) , tom pope subs not used : yates , birchall , lines , johnson booked : dickinson , inniss scorer ( s ) : tom pope 40 , mark marshall 45 , michael o'connor 76 referee : mick russell attendance : 9,446 the 51 - year - old yorkshireman , late of hibernian , west brom , celtic and teesside , spoke of restoring coventry âs glory days when he arrived in the week
but his short - term contract speaks of a more pressing mission - saving the coventry , famously fa cup winners in 1987 and staple of the top flight for many years , from the indignity of league two football
they remain above the relegation zone - just , by a sole point - after this 3 - 2 defeat but the new boss will be under no illusions that this is no time for grand future plans , just steely focus and cast - iron resolve
the initial signs had been so positive
on the first sunny afternoon of spring , the whole place seemed energised by mowbray âs arrival and coventry had a precious lead just four minutes in
from the left , the ball was worked into samuel âs feet but he could nât get them synchronised to shoot
instead , he passed backwards to oâbrien in plenty of space and he picked out the bottom corner with a perfectly - placed shot from 20 yards
mowbray issues instructions from the touchline during his first game in charge of coventry â we are staying up â , sang the home faithful , confident again that a club in the premier league as recently as 2000 - 01 would nât be playing fourth tier football next season for the first time since 1959
mowbray - who spent most of the match stood , hands in pockets , on the edge of his technical area - betrayed little emotion
it was only a start , after all
the coventry were well on top , looking threatening going forward and samuel âs deflected shot from a good position had neal scrambling across
but vale , who still harbour hopes of reaching the play - offs , slowly grew into the game and took command in the minutes just before half - time
first , tom pope was left with a straightforward side - foot finish after the ball was played across the penalty area , nobody seemingly wanting to take responsibility
there was a strong suspicion of offside , but the striker âs 11th goal of the season stood
few will come as easily as that for him
then , four minutes later , coventry âs fragile confidence at the back was dented again
the impressive mark marshall played a neat one - two with michael oâconnor around the home defence and produced an emphatic finish
the coventry wide man wheels away in celebration after giving his side the perfect start to make matters worse , mark marshall had been released by mowbray âs predecessor steven pressley last summer having been deemed unworthy of a new contract
mark marshall politely declined to celebrate
the travelling masses were less diplomatic , chanting â that âs why you âre going down
â mowbray sent his players out five minutes early for the second - half and , having composed themselves following the double blow before the break , they started on the front foot
oâbrien âs flighted cleared by neal âs legs just a fraction ahead of the onrushing john fleck and aaron phillips curled an effort wide from range
but they could nât sustain the bright start , allowing vale to dictate things again
byron moore volleyed over the bar after a clever piece of chest control and mark marshall tested burge with a low drive
the former middlesbrough and celtic manager holds his arms aloft in appeal at the ricoh arena then , out of nothing , an equaliser
frank nouble , brought back into the side by mowbray , bulldozed his way forward on the counter-attack before picking out sanmi odelusi bursting up on his right
after a touch to control , the substitute rifled home and in one swing of the boot , totally transformed the mood
a cloud of thick blue smoke rose in one corner from a flare as the home fans found their voices again
from their next piece of attacking play , vale were awarded a free - kick 25 yards out after oâbrien felled michael brown
up stepped michael oâconnor , bending the ball precisely around the wall and beyond the outstretched arm of burge
mowbray did nât know where to look
some welcome back to football this had been .
