isis terrorists are stealing civilians ' cars in an attempt to flee as iraqi soldiers fight their way into the strategically important city of tikrit
the massive operation involving more than 30,000 iraqi army soldiers is succeeding in forcing isis militants from the city , which is the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein
local officials confirmed that iraqi troops entered qadisiya , and penetrated the northern suburbs , raising the iraqi flag over tikrit 's general hospital
' the terrorists are seizing the cars of civilians trying to leave the city and they are trying to make a getaway , ' kheyon rasheed told the state - run iraqiyya television
tikrit , which lies midway between regime - capital baghdad and the isis stronghold of mosul , was taken by isis in june
retaking the isis stronghold is considered vital if government forces are to succeed in their plan to force isis out of the oil rich city of mosul , the terror group 's iraqi power base which lies just 140 miles north of tikrit on highway 1 - a road that effectively marks the front line in northern iraqi
most residents of tikrit fled in the months after the extremist group took control
those who stayed have fled in recent days , but a tiny fraction are still there , awaiting their fate
iraqi forces entered isis - held tikrit city centre from qadisiya in the north and also from the south - the terrorists still hold the town of al-alam , north of tikrit university militiamen laid down heavy machine gunfire in the neighborhood 's dusty streets during the attack today taking tikrit would open a supply line for a future operation to besiege mosul , iraqi 's second - largest city that still remains under isis control tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for iraqi forces , but the attack by thousands of shiite irregulars could severely test the government 's ability to handle sectarian divisions
iraqi is bitterly split between minority sunnis , who were an important base of support for saddam hussein , and the shiite majority
since the islamic state insurgency began , the iraqi military is heavily dependent on shiite militias that have been accused of abusing sunni communities elsewhere in iraqi
us military officials - who have not been involved in the ongoing tikrit offensive - have that said a coordinated military mission to retake mosul is likely to take place next month or two and involve up to 25,000 iraqi troops
but the us have cautioned that if the iraqi are not ready , the offensive could be delayed
iran military advisers have been helping guide iraqi forces in their advance on tikrit
general qasem soleimani , the commander of iran 's irgc ( irgc ) quds force , is taking part in leading the tikrit operation
most battlefield successes in iraqi have been coordinated efforts , with iraqi , kurdish and shiite militias fighting on the ground and the us - led coalition providing air power
the siege on the village of amirli just north of baghdad , when many feared the capital itself might fall , was broken last year with the help of us - led airstrikes and a fighting force of mainly shiite militias
shiite militiamen , backed by a coalition air campaign , also retook the town of jurf al-sukhr , on baghdad 's outskirts , from the militants in october
iraqi 's prime minister haider al-abadi has appealed for more aid for his country 's beleaguered ground forces , despite the us spending billions of dollars training and equipping iraqi 's army during its eight - year occupation
tikrit , the capital of salahuddin province , sits on the tigris river about 80 miles north of baghdad armoured vehicles of iraqi security forces drive past black smoke following the clash with isis iraqi celebrated the advance on tikrit and the withdrawal of isis militants from the city tonight , iraqi in baghdad celebrated the news from tikrit where isis militants fled the city in civilians ' cars the rapid advance across syria and iraqi by militant fighters from isis in 2014 led to the jihadist group announcing the establishment of a ' caliphate ' - stretching from aleppo in syria to the province of diyala in iraqi by june
the us went on to assemble a coalition to fight the militants , and has so far launched more than 1,400 air strikes against is targets in iraqi since the campaign started on august 8
