reaching up to close my kitchen blind , i catch sight of my neighbour in her garden
she raises her hand to wave , then stops
rooted to the spot , horror etched on her face , she looks as though she âll never get over the shock
but i âm not surprised
my face is the stuff of nightmares
covered in a cotton mask and wrapped in clingfilm ( right ) , i look just like hannibal lecter
i âm swaddled like this because , according to a new bestselling book , the skincare revolution , steaming your face by covering it in clingfilm is the secret to beautifully smooth and rejuvenated skin
a new bestselling book , the skincare revolution , says that steaming your face and covering it in clingfilm is the key to rejuvenated skin japanese women are renowned for their beautiful skin but , until now , no book in english has revealed the secrets of their beauty routines
now , we can discover the joys of massage to tone the muscles of the face and natural remedies for wrinkles , sagging , oiliness , pimples and blackheads â including a step - by - step guide to the clingfilm mask
the idea is that the heat created by your breath and body warmth will encourage pores to open , so that the moisture from any water , creams or serums applied to the face will soak into the deeper layers of the skin , boosting collagen
â moisture content is the most important factor in a rejuvenated complexion , â says the book âs author saeki , a celebrity beauty guru in japanese
â if skin is hydrated , it will look younger , firmer and fresher
â she promises that her mask , which consists of water , followed by hydrating lotion , then serum â will give me an instant youth boost
if i follow it to the letter , i can wave goodbye to botox , as water is the secret weapon in the war on ageing
surprisingly enough , the idea does have medical backing
frances childs ( pictured ) gave the bizarre technique a try and wrapped her own face in clingfilm to see what the results were like â we use clingfilm in severe cases of psoriasis to encourage cream to work at a deeper dermal level , â says dr chopra , director of the london dermatology centre in wimpole street , london
dr chopra says healing cream is applied to the skin , then wrapped in clingfilm before being left overnight in a process called occlusion therapy
the heat from the body encourages pores to open and the cream to absorb , rather than just sitting on the skin âs surface
in the past year , my complexion has begun to look grey and tired
at 46 , the lines around my eyes and mouth are becoming pronounced
so if wrapping my face in clingfilm helps me retain some semblance of youth , i âm willing to give it a try
frances childs ( pictured ) bought cosmetic facial mask sheets and first soaked them in water before applying nars hydrating fluid to the mask having bought a cosmetic facial mask sheet â a thin piece of cotton in the shape of a face with the eyes , nostrils and lips cut out â ( Â£ 2 for 40 , amazon.co.uk ) , i set to work
first , i soak the weird - looking facial mask in water and wring it out
then , i liberally apply nars hydrating fluid ( Â£ 27.05 , narscosmetics.co.uk ) to the mask , creating a thin layer of product over its surface
â hydrating fluid is a moisturising agent , â says dr prager , a cosmetic medicine specialist from london
â it contains humectant , a substance that attracts and retains water
it gathers water on and below the skin âs surface and retains it , plumping out fine lines and smoothing the complexion
â the book also recommends that you do a quick lymphatic drainage massage to clear toxins and reduce puffiness with the mask drenched , i pat it on to my face , where it sticks like a damp cloth
though it âs strange , it feels pleasantly cool and less slimy and greasy than i had imagined
now to wrap my face in clingfilm
this feels horrid and , despite having created breathing holes around my nose and mouth , i feel claustrophobic
yet within minutes , the clingfilm is doing its job
beneath the mask , my skin feels smooth and slippery and i âm clouding up from the humidity
i can feel the heat created by my breath
it âs not as hot as a sauna , but it âs several degrees warmer inside the mask than out
after 20 minutes , i whip off the mask as instructed
already , my skin looks smoother and plumper
now it âs time to rub in moisturising cream
i opt for estee lauder hydrationist ( Â£ 36 , john lewis ) , though saeki says any cream will do because it âs how it âs applied that matters
after taking off the mask , frances childs ( pictured ) tries to follow follow saeki âs instructions on the art of water massage by spritzing water along the â muscles of facial expression â she recommends a quick lymphatic drainage massage
massaging lymph glands behind the earlobes , around the collarbone and under the armpits helps stimulate lymphatic flow , thus clearing toxins , she says
this , in turn , will help reduce puffiness in the face and lead to a clearer complexion
after slathering on the cream , it âs time to steam my face again â only this time , i use a wet towel heated in the microwave for 30 seconds
beneath my warm towel , it âs dark and restful
i can almost feel the moisturiser seeping into my pores and , i hope , filling out the lines across my face
but the calm does nât last long
once the towel comes off , i âm busy trying to follow saeki âs instructions on the art of water massage
using a spray bottle , i attempt to follow her diagram , spritzing along the â muscles of facial expression â â along the forehead in a zig - zag from right to left , clockwise around the eyes and mouth , three short upward strokes along the cheeks and , finally , clockwise around my whole face
by the time i âve finished , i âm soaking wet , with water dribbling down my face and plopping forlornly off the end of my chin
frances childs ( pictured ) was pleasantly surprised by the results of the clingfilm facial and says she thought her complexion looked instantly softer onto the final leg of this marathon , and it âs time to massage serum into my face
i use skin - ceuticals serum ( Â£ 40 , amazon.co.uk ) , a strong , hydrating product with hyaluronic acid â an agent that encourages skin to attract and retain water
then i massage it into my damp skin , concentrating on smoothing out the lines around my mouth and on my forehead , and pressing it into my face with upward strokes
and , finally , i âm done
the facial took half - an - hour , but it felt much longer â perhaps because i was struggling to read the instructions through the clingfilm
nevertheless , i âm pleasantly surprised
my complexion looks instantly softer , its greyish tinge replaced by a rosy hue , and the lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished
â you wo nât get lasting rejuvenating effects from this facial because it wo nât increase collagen , which is the key to younger skin
but your face will look plumped out and smoother for 24 hours , â says dr prager
however , saeki insists her facial has a cumulative effect , so if you repeat it three times a week for three months , you can knock off a decade
the day after , i meet a friend for lunch
she demands to know if i âve had a collagen filler
â you âve done something and do nât tell me it âs just a good night âs sleep , â she says
with a result like that , i âm willing to mummify myself every evening for the rest of the year .
