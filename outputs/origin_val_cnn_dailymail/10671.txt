england 's population is up 565,000 in the past three years because of a fresh influx of migrants , experts said yesterday
the migrant population in england is estimated to have increased by more than half a million in three years , research from the oxford has revealed
around two thirds of the 565,000 migrants thought to have come to the country between 2011 and 2014 were born in other eu countries , the study by the university 's migration observatory said
today the former head of the european commission taunted cameron over this issue and said it was ' impossible ' for uk to reverse the trend
here is a regional picture of the total foreign population of england and the percentage it has risen in since 2011 jose manuel barroso said : â when you have 28 countries it will be impossible to say , let âs say , the french can come to uk to work in the city but the poland can not come to uk â this is not possible
this will be a violation of the principles of no discrimination
â having said that , the eu is very much aware that there is the abuse of social benefits
if you have not the means to be in the country , you can not go there just to benefit from the social security
â but you have the right , if you are a citizen of a europeans country to go to another country to establish there
â poland is trying to call its skilled workers home from uk
ambassador sobkow said it can not afford to lose its best young people and wants to persuade them to return
the poland authorities also hope eu freedom of movement rules will encourage other europeans to look for jobs in the country , boosting its economy
mr sobkow said efforts were under way to bring back some of the millions of young poland who left for uk and after poland joined the eu in 2004
he told bbc radio four : â we have a special programme called returns and the government is trying to attract these people back home
â we are worried that we may lose some well - educated people , and also skilled workers , because we need them
â but he added : â we have other nationalities in poland ... so this is a kind of free movement of brains
â plea : witold sobkow he said as long as the principle of freedom of movement is not called into question , a deal can be reached to restrict migrants â benefits
the majority moved to london and the south - east but the north - east and yorkshire and humber saw the biggest percentage increases , figures show
every council area of england has seen an increased migrant population , it was said
researchers , who stressed that the numbers are estimates , said the projections give a more up - to - date picture of the migrant populations across england than the 2011 census
it came as the institute for fiscal studies found that rising number of migrants has led to council services spending by being cut in half - and those with highest migration numbers were hit hardest
official estimates on population are expected in june from the office for national statistics
the greatest increase in the number of foreign - born residents has been in the capital
almost 200,000 more migrants were estimated to live in london last year , compared to 2011
the south east saw the second - highest rise of 79,000 , while the smallest increase was in the north east where an extra 26,000 migrants are thought to have arrived since 2011
madeleine sumption , director of the migration observatory , said the study was done to provide more insight ahead of the general election
' these data show how different local experiences of migration have been across the uk , ' she said
' there are large variations in the size of migrant populations , as well as the share that come from eu countries
figures : the study shows how all regions have seen thousands more migrants from within the eu since 2011 embarrassing : despite pledges from cameron thousands of migrants from outside the eu also came to england ' we have undertaken this analysis to provide a resource for anyone looking to understand local demographics of migration in the run - up to the general election
' the news piles more pressure on cameron , whose promise to curb immigration has been shattered , last week it emerged annual net migration â the measure of how many people have come into uk minus those who have left â has reached nearly 300,000 - a record
when he took power in 2010 mr cameron pledged to bring this politically sensitive figure below 100,000
a total of 624,000 people migrated to uk in the 12 months up to last september while 327,000 left
the inflow is up 94,000 on the year before
official figures : last year 300,000 migrants arrived in uk , with 190,000 of them travelled from outside the eu net migration from the eu hit 162,000 in the year ending september 2014 , up from 130,000 in the previous year a total of 37,000 romanian and bulgarian arrived in the uk , up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months
