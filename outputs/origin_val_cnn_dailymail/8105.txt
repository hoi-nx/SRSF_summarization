the sperm of a proto - facist italian soldier and poet has been used to reconstruct his dna , the first time this technique has been used
scientists performed the reconstruction , which usually requires the exhumation of remains , by analysing a handkerchief belonging to soldier and poet dâannunzio 100 years ago
it had been given by dâannunzio to his lover , countess olga levi brunner , in 1916 with semen residue on it
italian dâannunzio 's ( shown right , with mussolini on the left ) sperm was use to reconstruct his dna
scientists analysed a handkerchief belonging to dâannunzio 100 years ago
it had been given to his lover countess olga levi brunner with semen on it the handkerchief was analysed by police in cagliari , sardinia , along with a letter written by the countess and an ivory toothbrush
they had been stored at the vittoriale degli italiani foundation in lombardy , northern italian
dâannunzio , born 12 march 1863 , moved into the building in 1922 until his death on 1 march 1938
it was later turned into a museum
scientists believe that dna evidence found at a crime scene could in the future be used to create mugshots of criminal suspects
this is one potential use to emerge from a new research paper - modeling 3d facial shape from dna - published on last year in plos genetics
in the article , a team of scientists explained how they were able to produce crude 3d models of faces simply from people 's dna samples
â we show that facial variation with regard to sex , ancestry , and genes can be systematically studied with our methods , allowing us to lay the foundation for predictive modeling of faces , â the researchers wrote
experts studied the artifacts using a crimescope light , which can observe objects in a variety of wavelengths
this revealed the hidden blotches on the handkerchief , the dna results of which were then compared with federico dâannunzio , the right - wing revolutionary âs great grandson
vittoriale degli italiani foundation chief giordano bruno guerri joked that the experiment might open the door to the future cloning of historical figures even if their remains have been lost
â nobody wants to clone dâannunzio , but nobody knows what changes will take place in science and society , â he said
â it âs good the dna has been collected
â afp news agency described dâannunzio as a â proto - fasciast warmonger â , with many saying his ideals were a forerunner to italian fascism

dâannunzio 's dna has been extracted from a handkerchief stained with sperm that the poet gave a woman as a ' present ' after having sex in 1916 a member of the italian carabinieri presents an unpublished letter ( left ) that italian poet dâannunzio ( 1863 - 1938 ) wrote on 15 july 1935 to carabinieri colonel adelchi struffi
