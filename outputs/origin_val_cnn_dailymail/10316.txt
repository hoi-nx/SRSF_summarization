however , many local residents are opposed to the new , larger development
the rolling stone musician has written to planning authorities to express his objection to the plan
he said : ' the second - storey restaurant overlooks and is visible from the sea and beach
it spoils the natural beauty and seclusion of the beach
it dominates the area and degrades its character
' the restaurant threatens the environment and locals
it can not be allowed
' richards has objected to several other planned developments near his property , which is surrounded by its own moat
the new building would replace a cafe that was damaged by a fire caused by an electrical fault in october last year , and it has been operating from the life savers ' hut since then
west wittering estate runs the cafe and the company are proposing the planned redevelopment

peter dawson , mr keith richards ' neighbour , said he was ' gobsmacked ' when he saw the plans
shareholder tayler said he was surprised the new building had been located closer to the sea as an erosion map created by the environment agency showed the site ' was predicted to be eroded ' by 2105
he said : ' it 's an enormous development on a beach which is preserved not to have development
' it will be visible for everybody boating or sailing and all up the channel
mr tayler also said it would be ' dangerous ' to have premises selling alcohol in a secluded area so close to the sea
the plans include space to sit 60 indoors and 40 outdoors in seating on a terrace which overlooks the beach
developers want to build the new restaurant on a beach less than two miles from the musician 's house the planned beachfront restaurant is just two miles form keith richards ' elizabethan house a small restaurant is planned on the upper floor during the daytime , with a self - service cafe on the ground floor , take - away windows and ice cream kiosks
patrick byrne , a director of the estate , said the building had been sited nearer the beach so visitors could enjoy sea views for the next 50 years , as plans had not been made for the next 100 years
he said the building 's wooden exterior would help it blend into the landscape and that it would have be eco-friendly solar panels
stephen hammett , chairman of the estate , said : ' we believe it will provide a tasteful improvement , and it has been carefully designed to ensure the overall feel of the estate remains unspoilt and as natural as possible
' our aim is to provide our customers with a better service of food and drink , so that visiting west wittering is an even better experience than before
' following a trial in 1967 , mick jagger was sentenced to three months in prison for possession of amphetamines , while richards was jailed for a year for allowing cannabis to be smoked in his home
both sentences were overturned on appeal .
