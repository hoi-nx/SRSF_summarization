warm applause fluttered around wembley as harry kane slowly jogged up the touchline in the first half , but on the pitch welbeck was putting in a performance to indicate he is in no mood to step aside anytime soon
hodgson âs selection of welbeck ahead of the in - form harry kane in england euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania divided opinion across the nation ahead of kick - off
should he have started the hot - shot spurs striker , joint - top in the premier league with diego costa on 19 and with 29 in all competitions ? or welbeck who has been performing well for the national team but in - and - out of arsenal âs starting line - up , struggling to eight goals in 34 ? welbeck leads the celebrations after putting england 2 - 0 ahead against lithuania on friday welbeck 's header deflects into the back of the net to send england into a commanding lead welbeck is congratulated by england captain rooney after scoring his sixth of the qualfying campaign former england striker ian wright thought the former
â gutted that harry kane 's not starting , â he said before kick - off , â 29 goals , form of his life
â but within six minutes , the arsenal man had justified the choice with a huge hand in the opener
welbeck started on the left , but was to the right of goal when he nutmegged lithuania âs tadas kijanskas with some nifty footwork and fired a shot across goal , which keeper giedrius arlauskis could only parry into the path of rooney to head in
he almost set up a second on 19 minutes , again getting to the byline on the right before crossing deep to rooney , who looped a header back across goal and on to the post
welbeck was bright and alive around the box and got the goal his first - half performance deserved just before the break
jordan henderson crossed from the left and he diverted it in off a shoulder via a deflection
welbeck caused the lithuanian defence problems all evening and justified his selection welbeck is congratulated by former manchester united team - mate rooney after doubling the lead harry kane may be the latest boy wonder , yet welbeck is the top - scorer in this euro 2016 qualifying campaign
his goal moved him to six for the tournament , clear of israel âs omar damari on five
doubles against slovenia and switzerland , a goal versus san marino and another against lithuania is not a bad return
say what you will about the strength of the opposition , but players can only score against what is put in front of them
hodgson certainly recognised his value , choosing welbeck as one of only four players - alongside rooney , gary cahill and nathaniel clyne - to start from the last team he picked
dat guy welbz , as he was dubbed by ravel morrison providing a nickname that went viral , did not let his manager down
he was close to adding another on 41 minutes , riding a challenge and bending a shot towards the top right corner from the edge of the box which was narrowly over
welbeck is the first to congratulate debutant harry kane after scoring two minutes after coming on welbeck celebrates with rooney after he turns home the rebound after the arsenal striker 's effort was saved and again in the 54th , beating two men on his way into the penalty area to the right of goal and powering a shot on target which was pushed out for a corner
he would surely have had a second had raheem sterling not arrived in the box a fraction earlier to tap in england âs third
this may only have been lithuania , the team ranked 94th in the world , but welbeck âs passing was crisp and accurate , his runs inventive and movement fluid
an indication of his confidence was a clever back - heel flick in the middle of a quick england passing exchange early in the second half
england âs front three of welbeck , rooney and raheem sterling were swapping places all evening causing havoc to lithuania âs defenders
welbeck was substituted for theo walcott in the 77th minute , but the sponsors had seen enough to vote him their man - of - the - match
harry kane may have scored within two minutes of coming on , but , for now , welbeck will be going nowhere in the big games .
