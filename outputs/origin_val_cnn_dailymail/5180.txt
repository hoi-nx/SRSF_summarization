caroline bailey , 46 , worked at broad oak high school in bury , greater manchester , for 23 years but became stressed at work and began suffering panic attacks and insomnia
the mother - of - two ended up taking sick leave and made several attempts to self - harm during the school 's summer holidays , the inquest in oldham heard
she was later admitted to a psychiatric unit at fairfield hospital , greater manchester
on the day of her death in september 2012 , she told staff at the unit that she was going out to buy a newspaper but instead went to castle hill quarry near rochdale , where she was later found dead
the inquest heard how the tragedy occurred after ms caroline bailey was appointed head of humanities at the school , where she was described by the headteacher as an ' outstanding classroom practitioner ' who ' always put children first
' the hearing was told how she started talking about self - harm over undisclosed issues she had with a fellow teacher and was eventually prescribed anti-depressants
she became so stressed that she began locking herself in her own classroom to eat lunch at the school instead of joining her colleagues in the staff room
her husband neal connor , 36 , said she also began calling herself ' stupid ' after a fellow teacher was promoted above her and said : ' i have nothing
' mr neal connor , a recovery operator from prestwich , said : ' she had been suffering from panic attacks while she was at work
she had felt them a couple of times while she was teaching
' she had also felt the same sort of feeling when she had been in the presence of a couple of other members of staff as well , to the point that since december i noticed she had not been eating properly at home
' she avoided going to the staff room on multiple occasions because she wanted her own time
she did not want to be in the presence of certain staff
she locked herself in her own class room for dinner
' she had problems with members of staff at work and in my opinion it was a form of strategic bullying
' there were ongoing issues from school and they were on her mind
she was made aware that a person was promoted above her position and she came out with comments like ' i have nothing , ' and called herself ' stupid
' in the months before her death , ms caroline bailey was advised by her gp to seek counselling and also paid for her own hypnotherapy sessions
however , she ended up going on sick leave and began self - harming during the school 's summer holidays
neal connor told the inquest in oldham that he believed his wife caroline ( together above ) was being subjected to ' strategic bullying ' at the school
he said she called herself ' stupid ' after a colleague was promoted over her following one instance of self - harm , her husband took her to a&e and doctors suggested that she be treated in a psychiatric unit at fairfield hospital
however , she begged not to be admitted as it was so close to the school where she worked
mr neal connor said : ' when she got to fairfield hospital that night she looked like a frightened child
she said she wanted to be anywhere except there
when she walked from the ambulance she was frightened of seeing someone she knew - she looked through every single window to see who was there
' there were some boys from the school sat at the entrance to fairfield hospital and her biggest fear was the fact that she had taught there for that long that some of the kids she taught at 15 would be 25
' the biggest fear would be that they recognised her but she would not recognise them and that it would go out into the community that she was at that sort of ward
' following the treatment at hospital , ms caroline bailey was allowed to return home for the weekend and appeared to improve
however , three days before her death , her condition worsened when she began receiving text messages from a work colleague , the inquest heard
mr neal connor added : ' there had been a lot of interaction that day with work colleagues who had been texting her
she struggled to reply to these texts
' she had had several texts regarding work issues from a history teacher who was quite a close friend of hers
she was aware that caroline had been pretty bad but not aware she was on a ward
' they were lengthy messages and she struggled to reply to the messages and read through to make sure what she was writing made sense
' she was fixated on work
there had been a promotion of a person she had problems with
ms caroline bailey took sick leave from broad oak school in bury , greater manchester ( pictured ) and was admitted to a psychiatric unit at fairfield hospital
she was found dead after being allowed out to buy a newspaper ' when she first went off on leave , she was still scheduling work and work were contacting her
there were other teachers covering the lessons and she would see what they were doing but it was not sufficient for what she was happy with
she felt she was letting the kids down
' at all times , whether it would be a female , man or child , or anyone around her at school , others would come first
' she had a gift as a teacher and she was very much well - known for being able to take the most stubborn pupil and near enough turn them around her little finger
that was the way that she was
she was very much a loving , thoughtful person
' after the weekend break , ms caroline bailey returned to the psychiatric unit at fairfield hospital
however , staff allowed out her to go out on september 2 , 2012 , to visit a nearby newsagents
when she failed to return to the ward , doctors rang her husband and he tried to call her mobile but got no response
she was found dead at the quarry a short time later
at the inquest , coroner simon nelson said : ' it is clear caroline had many qualities
' she adored her children , she was a dedicated mother , a dedicated wife and dedicated teacher who cared about all of her pupils
' she remained concerned about the work and welfare and success of her children
she also put others before herself
