carol kirkwood , pictured at the tric awards where she was crowned weather reporter for the seventh time , has been getting explicit pictures in the post she has just been crowned weather reporter for the seventh time â so there is no doubt carol kirkwood is a hit with viewers
but the 52 - year - old bbc breakfast presenter has revealed some male fans are more than a little enthusiastic and send her explicit pictures in the post
â i do get letters from older men , fan mail , â she said , gesturing to her nether regions
i have had so many over the years
i am almost immune to it
you can tell by the hand writing
â i do nât have anyone who checks our mail as it all comes into the office
i do nât count them
â her smiley demeanour and shapely figure , which she often dresses in figure - hugging outfits , have attracted an army of admirers
on tuesday she was given the weather reporter gong at the tric ( tric ) awards for the seventh time , beating off itv rival laura tobin and the bbc breakfast âs tomasz schafernaker
speaking at the awards ceremony , the presenter â who also does weather reports for the one show â said she also receives sordid messages online
â you get a lot on social media
if they are on twitter you block them , â she said
she explained any explicit pictures sent to the office are quickly â binned â
the weather presenter is divorced from jimmy kirkwood , her husband of 25 years
but her new partner , whose identity is unknown , takes her legions of male admirers in his stride
she said : â my boyfriend is used to it
he just thinks it is funny
he does not take it seriously which is probably just as well
â the broadcaster herself has taken a light - hearted approach to live tv slip - ups
last year she battled on despite accidently â clicking her clicker â twice , revealing scorching temperatures of 99 degrees in a place identified as â town name â
speaking about her live gaffes , mrs carol kirkwood explained : â we ca nât see the weather map behind us
sometimes the map and town does nât pop up behind me and that has happened numerous times
you just have to get on with it
â the glamorous weather presenter said she receives fan mail from enthusiastic older men who would send the explicit pictures in the post and is seems some viewers have very high expectations of her capabilities
â people do blame me for bad weather , definitely , â she revealed
â and also people âs expectations are high
people wanted to see snow this year
some parts saw snow but by no means everywhere
â she believes women of her age have a lot to bring to the profession
â more and more we are seeing women my kind of age and possibly older coming through the ranks to present the weather
it is good as we offer a load of experience , â she said
speaking at the awards ceremony , the presenter â who also does weather reports for the one show â said she also receives sordid messages online on tuesday she was given the weather reporter gong at the tric ( tric ) awards for the seventh time , beating off itv rival laura tobin ( right ) and the bbc breakfast âs tomasz schafernaker ( left ) and , although she thinks bbc breakfast presenter bill turnbull , 59 , would not make the cut as a weather presenter , she believes multitasking men can be just as good at the job
she revealed : â bill turnbull has tried to do it but he is more like a ballerina
when you present the weather it is like tapping your head and rubbing your tummy at the same time
' if you can do it whether you are a man or a woman , then you can do it
we have got brilliant weather men as much as we have weather women
i do nât know if one is better than the other
