teacher davies , pictured , vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog a teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave
davies , who has taught english for the past 28 years , faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct
a general teaching council for wales ( gtcw ) hearing in cardiff was told mrs davies became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board
the 56 - year - old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress
caerphilly county council took the drastic action after suspecting the mother - of - two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the information commissioner 's office later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance
however , she was still hauled before the gtcw - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making ' vexatious ' complaints
among the penalties available to the body included striking mrs davies ' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home
a panel decided against the more severe sanctions - and said she can carry on teaching provided she promises not to cause problems again
mrs davies denied being a troublemaker and said she was ' fighting injustice ' after her complaint about a pupil 's behaviour was not taken seriously
she said : ' i am relieved that i am able to carry on teaching
i do n't know what i would have done if that was taken from me - it would have had a massive effect on my welfare and happiness as well as my financial circumstances
' i 've been through four years of hell - not only has there been the prospect of losing my home but also my job
' but despite everything that i have been through it would not put me off on blowing the whistle again
' this issue unravelled following a complaint about the safety of pupils and staff
it is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom
' i care too much about my pupils and their welfare
' even though they decided the allegations against were proven , i always believed what i was doing was right
' and if you can live with your conscience , then you can survive
' the gtcw heard that mrs shaw , from blackwood , south wales , became embroiled in a row with bosses at pontllanfraith comprehensive school after lodging a complaint about a problem pupil 's ' threatening behaviour '
after feeling the issue was not taken seriously , she was subject to disciplinary proceedings in 2010 before finally being dismissed two years later
during her period of suspension , it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school 's internal disciplinary processes and made ' vexatious allegations ' to exam board wjec in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute
case presenter reynolds said the registrant also behaved inappropriately towards her line manager , her head of department and headteacher robert davies - whom she called ' an idiot ' and referred to him being in his ' ivory tower '
ms reynolds added : ' she felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay , because she felt a sense of injustice
' we heard today that she did n't want the education of pupils to be jeopardised , but there is still no insight into her failings
' she was only suspended because of the way she acted towards her disciplinary proceeding
' ms davies had raised issues at pontllanfraith comprehensive school , pictured , about a ' problem pupil ' however , while the row rumbled on it emerged that caerphilly council paid private investigators Â£ 3,600 to tail mrs shaw for three days - a move the information commissioner 's office later called ' unlawful '
in mitigation , mrs shaw told the gtcw she had been absolutely devastated by the events of the past four years
' i had built up a reputation over 28 years in one school and to have that questioned and to be accused of malpractice decimated everything i believed i stood for , ' she said
nasuwt representative colin adkins told the hearing mrs shaw believed she was being disciplined after raising ' a serious safeguarding matter '
he said : ' mrs shaw believed that was done by challenging her professional integrity , which she found personally devastating
' she has suffered a serious detriment already - financially and personally - for pursuing matters she believed she was right to pursue
' i believe the public interest is best served by allowing mrs shaw to continue teaching
quite clearly , she 's a good teacher
' panel chairman steve powell said the gtcw was satisfied mrs shaw failed to ' behave professionally ' during her disciplinary process and her actions ' fell short of what is expected of a registered teacher '
mrs shaw , who has been a supply teacher for the past two years , was handed a conditional registration order
it means she can carry on teaching provided she fulfils certain requirements , such as any employer having to submit a report on her progress
following the decision , she said : ' i 'm still trying to take in the implications of what this means but for now i just want to get back doing what i do best - teaching
