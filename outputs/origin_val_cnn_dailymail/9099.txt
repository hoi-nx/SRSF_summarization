dzhokhar tsarnaev 's lawyers have been trying to paint him as a gullible teen who was recruited by his extremist brother to bomb the boston marathon finish line two years ago
but today , prosecutors presented the jury with a never - before - seen photo that tells quite a different story
seen in the bedroom of his family home in cambridge , massachusetts , dzhokhar tsarnaev sits at a computer chair and points to a black flag behind him - not unlike the kind used by extremist groups like al-qaeda and isis
dzhokhar tsarnaev 's former best friend silva testified in court on tuesday that he saw the flag hanging in dzhokhar tsarnaev 's room , the one time he visited the apartment to watch the walking dead
while the so - called black banner or black standard has been co-opted by islamist extremist groups in recent years , it has much deeper origins in the muslim world
the muhammad used a black standard when he fought , which is why it continues to be used as a symbol for modern - day jihadists
according to boston university master arabic lecturer giselle khoury , the flag reads : ' there is no god but allah , and muhammad is allah 's messenger '
she told the boston herald that the statement is called ' the shahada - the testimony ' which declares one 's belief in the islamic faith
however , quickly after the picture of the flag was shown in court today , u.s. district court judge george a. oâtoole jr ordered taken out of court since he found it ' illegible '
assistant u.s. attorney aloke chakravarty said another witness , who did not take the stand today , would be explaining the flag 's significance further
dzhokhar tsarnaev , 21 , is charged with killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade pressure - cooker bombs at the race 's crowded finish line on april 15 , 2013 , and shooting dead a university police officer three days later
where the boston bombing was hatched : the jury deciding the federal death penalty trial were also shown other pictures from the dzhokhar tsarnaev family home , including the image of the right of dzhokhar tsarnaev 's home computer authorities release this picture of the flag - which has become a symbol of islamic terror groups the world over since the 1990s where he slept : dzhokhar tsarnaev 's former best friend stephan silva says they were friends for several years , but that he only visited the dzhokhar tsarnaev house once to watch an episode of the walking dead on a computer from the top bunk of dzhokhar tsarnaev 's bunk - bed ( above ) strict older brother : silva told the court on tuesday that he had never met his elder brother tamerlan ( left ) and that dzhokhar tsarnaev ( right ) described him as ' very strict , very opinionated ' his former best friend silva , who federal prosecutors contend loaned tsarnaev the gun used in the shooting , testified in court on tuesday that he had long been close with the defendant but had never met his 26 - year - old brother , tamerlan , who died following a gunfight with police four days after the bombing
he said his brother was very strict , very opinionated , and that since i was n't a muslim he might give me a little s * * * for that , ' silva said
defense lawyers opened the trial at u.s. district court in boston with the blunt admission that dzhokhar tsarnaev had carried out the crimes he is charged with , focusing their hopes on the jury sentencing him to life in prison rather than the death penalty he could face if found guilty
they contend tamerlan was the driving force behind the attacks and that his younger sibling followed out of subservience
convict friends : friend of dzhokhar tsarnaev , silva ( left ) , testified at the boston bombing trial on tuesday about his ' strict ' older brother tamerlan
he is currently in jail on weapons and drug charges
dzhokhar tsarnaev and silva pictured on the right at their high school graduation prosecutors called silva , 21 , to the witness stand to discuss the loan of the rusty ruger p95 handgun they contend was used to shoot dead mit police officer sean collier on april 18 , 2013
silva has pleaded guilty to federal gun and drug charges , but was offered leniency in exchange for his testimony
he testified he had gotten the gun from a friend , intending to use it to protect his drug business , and also used it in a robbery
dzhokhar tsarnaev asked to borrow it , saying he too was interested in committing a robbery , silva testified
on loan : the gun was part of evidence shown in court on tuesday
friend of dzhokhar tsarnaev , silva , allegedly gave him the weapon which was used to kill mit officer sean collier ruined : this smashed - up iphone was found at the scene of a shootout between the dzhokhar tsarnaev brothers and police in the suburb of watertown on april 18 - a few days after the bombings in the most aggressive cross-examination by the defense in eight days of testimony , silva acknowledged having posted on facebook and having told the fbi that he believed the bombing must have been tamerlan 's idea
' at the time that 's what i felt , yes , ' silva said in response to questioning by defense attorney miriam conrad
he also acknowledged having told prosecutors in august he used ' peer pressure ' to persuade dzhokhar tsarnaev to smoke marijuana , which silva sold
' that 's what i said but i stated it wrong , ' silva said on tuesday

dzhokhar tsarnaev is an ethnic chechen whose family moved to the u.s. a decade before the attack
other than the ' kafir ' incident , silva said dzhokhar tsarnaev had rarely talked about religion
also on tuesday , the owner of the boat where dzhokhar tsarnaev hid after a gunfight with police recalled stepping into his backyard after a day - long lock down was lifted and finding a person in his watercraft
david henneberry described waking up the morning after a gunfight between the dzhokhar tsarnaev brothers and police rocked his suburban neighborhood and noticing something wrong about the winter covering of his boat , but presuming it had been blown around by the wind
he put off checking it until after authorities had lifted a shelter - in - place order on boston - area residents four days after the bombing , wbz reported
' i went to check on the boat and basically see why the strap was loose and i noticed a lot of blood , ' david henneberry said
' i just kept fixating on this blood and then , i just , my eyes looked at the other side of the boat and that 's when i saw a body in the boat ... i got off the ladder pretty quick and went in the house
' when prosecutors wrap up their case it will be the defense 's turn to call witnesses , who could include dzhokhar tsarnaev
after that , the jury will consider dzhokhar tsarnaev 's guilt
if he is found guilty , a second phase will play out that will focus on sentencing
the bombing killed restaurant manager krystle campbell , 29 , graduate student lingzi lu , 23 , and 8 - year - old martin richard
david henneberry said after he called 911 , bringing dozens of heavily armed police who fired scores of rounds into the boat where dzhokhar tsarnaev was discovered
the jury also saw two wooden slats from the boat into which a message had been carved which read : ' stop killing our innocent people and we will stop
' on cross-examination , mr david henneberry was asked by the defense if the blood and bullet holes in his boat were there before april 19
he confirmed that they were not
final words : inside the boat , dzhokhar tsarnaev wrote a series of notes , which the jury saw on monday
this note , punctured with bullets , explains how he is jealous of his brother tamerlan because he had died and gone to paradise the notes also denounced the u.s. for its wars in muslim countries
last week , the jury heard how all the bullets that made holes in the side of the boat were shot from outside the vessel as he hid inside investigators on a boat in watertown , massachusetts the day after dzhokhar tsarnaev was found hiding inside in april 2013
on monday , the jury in his death penalty trial visited the boat
