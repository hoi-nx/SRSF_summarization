dundee united manager jackie mcnamara pointed the finger of blame at ref thomson after paton was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1 - 1 draw with celtic in the scottish cup
paton was astonished to be shown a red card along with virgil van dijk after the dutchman and calum butcher clashed on the ground following a poor tackle by celtic captain brown on nadir â who appeared to kick brown âs head in retaliation
jackie mcnamara vowed to appeal in a bid to clear paton for next sunday âs league cup final against deila âs men at hampden , and it remains to be seen whether sfa compliance officer tony mcglennan will take retrospective action against calum butcher , nadir or brown , with tv pictures indicating they could all have seen red
dundee united manager jackie mcnamara was n't impressed with referee thomson 's performance paton was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1 - 1 draw with celtic but the dundee united boss claimed that , had the match official sent off brown for the initial challenge , the ensuing melee and embarrassing card blunder would have been avoided
â i think we will be appealing , â said jackie mcnamara , whose team were reduced to nine men in the second half when dixon was sent off for handling the ball in the box
â paton feels a bit hard done to for being sent off for nothing
he was nât even involved in the incident
but i think the ref should have dealt with the original bad challenge ( from brown ) that sparked the whole thing off
it was a two - footed challenge off the deck
it was a bad onebut it did nât get dealt with properly
â we should be talking about the football rather than the ugly scenes
but , for me , the officials should have dealt with it first and we would not have had the problems we had today
â asked if he expects brown to be hit with disciplinary action from the sfa , jackie mcnamara replied : â no comment
â nadir scored dundee united âs opener on the stroke of half time after connolly appeared to go down easily in the box , with celtic boss deila later insisting the player should be punished for diving
three minutes after the break , dundee united âs dixon was dismissed for blocking a goal - bound drive by griffiths but the striker âs penalty was saved by keeper radoslaw cierzniak
thomson ended up sending three players off , and dundee united will appeal the red card of paton griffiths had the last laugh , however , with a headed equaliser in the 71st minute to take the match to a replay at parkhead on march 18
nadir was lucky to still be on the park after kicking out at brown but jackie mcnamara claimed not to have seen the incident
â i need to see it
i have nât looked back at the tv footage
and when nadir gets tackled by brown , the ball breaks and calum butcher wins the challenge to put us through and i was looking at that next bit of play
i did not see what happened with virgil van dijk , calum butcher or anyone else
i actually did nât know the ref had got the wrong man until paton came over and told me
it was a melee but the ref did not deal with the original bad challenge which sparked it all off
â jackie mcnamara , whose side will now face celtic four times in march , also defended young striker connolly
â i do nât think he dived , â he said
â i think he ( anthony stokes ) has caught him although he has nât caught him on the leg
it might have been soft but it was a penalty
â jackie mcnamara had no complaints about the spot - kick award and red card when dixon handled a shot by griffiths
â rules are rules but rado made a great save
he did nât deserve to lose a goal today
but we switched off for one moment and griffiths peels off and scores a header
â we can take certain things from today âs game but celtic will be saying the same
cool heads will be needed for the final next week
the disciplinary side needs to be better
â it âs a chance for silverware and for the lads to create a bit of history
will i be sick of the sight of celtic by the end of our four games this month ? not if we beat them
