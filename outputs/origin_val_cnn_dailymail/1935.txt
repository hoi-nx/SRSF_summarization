as a schoolgirl , emma lavelle had twin passions â politics and horses
had she chosen to pursue the former , spring 2015 , with an election looming , could well have proved an important time in her life
but the woman who now runs a 70 - box stable in hampshire is hoping that , having favoured horses over hansard , the same period definitely turns out to be momentous when she saddles court by surprise , her first runner in the Â£ 1 million crabbie 's grand national on april 11
if the 10 - year - old wins , lavelle would be the third female trainer to win jump racing 's best known race this century following venetia williams , with mon mome in 2009 and sue smith , with auroras encore in 2013
emma lavelle poses with court by surprise , her first runner in the Â£ 1 million crabbie 's grand national and she would also be feted , along with her former jockey husband and assistant barry fenton , for executing a long - term precision plan
court has not run since november as lavelle patiently kept him fresh for the drier spring ground on which he excels
lavelle said : ' i did a lot of public speaking and debating at school
love her or hate her , she was a big presence
as a schoolgirl , lavelle had twin passions â politics and horses - now she is targeting the grand national ' she got me interested in politics
i am opinionated and i like talking
i am not so sure now because it is all so grey but at the time i would have been happy to go down that road
' lavelle 's communication skills with owners and staff have been essential after a devastating setback at the start of the season when she lost two of her best horses
timesremembered , who had finished sixth in the coral cup at the 2014 cheltenham festival , was killed in his first steeplechase , at aintree in october , and le bec , thought capable of contesting top - quality steeplechases , suffered a serious tendon injury at ascot a week later
court by surprise has not run since november as lavelle patiently kept him fresh for the drier spring ground lavelle said : ' it really hit us hard
it was like a football team losing their best two players at the start of the season
' it was hard to pick up and get going again
but you have to keep positive , keep going forward and take your team with you
' lavelle 's season has been rebuilt around grade two winner closing ceremony , much - improved parish business , exciting bumper winner see the world and , of course , court by surprise , who is owned by kempton chairman nick mustoe
lavelle 's decision to enter racing rather than politics was heavily influenced by the late balding court by surprise ridden by aidan coleman clears the last to win the best mate handicap steeple chase the grand national entry , who will be ridden at aintree by daryl jacob , won at exeter in october and was then awarded the badger beer chase at wincanton after finishing second to fast - improving unqualified entry , the young master
subsequent events tell us court by surprise faced handicapping everest that day
for saturday week , trainer and horse have that essential aintree ingredient â a good story to tell
lavelle 's decision to enter racing rather than politics was heavily influenced by working for the late balding , who won the aintree race twice
lavelle , who was first invited to spend a week with balding aged 11 when he trained a horse for her father , said : ' i was so lucky he let me be so involved
i was n't strong enough to carry the water bucket in the morning
i filled it and had to get someone to carry it back to the stable
when i look back i found it staggering that , even having ridden ponies , he let me ride racehorses
the grand national entry , who will be ridden at aintree by daryl jacob , won at exeter in october ' he was someone you could learn as much as you wanted to off
if you asked the questions , he would give you the answers
he was a big man who enveloped you in everything
' court by surprise , an overpriced 50 - 1 shot allotted 10st 3lb , has overcome two serious problems â a leg injury when falling on his point - to - point debut and an infected leg which kept him off the course for almost two years and could have ended his career
lavelle added : ' having missed the best part of two years , he has not had much racing but maybe it is a blessing in disguise ; he is so much stronger
now , he 's the best he 's ever been
