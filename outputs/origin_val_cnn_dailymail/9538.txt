a congressman from alaska is drawing criticism for suggesting gray wolves could help solve the homeless problem while addressing his colleagues at the capitol
alaska rep. young made the remark during a house natural resources committee hearing yesterday
young , 81 , was responding to a letter 79 members of congress sent to interior secretary jewell asking her to reconsider her agency 's 2011 decision to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list
some want it put back on the list alaska had 1,913 homeless resident in 2012 according to a homelessness research institute report young , a republican , supported the decision to delist gray wolves and does not want them to reacquire protected status
during young 's remarks to jewell , he called the gray wolf a ' predator ' that is ' killing the cloven - hoof animals ' , according to alaska public radio
he said : ' we 've got 79 congressmen sending you a letter
' have nât got a damn wolf in their whole district
' i âd like to introduce them in your district
' i introduce them in your district , you would nât have a homeless problem anymore
' hunting wolves is allowed in alaska
young said a healthy wolf population would ' wreak havoc and place anything in their reach in great jeopardy ' after young 's remark generated backlash and requests for clarification , he released a statement
young said his comment was an ' analogy ' that was ' intended to be hyperbolic in nature ' to help highlight that wolves pose a serious problem to communities in his state
he wrote : ' anyone who âs dealt with a healthy , roaming wolf population , as we have in alaska , understands that these predators have a detrimental impact on wildlife populations
' if you misunderstood my comments , just imagine the impact a healthy wolf population would have on your own town , community , or congressional district
' it would wreak havoc and place anything in their reach in great jeopardy
' there are an estimated 7,000 to 11,200 gray wolves in alaska , according to defenders of wildlife
alaska had 1,913 homeless residents in 2012 according to a homelessness research institute report .
