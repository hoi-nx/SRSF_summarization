lurking off the coast of scotland are swarms of stunning jellyfish - from the common moon to the rare purple striped stinger and the tiny neoturris pileata
and divers matt doggett and richard shucksmith have captured these floating beauties in exquisite detail
the images include a number of bright and colourful jellyfish that are rarely spotted so close to the uk , as well as so - called sea squirts which have been seen in abundance in recent years
the colourful mauve stingers ( pictured ) have tentacles that can grow around 13ft - long ( four metre ) and these eight tentacles are dangerous for unprotected divers.the species is also known as pelagia noctiluca which means ' open ocean night light ' in latin the images are from a collection called earth in focus and were captured off the coast of scotland around the outlying islands of north rona and sula sgeir , some 85 miles ( 136km ) west of stromness , as well as in loch duich
the divers said the further they headed offshore , the more bizarre and rare these lifeforms became and mr matt doggett , 36 from southampton , said a particular highlight was the mauve stinger
also known as the purple striped stinger , this species is native to warmer waters around the mediterranean , bermuda and deeper waters of the atlantic

they can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges , like a lion 's mane , which gives the species its name

mr matt doggett , 36 from southampton , said a highlight was the mauve stinger , also known as the purple striped stinger ( pictured )
it is native to warmer waters around bermuda and is a rare visitor to the uk the images are from a collection called earth in focus
the divers captured various species of jellyfish including so - called mild stingers that grow around 4 inches ( 10cm ) in diameter
these stingers have multiple radial canals that connect the centre to the edge of the flat bell also known as the purple striped stinger , this species is native to warmer waters around the mediterranean , bermuda and deeper waters of the atlantic
it is a rare visitor to the uk but has been known to travel to the western coast of the british isles and many experts believe the movement is linked to global warming

mr matt doggett said : ' despite all the dive gear , you still have to be careful not to get a stinging tentacle in the face so you do approach them with care
' some tentacles can be several metres long and could sting you before you see the jellyfish
' so we always took care to look around carefully and point them out to each other
' it was interesting to see young fish taking shelter in the tentacles of the lion 's mane and mauve stinger jellies which they use to stay safe from predators

they can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges , like a lion 's mane , which gives the species its name
like other jellies , the lion 's mane jellyfish reproduces asexually until it reaches full maturity at which point it reproduces sexually
the largest of these jellies have been recorded up to 120ft long ( 36.5 metres ) and with more than 800 tentacles divided into eight groups
while the smallest of the species measure just half an inch ( 1.3 cm ) in diameter and are 8 ft long ( 2.4 metres )
while diving in loch duich mr matt doggett spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish ( shown )
moon jellyfish are also known as aurelia aurita and grow up to 40cm ( 15.7 inches ) in diameter
they are recognisable by their patterns of spots and streaks and swim horizontally , keeping the bell near the surface at all times
this allows the tentacles to be spread over the largest possible area , in order to better catch food the left - hand image shows a close - up of a species known as neoturris pileata
they grow around 1.5 inches long ( 4cm ) and can have up to 90 tentacles
there are more than 350 different types of jellyfish and some 2,000 variations within these species
despite their reputation , many are harmless
the right - hand image was captured around 85 miles ( 136km ) west of stromness this image shows mr matt doggett capturing the previous close - up image of neoturris pileata
the tiny swimmers typically first appear in the northern north sea , off the norwegian coast and around kattegat and skagerrak in may
they can still be spotted as late as september they are typically found in the waters of the arctic , atlantic and northern pacific
while diving in loch duich , mr matt doggett spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish
moon jellyfish are also known as aurelia aurita or saucer jellies and grow up to 40cm ( 15.7 inches ) in diameter
they are recognisable by their patterns of spots and streaks and swim horizontally , keeping the bell near the surface at all times
this allows the tentacles to spread over the largest possible area and increase the chances of catching prey

mr matt doggett said that distance of the outlying islands from the mainland ' and their exposure to atlantic storms and swell makes their wildlife both spectacular but also hard to reach
if the weather gods are on your side and the opportunity exists , these sites will have any diver in awe of the beauty within our seas ' mr matt doggett said : ' the million moon jellies in loch duich were incredible and we returned the following day to photograph them and swim amongst them
as they do not sting it was a very relaxing , calming and enjoyable dive
' jellyfish are beautiful creatures both in colour and form and it was wonderful to have the opportunity to take time to show them looking at their finest
' the photographers also captured images of sea squirts , a type of filter feeder that lives on the ocean floor
there are more than 3,000 known species worldwide but many are found in warmer , tropical waters
they are protected by a thin membrane and are typically cylindrical
in addition to the common bell - shaped jellies , smaller species include what 's known as comb jellies or ctenophores ( pictured )
they get their name from tiny hairs called cilia that line their bodies and resemble combs
there are eight rows of combs that act like oars to help them swim the photographers also captured images of sea squirts ( pictured ) , a type of filter feeder that lives on the ocean floor
