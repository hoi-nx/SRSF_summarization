the need to anoint messi the greatest player there has ever been every time he has a good game is becoming rather tedious
yes , messi is a genius
every time i see him play live , it is a privilege
i try to make sure the memories are burned into my consciousness
he is the kind of player who lifts the spirit with everything he does
he is a quite prodigious goalscorer , a wizard of a dribbler and a provider for others
and yes , he was mesmerising against manchester city at the nou camp on wednesday night
the way he nutmegged james milner , the way he turned bacary sagna before joe hart saved from him at point - blank range , the caressed curling ball to ivan rakitic for the barcelona winner
it is normal for people to want to believe that what they are witnessing has never been matched before
â everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home , â said arsene wenger once , and now everybody believes there has never been a footballer as pretty as messi
messi showcases his magnificent ball control with an audacious nutmeg of james milner messi renders bacary sagna to the status of an open - mouthed ball - watcher during another masterclass messi awaits the ball as he inspired the catalan club to reach another champions leauge last eight messi forces his way past aleksandar kolarov and fernandinho during barcelona 's cruise against manchester city what saddens me about the relentless championing of messi , though , is that the idea there has never been anyone to match him has become such an aggressive orthodoxy
any dissent is met with untrammelled scorn and dismissive disbelief
it is as though messi has become a god and the idea that he might have a rival is sacrilege
as a football fan , i worship messi , too , but i do nât think he âs the best there âs ever been
it âs too early for that
he âs only 27 but he has not yet achieved what many of the other greats of the game achieved , either for club or country
a graphic circulated on social media recently that showed all the records messi had broken
la liga top goal - scorer , barcelona top goalscorer , european cup top goalscorer
but individual stats are not everything
sport , ultimately , is about winning things
if you are a great individual player , there is a wider test of greatness in inspiring your team to win trophies
in the argument about football âs best ever , messi is vulnerable here
pele , for instance , scored 1,000 goals in his career
but the test of his greatness was that he won the world cup three times with brazil
three times over a 12 - year span
it might have been four if he had not been hacked out of the 1966 tournament
messi has never been able to lift argentina to a world cup victory as diego maradona , another rival for the â best ever â , did in 1986
at last year âs tournament in brazil , where argentina made the final , messi produced some wonderful moments but he was not even his team âs best player
javier mascherano and angel di maria shared that honour
pele is hoisted aloft after winning his third world cup in 1970 with that peerless brazil side diego maradona lifted argentina to their second world cup in eight years with his tour de force in mexico messi reached the world cup final with argentina but was unable to grab the game by the scruff of the neck messi and pep guardiola embrace after winning the european cup in rome against manchester united messi âs zealous champions point out , with some justification , that international football is not as prestigious or as important as it was a few decades ago
that ignores the fact that most players would still consider winning the world cup the pinnacle of their careers
but it is true that the club game has risen in influence and players â priorities have changed
messi is vulnerable in this regard , too , though
he has played for barcelona , the team almost universally regarded as the outstanding side of the last decade and yet , remind me , how many european cup titles has he won ? that âs right
the european cup is now seen as the ultimate test of a player âs greatness and messi has only won it twice
it is still a fantastic achievement but it seems like an anomaly for someone who is supposed to be the best ever , especially when you consider the achievements of others
paolo maldini won it five times , raul won it three times , clarence seedorf won it four times with three different clubs
in its incarnation as the european cup , other greats like franz beckenbauer and johan cruyff won it three times
ferenc puskas and alfredo di stefano , two more players that some old fuddy - duddies think were the best they ever saw , won the european cup eight times between them

but if i had to single out the most beautiful thing i have seen in the game , it would be brazil âs fourth goal in the 1970 world cup final
in particular , it would be pele âs part in it
the way he stops the ball from jairzinho , waits and then strokes it into the path of carlos alberto
it was the stunning simplicity of it
it epitomised the way a man who was also a genius was ready to subvert himself to the team ethic
pele âs the best for me but i wo nât pour scorn on you if you stick with messi
just remember that in the same way english football did actually exist before the premier league , great players populated our game long before messi walked this earth
red bull should stop moaning and build a better car when mclaren won 15 of the 16 races in the 1988 f1 season , i do nât remember williams bleating about how unfair it was
i do nât remember williams demanding instant redress when prost won the first race for mclaren at jacarepaguã¡ in brazil
i do nât remember williams saying that because mclaren âs mclaren honda engine was so powerful , it should be hobbled in some way
i do nât remember him demanding that the fia do something about it because he had nât done as good a job as mclaren had
the preponderant mclaren team celebrate ayrton senna 's title in 1988 after an utterly dominant season williams was always a bit of a stoic like that
he usually worked on the basis that he did nât get mad , he got even
how outdated that kind of attitude seems in the sport now after red bull âs astonishing reaction to hamilton âs victory for mercedes at the australia grand prix in melbourne last weekend
we have grown used to premier league managers throwing their toys out of their prams after a defeat , but what happened in australia really was a spectacular tantrum
red bull team principal christian horner is an intelligent man but his suggestion that the mercedes â engine should be â equalised â in some way did him few favours
and the threat of red bull owner dietrich mateschitz that he might quit the sport was laughably petulant
this is a team , do nât forget , who exerted their own stranglehold on f1 for four years
they won 13 of 19 races two seasons ago
christian horner ( left ) and dietrich mateschitz were not so stony - faced when red bull were won every race now they have discovered they do not have a monopoly on winning , they want to walk away
the days of prost and ayrton senna sweeping all before them are a distant memory
so good luck to mercedes
they have done a brilliant job and now they are reaping the rewards
good luck to hamilton , too
f1 has always been about the battle to get in the best car and after years of watching sebastian vettel winning in the red bull , now it âs hamilton âs turn
i âm with mercedes boss toto wolff on this one
the others should stop moaning and try to get better
generally , that âs supposed to be what sport is about
rory mcilroy is the face of golf now but the sport in the us still has a little work to do when it comes to name recognition
as rory mcilroy and his group walked up the 18th fairway at the arnold palmer invitational on thursday afternoon , the officials put his name up on a board on the far side of the green
rory mcilroy 's name wreaked havoc with the scoreboard operators at the arnold palmer invitational first , it read â mcelroy â
after a couple of minutes , they realised the mistake
there was a hasty rearrangement of letters until it read â mcllroy â
they got it right the third time and the crowd in the stand overlooking the green serenaded them with ironic cheers .
