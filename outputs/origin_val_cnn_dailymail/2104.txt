rival fire brigades who turned up to tackle the same blaze started fighting over who should put it out - before police turned up and joined in the brawl
the conflict unfolded when firemen from mexico 's heroic fire and ceda fire were dispatched to deal with the brush fire in the capital mexico city
but tempers frayed when both sides disagreed over who should deal with the situation and a fight broke out
' and then the police arrived
' but rather than calming the situation down , the appearance of the officers seemed to fuel the conflict and the firemen quickly turned on the police
matos said : ' it was really bizarre
flash point : officers were brought in to ease tensions , but had to defend themselves after being attacked by fire fighters ' the police were trying to separate the two groups when they came under attack from the firemen who started punching them , and then more policemen who turned up to stop the fighting were also attacked
' it was like something out of a very bad comedy
' now furious city officials have demanded an explanation
a spokesman for the council said : ' this was appalling behaviour from those we employ to safeguard the city
' instead of behaving like public officials they behaved like children in a playground
' an investigation is underway and we will not stop until we have got to the bottom of what went on
' meanwhile both fire brigades have blamed each other for the fracas and the attack on police
a police spokesman said : ' we are assisting the city in their investigation
