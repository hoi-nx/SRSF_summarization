boris nemtsov , the russia opposition leader slain friday night a stone 's throw from the kremlin , was a true original , one of the towering figures of his country 's post-communist political odyssey
we do not know yet who it was who shot him four times in the back
various theories have been floated
but by far the most plausible is that his killers wanted to silence one of the most determined and courageous russia campaigners for personal and political freedoms
whether boris nemtsov offended by attacking the authoritarianism of putin 's regime , the jingoistic imperialism of his ukrainian campaign or even the massacre of journalists at charlie hebdo , it comes to the same thing in the end : he stood up consistently for the values of the western enlightenment against its motley army of enemies
born in the black sea resort of sochi , boris nemtsov began as an atomic physicist but rose to prominence in the early 1990s as the reformist governor of nizhny novgorod province
president yeltsin took a liking to him and brought him to moscow
" what a stubborn nature , " he wrote of boris nemtsov
" reminds me of myself
" boris nemtsov was the first person yeltsin anointed as his political successor
( unfortunately , he was not the last
) after putin 's election in 2000 , boris nemtsov hoped at first that the new president would keep his promise to restore order while preserving democracy
soon disillusioned , boris nemtsov became one of putin 's most biting critics
he was a natural politician -- emotional , gregarious , articulate
like yeltsin -- but unlike putin -- he enjoyed meeting ordinary people and was energized by electoral campaigns
some snickered at boris nemtsov 's extravagant personality , his hints of bravado and weakness for the fairer sex
but his determination and talent commanded respect
yet it is also true that , by the mid- 2000s , boris nemtsov was widely viewed as a spent force
and when the levada center polled russia in 2013 , 6 % approved of his actions , while 48 % disapproved and 46 % claimed to know nothing about him
along with all other russia liberals of the 1990s , he failed to forge a connection to the discontented groups outside moscow
he titled his first book of memoirs , " the provincial , " but to true provincials he looked like the elite
as one analyst told me , when boris nemtsov turned up at far - flung rallies in a sparkling , immaculately ironed , white shirt , it symbolized the class divide between him and his audience
by the wave of protests in 2011 - 12 , his generation 's day had passed
the new activists in their 30s and 40s had a different sensibility , a new cadence of speech to fit the internet age
on the stage before the anti-putin demonstrators , boris nemtsov often bombed
" khvatit ! " he said , in his last interview , when the host tried to tease out of him a confession of presidential ambitions
" enough already ! " but the dwindling appeal of western - style liberalism did not stop him
boris nemtsov 's doggedness during the last decade -- plugging away despite public indifference or scorn -- makes it the most impressive chapter of his career
having been chauffeured to his government office in the 1990s , boris nemtsov marched in the rain among bedraggled crowds in the 2000s as police wheeled out noise - making machinery to drown out the sound of his bullhorn
he endured the eggs and ammonia hurled at him by pro-kremlin hooligans
not shrinking from arrest , he spent more than a few nights in holding cells
even as the boyish charmer turned into a graying baby boomer with reading glasses that slipped down his nose , boris nemtsov refused to slacken
shut out of national politics , he ran for mayor of sochi -- and got 13.6 % of the vote
( even had the election been fair , he would probably have lost
) undeterred , he won a seat as deputy in the yaroslavl regional council
swallowing his pride , he battled on because he cared about russia and because , well ... politics was what he did
the killing comes at a time when the kremlin is clearly nervous
with the ruble and growth rate both plunging , glimmers of opposition have already appeared in unexpected corners
five deputies in the usually subservient duma have tabled a bill to repeal the sanctions putin slapped on european food imports , calling them unconstitutional
if the economic slide continues , putin 's high ratings are likely to fall
in undemocratic states , the killing of a major opposition figure is sometimes the spark that lights the fuse
in the philippines , after ferdinand marcos ' military thugs shot benigno aquino on the tarmac at the manila airport , this set off the " people 's power " movement that eventually swept the dictator from office
the murder of orlando letelier by augusto pinochet 's agents helped to discredit the chilean leader
and yet russia is in a poisonous state of division
the country 's westernized fringe may be galvanized into opposition
but as war fever bleeds into economic anxiety , a pervasive resentment and directionless aggression seem more likely in the short run than a united uprising for civil and political rights
meanwhile , the wait for answers continues
the attack took place in an area saturated with video cameras
within hours , one television station was showing footage of the killing -- albeit from a considerable distance
boris nemtsov was almost certainly under surveillance at the time
if the kremlin did not know before , it very likely knows by now who the killer was
its next decision will be how to use the information for its own purposes
whether or not the actual perpetrators are caught and punished , all know who created the climate of hatred in which liberal politicians are likened to " jackals who hang around foreign embassies " and a " fifth column " of traitors
boris nemtsov in his later years was never a threat to putin 's regime
hardly a radical revolutionary , he cooperated with the authorities to avoid violence by moving the site of the first major moscow demonstration in december 2011 , and he participated in discussions with then - president dmitry medvedev about reforms of the political system
having come to symbolize for most russia the disorder of the 1990s , he had little chance of rising to the top again
indeed , he was the kind of liberal -- unbowed , unabashedly pro-western , unpopular -- whom the kremlin loved to hate
now it will have to find somebody else .
