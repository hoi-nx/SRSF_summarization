a ukip parliamentary candidate has been replaced after he called for obama to be kidnapped
jeremy zeid , who was standing in hendon , said the president should be treated in the same way as a nazi war criminal after the american declassified documents about israelis âs nuclear capability
he wrote on facebook : â once obama is out of office , the israelis should move to extradite the b * * * * * d or â do an adolf eichmann â on him , and lock him up for leaking state secrets
after all what 's sauce for the pollard goose is sauce for the obama gander , do n't you think ? â jeremy zeid said the israelis should kidnap the american president - pictured in boston , massachusetts yesterday - once he was out of office in response to a comment , he added : â nah , just kidnap the bugger , like they did to adolf eichmann , who suddenly found that he 'd woken up in israelis
â the problem is that israelis jails are far more humane and adherent to human rights than american ones
â mr jeremy zeid was referring to adolf eichmann , a nazi ss officer who played a major role in the holocaust
after the second world war he fled to argentina , but was kidnapped by israelis security services and put on trial in israelis before being executed in 1962
ukip today announced that raymond shamash , an nhs surgeon , would instead be standing in the seat
mr jeremy zeid wrote a further post on facebook complaining that whoever had made his comments public a â squealer â and â vermin â
mr jeremy zeid said he stood by his comments and likened himself to the french cartoonists massacred in paris last year
he said : ' remember that phrase â je suis charlie â ? well , freedom of speech
' [ president obama ] wants to do a deal with iran - which wants to wipe israelis out , to see the jewish gone to dust
left - wing jewish people do not want to deal with it
' ukip parliamentary candidate jeremy zeid ( left ) called for obama to be kidnapped by the israelis like nazi war criminal adolf eichmann he told the jewish chronicle that he was quitting as candidate for hendon
he said : ' i am done with politics because people focus on the minutiae
' a ukip spokesman said yesterday : ' jeremy zeid resigned as a candidate last week , citing his health
' last year , in a string of tweets , mr jeremy zeid caused a stir by saying : ' the almost absence of white faces in ilford is worrying
' he went on to attack labour mp for ilford south , mike gapes , accusing him of being ' either blind to or deliberately complicit in the ethnic cleansing of ilford which i âm sure will be called " racist "
