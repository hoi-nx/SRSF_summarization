west brom boss tony pulis is keeping his cards close to his chest in terms of his goalkeeper selection for saturday 's fa cup quarter - final at aston villa
the premier league derby between the two clubs at villa park on tuesday ended in a 2 - 1 victory for the hosts after a stoppage - time error from ben foster saw the west brom and england shot - stopper give away a penalty that was converted by christian benteke
tony pulis spoke up for ben foster - who has kept six clean sheets in all competitions since the welshman took over at west brom - after the game
ben foster is not guaranteed to keep his place against aston villa in the fa cup quarter - finals ben foster brought down matthew lowton to concede a penalty against aston villa in premier league clash on tuesday christian benteke scored from the spot to give their midlands rivals a late victory at villa park and while refusing to say outright whether or not the 31 - year - old would keep his place at the weekend , the head coach once again had praise for ben foster at his press conference on thursday to preview the cup tie
asked about his goalkeeper selection for saturday 's game , tony pulis said : ' i 'll be telling the goalkeepers first before i tell you ! ' boaz myhill has had an injury with a finger , which we have to take into account
' with the number of clean sheets he has kept ( 12 overall this season ) , ben foster has been absolutely fantastic
goalkeepers get highlighted , like referees , because it can cost you games
' west brom boss tony pulis has backed his no 1 without confirming ben foster will keep his place on saturday berahino celebrates while being chased by his team - mates , after netting his 18th goal of the season with regard to referees , another notable incident from the latter stages of tuesday 's game saw aston villa defender hutton make a nasty - looking challenge on west brom striker berahino and the pair square up to each other before each being booked
it appeared hutton was lucky not to have been sent off by referee jonathan moss
and while tony pulis was keen on thursday to avoid hitting out at the official for not doing so , he did once again express his desire for there to be a referral system for managers during games where they get ' two calls ' each , something he has spoken about in the past
' i 've seen the challenge back , ' said tony pulis
hutton appeared to raise his studs into berahino 's leg during aston villa 's win over west brom berahino goes down in pain on the touchline following hutton 's nasty challenge on tuesday hutton and berahino squared up after the challenge ( left ) and were both booked by referee jonathan moss ' i thought jon managed the game pretty well , and there are enough people at the moment criticising referees and looking to blame them
' jon did n't cost us the game on tuesday , we cost ourselves the game
' people make good decisions and bad decisions and you have to accept it - but i 'm sure he 'll look back at it and maybe will analyse it differently to how he did on the night
' he then added : ' i would have two calls during a game , where managers can call things back
' you could put advertising on the big screens ( at the same time ) - the clubs could make some money from it
tony pulis has labelled the alleged spitting incident involving jonny evans ( left ) and papiss cisse as ' disgusting ' ' and it gives a chance to the officials to get right decisions that could be big
they , fifa and uefa , have to accept that referees do make mistakes
' tony pulis also made his feelings clear about spitting following wednesday night 's incident involving manchester united defender jonny evans and newcastle striker papiss cisse
' it is disgusting and disgraceful , ' tony pulis said
' spitting should never be anywhere near our game
it should be dealt with
' tony pulis , while mindful of his side 's ongoing league battle to avoid relegation , says he will try to put his ' strongest team ' out on saturday
stephane sessegnon ( right ) will be given time to cope with ' personal problems ' before returning to the team forward victor anichebe ( groin ) remains unavailable , and winger callum mcmanaman is a doubt due to a foot injury
tony pulis has also said west brom ' have to go careful ' with stephane sessegnon due to the forward 's ' personal problems ' - understood to be a family bereavement - and that there are a few ' knocks and niggles ' to deal with
berahino and fellow frontman brown ideye have both been playing recently with pain - killing injections .
