only 16 - year - old joe still lives at home , while katie , 26 , lives with her husband and two children in a converted barn on the 28 - acre estate
he said : ' the house is very special to us and it will be a real wrench for us to leave
we began refurbishing the home in 2000 and finally finished it in 2007
' it was a real labour of love and no expense was spared
i especially love our home pub with a fully stocked bar
it âs really unique and we âve had some great parties there
' when he bought hammer hill house in 2004 , mr steve smith set about doubling the property in size , turning the quaint country house into a sprawling estate
the property listing boasts of the space afforded by the 28 - acre estate country life magazine once mooted as a possible base for the duke and duchess of cambridge
mr steve smith added : ' we 've had the place for 11 - 12 years and i suppose i like projects , i get itchy feet and want to build something else
' i 'm looking for a site where i can create my own house and build the kids ' houses
so i 'm looking for a plot of land where i can build four houses and keep the family together
' we 've reduced the price because at that level the stamp duty is pretty high , so at that price i 've more or less knocked the stamp duty off it
' advertised on his own website estatesdirect.com , the listing reads : ' the house is approached through magnificent wrought iron electric gates opening to a sweeping tree lined driveway to the turning circle to the front of the house and into the walled coach yard to one side
' the gardens and grounds are beautifully landscaped and maintained with sweeping lawns , glasshouses , stocked borders and hidden pathways through wooded vistas
' the house has extensive grazing land with four paddocks partially surrounded by mature woodland
' mr steve smith founded the cut - price discount store poundland in 1990 before selling it a decade later for Â£ 50million
the property listing boasts the ' sweeping walnut staircase ' ( pictured ) leads to a ' galleried landing ' mr steve smith bought the property a decade ago for Â£ 2.2million but with only one of his children left at home , wants to move on earlier this week the budget chain made headlines when the asa ruled that it must drop its claim that everything costs Â£ 1 because it sells cds and dvds for Â£ 2
it was a major blow for the company which has built an empire on the boast that just Â£ 1 can buy anything in its stores
the decision even calls into question whether the budget chain can legitimately continue to call itself â poundland â
before the advertising watchdog âs ruling , poundland 's website boasted : â everything for Â£ 1 was the idea of our founders in 1990 and we âre still true to that vision today
â under a heading â our values â , it added : â we âve grown to be the largest single price value retailer in the uk ... we are very proud to offer you a single Â£ 1 price , that has nât changed since we opened our first store
â however , people complained to the asa that these claims were no longer accurate because it was stocking dvds of blockbuster films in a concession partnership with another firm for Â£ 2 each
poundland defended the breaking of its normal Â£ 1 price barrier saying the Â£ 2 items were part of a special promotion run at the tills and sold to customers providing they met a minimum spending threshold
