a federal judge has ordered the u.s. military to release photographs of detainees being abused in iraq and afghanistan u.s. district judge hellerstein 's ruling on friday gives the government , which has fought the case for over a decade , two months to decide whether to appeal before the photos could be released
the aclu has been seeking to make them public in the name of holding government accountable
the fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in iraq and afghanistan , and it invokes the images of abuse at the abu ghraib prison in iraq that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006
this image shows an unidentified detainee standing on a box with a bag on his head and wires attached to him at the abu ghraib prison in baghdad
a federal judge has ordered that more pictures of inmate abuse must be shared by the u.s. military ' to allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone , somewhere , to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents ' misconduct , ' said jameel jaffer , aclu deputy legal director
' giving the government that kind of censorial power would have implications far beyond this specific context
' the defense department is studying the ruling and will make any further responses in court , spokesman lt. col. myles caggins iii said
early in the 2004 lawsuit , the aclu pointed to the abu ghraib prison photos as priority examples of records the organization was seeking on the treatment of detainees
it 's unclear how many more photographs may exist
the government has said it has 29 relevant pictures from at least seven different sites in afghanistan and iraq , and it 's believed to have perhaps hundreds or thousands more , hellerstein said in a ruling in august
he said some photos he had seen ' are relatively innocuous while others need more serious consideration , ' and he has ruled that any images that would be released would be redacted to protect the identities of people in them
some photographs , taken by service members in iraq and afghanistan , were part of criminal investigations of alleged abuse
some images show ' soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees , ' then - solicitor general â now supreme court justice â elena kagan wrote in an appeal to the high court earlier in the case , which has taken a long road through the courts and congress
the fight over the photographs reaches back to the early years of the wars in iraq and afghanistan , and it invokes the images of abuse at the abu ghraib prison in iraq ( inside pictured ) that sparked international outrage after they emerged in 2004 and 2006 the government has long argued that releasing the photographs could incite attacks against u.s. forces and government personnel abroad , and officials have said that risk has n't abated as the u.s. military role in iraq and afghanistan lessened
indeed , ' the danger associated with release of these photographs is heightened now , ' amid the rise of the islamic state militant group , navy rear adm. sinclair harris , the vice director for operations for the joint chiefs of staff , said in a december court filing
islamic state , he said ' would use these photographs to further encourage its supporters and followers to attack u.s. military and government personnel
' amid the lawsuit , congress passed a 2009 law allowing the government to keep the photos secret if the secretary of defense certified that unveiling them would endanger u.s. citizens or government or military personnel
defense secretaries have since done so , but hellerstein said the government has n't been specific enough .
