the 15 - year - old washington boy charged who was charged with trying to kidnap a toddler was linked to a similar incident nine months ago
the unnamed teenager , who will be tried in juvenile court for the attempted abduction of 22 - month old owen wright a week ago , was also accused of trying to lure a child last june
he does not have a criminal history , and has pleaded not guilty to second degree kidnapping after being caught on video attempting to run off with a child in broad daylight while wearing a fake mustache and glasses
attorneys decided not to file charges in that case because ' it did not meet the elements of luring , ' according to mr barkdull

mr barkdull said he stood by the decision not to pursue the previous incident in sprague , a farm town of around 500 people located about 40 miles west of spokane along interstate 90
prior to the boy 's arrest , the man captured on video was identified as a 30 - year - old man
however , two brave teens who helped thwart the kidnapping by running after the abductor later recognized the suspect as their disguised school classmate
