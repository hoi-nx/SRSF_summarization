' it is not only singh who thinks like this
' singh was one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the physiotherapy student , who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in december 2012
once inside , bus driver singh , his brother ram , gym instructor vinay sharma , 20 , bus cleaner akshay thakur , 28 , fruit - seller pawan gupta , 19 , and an unnamed teenager launched the attack

they penetrated her with a rod , leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death
she died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen , genitals and intestines
her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape
many in the country still believe that women are subservient - illustrated by convict singh , who told the documentary his victim would still be alive if she had not objected
' when being raped , she should n't fight back , ' he said
' she should just be silent and allow the rape ... then they 'd have dropped her off after ' doing her ' , and only hit [ her friend ] the boy
' he claimed ' you ca n't clap with one hand - it takes two ' and insisted : ' a decent girl wo n't roam around at 9 o'clock at night
' a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy
boy and girl are not equal
' housework and housekeeping is for girls , not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things , wearing wrong clothes
about 20 per cent of girls are good
