it was only fitting that a former hearts man should help to finally send the championship title to tynecastle
after all , this entire season deserves to be coloured maroon
yet it was not only a favour to his first love that lee wallace performed at easter road
in scoring the crucial , confidence - building opening goal for rangers , he also delivered an immensely valuable prize to his current employers
for the ibrox side , games against hibs this term have been akin to a sadistically extended form of torture
three successive defeats had delivered a crushing 9 - 1 aggregate
one more on sunday and it was an historic clean sweep
it would also have delayed hearts â inevitable coronation for at least another six days

freed to attack almost at will in a new 3 - 5 - 2 formation set up by mccall , he delivered a barnstorming display on the left flank
after speaking so openly on friday about how this had been a season of professional and personal torment , here was an emphatic reminder of just how forceful a player he can be
others in blue followed his lead
kenny miller scored a highly controversial clincher ten minutes from the end â when refereeing headline - magnet collum ignored hibs â claims for a foul by lee wallace â but , in truth , this was a victory that had foundations laid long before kick - off
so often in recent times , rangers fans have lamented the perceived lack of tactical thinking from those resident in the technical area
mccall , though , turned up in leith and did a number on hibs to secure the first triumph of his three - match reign
it did not go unnoticed
kenny miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for rangers and close the gap on hibs â mccall âs blue - and - white army â was the chant from the visiting support as the minutes ticked down
mccall âs hopes of remaining in situ beyond the end of the season may well hinge on winning promotion
if that is to become a reality , then he will need many more days like this one
overall , this was just a second win in 10 games for rangers but it lifted them to within three points of their hosts , with a game in hand
they now have renewed hope of finishing second and reducing their play - off schedule in the fight to follow hearts up
hibs â 15 - match unbeaten run is at an end but stubbs is adamant this will not derail the momentum they have steadily built since the turn of the year
building momentum is now mccall âs ( pictured ) aim â after he recognised something different had to be attempted against hibs if rangers were not to face the inevitably of yet another defeat
his ploy was to move to three centre - backs , with zaliukas and mohsni flanking captain lee mcculloch
it was hardly a trio to inspire confidence in the visiting support , given their ropey individual performances this term , yet the hope was that weight of numbers would help stifle the hosts in central areas and allow mcgregor and lee wallace to advance as wing - backs
it worked , and contributed to a fractured opening period in which clear sights of goal were at a premium
lee wallace slams home the opener just before half - time to put the away side in control at easter road the easter road side had the first , thanks to a majestic , deep cross hit with pace and accuracy from the left flank by dylan mcgeouch
liam fontaine had remained upfield from an earlier free - kick but could nât cash in on that gamble as he powered a header wide of target
that was , though , as good as it got for hibs in the first half as they encountered a rangers line - up displaying a renewed level of organisation
that such a trait was noticeable says much about what went before
it was nât bringing about a huge amount in the way of free - flowing entertainment but this at least now looked more like a toe - to - toe contest between well - matched opponents
law set up dean shiels â back on his old stomping ground â to slice one over the top from the fringe of the penalty area
then gray was caught out as rangers broke forward and was forced to haul down lee wallace around 25 yards out
collum punished him with a yellow card before law stepped up to whip the resultant free - kick a couple of feet too high
a couple of set - piece exchanges then caused flickers of threat at either end
it would , though , be the visitors who took the lead two minutes ahead of the interval via a goal made possible by mccall âs rejig
the move started at the feet of the oft - mocked mohsni , who had the presence of mind to spot that gray was out of position
a long , raking pass found clark scampering into the space he had left behind
clark stepped on the brakes to switch to his right foot and sling a cross along the six - yard line
kenny miller could nât connect with a little attempted back - flick before mcgregor was denied by a terrific blocking challenge from lewis stevenson
the ball broke loose and lee wallace , who had stormed into the area to support his fellow wing - back , managed to scoop a shot high into the net despite desperate attempts to close him down
kenny miller celebrates his goal with the fans during his side 's win it was the first time rangers had taken the lead against hibs on championship duty and only the second goal they had managed during 313 minutes of this fixture
the question was whether they could hold onto the advantage they had finally gained
stubbs sought to fix one fault in his set - up when he replaced the injured gray , who had endured a pretty difficult first half , with keith watson
yet the pattern of play remained similar after the restart
it was tense , often scrappy , and with the ibrox side winning marginally more of the numerous little battles
the game found fresh impetus after the hour - mark , however , as each side let slip a prime opportunity
it was rangers up first , with mohnsi feeding kenny miller , whose angled ball set up clark
he could nât sort out his feet quick enough , allowing hanlon to block the strike
seconds later , franck dja djedje found himself clear in the inside - right channel after the visiting defence was caught out
the angled shot was on , but dja djedje tried to square for sidekick dominique malonga and zaliukas intercepted
at last , there was a stretched , open look to the game
clark was denied space to finish at the near post after another surging run from lee wallace
hibs looked to press back but saw their hopes extinguished in rancorous fashion
lee wallace looked to play a one - two with kenny miller , but it seemed hanlon had beaten him to the return pass before they collided
the centre - back crashed to the deck claiming a foul , before easter road erupted in astonished fury as collum waved play on
the rest of the home defence seemed to freeze , expecting the free - kick , but kenny miller was unperturbed as he gathered possession before cracking a shot past mark oxley .
