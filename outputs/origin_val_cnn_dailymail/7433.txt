the insignia on mayweather 's baseball cap reads tbe but whether or not he can enhance his claim to be the best ever boxer by beating pacquiao , he already holds the title of world 's greatest self - promoting athlete
not only will may 2 in las vegas be the most gigantic happening in the annals of human kind â or something like that â but even admission tickets for the official announcement which is about to take place are like gold - dust
floyd the money versus pacquiao the pacquiao will be formally launched with more fireworks than a nasa moon rocket this wednesday
mayweather had the tbe cap on after beating marcos maidana in las vegas last september mayweather has also been sporting a tbe t - shirt during his training camp in las vegas invitations to these media events are usually pressed on we hacks by pr men pleading with us to attend and fans are often allowed in to help fill the room
this one is making a little history all its own by requiring that we apply for accreditation and such is the frenzy that we are warned ' space is limited
' never mind the richest fight of all time , which was a sellout while still only a gleam in the eye of the promoters , but they could have sold tickets for this head - to - head sabre - rattling by the gladiators in la
given the cost of flights from london , we thank them for not doing so
not so much as a twitch of a muscle or the flicker of a nerve is to be missed in these weeks in which all roads lead to the mgm grand garden arena on that neon las vegas in the desert
for this , mayweather can take most of the credit
the five years in which he held to ransom the hundreds of millions around the world who have been begging him to face pacquiao in the ring have generated a commercial monster of unprecedented enormity
mayweather was on the famous las vegas as he took a break from training for his fight with pacquiao pacquiao shadow boxes in the ring as he prepares for the richest fight in history of boxing even before these reluctant grooms affirm their vows to each other in public for the first time , estimates as to the potential worth of this fight have soared from a lip - licking $ 200million to at least an eye - watering $ 350m and maybe a gob - smacking half a billion
whatever mayweather 's reasons for stalling â and he has been accused of everything from cowardice ( outrageously ) to an excessive obsession with his undefeated record ( possibly ) â he has proved himself to be an economic genius
had he agreed to this shotgun wedding back in the year 2000 he and pacquiao would have received half each of a total purse estimated at around $ 60m
now he is getting the 60 per cent upside of a deal which is expected to deliver $ 210m to him and $ 140m to his arch - rival
the bulk of that money will come from pay - per - view television but claims that showtime and hbo in us â and either sky or boxnation here â will be short - changed by fighters past their prime are being rebuffed by boxing men in the know
pacquiao 's seven - time trainer of the year in the us â freddie roach â tells us : ' this will be a much better fight for tv and the fans than if it had happened when it was first discussed
the filipino legend had complained about ' feeling slow ' but looked up to speed during his fifth day of training the 36 - year - old is completing his training regime at freddie roach 's wild card gym in la ' mayweather could well have won back then by running and dodging behind that highly technical defence of his
but now that his legs have slowed a little pacquiao will have more chances of getting to him , making a real fight of it and beating him
' for me and pacquiao this will still be the biggest challenge of our careers
it will still be our most difficult fight
but it is one we can win
' that opinion will gain legs of it own in la this week , all the time continue to build an already massive market around the world
mayweather 's business acumen has already made him the wealthiest sportsman on the planet
after this there will be no catching him in the foreseeable future
even as he waits for the biggest pay cheque of all , he continues to enjoy the fruits of his punishing fistic labours
mr money 's idea of a break from hard training in his hometown vegas this weekend was a trip along the las vegas for a little high - rolling in a casino
who can deny that 's he 's earned it ? and whatever anyone may think of him , there is no smarter operator in the whole wide world of sport
the first leg of what british boxing hoped would be a world - title double in liverpool came nastily unstuck at the weekend
chester 's butler went in to his bid to become a two - division world champion full of promise but ended up flat on his back
after stepping up to bantamweight to defeat stuart hall , our somewhat vulnerable ibf belt - holder , butler took the unusual step of training back down in poundage to challenge super-flyweight champion zolani tete
butler was knocked out by a brutal uppercut from zolani tete in the eighth round butler was bidding to become a two - division world champion but was beaten by south african alarmingly , the rangy south african comprehensively outclassed him before landing a knockout uppercut in the eighth
british boxing is on the rise but this came as a sharp reminder that at its best the hardest game is never easy
next up at the echo arena , on april 19 , is liverpool 's own derry matthews
the veteran lightweight faces what appears to be an even tougher assignment against wba champion richar abril and will need to box at the highest level of his career if he is to assuage the butler disappointment .
