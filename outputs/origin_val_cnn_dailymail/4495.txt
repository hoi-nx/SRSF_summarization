these fascinating pictures show the hoard of nuts collected by a squirrel who stole them from a bird table before stashing them away under the bonnet of a honda civic
the animal helped itself to food left out for the birds in the garden of a gloucestershire property before crawling inside the engine of the car and hiding them in the air filter
the secret stash of nuts was only discovered when the owner of the honda civic 1.6 took her vehicle to the garage because she could n't work out why it would n't go above 40mph
evans , who owns the garage , said he ran a complete set of tests before making the discovery
he said : ' it was rammed solid with nuts
i 've been doing this job for 18 years and i 've never seen anything like it
i could n't believe it '
he , along with colleague plaister , spent an hour sucking the nuts out of the air filter with a vacuum cleaner and collected enough to fill half of a supermarket carrier bag
mr evans added : ' i ca n't be certain , it could have been a mouse , but i think it was more likely a squirrel
' the owner was as shocked as we were
she 'd been leaving nuts on a bird table in the back garden , and somebody had been helping himself to them
' he 'd been getting into the garage , where she parked the car , and had been climbing right inside the engine bay and squeezing himself into the air filter
' he kept on doing until he could n't get any more in
' mr evans spent an hour sucking the nuts out of the air filter with a vacuum cleaner and collected enough to fill half of a carrier bag
he said he only made the discovery after diagnostic tests failed to find the problem the nuts had been stuffed into the air filter by the squirrel until no more could possibly fit in the pump the car was taken to dpe autosport near kemble , in the cotswolds , after it failed to go more than 40mph mr evans had initially suspected a problem with the catalytic converter but discovered the nut stash after a series of diagnostic tests failed to reveal what the problem was
ms plaister , who has worked at the firm for five years , said : ' the lady whose car it is had obviously been feeding the birds and a squirrel or a mouse had stashed them in the car
' it was quite fascinating
when we took the air filter lid off we were just gobsmacked
' the car 's owner declined to comment on the matter .
