the president told simon he was a huge fan of the hit hbo series about life in drug - plagued baltimore , during a chat about criminal justice reform
a video of the 12 - minute conversation , about the need to reduce the incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders , was shown at the bipartisan criminal justice summit in washington
meeting : president obama talks to the wire creator simon about the war on drugs the president said people looking for solutions to the drug war need to ' humanize what so often , on the local news , is just a bunch of shadowy characters and tell their stories
' ' that 's where the work you 've done has been so important , ' he told mr simon
' there is an increasing realization on the left , but also on the right , politically , that what we 're doing is counterproductive , ' he said
fan : president obama hailed the wire , starring dominic west , larry gilliard jr. and wendell pierce ( pictured ) as a great ' piece of art ' high praise : president obama said he was ' huge fan ' of the wire , starring officer james ' jimmy ' mcnulty ( dominic west ) and detective william ' bunk ' moreland ( wendell pierce ) pictured ' either from a libertarian perspective , the way we treat non-violent drug crimes is problematic , and from a fiscal perspective , it 's breaking the bank , that you end up spending so much more on prison than you would with these kids being in school or even going to college , that it 's counterproductive '
he spoke of people being turned into ' hardened criminals ' while in prison , which created a cycle of them returning to jail
disaffected : obama said solutions to the drug war needed to ' humanize what so often , on the local news , is just a bunch of shadowy characters and tell their stories ' which the wire had helped with discussions : obama meets the wire creator simon at the white house to discuss incarceration of drug offenders ' when you break down why people are n't getting back into the labor force , even as jobs are being created , a big chunk of that is the young male population with felony histories
the wire , which looked at the dark underbelly of the city of baltimore , ran for five seasons on hbo
each season focused on a different facet of the drugs trade in the maryland city : the drug trade on the streets , the seaport system , corruption within the city government and bureaucracy , the school system , and the print news media
the series , which ran from 2002 to 2008 and became a huge cult hit , being hailed by many critics as the best television programme of the last decade or even of all time
' so now where we have the opportunity to give them a pathway toward a responsible life , they 're foreclosed
' the the wire chronicled the effects of the drug war as it was waged in maryland 's largest city in the early 2000s , showing how both drug use and the heavy - handed response of the law enforcement devastated communities
mr simon , an outspoken critic of the federal government 's drug policies , did not hold back as he spoke with the president
' what the drugs do n't destroy , the war against them tears apart , ' he said
obama once again mentioned his favorite ' the wire ' character omar little , a stick - up man who would make a living by targeting drug dealers
the president had previously revealed the character , played by michael k. williams , was his best - liked star of the show .
