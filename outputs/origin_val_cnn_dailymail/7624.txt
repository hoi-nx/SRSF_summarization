cristiano ronaldo headed real madrid into the quarter - finals of the champions league with two first half goals against schalke but an awful performance from the holders suggested their crown is very much up for grabs this season
carlo ancelotti âs team were booed off after losing 4 - 3 on the night
they stumbled into the last eight 5 - 4 on aggregate but cristiano ronaldo âs goals and the return of luka modric apart , there was little to cheer
carlo ancelotti was even asked if he would be surprised if he was sacked after the performance
he said he was just concentrating on doing his job and apologised for the display : â it was bad for the image of the club , â he said
cristiano ronaldo scored a brace for real madrid as they made it through to the champions league quarter - finals the portuguese forward heads the ball past schalke goalkeeper timon wellenreuther at the bernabeu on tuesday night cristiano ronaldo is now the highest goalscorer in european competitions after overtaking lionel messi and raul with brace klaas-jan huntelaar beats pepe to the ball and fires home schalke 's fourth goal against real madrid at the bernabeu the comeback was well and truly on for schalke after klaas-jan huntelaar 's strike to make it 4 - 3 to the visitors in real madrid casillas looks dejected on his home turf - the experienced goalkeeper was out of sorts against the german side schalke players congratulate midfielder leroy sane after his fine strike in the champions league last - 16 second leg schalke players salute their fans at the end of the game after beating the champions league holders 4 - 3 real madrid were booed off at the end of the game by the home faithful on tuesday night a group of real madrid fans wave a white handkerchief after the final whistle at the bernabeu real madrid : casillas , alvaro arbeloa ( nacho 83 ) , raphael varane , pepe , fabio coentrao ( marcelo 58 ) , sami khedira ( luka modric 58 ) , toni kroos , isco , cristiano ronaldo , karim benzema , gareth bale

i still believe in the team because i know what they can give but at the moment they are not giving it
we are playing very badly
we need to train more , work more , we need more of everything
â cristiano ronaldo headed in a toni kroos corner on 25 minutes to cancel out christian fuchs â shock opener and when schalke took the lead again on 40 minutes through klass-jan huntelaar , cristiano ronaldo headed in a fabio coentrao cross to equalise
it was his rage at the lacklustre performance from some of his team - mates more than his finishing that was most striking
karim benzema scored eight minutes into the second half but real madrid still allowed schalke to level on the night with substitute leroy sane beating casillas with a long range shot and when klaas-jan huntelaar got his second five minutes from time it left roberto di matteo âs team needing just one more goal for one of the all - time champions league shocks
the fifth goal never came and real madrid stumbled over the line but this was hardly a performance to put fear into the rest of european
the mood was set before kick - off when supporters jeered carlo ancelotti âs name as it was announced
the credit he earned for winning this competition last season seems to have long since disappeared
he needed a positive champions league display from his players â he never got one
real looked flat going forward and were slow to cover space at the back and when tranquillo barnetta crossed from the right on 25 minutes , he found christian fuchs with time and space to shoot past casillas
sami khedira , who will leave on a free transfer at the end of the season had failed to follow christian fuchs â run and casillas was beaten too easily
cristiano ronaldo turned to shout at his sleepy team - mates after he rose to head in toni kroos â corner five minutes later but real madrid did not wake up
karim benzema was also on the scoresheet for real madrid as he re-found his goalscoring touch against schalke karim benzema is congratulated by real madrid team - mate pepe after netting past schalke goalkeeper timon wellenreuther ( left ) schalke left back christian fuchs gave the visitors a shock lead at the bernabeu on tuesday night christian fuchs ' goal fave the german side a lift as they looked to pull off a shock victory against real madrid schalke players congratulate the defender after his goal in the 20th minute in real madrid in the champions league klaas-jan huntelaar restored schakle 's one - goal advantage when he followed up after casillas parried the ball into the danger area the dutchman striker ran back to the halfway line with the ball after scoring against his former club klaas-jan huntelaar 's goal at the bernabeu put schalke back in front with the score at 2 - 1 in the champions league clash schalke are starting to gain a reputation for spectacular exits from the champions league
the german club have been on the losing end of the highest - scoring tie of the round each time they 've been dumped out in the knockout phase
they might not have made progress , but schalke get full marks for entertainment , as these aggregate scores show ... 2014 , last 16 real madrid 9 - 2 schalke 2013 , last 16 galatasaray 4 - 3 schalke 2011 , semi-final manchester united 6 - 1 schalke james restall a raphael varane back pass almost let in klaas-jan huntelaar who then rattled the bar
and with his third chance inside five minutes he found the back of the net
casillas spilled max meyer âs shot straight to the dutchman and , against his old club , he made it 2 - 1
cristiano ronaldo stepped forward to level once again but a crescendo of whistles still greeted the half - time whistle
karim benzema put them 3 - 2 up on the night on 53 minutes but leroy sane beat casillas from distance to cause further embarrassment
this was the first time since 2009 real madrid had conceded three at home in european
carlo ancelotti immediately brought on luka modric and marcelo for sami khedira and fabio coentrao
the croatian looked to restore some control to midfield but when klaas-jan huntelaar got his second of the game off the underside of casillas â bar the miracle looked back on for schalke âs 4,000 following
gareth bale was jeered when he shot well wide from a good position
he is a victim rather than the cause of real madrid âs malaise but is starting to struggle in front of the club âs unforgiving supporters
he will be glad that former tottenham team - mate luka modric is now back in the side alongside him
his return and cristiano ronaldo âs reliability were the plus points for real madrid on a night when they answered more questions than provided answers
around 1,000 real madrid supporters had voted for cristiano ronaldo to be dropped earlier this week in a poll organized by spanish newspaper diario as
whether they were at the bernabeu on tuesday night or at home clicking other online surveys it is impossible to know
once again real madrid âs ballon dâor had been head and shoulders above the rest and had he not been , next friday âs quarter - final draw might even have been missing the name of the ten - times winners
