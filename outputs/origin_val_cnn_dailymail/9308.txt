mr bould said : â you can summarise his charges as : â i âm on duty , i âm going to rush ( over to your home ) so you can give me oral sex before i rush back to work â
â he picked one woman up while on duty and took her to longton police station in stoke-on-trent
â he picked her up in a marked car , in uniform , and she had to wait in the car while he checked the coast was clear
â then he took her into the police station , it was in darkness , and he told her to keep quiet , and took her to an office
â the only purpose of that was for sexual activity
they began to go further , she put his handcuffs on him , and it was intended to go further but they were disturbed so had to leave
â another charge , the prosecutor said , related to a woman his visited at home who he persuaded â by a lie or ruse â to show him her intimate areas
another woman , who had checked in to a hotel after she had been left terrified to stay at home following an incident of â sexual violence â , had sex with rushton despite his sergeant earlier warning the officer to leave the hotel
mr bould said : â she was put in a hotel just over night , so mr rushton knew he would have to act quickly
rushton was suspended from staffordshire police ( headquarters pictured ) when the allegations came to light â he set about grooming her by flattering her and flirting with her to show his interest in a sexual way
he then turned up at her hotel at about 10.30pm that night
â a sergeant heard about it and attended the hotel and pointed out that mr rushton should leave because of the way his behaviour was reflecting on the force
â but mr rushton did nât leave , he stayed and had sex with her
â one of rushton âs victims told the jury how he had sex with her while on duty , after he had attended a burglary at her home
a few weeks later , he was waiting for her outside her home
the woman said : â my relationship with my partner had broken down completely so i was grateful rushton had come round
â on his third visit it was different , we did nât discuss the burglary that time , it was more of a friendship by then
â he had been texting me and sometimes he would send me some images of parts of him privately , unclothed below the waist
â rushton was suspended after the allegations came to light in early 2013
