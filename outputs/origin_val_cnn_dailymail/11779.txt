he is the latest object of female lust from caithness to cornwall â a heartbroken hero who is all brooding desire and smouldering good looks
and aidan turner , the new ross poldark , certainly has plenty of tumultuous romantic experiences to draw on
perhaps , given his good looks , a rather swashbuckling love life is to be expected : gossips in dublin insist that he was once â when between serious girlfriends â seen leaving a nightclub in the city with no fewer than three attentive females in tow
his first girlfriend was actress india whisker , a pretty blonde whom he met in 2004 while at drama school in dublin
she was followed by another actress , brunette charlene mckenna
they lived together in camden , north london , from 2007 to 2009
she told an interviewer how happy they were together
but within a few weeks they split , and she was apparently devastated
aidan turner then fell for lenora crichlow , his co-star in the tv series being human â from 2009 he played a vampire and she a ghost
then in 2011 , he and lenora crichlow parted ways and he decided to quit the series while she stayed on
it seems that this was a source of great heartbreak for him
he said this week : â i do nât know anyone on this planet who has nât had their heart broken
it âs happened to me
love is love , it âs the purest and rawest thing we have in life
â aidan turner was also romantically involved with charlene mckenna ( pictured )
they shared a flat together in camden , north london from 2007 to 2009 the following year he started to date the irish actress sarah
she was nominated for a tony award for her performance on broadway opposite daniel radcliffe in the cripple of inishmaan , and last year starred in the film adam jones with bradley cooper
their romance is still going strong after three years , but aidan turner admits that they are often separated by work
he spent 18 months making hobbit films in new zealand early on in their liaison
he explained of the periods of separation : â it âs all we âve ever known [ as a couple ] and it makes for good times when we meet up again and maybe have a month straight when we âre both unemployed and watching movies every day
it âs fun to laze around and do normal things
â aidan turner ( left ) also dated lenora crichlow ( right ) from 2009 to 2011 , after they met on the tv series being human
he later decided to quit the series while she stayed on aidan turner is quietly bowled over by his sudden fame
asked how it feels to be an overnight sex symbol , he chuckles
â ah , i would nât say that , â he demurred yesterday
but it is nice that the show has gone down quite well and people are positive about it
â understatement must be as much a part of his make - up as the kind of looks which have reduced the female half of the country to jelly
in the show , aidan turner is british army officer ross poldark , who returns to cornwall following the american war of independence to find his father dead , the family âs tin mine in ruins and his sweetheart , elizabeth , engaged to his cousin
aidan turner ( left ) is seen with ex-girlfriend actress india whisker ( right ) whom he met in 2004 while at drama school in dublin since the opening episode on sunday , there has been praise for the ensemble acting and the script â but mostly for how dishy the lead looks in a pair of britches
even his mother , eileen , is being stopped in the street and asked how it feels to have a sex - symbol son
â that is very funny , â aidan turner told me this week
â i âve definitely never had that before
i ca nât believe it , really
â i can reveal that aidan turner is contracted to be in a further five series of poldark , should the bbc make the obvious decision to make more
in the meantime , he is staying with his mum in dublin , although he is hoping to go away on holiday soon with girlfriend sarah
aidan turner ( pictured as ross poldark ) has been bowled over by his sudden rise to fame and definitely does n't consider himself a sex symbol one of those watching poldark on sunday was his old drama teacher sutton , director of dublin âs gaiety school of acting , who told me : â i settled down in front of the telly like a child waiting to meet father christmas
and then he comes on , all brooding and bubbling and seething , and i said to myself : â well , that âs a grand day out
â i could not be prouder of him
â mr sutton , who counts hollywood star colin farrell among his previous students , puts aidan turner âs success down to talent , hard work and good manners â all three of which gaiety school of acting students are taught
the son of eileen , an accountant at a local carpet store , and pat , an electrician , there is no acting background in aidan turner âs family â he had nât even been to a play before he went to drama college
he was raised in clondalkin , just west of dublin , and went to st macdara âs community college in templeogue
one of two brothers , he recalls having been a bit of a tearaway as a schoolboy
he told one interviewer : â i remember my mum getting called up a lot
â smouldering : aiden turner with co-star eleanor tomlinson in poldark dumped : in the bbc series , poldark ( aidan turner ) is dumped by his former love elizabeth ( heida reed ) his great talent at that age was ballroom dancing , and he even represented his country
he travelled around irish and internationally , competing in ballroom and latin for around ten years
tommy shaughnessy , president of dancesport federation of irish , told me : â i used to teach aidan turner
but after i told his mother the cost of making it in international ballroom dancing , she said they could nât afford it and told me that he might go into acting
â this surprised me as he was very shy
anyway , he joined the gaiety school of acting and the rest is history
â while at drama school , he did put his old skills to use , doing a dance for a fundraiser with his then girlfriend india whisker
aidan turner had no idea what he wanted to do after school
after a stint working with his dad as an apprentice , he toyed with the idea of becoming a professional snooker player before spotted an advert for the gaiety school of acting
â i did nât know anything about this world at all , â said aidan turner
â i felt intimidated from the get - go , but thought : â that âs just right for me
â the sense of potential failure is a buzz
â being around committed people there was very inspiring
â before he started acting , aidan turner ( pictured with eleanor tomlinson in poldark ) , represented irish in ballroom dancing competitions across the country and internationally he graduated in 2004 , and had various theatre roles before getting a break in an irish television medical drama , the clinic , in 2008
the following year came being human
this attracted an excitable group of young fans whom he calls â the posse â , and who have followed his every move ever since
he gained more fans playing kili , a heartthrob of the dwarf world in peter jackson âs hobbit films
but his biggest break was poldark
earlier this year he said : â the offer came in and i said : â what the hell âs poldark ? â i had to google it
â then i called my mum
she said : â you âd better not mess this up ! â â do n't mess this up ! aidan turner had n't heard of poldark but was warned not to mess the job up by his mother perhaps we can forgive his ignorance as , since he âs still only 31 , he was nât even born when the original seventies tv version aired
one wonders if either he or girlfriend sarah are ready for the attention which has just exploded , even more of which will no doubt follow with the promise of a buff and shirtless poldark in future episodes
sarah said in an interview last year that she had been outraged when some fans took pictures of him when he was asleep on the london underground
but he says of the ardent kerfuffle : â i do nât think she âll be bothered , no. we âre both actors , we understand that it is part of our job
â in aidan turner âs case , the â job â seems to be the play the role of newly minted national sex symbol â and he âs doing it to perfection .
