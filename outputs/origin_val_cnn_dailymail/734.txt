electric vehicles are a useful tool for fighting sweaty city summers , according to a study published on thursday
switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug - in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island , it said
the term describes what happens when city temperatures are driven higher by heat from traffic and air conditioners and by warmth , stored during the day in roads and buildings , which is released at night

in some places , the buildup combines with a summer heatwave to inflict sweltering discomfort and heat stress

writing in the journal scientific reports , specialists in chinese and the united states said urban heat island creates a vicious circle
the hotter it is , the more people crank up their air conditioning , which in turn disgorges more heat into the street , and so on
the team calculated what would happen in beijing if petrol - and diesel - powered cars and light trucks were replaced by their electric equivalent
their simulation was based on the weather in the chinese capital in the summer of 2012 , when the city was three degrees celsius ( 5.4 degrees fahrenheit ) warmer than the surrounding countryside
switching vehicles would have caused this to fall by 0.94 c ( 1.7 f ) , according to their model
' heatwaves kill , and in terms of climate change , even one degree can make a difference , ' said jianguo liu of michigan state university , who took part in the study
the theoretical switch would also save the city 14.4 million kilowatt - hours in electricity each day -- the daily equivalent of 10,686 tonnes of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) emissions
the calculation took into account heat from the extra fossil fuel that would have had to be burned at local power plants to charge the electric cars
electric vehicles emit only about a fifth of the heat of conventional cars

' the replacement can mitigate heat island intensity , which can reduce the amount of electricity consumed daily by air conditions , benefitting the local and global climate , ' the study said
the researchers sounded a note of caution , pointing out that urban heat island has a basket of factors , some of which are sketchy
particulate pollution , city layout , building design , energy efficiency and parks are also believed to play a part in worsening or mitigating it
the computer simulation focused only temperature change and energy savings
it was not designed to factor in the cost of introducing electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure , nor did it estimate the health benefits from less pollution
