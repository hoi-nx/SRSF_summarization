back in 2010 uk 's politicians broke new ground
they were long used to haranguing each other in the uk 's rowdy house of commons -- but they 'd never had u.s. style pre-election head - to - head debates
it is necessary and long - established political fare in the u.s. -- but over here in the uk , it was novel
it seemed to go well -- political points were scored , and polls were commissioned looking for advantages gained or lost
it was a drama of sorts , even though no knock - out punches were landed
prime minister cameron and his conservative party won the election , but not by enough to go into government alone
for the past five years he 's been governing in coalition with the uk 's third party , the liberal democrats
and their leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , has mostly backed cameron in parliamentary debates against the opposition labour leader miliband
uk 's broadcasters , keen to channel lively politics onto prime time tv and boost ratings , have been working the corridors of power themselves over the past year to try to nail down a repeat -- or two -- of the 2010 knockabout
what 's at stake is n't just the proposed debates ahead of may 's general election -- but the enshrining of such debates permanently into uk 's political architecture -- just like in the u.s. but while cameron and miliband have hired former white house election advisers to edge them in to the lead , no one can agree on what form a debate should take , how many there should be , or even who should be invited
cameron has insisted on just one debate involving the leaders of seven leading uk parties -- giving equal airtime to the greens , the scottish nationalists and the upstart rightwing uk independence party ( ukip ) , among others
but miliband 's labour is holding out for at least one head - to - head debate with cameron
no one seems to be budging but both of the uk 's largest parties could use the bump in the polls such a debate might bring
part of the problem is the uk electorate , which has changed since 2010 , boosting the fortunes of some of the country 's former political outliers
the rightwing ukip , which has pledged to take the uk out of the european union , has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of cameron 's conservatives
in scotland , the september independence referendum ( which narrowly failed ) so reinvigorated the scottish national party that they could hit what is usually a key labour stronghold , undermining miliband 's bid for power
all of this has made the whole process of nailing down precisely who will be allowed in the debate that much more tortuous
for the big leaders who drive that conversation , it is about how each outlier can help them -- and hinder their rivals
it once looked like it would become as much of a uk institution as rain , or fish and chips , but now the election debate seems in danger of not happening at all
on the upside , you can still tune in to house of commons tv most days of the week to get your fix of one lawmaker bellowing at another
but do it soon -- i hear that even those everyday raucous exchanges are being scrutinized for being a bit old - fashioned .
