gov. pence unleashed a firestorm on indiana last week when he signed the religious freedom restoration act
critics of the law contend it could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate -- particularly against the lgbt community of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender individuals -- on the basis of religion
the ramifications for the hoosier state are just starting to be felt in the form of boycotts , petitions and travel bans
as the controversy mushrooms , here 's what got us to where we are
and where things are headed
last week , pence put his signature on the religious freedom restoration act -- a law that allows indiana businesses to cite their religious freedom as a legal defense
the law states that the government ca n't " substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion " and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be " substantially burdened " can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits
in an opinion piece in the wall street journal , pence says the religious freedom restoration act " ensures that indiana law will respect religious freedom and apply the highest level of scrutiny to any state or local governmental action that infringes on people 's religious liberty
" pence notes that there is no reference to sexual orientation in the law
civil liberties and gay rights groups hold to their stance that the law could be used by businesses to deny service to people based on their sexual orientation and justify that discrimination based on their religious belief

indiana 's top two state lawmakers pledged monday to amend the state 's controversial " religious freedom " law to clarify that it can not be used to discriminate against gay people
" this law does not discriminate , and it will not be allowed to do so , " david long , the indiana senate president pro tem , said during a news conference with state house speaker brian bosma
pence had said earlier that he was working with lawmakers to clarify the law
critics still were n't on board with the anti-discrimination claims
opponents of religious freedom restoration act marched around the state capitol
someone even created a satire ad : " indiana
it 's a great place to be a bigot
the rhetoric has reached such a fever pitch that a front page editorial in tuesday 's edition of the indianapolis star blares the headline : " fix
" the editorial suggests the religious freedom restoration act and protections for gays and lesbians can co-exist
the state is at a crossroads it says
" ( n ) o matter its original intent ( the law ) already has done enormous harm to our state and potentially our economic future , " according to the editorial
" only bold action -- action that sends an unmistakable message to the world that our state will not tolerate discrimination against any of its citizens -- will be enough to reverse the damage
" the editorial closes with : " governor , indiana is in a state of crisis
it is worse than you seem to understand
" you must act with courage and wisdom
you must lead us forward now
you must ensure that all hoosiers have strong protections against discrimination
" the laws can co-exist
" some of the republican 's top figures are backing pence despite the controversy
jeb bush and marco rubio have voiced their support
both are considered likely republican candidates for the white house
sen. cruz , who announced his candidacy last week , is also on board
" i 'm proud to stand with gov. @ mike_pence for religious liberty , and i urge americans to do the same , " cruz tweets
indiana is the 20th state to adopt a " religious freedom restoration " law , most of which are modeled after the religious freedom restoration act , which president bill clinton signed into law in 1993
but that law passed with the backing of a broad - based coalition and was n't set against the backdrop of gay rights or the wave of marriage equality laws that have swept the country in recent years
talbot , a spokesman with the human rights campaign , a gay rights group , stresses that those 20 laws are " dramatically different in their scope and effect
" " calling them similar in this way risks being misleading
indiana is the broadest and most dangerous law of its kind in the country , " talbot says
arkansas ' legislature passed an indiana - style law on friday , which now heads to the state 's governor for approval
despite the controversy , the indiana governor says concerns that his state 's new " religious freedom " law will allow businesses to turn away lgbt customers is the result of a " tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding
" still , he was hard pressed to explain why that was n't the case
given a chance on sunday to add some clarity , pence refused to answer at least six yes - or - no questions from abc 's george stephanopoulos about whether the measure legalizes discrimination against gays and lesbians
