apple âs watch does what google glass and pebble âs smartwatch failed at - create a beautiful , elegant device that works as a piece of jewellery , without even switching it on
surprisingly light , the watch oozes quality and attention to detail in the design and build
apple has gone to great lengths to show off the specialist materials used to make it , and it shows
' it creates a beautiful , elegant device that works as a piece of jewellery , without even switching it on
' while in images it looks a little chunky , on the wrist it is a different story
the rounded curve means it fits comfortably on the wrist , and the range of bracelets means there âs one for pretty much every taste
for the record , i used the leather strap with magnetic â slap band â on the sport model , and also tested the gold edition
using the watch can be slightly confusing at first - the combination of digital crown , button and touchscreen mean that for your first few tries , you âll probably press the wrong one
however , after a few minutes it becomes second nature to navigate around , and the digital crown in particular is perfectly weighted , making scrolling through long lists - such as music or your messages - simple
the touchscreen in particular is extremely accurate
i did nât notice a single press in the wrong place , even on the main screen which has dozens of icons
we were able to try its features , and found even in the beta version we were using , the software is spot on - animation are smooth and fluid , with watch faces such as an opening rose showing off the screen however , there is undoubtedly an initial confusion factor apple will have to overcome
the experience of buying one in apple âs stores will be key to its success , as the watch simply is nât a device you can just pick up and understand instantly
however , once you know how to get around , the watch is fluid , fast and the screen astonishingly bright
we were able to try all of its features , and found even in the beta version we were using , the software is spot on - animations are smooth and fluid , with watch faces really showing off the screen
overall , the apple watch is by far the best wearable device on the market
sadly , this is no indicator of success as there âs simply not much in the way of competition for the â normal â consumer , despite google âs attempts with android wear
apple has taken the ios software on its phones and tablets and tweaked it to better suit the watch 's power , display size and functions
it has also invented a new typeface to make the screen easier to read however , will people want one ? overall , the selling point from my ( admittedly short ) time with the watch seems to be its time - saving potential - as a phone addict , i âm constantly checking for messages
having that on my wrist , along with the ability to easily reply and to see , will make the process faster
as with the apple phone when it was first introduced , one feels we are only seeing apple âs apps in any detail
when it ships on april 24th , developers around the world are expected to unleash a raft of apps
much like the iphone , these are what could really propel apple watch from being an elegant way to see your notifications , to being a true new computing platform apple hopes it will be
on first impressions , it seems apple has a very good chance of once again changing the way we interact with technology

gestures : following last year 's unveiling , apple admitted the watch is unlike any device it has ever made
it said it has ' reinvented all - new ways to select navigate and input that are suited to a smaller device worn on the wrist '
the watch is also said to be able to sense force adding ' a new dimension to the user interface '
force touch uses electrodes around the flexible display to distinguish between a light tap and a deep press , and trigger instant access to a range of contextually specific controls - such as an action menu in messages , or a mode that lets you select different watch faces

all of the watches can be pre-ordered from 10 april and will be available in stores from this date digital crown : on mechanical watches , the crown has historically been used to set the time and date and to wind the mainspring
apple has adapted this and its ' digital ' crown can be used to magnify content on the small display
rotating the digital crown replaces the typical pinching motion used on iphones and ipads and allows wearers to zoom and scroll without obstructing the screen
pressing the crown will also return wearers to the home screen
watch os : apple has taken the ios software on its phones and tablets and tweaked it to better suit the watch 's power , display size and functions
it has also invented a new typeface to make the screen easier to read
on mechanical watches the crown has historically been used to set the time and date and to wind the mainspring

' while on the sport collection the screen has the added protection of ion-x glass
glances : the glances feature shows info users would like to see , similar to google now , and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom
for instance , wearers can glimpse the weather forecast , check out what âs next on their calendar , or find their location on a map
they can then swipe through different glances , or tap on one to go directly to its corresponding app for more details
music can also be controlled on an iphone through the apple watch
on the back of the watch 's case is a sensor ( pictured ) that uses infrared and visible - light leds and photodiodes to detect the wearer 's heart rate vibration and notifications : the watch has a built - in is a ' taptic engine ' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications
any notification that appears on the connected phone will appear on the watch
this is made from a linear actuator , or motor , inside the apple watch that produces haptic feedback
the wearer can then respond to these messages directly or swipe down to see the notification centre
this haptic feedback could also be used with apple maps , for example , to help people navigate
it will produced gentle vibrations to signal when to turn left or right
the watch additionally understands questions in messages and offers pre-selected answers , and messages can be dictated to the iphone
and this taptic engine means people can get someone 's attention with a gentle tap or send their heartbeat remotely
there is no keyboard on the watch , and messages can only be sent through dictation , or emoji
siri is also built into the apple watch
heart rate sensor : on the back of the watch 's case , a ceramic cover with sapphire lenses sits above a sensor that uses infrared and visible - light leds and photodiodes to detect the wearer 's heart rate
apple watch uses this sensor , along with an accelerometer and the gps and wi â fi in a connected iphone , to measure physical movement such as steps , distance and calories
inductive charging : the watch uses apple 's magsafe technology with inductive charging
this means it can be charged wirelessly by placing a connector near the back of the watch where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically
magsafe is the name of the connector apple uses with its macbook range
battery life : mr cook was vague about the battery life of the apple watch when it was announced
he confirmed last month that it will last a full day after initially saying it will need to be charged overnight .
