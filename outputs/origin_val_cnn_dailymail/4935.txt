prince william launched his four - day visit to china today with a ceremony to bring good fortune
the second in line to the throne found himself in the unusual position of having to paint the eyes on a larger than life sheep - uk cartoon character shaun , no less
' you know i ca n't do two things at once , ' he joked with the photographers who asked him to pose up with his artwork
' the sheep - marking ceremony signalled the launch of the first ever year of cultural exchange between the uk and china , a showcase of innovation for uk goods and services
in the china calendar this is the year of the sheep - and with aardman animation 's shaun being the uk 's most famous export of the species , the british council thought it might be fun to marry the two
the ceremony took place in the gardens of the residence of the uk ambassador , barbara woodward
william was shown five sculptures of shaun , each decorated by a different artist , which are among 50 such sculptures to be displayed across china and later auctioned off in aid of the beijing cultural development fund

dotting the eyes of the traditional lions used in lion dances is thought to bring good fortune and happiness - and it is hoped that by william doing this he will bring such benefits to the year of cultural exchange
it also ties in with the china idiom ' san yang kai tai ' , which means ' the advent of spring brings prosperity '
the prince was accompanied by sajid javid , secretary of state for culture , media and sport , who said : ' we are incredibly proud of our creative industries , they are one of our biggest success stories and a tremendous driver of economic growth

the duke of cambridge 's visit is the highest - profile visit by a member of the royal family for 30 years ' the year of cultural exchange will be a wonderful celebration of uk and china creative talent and will help forge new business relations between our two nations
' nick marchand director of arts and creative industries at the british embassy said william was a ' fantastic ambassador ' for the uk
' it 's wonderful that he can be here to launch this for us , ' he said
