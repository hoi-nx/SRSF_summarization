the sight of an aspiring model who had bleach thrown in her face was saved by a friend splashing her eyes with pepsi
victoria smith , 17 , was left with raw burns and hair loss when a school bully attacked her at a party shouting : â here âs your shot of bleach
â yesterday a judge sentenced rebecca morris , then also 17 , to 27 months behind bars for the assault , which he described as a â spiteful and vengeful act â
miss smith , who modelled under the name toria melody and at the time dyed her hair bright pink , had been bullied by morris at the college where they were studying , the court heard
victoria smith , 17 , was left with raw burns and hair loss when a school bully attacked her at a party in hull in august last year , while shouting : â here âs your shot of bleach ' morris was suspended as a result and began threatening to attack her accuser with bleach
â she knew she was a model and it was designed to burn and disfigure , â said stephen welch , prosecuting
but her sight was saved when a quick - thinking friend carrying some pepsi splashed it over her burning eyes
the assault came in a carefully - planned ambush in which miss smith was lured to a house party in their home town of hull last august
first aid manuals stress the vital importance of flushing out the eyes with lukewarm water if they come into contact with harmful chemicals
ideally the eyes will be bathed for at least 15 - 20 minutes to dilute the substance and remove as much of it as possible before it can cause damage
if water is nât available , alternative liquids such as soft drinks can also be suitable â making the action of miss smith âs friend an admirable improvisation
however , once an acid or alkali enters the eye , there is usually no specific benefit in using the opposite to try to neutralise it
she was unaware that morris was there but became suspicious that something was wrong and left
her tormentor then followed her down the street and flung the bleach in her face with the aim of ruining her looks
a previous hearing heard that morris shouted : â here âs your shot of bleach instead of your shot of vodka
this is for getting me thrown out of college â
she could have suffered permanent damage to her sight had it not been for â a friend who irrigated her eyes with the soft drink she was carrying â , judge david tremberg told hull crown court
â this was an assault which was unprovoked and premeditated
â however , miss smith needed treatment in hospital , continues to suffer chronic dryness in her eyes and had to wear a wig as a result of damage to her hair
she also suffered severe psychological harm â leaving her feeling unable to socialise with friends â and made a suicide attempt two months later
writing on facebook after the attack , miss smith said : â the outer layer of my eyes are permanently damaged and my hair has turned green from the bleach and has fallen out at the front
miss smith ( pictured left and right arriving at court ) could have suffered permanent damage to her sight had it not been for â a friend who irrigated her eyes with the soft drink she was carrying â , hull crown court told â i have burns on my body from all the chemicals inside the bleach and i am in excruciating pain in my eyes
they are red raw , it went in my mouth , up my nose and i could nât breathe
â the judge added that miss smith â who did not attend court â â used to pride herself in her appearance and her hair â but now suffers â flashbacks [ and ] panic attacks â
rebecca morris was sentenced to 27 months behind bars for the assault he told morris : â the emotional harm you have caused has been grave
since the offence her life has changed
she has lost confidence , she feels unable to go out and socialise ... indeed she feels barely able to go out socially at all
â morris was also handed a four - year restraining order against miss smith after pleading guilty at a previous hearing to applying a corrosive fluid , with intent to burn , maim , disfigure or disable or to do some grievous bodily harm
she will serve her sentence at a young offenders â institution
afterwards detective sergeant chris coupland , of humberside police , said miss smith could have been seriously injured
â it followed a prolonged bullying campaign by morris which caused her victim a great deal of distress , â he added
â i hope morris âs sentence serves as a warning to others
â the attack comes amid mounting concern over a rise in the number of acid or bleach attacks
last year a newspaper investigation revealed there had been 21 court cases involving the throwing or sending of dangerous substances in 2013 â compared to just five the previous year
one of the most notorious cases came in 2008 when model katie piper sustained horrendous injuries after an ex-boyfriend arranged for acid to be thrown in her face .
