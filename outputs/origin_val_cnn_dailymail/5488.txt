andy murray led a chorus of tennis players giving drugs cheat wayne odesnik a send - off after the american player was effectively banned for life for committing another doping offence
the american journeyman was handed a 15 - year ban after being found to have taken several banned substances , including steroids , in out - of - competition tests carried out in december and january
the severity of the ban for the 29 - year - old world no 267 owes itself to odesnik already having been given a two - year ban when he was found in 2010 by australian customs officials to be importing vials of human growth hormone at melbourne airport
american tennis player wayne odesnik has been banned for 15 years after a second doping violation â wayne â¦ good riddance , â tweeted andy murray , who has been among the more vociferous players calling for an extension of anti-doping measures in tennis
andy roddick joined in the condemnation of wayne odesnik who , even before 2010 , was deeply unpopular in the locker room
he tweeted : â my feelings are that he âs a d * * * * * bag and i hate that he has a american flag to his name when he âs cheating , good riddance
â veteran british doubles player jamie delgado chimed in : â wayne odesnik cheats again , what a joke
get out of the sport mate
â andy murray later beat adrian mannarino 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 at the indian wells and will face spain âs feliciano lopez in the quarter - finals
it was andy murray âs 496th win , equalling tim henman âs record for a british man in the open era
after his victory , andy murray spoke further on wayne odesnik 's ban
he told the bbc : ' i think it 's a good thing for tennis that he 's off the tour
andy murray tweeted ' bye bye wayne ... good riddance ' before his win over adrian mannarino in indian wells ' he was given a second chance in a way
he was a cheat so it is good for everyone involved in tennis that he 's been dealt with in the right way
' i think any doping in any sport is very bad
i think it 's the job of the sports when cases do come up that they treat them very strictly and in the right way
' i think [ testing ] is going in the right direction but i do n't think it will ever be perfect
' wayne odesnik issued a statement maintaining his innocence , claiming he had accidentally ingested substances through taking an over-the - counter supplement , but he has little credit in the bank , especially after being linked to the notorious biogenesis clinic in florida two years ago
tennis has stepped up its drug - testing regime and introduced a biological passport , but many still feel that a wealthy game should allocate more resources
the fact that wayne odesnik was initially caught this time in december shows the value of more expensive out - of - competition testing compared to the cheaper option of doing it at major tournaments , where it is most expected .
