roy hodgson is holding his cards close to his chest with three lions âs squad due to be announced this week
three lions meet lithuania at wembley in euro 2016 qualifying on march 27 before travelling to the juventus stadium in turin for a friendly with italy four days later
the last time three lions played was in mid-november , when they beat scotland and slovenia with wayne rooney , danny welbeck , rickie lambert and saido berhaino
yet the contenders have arrived
harry kane , daniel sturridge , charlie austin and danny ings are among those that could be selected , and roy hodgson is set to pick four from the eight available
so , stick or twist ? well , here are the numbers that may sway roy hodgson âs decision one way or another
three lions captain wayne rooney , pictured celebrating against scotland , looks a certainty to be picked harry kane , tottenham against arsenal on february 7 , harry kane scored twice in front of watching three lions manager roy hodgson to win the north london derby
it was deja vu on march 8 , when the 21 - year - old added two more against qpr yet again in front of the three lions manager
if that does nât convince , perhaps these statistics will : only lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo ( both 41 ) have scored more than harry kane ( 26 ) in all competitions this season only sergio aguero and diego costa ( both 17 ) have more premier league goals but harry kane ( 16 ) did not start a game until november 9 harry kane has scored 14 in his last 13 premier league games and became the fourth player in history to score in six consecutive away games his goals have contributed a staggering 19 points in the premier league this season and we could go on
harry kane is used to leading a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 at tottenham , and would have to adapt to a partnership in roy hodgson âs classic 4 - 4 - 2 midfield diamond formation
even so , the question is not should roy hodgson pick the highest scoring english , but rather how could he not ? verdict : should go tottenham striker harry kane beats qpr goalkeeper robert green last week harry kane celebrates one of his many goals this season as the striker gets noticed in the premier league harry kane will hope to be involved in roy hodgson 's three lions squad when it is announced this week charlie austin , qpr qpr vs tottenham was billed as the battle of the two best kids on the playground yet , with teacher watching on , harry kane overshadowed his potential three lions team - mate
but austin , seemingly carrying the third - bottom team in the premier league , remains the fourth top goalscorer ( 15 ) , just one behind the man with better service at white hart lane
shoot on sight , seems to be the strategy
austin ranks first in total shots ( 61 ) and shooting accuracy ( 67 per cent ) out of the eight potential three lions forwards , having played more minutes ( 2,169 ) than any of the others this season
charlie austin âs goals have contributed 45 per cent of qpr âs points this season , and manager chris ramsey reckons he and harry kane would complement each other in a front two partnership
verdict : should go qpr striker charlie austin scores against arsenal at loftus road earlier in march in the premier league three lions hopeful austin is in contention to be selected by roy hodgson when his squad is announced this week wayne rooney , manchester united wayne rooney , no longer being restricted to deep midfield , was restored to an attacking role recently , and scored twice against sunderland to show he has nât lost his touch
he âs joint - first for chance conversion ( 29 per cent ) and assists ( four ) , and roy hodgson previously announced he has no intention of using him as anything other than a striker
was that a bluff ? wayne rooney could still be used as an attacking midfielder or auxiliary forward behind two strikers , without wishing to step on sterling âs toes as no 10
wayne rooney looked comfortable up top against arsenal on monday night , scoring manchester united âs only goal in a 2 - 1 defeat
â he âs our captain and nearly the record goalscorer , â roy hodgson said in february
â it would take a lot from a 19 or 20 - year - old to replace a man up front with over 100 caps
â never say never , but wayne rooney surely has a place reserved , whether that be as a striker or otherwise
verdict : should go wayne rooney has become the regular face of three lions and is set to be selected once more by roy hodgson wayne rooney celebrates young 's wining goal at st james ' park for louis van gaal 's manchester united daniel sturridge , liverpool daniel sturridge is just returning from a thigh and hamstring injury that cost him five months , but has the third best minutes - per - goal ratio ( 175 ) of the eight strikers
the fit - again liverpool forward started against blackburn rovers and burnley , rather than sterling being used in the centre , as the youngster had been against manchester city and southampton
easing daniel sturridge back in to middle of liverpool âs 3 - 4 - 3 is only natural , but he should be fit enough to be used internationally this month
plenty are calling for three lions to adopt sturrikane , and we know the former chelsea forward has no qualms in developing a partnership , as he showed with luis suarez
daniel sturridge can create something from nothing , and he and the young tottenham forward could click , if roy hodgson fancies it
verdict : should go liverpool striker daniel sturridge heads his goal against burnley in the premier league at anfield the ball nestles in the back of the net as daniel sturridge continues his recovery from an injury that cost months daniel sturridge runs away in celebration after scoring for liverpool as he continues his return to fitness berahino , west brom nobody can say berahino is nât a workhorse
the only player to have featured in all 28 premier league games , he has an admirable 12 goals and dominated back pages when he was selected by roy hodgson in november
yet he never made it off the substitutes â bench against slovenia or scotland , and it led to a run of eight games without a goal for west brom
he broke that duck against west ham with an equaliser on new year âs day , before letting his frustration out on poor , old gateshead with four goals in a 7 - 0 humiliation in the fa cup third round
roy hodgson has put plenty of faith in his young lions previously , and could well choose to give the 21 - year - old his three lions debut in march
but the fight to be roy hodgson âs fourth striker arguably rests between berahino , danny ings , austin and danny welbeck
for me , the pendulum swings the way of the qpr striker more than the rest
verdict : should not go west brom striker berahino is in contention to be selected by three lions manager hodgson berahino runs away in celebration after scoring for west brom in the premier league against aston villa berahino could be selected as he continues to show why he deserves a place in the three lions team danny ings , burnley what about the chap wanted by liverpool , both manchester clubs and real sociedad ? danny ings has scored nine goals for second - bottom burnley â five of them in 2015 alone â and has the joint-most assists of the lot ( four )
young and english with plenty to prove , he âs beating the odds week in , week out
perhaps it is that which convinced louis van gaal to send chief scout jim lawlor to anfield last week when burnley were in town
sean dyche fielded the first all - british premier league xi in december since 2011 , and danny ings is among those taking his chance in a team that use similar formations to three lions â 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 and 4 - 4 - 2
danny ings has scored four goals in seven games for the england under-21 team , but a call - up can only come if he proves more worthy than his competition , and that âs a tall ask
verdict : should not go ... yet danny ings is wanted by a number of top premier league clubs and could be called up by three lions danny ings is being looked at by manchester united , manchester city and liverpool as he is likely to leave burnley danny welbeck , arsenal against slovenia in november , danny welbeck scored twice in the euro 2016 qualifier as three lions won 3 - 1
same again ? he played as a lone striker against his former club at old trafford , scored , and celebrated
arsenal opted for 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 that night , although they tend to alter between 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 and 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 with olivier giroud the preferred striker
but danny welbeck seized the day , pouncing on antonio valencia âs suicidal back - pass and making no mistake
yet this season has not gone according to plan for arsenal forward
he âs ranked last for minutes per goals ( 379 ) out of the eight , as well as bringing up the rear in chance conversion ( 11 per cent )
does he deserve a spot more than harry kane , danny ings or austin ? not according to the rankings
verdict : should not go danny welbeck trains with arsenal as the premier league club look to clinch champions league football danny welbeck has had a dip in form recently but will be looking to clinch a place in the three lions team once more rickie lambert , liverpool rickie lambert got 10 minutes against scotland in november , having gone to brazil for the 2014 world cup , hardly getting a look - in
the 33 - year - old âs rankings tell the story better
in 19 appearances in the premier league , he ranks last for goals ( 2 ) , shots ( 12 ) , and , for a man with aerial ability , is the only one of the eight to not have scored a header
it would be bold to argue those with more than a decade on the liverpool striker are less worthy to be included in roy hodgson âs squad , and it seems rickie lambert âs time has been and gone
the consistency of harry kane and austin , among others , has blitzed the man on the wrong side of 30 , and it âs time for the young blood
verdict : should not go rickie lambert has found life difficult since joining liverpool and is unlikely to be selected by roy hodgson it would be surprising if rickie lambert ( pictured right with fabio borini in training ) was picked for the three lions team should go : wayne rooney , kane , sturridge , austin should not go : danny welbeck , berahino , danny ings , rickie lambert
