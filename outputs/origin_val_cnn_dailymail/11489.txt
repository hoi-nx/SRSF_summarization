they might not have had quite as rapturous a reception as ' willkat ' but ' chacam ' , as the local media has christened them , certainly know how to put on a show
so far , the star is proving to be camilla who showed off her increasingly confident sense of style during a reception at the british ambassador 's residence in washington d.c. last night
resplendent in a shimmering silk gown by bruce oldfield and her trademark pearl choker , the duchess of cornwall cut a glamorous figure as she arrived on the arm of prince charles
arriving to cries of ' welcome your highness ! ' , a clearly delighted prince of wales happily stopped to chat to schoolchildren and their parents outside the lincoln memorial
not everyone knew who they were however , with one little boy asking his mother : ' who is that man ? ' ' the future king of england , ' she replied as she swiftly snapped a photo on her iphone
charles and camilla are now on the third day of a four - day state visit that has been described as ' your grandfather 's royal visit ' by the local washington post
new name : the royal couple have been re-christened ' chacam ' by the local media warm welcome : both charles and camilla have enjoyed a rapturous reception from local people in a piece headlined , ' camilla and charles do nât get the willkat [ william and kate ] treatment , but it âs still royal ' , the paper went on to contrast the ' high - volume excitement worthy of boy - band ' that greeted the duke of cambridge with the quieter one offered to his father
but while charles and camilla are n't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation , the visit is seen as ' crucial ' - for charles at least
that echoes comments made by british ambassador to the united states sir peter westmacott who described the tour as being a fillip for american relations
' i am so pleased to welcome the prince of wales and camilla back to the united states , ten years after their first official visit together , ' he said ahead of the royal couple 's arrival on tuesday night
looking around : charles and camilla spent their first full day touring washington d.c. star of the show : camilla , who is clearly been enjoying the tour , has enjoyed a particularly warm welcome smile ! yesterday , the duchess of cornwall obligingly posed for a selfie outside the lincoln memorial cheering for charles : local teenagers wait for the royal couple to emerge from the lincoln memorial ' their trip to washington d.c. and kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values , combating climate change , preserving the natural environment , creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the royal family play in keeping that relationship special
' much of the itinerary is taken up with marking big anniversaries , among them the 800th birthday of the magna carta and the 150th anniversary of lincoln 's assassination
both were ticked off the list yesterday , with charles and camilla starting the day at the lincoln memorial in washington d.c. and , in charles ' case , ending it at the national archives for a viewing of the 1297 magna carta
today 's schedule , which , if yesterday is any indication , will also be covered rather breathlessly by the local press , will see ' chacam ' visit president lincoln 's cottage in washington d.c. later , the royal couple will be whisked to the white house where they will meet president obama in the oval office for the second time since he took office
president obama is the sixth american president to entertain charles , who has visited the united states on 23 separate occasions , during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last
