forensic tests on the body of argentina state prosecutor alberto nisman who accused the president of a cover - up with iran indicate that he was murdered , his ex-wife said today
he was found shot dead in the bathroom of his locked apartment in january , hours before he was due to testify against president cristina fernandez de kirchner in the congress
he was trying to arrest the president after claiming she helped cover up iran 's alleged role in a 1994 bombing which killed 85 at a jewish community centre in buenos aires
the mysterious circumstances surrounding mr alberto nisman 's death unleashed a storm of conspiracy theories
his ex-wife , arroyo salgado , hired a private team to analyse the autopsy results and run additional tests
on the offensive : argentina president cristina fernandez de kirchner ( left ) has denied claims helped iran cover up a terrorist attack
the claims were made by alberto nisman ( right ) - who was mysteriously shot dead argentina authorities have not released full results of his autopsy , more than six weeks after he was found sprawled in a pool of blood in his flat
the few details made public so far have suggested suicide , although the lead investigator into mr alberto nisman 's death said she could not categorically say if he shot himself in the head or was killed
but today , his ex-wife - the mother of their two children - said : ' alberto nisman did n't have an accident
he did n't commit suicide
' earlier today , ms arroyo salgado , who is a judge , deposited the forensic evidence backing up her allegations at the state prosecutors ' office in buenos aires
she did not give details of the findings to journalists
yesterday , a full - page advert , signed by the government of argentina and bearing an argentina flag , questioned mr alberto nisman 's motives and attacked his argument
' one must ask oneself what objectives alberto nisman was pursuing with a complaint plagued with contradictions , lacking logic and without legal basis , ' it declared
mrs cristina fernandez de kirchner : the president 's name was on a draft warrant discovered in the home of alberto nisman ' can one think of a hypothesis other than seeking to generate a destabilising political effect ? ' mr alberto nisman had accused the president and top administration officials of helping iran officials hide their and iran 's alleged role in the country 's worst - ever terrorist attack
his 289 - page investigation , which was published a few days after his death , was based on wiretaps of top administration officials that he argued proved the secret deal with iran
according to mr alberto nisman , the president allegedly orchestrated the deal in exchange for economic trade
ms cristina fernandez de kirchner rejected the allegations , and iran denied any role in the bombing
the prosecutor was found shot in the head in his apartment in the capital 's upmarket puerto madero district on january 18 , triggering protests in the streets
his mysterious death triggered a pr fightback by the government , whose officials said the prosecutor was trying to smear the nation
senior government official gustavo lopez claimed last month the allegations were part of an attempt to unseat the president and bring neoliberals back to power
' we are facing an attempted coup d'etat , that aims to get rid of the president , ' he wrote
but the alleged smears have upset other politicians
cornelia schmidt-liermann told the associated press : ' it 's awful to see so many accusations against a person who ca n't defend himself
' instead of clarifying anything , fernandez is damaging the investigation into alberto nisman 's death
' anger : protesters clashed with police after the death of the prosecutor in his locked apartment in january horror : the 1994 bombing of a jewish centre , run by the argentine israelite mutual association , left 85 dead and remains the country 's most deadly terrorist attack
iran has denied it was involved yesterday 's newspaper advert highlighted a judge 's ruling which said mr alberto nisman 's argument had a lack of ' coherence and integration '
judge daniel rafecas , who made the ruling , said : ' there is not a single element of evidence , even circumstantial , that points to the head of state
' that ruling was appealed yesterday by prosecutor gerardo pollicita , who has taken up the case following mr alberto nisman 's death
he said the judges ' decision was ' premature ' and an investigation was needed to ' prove or disprove the facts '
the appeal sends the case to the federal chamber of judges , which can uphold or reject last week 's decision by federal judge rafecas
argentina will go to the polls in october , but the president is barred from running for a third term by the country 's constitution and will have to step down
she has nevertheless gone on the offensive , accusing opposition parties of using the row for political gain and claiming the u.s. and israel were meddling in argentina 's affairs .
