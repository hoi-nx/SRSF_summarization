a florida middle school student was found with an arsenal of weapons in his backpack last wednesday
the 13 - year - old boy , whose name is being withheld , was caught when another boy was seen handing him a knife in the cafeteria at sunrise middle school in fort lauderdale
upon further inspection , it was revealed he was also carrying a smith & wesson firearm , another knife , ammunition , a mask and fireworks
the teenager was eventually released , but could now face charges of weapons possession and disruption of a school function
both the boy 's mother and attorney , jim stark , refused requests for comment
the student who was caught giving the other boy a knife was also taken in under the baker act and released
his age and identity are not known at this time
principal michael walker notified parents of the incident in an email last friday , and this week assured them that the school was safe , though he did not reveal any specifics of what had occurred on that day
despite his assurances however , many teachers are still afraid
' it seems calculated , whatever the [ student 's ] plan was , ' said mary fitzgerald , a schoolteacher for over 35 years and the school 's teachers union steward
' i 've never , never in all the years of teaching , even heard of this in broward county
' the incident occured at sunrise middle school ( above ) in fort lauderdale another meeting has been scheduled for thursday evening with faculty , and a more detailed account of what happened has been posted in an online forum only accessible by staff at the school
under school guidelines , possession of a class a weapon is grounds for expulsion
' student safety is always the district 's highest priority , and the school followed all the proper protocols and have worked to keep parents informed , ' said cathleen brennan , a spokeswoman for broward county public schools
teachers however still seem unsure of how to deal with last week 's event with their students
' if teachers feel safe , the students will feel safe , ' said fitzgerald
