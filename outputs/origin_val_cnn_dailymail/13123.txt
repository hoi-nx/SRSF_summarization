if you have n't yet been asked by friends or co-workers to meerkat , chances are you will soon
the livestreaming app was the " sxsw sweetheart " this year , despite having only launched on february 27
it 's been adding users rapidly ever since -- even jimmy fallon is streaming his life using meerkat
as part of cnn 's instant startups series , cnnmoney correspondent segall reached out to meerkat 's rubin with some questions
and he agreed to answer them -- on meerkat , of course
you can see a few moments from the chat in the video above
rubin is actually the co-founder and chief executive of life on air inc. , a livestreaming company with many tentacles
but recently rubin decided to dedicate his entire team to work on meerkat after the app 's popularity exploded
still , rubin said , he does n't consider the app an " instant startup " per se
it took years of work to reach this moment , he said
the half - hour chat between rubin and segall was informative and entertaining
several people said it broke their record for the longest meerkat stream they had ever watched
we heard more about meerkat and rubin 's vision for the future ; for example , he sees the app branching out to work with other platforms , like facebook or tumblr
rubin also revealed who he 'd like most to join in the fun
startup wannabes also got some great advice from this successful entrepreneur
launching a new business or product is difficult , and requires flexibility , rubin said
entrepreneurs need people they can trust -- who wo n't be afraid to call " b.s
" on a bad idea
