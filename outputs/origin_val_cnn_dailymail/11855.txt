damaging splits have opened in the upper ranks of the conservative party over cameron âs plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration
the prime minister and home secretary theresa may have become increasingly isolated in their determination to fix a new measure for bringing net migration under control
mr cameron is considering including two different targets in next month âs manifesto â including a specific target to slash net migration from outside the eu , which , unlike eu migration , ministers can fully control
conservative rift : splits have opened in the upper ranks of the tories over cameron âs plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration - with the prime minister and theresa may becoming increasingly isolated he is also expected to re-state his commitment to sharply reducing overall net migration
but senior figures , including chancellor george osborne , health secretary jeremy hunt and communities secretary eric pickles are understood to have voiced doubts about the idea
it follows the failure of mr cameron âs 2010 pledge to reduce overall net migration to the â tens of thousands â
last week , the figure hit 300,000 â fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the eu of 190,000
left - wing tories outside of the cabinet , who are in favour of a more relaxed borders policy , have seized on the figures as their moment to strike
they believe that , in the wake of this shuddering failure , it is easier to make the case for scrapping the target altogether
yesterday , ex-cabinet minister kenneth clarke said : â we will have to drop the target
it would not be possible to achieve it without damaging our economy quite severely
i âm afraid that the net migration target has proved to be a mistake
â george osborne is said to be among thoseto to have voiced doubts about the prime minister 's idea baroness warsi , a former foreign office minister , added : â if you set yourself unrealistic targets , you are setting yourself up to fail and , in the long term , turn the whole thing into a bigger issue by fuelling the perception that the government ca nât get a grip
â but mrs may is understood to believe that giving up on the target would be a huge error , not least because immigration still ranks in the top two concerns of voters
she recently resigned from the advisory board of a prominent conservative think tank , called bright blue , which has publicly criticised the idea of a migration target
in a report , the right - of - centre organisation declared : â putting an unreliable cap on net migration centre - stage has meant that other measures of competency have been missed and unnoticed
â its findings were given positive coverage in both the left - wing guardian and independent newspapers
one senior government source , who supports the migration target , said : â this is the coming fight in the party â liberal metropolitans versus people who have lived in the real world
â illegal migrants run on october 29 , 2014 behind a truck to try to board it in calais last october over the past five years , mrs may has introduced a series of policies to bring migration from outside the eu under control
these included a crackdown on bogus students and sham marriages
however , plans to go further â including the introduction of bonds for visitors â were blocked by the treasury and the department for business , innovation and skills
yesterday , immigration minister james brokenshire , an ally of mrs may , dropped strong hints a target would feature in the manifesto so that â people can measure â progress made in cutting immigration
he said : â we do believe very strongly that net migration matters
long - term figures will show you that net migration to this country over the long term has been in that below the 100,000 figure
so , we âre looking very carefully and we will be coming back so people can measure us on what success looks like in terms of our migration policy
â he added : â the prime minister has said that we will come back and set out what you can measure us on â because that âs the key thing â on how we perform , on controlling our immigration system
â the number of migrants in calais has dropped by two thirds in recent weeks â suggesting many have managed to dodge border controls and reach britain
the latest figures reveal that some 2,500 africans , asians and eastern europeans were in the french port town over the christmas period but that number has now fallen to around 1,000
break for the border : migrants try to get into a lorry as it fills up with fuel near calais last night it emerged that on one day in january alone a fire in the town caused chaos and allowed 300 migrants to sneak through the channel tunnel
a winter storm also caused major problems for border officials when a large section of fencing was blown down near the truck parking area
hundreds more have succeeded in stowing away on trucks and vehicles from french ports such as caen and cherbourg where border controls are less stringent
in recent weeks albanian people smugglers have moved their profitable operations down the coast from calais and managed to load a number of migrants on to lorries at motorway rest areas
a recent head count in calais revealed that only around 1,000 africans , asians and eastern europeans are now sleeping rough and in squats and at three open air camps in calais
shortly after christmas when a similar survey was carried out the number was put at some 2,500
the french newspaper nord littoral reported over the weekend : â it is difficult to estimate the number of migrants present in calais but one thing is certain â it has decreased significantly
