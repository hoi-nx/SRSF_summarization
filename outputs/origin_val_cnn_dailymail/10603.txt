celtic manager deila has insisted that he has no regrets over publicly targeting a domestic treble in his first season as celtic boss
the norwegian has set the bar high and riled opponents by repeatedly saying he wants nothing less than a clean sweep
jock stein and martin o'neill are the only parkhead managers in the club âs history to have achieved the feat. celtic boss deila will be hoping to get his hands on the scottish league cup this weekend deila believes he set his side a realistic target in trying to win a domestic treble however , deila defended the treble talk , saying : â what âs the worst thing that can happen ? that you do nât reach your goals ? â i can say i am happy to win one title this year and reach a goal
you can say something else , but everybody knows the demands of this club
i have said that all season and there is so much hard work and so many games but we have a good chance to win a trophy on sunday and we have prepared for that
â the accepted practice for managers is to try to remove pressure and expectation from the shoulders of their players by playing down trophy talk , but deila rejects that idea completely
â i learned at stromsgodset that if you say you are satisfied to be number six then you come sixth
â if you say then that you only want to get to the cup final then you lose the cup final
â you have to say you want to win the league or scottish league cup
you have to reach for something
it âs in your head mentally
martin o'neill was the last manager to win the domestic treble at celtic â this club is so big and has such a good team that it âs possible
if i did nât think it was possible i would nât say it
but i know it âs possible and that âs why i set high goals and make high demands
â desperate to win his first trophy as celtic manager , deila has removed a ban on his daughters attending games following some early setbacks when they attended
â i have to be fair with them
they were at the aberdeen game , away , standing with the supporters
it was a crazy experience for them
they just said that the supporters were crazy and they do nât look at the football match
they smelled of smoke and beer
but they will be here on sunday
â famously pictured removing his clothes on the pitch after stromsgodset avoided relegation , deila says he has no plans to embarrass his daughters by repeating the feat if he wins on sunday
â they are used to it
they âve seen their father doing stupid things before
they are 15 years old and they are probably a little embarrassed about that
â they were there when i took off my clothes after that game
we were sitting on the couch the day after that game , watching it on television
it was not a great sight
if we win on sunday you can expect a good celebration with the others
i will not take off my clothes
