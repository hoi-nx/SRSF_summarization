pugachev , who was once branded ' putin 's banker ' , said the order has made it difficult for him and his partner , alexandra tolstoy , to support their home
last year it was reported the couple , who have three children and own a Â£ 12million house , employ two housekeepers , three nannies , two drivers and a live - in doctor
and ms alexandra tolstoy , 41 , said it was hard to live on the Â£ 10,000 - a - week allowed by the court
mr pugachev , the former billionaire business partner of the queen 's nephew viscount linley is accused in moscow of siphoning more than Â£ 655million in funds from mezhprombank , which filed for insolvency in 2010 , including $ 700 million in russian central bank bailout money
the 52 - year - old former tycoon , who denies any wrongdoing , complained the freeze has left him unable to support alexandra tolstoy who said last year it was hard to live on the Â£ 10,000 a week allowed by the court
' i can be called a poor man
i do not have money to support my family and my property , and this is more important than paying the lawyers , ' he told vedomosti newspaper in moscow , blaming the arrest of his bank accounts and assets
he said he has borrowed $ 5 million towards his $ 10 million legal bill , but was now unable to take more loans because his assets were frozen
as a result , he has dispensed with his lawyers
last year , his socialite partner - a distant relative of leo tolstoy - said ' we are just surviving ' on the Â£ 10,000 a week allowance
the deposit insurance agency in moscow , which is taking the legal action , claim the ' statements of his partner alexandra tolstoy ' about their lifestyle belie ' his declarations about financial difficulties '
a source claimed his move to dispense with his british lawyers ' looks like a tactical trick and is aimed at making obstacles for english justice '
last week a london court of appeal judge ruled that pugachev , also previously nicknamed ' cashier to the kremlin ' , must disclose further information about trusts he uses to bolster his income
lavish : last year it was reported the couple , pictured together , who have three children and own a Â£ 12million house , employ two housekeepers , three nannies , two drivers and a live - in doctor ' sophisticated and wily operators should not be able to make themselves immune to the courts ' orders , ' said the judge
pugachev claims he is the victim of a ' politically motivated ' asset grab by figures in the russan elite of which he was a member before fleeing to london
his property was ' expropriated by the state and by private persons ' , and sold at rock bottom prices , he claimed
he also alleged in court that a senior deposit insurance agency official earlier made ' a brazen attempt to extort money ' from him , and threatened that ' he or his family could be physically harmed '
in november , interpol put pugachev on its wanted list at russian 's request , with putin 's spokesman alleging : ' he built up huge amounts of debts and then ran away
' struggle : ms alexandra tolstoy , pictured , said ' she and her husband are just surviving ' on the Â£ 10,000 a week allowance faced by the legal moves in moscow , pugachev in october blasted putin , claiming all russian businessmen are now ' serfs ' under his total control
' today in russian there is no private property
there are only serfs who belong to putin , ' he told the financial times , in a blunt warning over the collapse of regulated capitalism in his homeland
' now there is putin and there are his lieutenants who carry out his orders - and all cash generated is put on the balance of putin , ' he alleged
' the country is in a state of war
and therefore big business can not live as before
it has to live under military rules
' he alleged : ' if putin says he wants to buy something , you can not say that you do not want to sell
' if he says ' i want to buy something ' then you say , ' thanks for saying you want to buy it , and not just taking it
