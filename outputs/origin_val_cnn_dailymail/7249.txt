ms alina fernandez began attending meetings of the orthodox party , which opposed corruption in the government
at the time , castro , then without his now - famous beard , was married to diaz-balart , whom he met while studying law at the university of havana
he first laid eyes on ms alina fernandez at a protest marking the anniversary of the 1871 slaying of independence - minded medical students by spanish soldiers
castro dispatched a mutual friend who introduced the pair
a few days later , the same friend approached ms alina fernandez , wanting to know if castro could drop by her house
' of course , ' she replied
' after five o'clock , i 'm always home
' ' he was the kind of person who could n't be ignored
if he was in a room , people paid attention to him , ' alina fernandez told us news and world report in 1999
' i too had a certain charm of my own
' castro was briefly jailed soon after for leading an underground movement against strongman batista , and he did n't turn up at ms revuelta 's for months
but after he did , her home became a key planning area for the attack on the moncada army barracks in eastern cuban
ms alina fernandez was ' one of an extraordinary contingent of beautiful and / or highly intelligent women who , in effect , dedicated their lives to ( castro ) and his cause , ' tad szulc wrote in castro : a critical portrait
she handed over all of her savings of 6,000 pesos â then worth the same amount in dollars â to support his movement , and later pawned her sapphires , emeralds and diamond jewelry for his cause
she sewed fatigues for his rebels to wear , and delivered castro 's uprising manifesto to top havana newspaper editors

ms alina fernandez wrote to castro frequently when he was in prison
she sent him scores of books by dostoevsky , freud , and hugo and an envelope of sand to remind him of the beach
castro 's prison love letters to ms alina fernandez are one of the few glimpses into his closely guarded emotional side : ' i am on fire
write to me , for i can not be without your letters , ' he wrote in 1954
' i have been meaning to ask you for several days now to stop using the typewriter once in a while and write longhand
i love your handwriting , so delicate , feminine , unmistakable , ' he wrote
the rebel and diaz-balart divorced , in part because one of his letters to ms alina fernandez was mistakenly delivered to his wife
castro was freed , and he and ms alina fernandez became lovers for what she said was the first time
she became pregnant , though she did n't tell castro until after he had fled to mexico later that year
castro then asked ms alina fernandez to come to mexico and marry him , but she refused , convinced he would not survive
alina was born in march 1956 , six months before castro returned to cuban and took to the sierra maestra mountains
castro did not recognize his daughter , and ms alina fernandez 's estranged husband gave her his last name
the future cuban leader eventually told alina at 12 she could become a castro , but by then she did n't want to , according to her memoir
castro 's rarely seen emotional side is visible in letters to ms alina fernandez from prison in which he says he is ' on fire
