real madrid and barca have two of the most talented , and expensively assembled , teams in world football
but who would make a combined xi out of the two squads based , not on reputation , but on current form ? allow me to get ahead of the fury of the comments section
if you 're ancelotti do you pick cristiano ronaldo ? of course you do
cristiano ronaldo may be the world player of the year , but on current form he does n't make combined xi our combined xi , which has no place for cristiano ronaldo , but does feature some of the world 's best players cristiano ronaldo has n't scored a league goal from open play in a month , and bale is preferred on the wing did cristiano ronaldo have a brilliant first four months of the season ? of course he did ? might he score the winner on sunday ? quite possibly
does he deserve to be in a combined xi based on current form
no. goalkeeper - marc-andre ter stegen there are four to choose from
keylor navas has barely played and iker casillas continues make mistakes in big games â schalke , atletico madrid - so that leaves the two barca goalkeepers
claudio bravo is the league keeper but every time marc-andre ter stegen plays he impresses and he âs fresh from a penalty save in midweek
marc-andre ter stegen has not played in the league this season , but he has earned his chance this week right back - dani alves it âs a close call between dani alves and dani carvajal but the brazilian shades it after an aggressive , positive performance in midweek and because for all his much - debated defensive shortcomings dani carvajal has actually shown many of the same deficiencies of late
dani alves put in a strong performance against manchester city , and just shades real madrid 's dani carvajal centre back - gerard pique one of the best defenders in europe this season â so much for the poster boy with the pop star wife who was now more interested in playing poker and running his web business than playing football
no one has been better than gerard pique , not at barca , not in la liga , not anywhere
gerard pique , europe 's best defender this season , stops sergio aguero in the champions league centre back - pepe he gets in just ahead of sergio ramos courtesy of the spain defender having only just come back from injury
pepe has held together real madrid âs defence in his partner âs absence and is playing like a man who wants and will probably be given a new contract
has shown why manuel pellegrini wanted him at the start of the season
portuguese centre back pepe has been in excellent form in recent weeks , holding the real madrid defence together sergio ramos ( left ) has returned to fitness , and should start on sunday , but pepe just pips him in our team left back - jordi alba a very close call between jordi alba and marcelo
alba is the fastest full - back in football
the only defender quicker than jesus navas and he showed it on wednesday
marcelo offers real madrid so much going forward and has improved defensively but alba shades it
jordi alba proved against jesus navas that he is the fastest full back in the world , and he makes the xi real madrid 's left back marcelo has improved his game , and offers plenty going forward , but just misses out right midfield - ivan rakitic scored against manchester city and in the league against granada two weeks before
the croatian is starting to show the sort of form that made him one of la liga âs best midfielders last season
ivan rakitic has been a top performer for barca recently , including his well - taken goal in midweek centre midfield - mascherano it was bad luck for manchester city that when injury hit barca before the midweek second leg it probably made them even stronger
sergio busquets is perhaps the second best holding midfielder in the world , mascherano , who as roy hodgson well knows ( after getting slightly carried away and selecting him as the world 's best player in the ballon dâor vote ) , is the best
the injury to sergio busquets has allowed mascherano ( left ) to prove again that he is the world 's best left midfield - isco he is not the complete midfielder that many real madrid supporters seem to believe he is but all the same he is in very special form at the moment and in this team he can play alongside messi , who famously has a dog named after
isco is in a rich vein of form for the european champions recently , and can thrive in a number of positions right forward - messi does there need to be an explanation here ? messi mesmorised manchester city in midweek with a performance for the ages at the nou camp messi is currently the best player in the world , on form , and possibly even the greatest of all time centre - forward - suarez selecting between suarez and karim benzema was one of the toughest choices but in this combined super-team you have messi dropping into midfield so the battering ram that is suarez gets in ahead of him
suarez just edges in ahead of karim benzema to allow for his combination with messi up front left forward - bale it has to be bale or cristiano ronaldo or neymar so what can you do ? neymar and cristiano ronaldo both went off in a huff in their last league games , bale scored twice to silence some of the disproportionate criticism he has been on the end off
put bale back on the left where he can whip the ball on his favoured foot or just do as he did last season against barca in the copa del rey final and power so far in front of his marker that he can still cut inside and shoot
there is also only one player who has scored with a direct free - kick for real madrid this season ... and it is nât ronaldo it âs bale
total : barca 8 real madrid 3 bale gets in ahead of cristiano ronaldo after his two goals , complete with great celebration , against levante bale can have a real impact if he is moved back to the left hand side , and starts up front in our team
