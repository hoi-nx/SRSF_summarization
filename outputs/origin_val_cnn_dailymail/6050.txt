a plague of mutant ginger rats first spotted in scotland are feared to have made their way south of the border , it was revealed last night
a shocking video taken by two revellers in newcastle shows 60 large rodents scurrying down the street in a popular area of the city on saturday
now , there are claims the rats could be the same giant ginger species recently spotted 60 miles away in hawick in the scotland borders - which were feared to be moving south
mr donaghey said : â we walked around the corner and we saw dozens of rats
you only see a few on the video but when we first went around the corner there were about 50 or 60
â they were all over the bins and then running down the road
there were a few other people walking past so i âd shout â watch ! â and then they saw them
â the video shows rats scuttling over the cobbles of a back lane and onto a nearby stretch of grass , squeaking loudly
the rodents are feared to be the same as the beasts spotted in hawick last week
shocking video : there are claims the rats in newcastle could be the same giant ginger species recently spotted 60 miles away in hawick in the scotland borders - which were feared to be moving south running : the video shows rats scuttling over the cobbles of a back lane and onto a nearby stretch of grass numerous sightings were being reported to the council on a daily basis - and the rodents are believed to have ginger fur because freed domestic rats have been breeding with wild scotland rats
newcastle city council âs environment manager edwin foster said : â littering and poor refuse storage attract vermin
traders have a legal responsibility to make sure they store and dispose of their refuse correctly
â â pest control officers have been treating this area and will continue to do so , but people must understand the rats are there because people are leaving rubbish for the rats to feed on
â in hawick , one businessman said he had seen â dozens â of rats at a time on an industrial estate , while a pest controller in scotland confirmed that he had been killing rodents on the site for months
but he added that it was becoming increasingly difficult to exterminate the creatures due to fear of killing other animals
a scottish borders council spokesman said it was monitoring the rats there
last year , a 2ft - long rat was captured in cornwall a new breed of genetically - mutated â super rats â is spreading at alarming speeds , experts say
the rodents , which have been seen elsewhere in britain over the past year , are twice as large as normal species and can not be killed with traditional substances
earlier this year a swarm of mutant 20 - inch rats that are immune to poison were found in swindon , wiltshire
scientists have been charting the super rat invasion into new communities by monitoring their progress in 17 counties in the britain
genetic testing by huddersfield university has revealed that the rodents have developed a mutation that allows them to survive conventional poisons
research earlier this year found that the swarm of â super rats â spotted across the country is expected to outnumber humans two - to - one by next year
last year , a 2ft - long rat was captured in cornwall , with other huge rodents seen in kent and liverpool
birmingham reported the most rat - related call - outs , with 5,100 in the past year
