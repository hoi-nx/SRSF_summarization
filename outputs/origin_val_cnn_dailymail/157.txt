of all the terrible things a single mother has endured since discovering a malignant tumour in her breast , one of the worst was how to explain to her young daughter that she had cancer
following her diagnosis in may 2014 , 42 - year - old city worker ebba worried most about how six - year - old lene would take the news
her greatest fear was that lene would be left without a mother at a young age , just like her own mother had been
ebba 's grandmother had died of liver cancer when ebba 's mother was only 10
ebba is proud of how daughter lene , six , has dealt with her breast cancer diagnosis ebba , who is originally from germany and now lives in london , said : ' when i was first diagnosed , i had all the shock , horror and anxiety to deal with and i worried history would repeat itself
' my grandmother died of liver cancer when she was 33 and my mother was 10
i was told she was in horrific pain and that has always informed my image of cancer
' after finding a lump in her breast , ebba waited until she had confirmation that it was cancer following a number of tests before broaching the subject with her daughter one bedtime
' i thought it would be the worst thing ever to tell lene and i was worried i would dissolve into tears , ' she told mailonline
' but i forgot that children do n't have the same images of people being bald and throwing up
' beforehand i was very stressed and tearful at the thought of having to tell lene but when it happened she was calm
' she 'd never heard of cancer before so her first response was to be puzzled
i did n't get the reaction i 'd had from other people that something terrible was happening to me so in the end it was one of the few occasions i did n't cry when telling someone i had cancer
' mother and daughter pictured after one of ebba 's chemo sessions when she started to lose her hair ebba tried to make her hairloss fun for her daughter so it was less traumatic for them both since her diagnosis , ebba and lena have found ' the clouds toolkit ' a useful resource to help them through the incredibly difficult time
created by the fruit fly collective using money raised through red nose day , the resource pack provides invaluable guidance to parents on how to talk to their children about what cancer is and the treatments and side - effects involved
designed by psychotherapists and artists , it includes puppets , photos and illustrations which help families share their emotions and gain a greater understanding of what lies ahead
as ebba explains , children often need reassurance about issues that adults would n't usually consider - like whether cancer is contagious - and are most alarmed by the hair loss caused by chemotherapy
' when we initially talked about it , lene was most concerned about hair loss , i still remember her eyes looking big and shocked when i told her my hair would fall out , ' ebba said
' she was also worried about catching cancer and i found her looking for lumps
' when ebba did start to lose her hair , she found a way to make it less traumatic for lene
she said : ' they say it 's good to take control before it starts so i looked online for nice head scarves and in a funny way i was looking forward to wearing them
' it meant that when it happened it was a big event but not too traumatic for me
but lene found my hair loss very tough to deal with , very disconcerting
ebba wearing a scarf , left , and wig , right , her daughter helped her choose following her chemo ' i 'd decided i was going to shave my hair off so we had a little party and my daughter cut my hair
i invited a few friends and we had drinks and biscuits
lene took the scissors and then everyone else got involved
' thanks to eight gruelling chemotherapy cycles , two operations , and forthcoming radio therapy , ebba is getting better and hopes to make a full recovery
she said : ' now from what they can see it looks like the primary cancer is gone and i should be cancer free
but it 's hard to say i 'm cured because some of the cancer cells may have survived and escaped into the rest of my body so i 'll have annual check - ups and hope for the best
' ebba said it 's been a difficult time for both her and lene but she has felt proud of the way her daughter has adapted and coped
she said : ' i 'm amazed at how calm lene has been all the way through
when i had my first cycle we were all very scared and she papered my bedroom with get well cards
' she has always tried to cheer me up and encouraged me to look nice
she pressed me to get a wig , to put on a nice dress and make - up so i would feel better
' she reads to me and when i 've been really sick and tired she sits next to me and draws very quietly instead of jumping across the furniture like she normally would
' like most mothers , the thought of dying and leaving my daughter is really hard to deal with
but one thing i 've learned through all this is that she is extremely adaptable and would be okay
' the clouds toolkit , pictured , gives parents with cancer information on how to support their children for any other parents who find themselves in the same terrible situation , ebba has the following advice : ' i think it 's really important to let children get involved and have an active role as much as they can
' all of the things lene has done have made her feel part of things
just like adults , if children feel included and are able do something to help it gives them an important feeling of having some control over their situation
' she added : ' i think being honest is also really important
children already know when something is up , they sense the emotional temperature and see the hugs and furtive conversations so you ca n't lie to them , especially if they are older child as they might get upset when they find out
you do n't want to fall apart in front of them but do n't totally hide what you 're feeling either , let them be part of your journey
' she also recommends the the clouds resource pack which is available via www.fruitflycollective.com
ebba said : ' it was really brilliant
from a kid 's perspective it 's like a treasure box and it was nice to have something lene could open and explore
' it was a massive help to learn about things and i think it 's really important to be honest with children because healthy communications help families get through cancer more easily
lene kept her mother 's spirits up with get well cards like this one she created lene wrote her experiences down in a book to hep her deal with them , like when she helped ebba chose a wig lene 's story , which she wants to sell to raise money , shows how they coped when ebba 's hair fell out ' it was a great way to kick off the conversation
i gave this box to my child and she opened it
there were things for her to play with and it really helped to explain to her about the good and bad cells
' it turned into a game and the whole thing was very relaxed , which is the beauty of it because it does n't feel like a big deal
it 's also been really useful to have something to refer back to when we 've been talking about things later on
' one of the ideas suggested in the information pack was for lene to write down her feelings
so she has created a storybook about her experiences called ' how it is with breast cancer '
the selfless six - year - old wants to get the book published so she can support other children going through what she has experienced and give any money made from sales to charity
