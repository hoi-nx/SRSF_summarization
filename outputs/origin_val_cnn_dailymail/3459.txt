last rites : kerobokan ( pictured , this week ) will hold a special hindu ceremony for chan and sukumaran asking the gods to bless the men before they make their final journey to their deaths is all hope lost ? bali 's chief prosecutor says he is now certain that sukumaran ( above , left ) and chan ( right ) will be moved from bali to nusakambangan island this week to be out to the firing squad a masked member of the mobile paramilitary brigade ' brimob ' armed with an assault rifle will be among 22 officers who will accompany chan and sukumaran from kerobokan prison to denpasar airport , which they last saw ten years ago on arrival for their ill - fated heroin smuggling trip these armed personnel carriers belonging to the indonesian special police will be used in the transfer of the two australian to bali 's airport whereupon they will be placed in sukhoi jets and likely flown straight to cilacap , which is just a short trip to their place of execution , nusakambangan another woman , vietnamese tran thi bich hanh who was executed on the same night but at boyolali on the mainland in java , said in a final submission , ' whenever god wants me to die i am ready '
news emerging from cilacap , the nearest port to nuskambangan island , is that the town is filling up with indonesian navy special forces
mr samiarso said nuskambangan , which houses seven prisons amid thick rain forest on the 30km long island , was now ready to receive chan and sukumaran
' everything is ready , ' he said , reports nine news , ' it will be this week for sure
' indonesian police carry out an ant - terrorist drill at pasir putih prison , the ' supermax ' of nuskambangan 's seven correctional facilities on the island where chan and sukumaran are due to be shot this week after weeks of deadly anticipation it appears that nusakambangan , where police were pictured ( above ) this week taking part in an anti-terrorist drill is finally ready to carry out the deaths by firing squad of ten drug traffickers including the australians chan and sukumaran indonesian plans to hold the australian and eight other convicted drug traffickers in one of the island 's prisons before they are simultaneously killed by firing squads in the middle of the night
the prisons boss for central java provence , ahmad yuspahruddin , confirmed last week that special isolation cells had been prepared for the australian pair or batu , or ' stone ' prison away from the jail 's other inmates weho were n't on death row
the transfer of chan and sukumaran to nusakambangan , which had been predicted more than a week ago , was delayed by the logistics of carrying out the execution of ten people at once
sukumaran pictured in 2006 just after the death sentence had been passed on him and chan , less than a year after the pair and the seven drug mules they consigned to carry 8.3kg of heroin into australian had been caught and jailed the men spent time with family members , although sukumaran 's father , chinthu and siblings , brother chinthu and sister brinthe returned to australian on sunday
last friday , indonesian 's mobile paramilitary brigade , brimob , who will carry out the executions , staged a dress rehearsal in bali to demonstrate how the australian drug smugglers will be transferred from kerobokan jail to the execution island
in the exercise , 22 heavily - armed officers clad in balaclavas took the ' prisoners ' , played by two police officers , on and off a military plane , represented by a bus
if mr samiarso 's statement is correct , pleas for clemency by australian 's foreign minister julie bishop and , in a phone call directly to indonesian president joko widowo , prime minister tony abbott , havefallen on deaf ears
chan , 31 , and sukumaran , 34 , were the leaders of an 8.3kg heroin trafficking ring dubbed the ' bali 9 ' who were convicted of attempting to smuggle the drugs out of indonesian to australian in 2005
they were sentenced to death in february 2006 and have been living in kerobokan
the other eight due to face the firing squad are : filipina mary jane fiesta veloso , nigeria raheem agbaje salami , serge areski atlaoui of france , martin anderson of ghana , indonesian zainal abidin , silvester obikwe of nigeria and rodrigo gularte , a paranoid schizophrenic man from brazil whose family has desperately fought to be transferred to a hospital .
