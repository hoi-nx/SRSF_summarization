' built for a life in the trees , the veiled chameleons also have zygodactyl feet that can easily grasp branches , their eyes can rotate independently and look in two directions at once and their tongue can project 1.5 times their body length to capture prey
' they can literally look forwards and backwards at the same time , which enables them to be on the watch for predators and food at all times , ' said michael
visitors will be able to see these amazing adaptations in action when up to four of the new hatchlings go on display once they reach maturity
the remaining hatchlings will move to other australian zoos and wildlife parks once they reach two - three months old
