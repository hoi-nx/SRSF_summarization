and on tuesday the inside of the $ 3.5m mansion was revealed

back inside , the kitchen has a centre island fitted with white countertops and cabinets , as well as stainless steel fixtures
white features : a large kitchen features white countertops and cabinets , as well as stainless steel features open plan : with no division between the living room ( right ) and dining room ( left ) , glass walls give the house an open and airy feel the main part of the mansion features an open - plan design , with a step - down living room with a fireplace and a dining room next to it
hardwood floors and ornate glass doors mark the entryway
even the master bath features mountain views from the bathtub - with no near neighbours this is still private - and a glass - walled shower
a bathroom with a view : even the luxury bathroom allows for spectacular views from the tub outside areas : the house is surrounded by covered patios and verandas outside , covered patios surround the building that has a three - car garage attached
while the existing photos show the house before bruce moved in , the e ! reality star was spotted moving in several items , including a king - sized mattress and a bed frame
bruce 's son , brandon , was on - hand to help - he took off his shirt to move bar stools from a white pickup truck into the flashy residence
wider view : the e ! star 's new spread is surrounded by 11 acres of land move - in day : while more furniture and belongings undoubtedly came separated , bruce and his son , brandon , were spotted moving in a few items three - car garage : a fan of cars and other motorized toys , bruce will likely fill his new three - car garage though it is large , the property is much less ornate that the spanish style home he shared with kris jenner , 59 , in hidden hills until 2013
the malibu residence also appears to be brand new with an untouched roof and what appears to be fresh landscaping around the home
bruce may have chosen to move now as he has been under the microscope lately
casual for the new place : the keeping up with the kardashians star wore a blue striped golf shirt while brandon went shirtless not only has he been strongly hinting that he wants to transition into a female ( thanks to longer hair , painted nails and what appears to be a more curvy body sometimes covered by spanx ) , but he was also the center of a fatal accident on pacific coast highway on february 7
the father of model daughters kendall , 19 , and kylie , 17 , was driving a dark blue cadillac escalade at the time and dragging a dune buggy when he hit 69 - year - old widow kim howe of nearby calabasas
she was in a white lexus and pushed into oncoming traffic where a black hummer smash into her , causing her to die
several others were involved in the accident as well and were taken to the hospital
go daddy ! : brandon watched as bruce went back into the home where he will no doubt be filming his new e ! reality series good deal : surrounding houses have been priced as high as $ 10m , making bruce 's new digs a steal his old pad : the property is much less ornate that the spanish style home he shared with kris jenner , 59 , in hidden hills
