mr john mcdonnell has held talks with mr miliband and said he has already â moved the party on to our agenda â

miliband will struggle to stop dozens of hardline labour mps from working with the snp to stop cuts to public spending , it was claimed today he told the new statesman : â the first row will be around austerity unless we get this right ... i think it will change , inevitably it will change
â i think it will be clear from pressure coming back from constituencies and individual mps that we need a labour government quickly making a change
â mr john mcdonnell said there has already been â a shift in terms of the labour leadership âs thinking and even in terms of ed balls âs thinking â
he added : â you âve got to offer an alternative
you ca nât come in with austerity - lite , it wo nât work
john mcdonnell said â a bloc of 30 - 40 left mps â in labour will ensure mr miliband will not be able to â ignore â the hard - left in the party after the election â coming in with arguments that you âre going to cut services , not necessarily as much as the tories , but you will still be cutting services , i think that argument is beginning to creak , i think that argument is beginning to fade
â increasingly now , the labour leadership has recognised that , actually , you can tackle the deficit over a longer period of time , that way you avoid any cuts whatsoever
â mr john mcdonnell said that a â large number â of labour âs candidates for the general election were on the left and could help vote against the renewal of trident
