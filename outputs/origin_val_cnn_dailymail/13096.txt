utah 's governor signed a bill monday that brings back firing squads as a potential way to execute some death row prisoners
lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in the state , gov. herbert said in a statement
a firing squad would only be used in the event the necessary drugs can not be obtained
" those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state , " said marty carpenter , a spokesman for herbert
" we regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued
however , when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant , enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch , " he said
utah banned death by firing squad in 2004 , though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death
the last execution by firing squad was in 2010 , and it was also the most recent execution in utah
a utah firing squad also executed gary gilmore in 1977 , the first death by capital punishment after the u.s. supreme court reinstated the death penalty the prior year
