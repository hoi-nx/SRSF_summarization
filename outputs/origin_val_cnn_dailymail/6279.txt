police lt. kenny park said that police were first contacted at 1.55pm - hours after her alleged abduction - by her 30 - year - old boyfriend who was in the house at the time of the assault

' this is overwhelming to me , ' said michael huskins to cbs
' i do n't understand it
that 's the hard part
i just do n't understand what 's going on
' ' if she sees this , i want her to know , that the family is there , we love her and we 're not giving up , ' he said
home : denise huskins was taken against her will from her home on kirkland avenue ( pictured ) early on monday morning police described her as 5 feet 7 inches tall , 150 pounds , with blond hair and blue eyes
suspicion had earlier fallen on a local peeping tom who lived in the area recently , who had been spotted crawling on people 's roofs
he has apparently moved away according to neighbors who spoke to abc news
according to her facebook page , huskins works at kaiser hospital and vallejo police department has called in help from the fbi and the solano county offie of emergency services
officers released pictures of huskins ' boyfriend 's car and asked for anyone who may have seen the vehicle during monday afternoon or evening to contact them
desperate search : police would not say what the ransom was for denise huskins ( left and second right with her mother ) nor how they knew she had been abducted indeed , according to the san francisco chronicle , police have been unusually tight lipped about the incident
once they received the report about the abduction , the alert was not sent over police radio but rather sent by phone between dispatchers and officers
this suggests her kidnapper is listening into police radio broadcasts
huskins previously worked at a southern california orthopedic institute and arrived in vallejo in june 2014
