in his book , o'reilly claimed he heard the blast when de mohrenschildt - an associate of president kennedy 's assassin lee harvey oswald - killed himself with a shotgun in florida
cnn 's reliable sources played an audio recording from 1977 where a young o'reilly is heard talking about traveling to florida to cover de mohrenschildt 's suicide
an audio recording released by cnn proves o'reilly ( above ) lied in his best - selling book killing kennedy the fox news host claimed in killing kennedy , ( right ) that in 1977 he ' heard ' the fatal shotgun blast in the suicide of de mohrenschildt ( left ) who gave testimony at the investigation into president kennedy 's death o'reilly , 65 , was covering the jfk assassination for dallas , texas , television station wfaa at the time
in his book , o'reilly wrote : ' in march of 1977 a young reporter knocked on the door of de mohrenschildt 's daughter 's home
' he heard the shotgun blast that marked the suicide of the russian
' that reporter 's name is o'reilly
' the recording , which was originally published by former washington post reporter and author jefferson morely on his website jfkfacts.org in 2013 , seems to prove that claim is false
in the high - quality recording cnn aired on sunday , o'reilly can be heard calling investigator gaeton fonzi to confirm de mohrenschildt 's suicide
he also talks about coming to florida , meaning there is no way he could have been on de mohrenschildt 's doorstep to hear the shotgun blast
in the tape , o'reilly said : ' i 'm coming down there tomorrow
' i 'm coming to florida
' i 'm gon na try to get a night flight out of here , if i can
' but i might have to go tomorrow morning
' fox news released figures showing o'reilly 's weekly audience is up 11 per cent compared with last year morley told media matters 's claim about overhearing the gunshot in de mohrenschildt 's suicide is ' just not true '
he added : ' it is what these guys all do , they inject themselves into a dramatic situation
' o'reilly was chasing this story , but he was n't there , he made it sound like he was more on the scene than he was , it was show business
' former wfaa reporter tracy rowlett echoed those sentiments
he said : ' o'reilly 's a phony , there 's no other way to put it
' he was not up on the porch when he heard the gunshots , he was in dallas
' he was n't traveling at that time
' fox news did not comment about the matter and referred daily mail online to book publisher henry holt henry holt spokesperson patricia eisemann said : ' we fully stand behind bill oâreilly and his bestseller killing kennedy and we âre very proud to count him as one of our most important authors
' this one passage is immaterial to the story being told by this terrific book and we have no plans to look into this matter
' a fox news spokesperson previously told daily mail online : ' o'reilly has already addressed several claims leveled against him
' this is nothing more than an orchestrated campaign by far left advocates mother jones and media matters
' responding to the unproven accusation du jour has become an exercise in futility
fox news maintains its staunch support of o'reilly , who is no stranger to calculated onslaughts
' on friday , fox news released figures showing o'reilly 's weekly audience grew by 11 per cent compared with the same period last year , the washington post reported .
