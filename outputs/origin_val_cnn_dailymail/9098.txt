gatland has told jones that he will not â get on his knees â and beg the curly haired welsh prop to come out of retirement following a world cup threatening injury to samson lee
samson lee , 22 , was on tuesday given a â 50 - 50 â chance of being ready for the â pool of death â later this year because of a ruptured achilles tendon , with his recovery already delayed by a week after specialists in london decided there is too much swelling to perform an immediate operation
it has left wales painfully low on experience in the front - row â the four props in the matchday squad to face azzurri have just 11 test starts between them â but gatland maintains the onus is on jones , capped 100 times , to reverse his decision to hang up his international boots
gatland has told jones that he will not â get on his knees â and beg the prop to play samson lee injured his achilles during wales ' 23 - 16 win against ireland in the six nations â i was surprised at the timing of his announcement , â said gatland
â he was nât out of our thoughts : we had played a little bit of phone tag , leaving messages and going backwards and forwards
if he has changed his mind and wants to get on the phone and say â i made a rash decision , retired too early and want to be part of the world cup squad , â that is a different conversation
jones passes the ball during the british and irish lions training session held at scotch college in 2013 wales captain sam warburton reacts with jones during the six nations in 2013 â at the moment i will not be going on bended knees ringing him saying â please come back , we really desperately need you â
for us , it âs about dealing with the other players
if jones was nât retired from international rugby , then he may very well be in the squad now
â making his test debut in 2003 , jones became a household feature in the welsh pack alongside fellow front - row jenkins
while jones will not feature on saturday because of his retirement , jenkins will play no part because of a hamstring injury
asides from the changes up front , gatland has stuck with the same starting xv that beat ireland at the millennium stadium , with his side needing to overturn the points advantage of england and ireland if they are going to snatch the championship
prop samson lee had to leave the field on a stretcher at the millennium stadium during wales ' win over ireland samson lee was pictured on crutches with his foot in a protective boot after the match if wales do enjoy a landslide result at the stadio olimpico and pip their rivals to the title , they will find themselves in a position where there is no silverware to celebrate with
the two trophies are due to be sent elsewhere and - while there is understood to be disappointment behind the scenes - gatland accepts that it is a logical decision
â we can understand from the points difference that they are taking one to twickenham and one to edinburgh , â he said
â if we do get enough points and win , we will celebrate in our own way
maybe we will get some medals to hang around our necks or maybe we will have to wait 24 hours ; we âll wait and see
â sergio parisse limped off during azzurri 's defeat by france in rome at the weekend if sergio parisse plays he will be a major factor in wales ' attempts to win the six nations after their early kick - off at the stadio olimpico , the tourists will move on to a black tie function at the palazzo venezia in central rome
they will have to wait on tenterhooks , but any hopes of a thumping victory could hinge on the fitness of italian skipper sergio parisse , who is struggling with a foot injury and is the heartbeat of the azzurri team
â he âs a catalyst for them , â said gatland
â if they defend heavily in the front line with 14 or 15 men and we try to play too much rugby too early , they might get a chance of turnovers and penalties or intercepts
we have to negate two or three of their obvious strengths and put ourselves in a position to score some points
â gatland knows his team need a large victory to overhaul england and ireland wales beat ireland 23 - 16 at the millennium stadium to force themselves into title contention wales have identified the final 20 minutes as the opportunity to rack up their points difference and gatland has named a bench loaded with attacking intent
gareth davies has usurped mike phillips to provide scrum - half cover for rhys webb , who on tuesday signed a dual contract , while justin tipuric and scott williams will also be expected to make a late impact
â if the championship comes down to points difference , that says to me there is not a lot of difference between the three of the four teams at the top , â said gatland
â we improve as a squad through campaigns and we have demonstrated that again in this competition
the exciting thing about the world cup is the time we will have together to do in - depth coaching and stuff we do not have the opportunity to do in the six nations
the time we have together will make a massive difference
â gatland 's wales side have a plus - 12 points difference , 25 behind england and 21 adrift of ireland
