the white house committed today to a ' firm ' deadline of tuesday for iran to make a permanent pact with a group of international negotiators not to build up it nuclear capabilities
' we âve been clear that the end of march is a firm deadline , and that âs simply because these negotiations have taken place over the course of more than a year , ' white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters on friday afternoon
' that should be ample opportunity for us to reach an agreement
major powers and iran were pushing each other for concessions ahead of an end - march deadline for a preliminary nuclear deal , with tehran demanding an immediate end to sanctions and freedom to continue sensitive atomic research , officials said kerry , left , u.s. secretary of energy ernest moniz , 2nd left , and others , including head of iranian atomic energy organisation ali akbar salehi , 2nd right , and iran foreign minister javad zarif , right , particpate in a friday meeting at the beau rivage palace on friday in lausanne , switzerland the timetable for the details of the agreement to be set in stone continues to be the end of june
' but where we need to start , is the outlines of a political agreement , ' he said , which ' is something we are aiming to achieve by the end of march
' u.s. officials and their foreign counterparts in the p5 +1 group - the five permanent members of the security council along with germany - were in switzerland on friday with iran 's negotiators making a desperate last ditch bid to secure a landmark agreement - 13 years since the country 's nuclear program became public
britain 's foreign secretary hammond said earlier this week an agreement was ' deliverable ' but urged iran to make ' tough decisions ' ahead of the meeting in lausanne , on the shores of lake geneva
along with five world powers , britain is seeking a deal that would allow iran to continue its uranium enrichment program while reducing the likelihood of it gaining nuclear weapons
iran foreign minister javad zarif told reporters staking out the talks that he did n't have a strong sense if an acceptable agreement could be made in the next several days
' the negotiations are difficult and complicated and there are highs and lows , ' javad zarif said , according to reuters
' we think an agreement is still possible but when is another story
our feeling is that we certainly will be able to reach an agreement , but that will need political will on the other side
' the white house said friday that it continued to believe the coalition had a 50 percent chance of convincing iran to make the required concessions by the last day of the month , tuesday , march 31
' it âs still at best 50 - 50 , ' white house press secretary josh earnest said friday
' that âs the odds that i have previously given to the likelihood of an agreement being reached before the deadline , and those odds have not changed

an iran official told reuters that lingering issues with the international coalition , which includes , china , russia and france in addition to germany , britain and the u.s. , were over research and development and security council sanctions still ' fluid ' next week is obama 's schedule
the white house declined to give reporters a preview on friday , as is generally expected , of the president 's plans beyond a monday trip to boston , massachusetts , leaving him open to take on a more direct role in negotiations
the president has been receiving regular and at least ' daily ' updates on the situation , his spokesman said friday
after the afternoon briefing the white house sent reporters a notice that obama had called germany chancellor angela merkel to discuss the state of negotiations
the statement said the two world leaders agreed that ' iran must make decisions necessary to resolve several remaining issues
' it did not provide details on what those deal - breaking matters were
an iran official told reuters , however , that lingering issues with the coalition , which includes , china , russia and france in addition to germany , britain and the u.s. , were over research and development and security council sanctions
iran reportedly wants an immediate draw down of sanctions , which the u.s. and its partners have said is a deal - breaker
the white house reiterated on friday that only after it verified , over time , that iran was keeping up its end of the pact would it ask congress to ease sanctions on the country
another iran negotiator told afp on friday that as far as his country is concerned , ' it all depends on the willingness of the other side
all the solutions are on the table
' ' we have already done what we need to do , ' he stated
iran president hassan rouhani reached out directly to the leaders of france , russia , britain and china on thursday in an attempt to break the stalemate and passed on letters to all six members of the international coalition , including president obama
elsewhere , the hawkish france foreign minister laurent fabius has warned against a soft deal during negotiations
' tough decisions ' : this map helps demonstrate how iran 's nuclear program is spread across the country britain 's hammond warned failure to achieve a deal over iran 's nuclear program could trigger a nuclear arms race in the middle east
iran 's nuclear program became public in 2002 when an opposition group revealed secret activity including construction of an uranium enrichment plant and a heavy - water reactor
enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons , while spent fuel from a heavy - water reactor contains plutonium suitable for a bomb
following that , iran agreed to inspections by the iaea ( iaea )
but the iaea could not confirm whether it had tried to develop nuclear weapons
this led the p5 +1 to press iran to stop enriching uranium
talks failed and in 2005 the iaea referred iran to the security council for failing to comply with the npt ( npt )
since then , the security council has adopted six resolutions requiring iran to stop enriching uranium , some imposing sanctions
in 2012 , the u.s. and eu began imposing additional sanctions on iran oil exports and banks , putting pressure on iran to negotiate
tehran insists its program is for civil nuclear power , but the international community has imposed sanctions amid concerns iran harbors ambitions to create nuclear weapons
in a speech in london , hammond said he was clear that ' no deal is better than a bad deal ' if talks in switzerland break down this weekend
' but we should also be clear - eyed about the alternative , ' he said
' no deal means no restrictions on enrichment , no restrictions on research and development , and no independent monitoring or verification
it means a fundamentally more unstable middle east , with the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the region
' he added : ' so now is the time , with our key allies , to build on the recent momentum , to press iran where differences remain , and to strain every sinew to get a deal over the finishing line
the door to a nuclear deal is open , but iran must now step through it
' iran and the p5 +1 agreed an interim accord in november 2013 that saw it cut down on sensitive nuclear activities in return for temporary relief from sanctions that have crippled its economy
a deadline of july 2014 was set to find a ' comprehensive solution ' , but the talks were subsequently extended by four months to give negotiators more time
despite ' significant progress ' being made , both sides agreed in november that another seven months were needed
diplomats now hope to reach a rough deal this weekend with all - important technical details decided by june 30 .
