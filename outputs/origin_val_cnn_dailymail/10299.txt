an eight - year - old schoolboy who dressed as a character from christian grey for world book day was laughed at by teachers , while a second school child was told he could n't take part for wearing the same costume
cole pulled on one of his father 's suits and arrived at lakes primary school in redcar and cleveland , north yorkshire , dressed as christian grey - where staff found his costume ' funny '
however , in manchester , liam scholes was ' excluded ' from lessons after teachers at sale high school branded his outfit , inspired by actor jamie dornan , was inappropriate
the 11 - year - old pupil was dressed in a shiny grey suit , equipped with cable ties and a face mask
jamie dornan , ( right ) , played the character in the recent blockbuster hit but cole 's 28 - year - old mother , joanne dickinson , was surprised when she heard liam scholes had been disciplined for the outfit , after her son 's teacher reacted by laughing
she said : ' i took him into the classroom and his teacher asked who he was and he said christian grey and the teacher just started laughing
' some of the kids had never heard of him so not many knew who he was dressed as but those who did thought it was funny '
miss joanne dickinson , who has an older daughter , caitlyn , 10 , and a 12 - month - old baby called harrison , said the year 4 pupil came up with the outfit idea himself
' he was asking on wednesday about what he could go as for world book day
i 'd done some researching and could n't come up with anything
' then he suggested going as christian grey himself
he 'd seen that i had the book and heard me go on about seeing the film
' he has n't read the book or seen the film but there are adverts on in the day and he 's asked about it
but he thinks it 's about a rich man that owns a big house and a helicopter

after some persuasion the 35 - year - old carer allowed him to wear his black shirt , grey tie and grey trousers
' his dad popped in between his work hours with the outfit , but did say he did n't think it was a good idea , but we went ahead with it anyway
' most of the parents at the school thought it was funny
one or two have made little digs saying he should n't know what that is - but he does n't know what it is

when cole arrived at school his teacher , dressed as harry potter , found the outfit funny the full - time mother said she ' could n't understand ' why staff at sale high school had taken such drastic action over the costume

i was half - expecting one of my son 's teachers to pull me up on it today but they did n't

teachers objected when the youngster appeared with cable ties and an eye mask which were both props from the controversial book
staff then rang liam scholes 's mother nicola , who herself is a primary school teacher , to tell her that the outfit was inappropriate
she said : ' we thought it was funny
we were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as christian grey
' at first we laughed it off but the we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea
' he went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties
the cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them
we did n't think there would be a problem
' i got a phone call home from the school saying the outfit was inappropriate and that he had been excluded from taking part or being in any of the photographs
