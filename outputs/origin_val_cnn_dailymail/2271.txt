' i actually hit a really good tee shot and a really good second shot , i was surprised to see it there , ' he told sky sports 4
' obviously it 's into the green so i can be aggressive but it actually jumps out a bit quicker than i thought and obviously ( i am ) delighted it hit the pin and dropped in
' delighted with the round , i hit some really good shots today
' davis has won 12.8million dollars in his pga tour career but has yet to win a tournament and hopes improved iron play may at last push him over the edge after hitting 15 greens in regulation on the copperhead course
' my stats probably show i 'm hitting eight to 10 greens a round , which is not going to get it done , ' he added
' if you start hitting 14 greens the way i putt , you 're going to shoot under par and that 's what i did today
' davis hopes that his improved form will lead to a first tournament win of his pga tour career o'hair had eight birdies and three bogeys in his 66 while barnes recorded a single dropped shot on 17 to slip into a share of second
there was then a group of six players on four under made up of justin thomas , derek ernst , nicholas thompson , brendon de jonge , alex cejka and henrik stenson

henrik stenson , the top - ranked player in the tournament , is two shots back after a first round of 67 ' i come in here trying to prepare for augusta as well and this is a great test for that , ' he told www.pgatour.com
' to just keep hitting your spots and stay patient and i did that all day and i got rewarded for it
' i 'm going to try the same for the next three days and , of course , try and hit the shots
even though my swing was n't on today i still picked my targets and tried the best i could
' i hit some good shots , obviously , and the other ones i missed in the right places which is key here
