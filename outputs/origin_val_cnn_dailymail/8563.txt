patients lying in their hospital beds are charged 10 times more to watch ' free ' tv programmes than prisoners incarcerated in their cells , it has emerged
to use a bedside television showing terrestrial programmes at southport hospital , patients are charged Â£ 10 every 24 hours
meanwhile inmates at nearby maghull 's hmp kennet pay just Â£ 1 a week to have a tv in their cell
the stark disparity has prompted patients and their families to hit out at the costs , saying they add a huge expense to a stay in hospital
to use a bedside television showing terrestrial programmes at southport hospital , patients are charged Â£ 10 every 24 hours
that is 10 times more than prisoners are required to spend to watch the same ' free ' tv programmes
relatives have branded the disparity ' shocking and unfair ' ( file picture ) mike gillett , whose relative was a patient at southport hospital after breaking her leg , said the family paid Â£ 140 over the course of a two - week stay
he said : ' to charge Â£ 10 is just unfair because you have nothing better to do but to watch tv while you are in hospital
' what else are you supposed to do ? ' but to find out that people in prisons pay just Â£ 1 just beggar 's belief
' hard working tax payers are forking out Â£ 10 per day to watch tv from their hospital bed when they have nothing better to do , but criminals pay a small fraction of the same amount - when they 're supposed to be locked up
' it just does n't seem fair
i understand they have costs to meet but i would be shocked if it costs as much as Â£ 10 a day
' some patients on the ward were complaining that they only watch one soap a day , and it still costs them the same amount as if they were watching 24 hours of tv
' hospedia provides bedside tv services in nhs hospitals across the country
patients are all charged similar amounts for access to tv , phone and internet services , across the uk
meanwhile inmates at nearby maghull 's hmp kennet pay just Â£ 1 a week to have a tv in their cell ( file image ) a spokesperson for the company defended the charges to patients , saying it also paid for installation costs
they said : ' hospedia provides bedside media to both southport hospital and ormskirk hospitals across the majority of their wards
' we have 323 tvs installed at southport hospital and 134 at ormskirk
' private providers have spent hundreds of millions of pounds installing and operating these systems so that the nhs did not have to pay for them from public funds
' if a patient is staying in hospital for one day only , we have a number of options for them to purchase but it is important to note that there are many longer term packages providing a wide range of further options too
' we give very serious consideration to the packages we offer and customer feedback has been the driving force in selecting the durations and options we currently have available
' a spokesman for southport hospital and ormskirk hospital nhs trust said : ' we will discuss the issues raised with hospedia
