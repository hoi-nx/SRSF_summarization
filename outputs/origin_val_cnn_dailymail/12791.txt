another flight brings another complaint about an airline interfering with a passenger breastfeeding her baby
the mothers who complain about instances of airline employees interfering with their breastfeeding or pumping are n't covering up and going away ; they are tweeting out their complaints in 140 characters or less , sometimes in multiple posts , other times taking pictures of longer reports
hilderman is the latest mother to say she was hassled while breastfeeding
the vancouver mother was returning to canada from a vacation in costa rica with her family on sunday night when , she says , there was a problem on the final leg of her trip
hilderman was feeding her 5 - month - old son on board united as the aircraft taxied along the runway before taking off from houston to vancouver
to describe what happened next , she took a picture of her typed recollections and posted it to twitter
" a male flight attendant named keith walked up to our row and said to my husband ( loudly , so that everyone around could here ) , ' are you two together ? ' " hilderman wrote
when her husband said yes , hilderman said , the flight attendant " tossed a blanket at him ... and said tersely , ' then here , help her out
' " when she twice asked what he was supposed to help her out with , she said , the flight attendant ignored her
passengers on the plane were supportive , she said , and told her they had n't known she was breastfeeding until the flight attendant singled her out
" i 've been breastfeeding my son in myriad public places since he was born , and never has anyone made me feel so uncomfortable and ashamed for feeding my baby without putting a cover over his head , " she wrote
united spokeswoman dohm said that the airline reached out to hilderman on monday night via twitter and that airline officials " look forward to speaking more with her and to our crew member to understand what happened
" " on our general approach to breast feeding , we welcome nursing mothers on board and we ask that crew members do their best to ensure their comfort and safety as they do with all customers , " dohm wrote in an email
" we also ask nursing mothers and passengers seated near them to be mindful of one another 's space and comfort
" hilderman , who filed a complaint with the airline , said united had not contacted her beyond their tweeted reply but said she has found support from allies on social media
why are we so squeamish about breastfeeding ? delta airlines passenger modeen , who needed her breast pump on a january flight but was forced to check it as luggage , started a boobs on board facebook page that 's gained over 1,100 followers in the past month
" before social media , the majority of these harassment stories went unheard , " modeen wrote in an email
" as a result , airlines faced little pressure to improve and pave a better way for mothers and children
" she wants her facebook page encourage airlines " to publicly post their explicitly clear pro-breastfeeding / pumping policies inside every airplane so the rules are not left to interpretation by an airline employee , and in turn harass / shame / bully a mother
" united , delta airlines and other major u.s. airlines say breastfeeding is allowed on their aircraft , although united does n't post its policy on the airline website
american airlines , southwest airlines and delta airlines do
though you ca n't please everyone in the air , women are allowed to breastfeed in flight , says veteran flight attendant and author poole , who is also a mother
" which means if breastfeeding bothers you , maybe try looking away , closing your eyes , " said poole , author of " cruising attitude : tales of crashpads , crew drama and crazy passengers at 35,000 feet
" and remember that baby could be crying instead , giving you another reason to complain
" better a happy baby than a crying baby
