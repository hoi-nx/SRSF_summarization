the return of midfielder koke could be crucial to atletico madrid 's hopes of overturning a 1 - 0 deficit to bayer leverkusen in tuesday 's champions league last 16 , second leg , coach diego simeone said on monday
a spanish international and one of atletico madrid 's most creative influences , koke missed last month 's first leg defeat in germany due to injury but has featured in atletico madrid 's last three outings in la liga
the 23 - year - old , who scored in this month 's 1 - 1 draw at home to valencia , is also a dead ball specialist and the spanish champions have netted a host of goals from his corners and free kicks

' when he is on top form , he allows us to play with speed
not because he is fast himself but because his vision allows us to play that way
' atletico madrid , last season 's beaten finalists , have been struggling for goals in recent weeks and have only scored once in their last four outings in all competitions
