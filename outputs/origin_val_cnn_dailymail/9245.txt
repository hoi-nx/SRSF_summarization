the review conducted by janet smith ( pictured ) has interviewed more than 475 witnesses and ' been in contact ' with 775 another report published last month said nhs hospitals had still not fully learned the lessons of the savile sex abuse scandal and he was given ' endorsement from the very highest level of society '
the then - prime minister , margaret thatcher , had appointed him in an official fundraising role at stoke mandeville hospital where he raped or assaulted at least 63 patients , staff and visitors
savile was given open access to the buckinghamshire hospital while volunteering as a porter from 1969
while tales of his behaviour were widespread by the early 1970s , senior staff were never told of his ' wicked ' crimes - many of them against desperately ill children
barrister kate lampard , whose review of savile 's offending across nhs institutions made a series of recommendations , said the access he was given offered him the ' opportunity to commit sexual abuses on a grand scale for nearly 50 years '
hall , known for being the face of it 's a knockout , was convicted by at preston crown court of indecently assaulting a girl under the age of 16 and earlier pleading guilty to another indecent assault on the same girl when she was 13
he was already serving a 30 - month jail term after he pleaded guilty in 2013 to indecently assaulting 13 other young girls , aged between nine and 17 , over a 20 - year period
members of the review visited the court during hall 's trial and also visited the shepherds bush empire theatre , which was owned by the bbc , and television centre .
