' tyler , whose mother and two sisters still live with his father , said : ' i have n't heard from my father at all
i moved out to my aunt 's house a few weeks after he sent the messages
' he sent them a week after i came out during december , and i have n't spoken to him since then
the rest of my family were kind of blown away by how much attention [ the photos ] have drawn
' i initially just posted them in anger and disappointment to my tumblr blog because that is usually where i vent and rant about stuff
i never thought that it was going to [ escalate ] like this
' he added : ' i visit my mom and sisters whenever my dad is at work
' the teenager said he had known he was gay ' since fifth grade ' , but had been worried about coming out publicly - particularly because his relationship with his father had been ' rocky for a long time '
' i had a feeling he was n't going to like it
but i had to tell him
i could n't keep it anymore , ' he said

' we loved you , took care of you when you âre sick
lost many days and nights in all your fifteen years
now this is what we get in return , shame and embarrassment
' if only you did n't reject god and his teachings in your life you could have been strong enough to stay from evil and scums that surrounds you

people will ridicule me , insult me , and i might turn out to be a criminal
