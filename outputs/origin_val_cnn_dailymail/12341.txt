dynel lane , a former nurse 's aide accused of stabbing a pregnant colorado woman , was charged friday with criminal attempt to commit first - degree murder , unlawful termination of pregnancy , and other crimes for allegedly cutting a fetus from the womb
boulder county district attorney garnett was unable to file a murder charge under state law , and he highlighted how the coroner found that the fetus did n't show any signs of life outside the womb , garnett said
the victim , wilkins , 26 , who was seven months ' pregnant , survived this month 's attack , which occurred when she went to a longmont home to buy baby clothes advertised for sale on craigslist
" now , i understand that many in the community -- and heaven knows i 've heard from a lot of them -- would like me to file homicide charges , " garnett told reporters
" however , that is not possible under colorado law without proof of live birth
a prosecutor can not file murder charges when a baby who is killed has not lived outside the body of the mother
for similar reasons , i can not bring charges of child abuse resulting in death , " the district attorney said
the fetus ' lungs never inflated , garnett said
the fetus ' exact cause of death , however , is n't immediately known and is expected to be revealed when the final autopsy report is released in six to eight weeks , he said
wilkins and her partner , identified only as dan , named the female fetus aurora , the prosecutor said
dynel lane , 34 , appeared briefly in a holding room during an initial court appearance friday , but she did n't enter the courtroom
her attorneys waived a formal reading of charges at the hearing , which occurred before the prosecutor 's press conference
" she could get a long sentence and very well could die in prison , " the district attorney said about dynel lane , adding he could n't immediately calculate the maximum number of years she faces if convicted of all counts
dynel lane was also charged with two counts of crime of violence , two counts of first - degree assault , and two counts of second - degree assault , garnett said
dynel lane 's next court date , a preliminary hearing , is may 5
she is being held on a $ 2 million bond
earlier friday , the boulder county coroner 's office said the fetus was n't alive on its own after it was cut from wilkins ' womb
the female fetus did n't exhibit " any signs of life outside of the womb , therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth , " coroner hall said in a statement
friday 's finding came a day after prosecutors indicated that dynel lane would n't face a murder charge in the march 18 assault
wilkins was released from the hospital on thursday , relatives said
the coroner 's office performed an autopsy on the fetus and said wilkins was 34 weeks pregnant
" an autopsy has been completed , " hall said
" at this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb , therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth
no evidence of trauma or injuries were found on the body
" final autopsy results will be released once all testing and further studies are complete , " hall said
the coroner 's finding apparently contradicts earlier claims made in police reports that the fetus " gasped " and that emergency room personnel described the fetus as viable
ridley , the 35 - year - old husband of dynel lane , told police he found his wife " covered in blood " in the family home and later found " a small baby lying in the bathtub , " a longmont police report said
" he rubbed the baby slightly then rolled it over to ... see it take a gasping breath , " the report said
ridley took the baby and his wife to the emergency room of longmont united hospital , and the hospital told police the baby " would have been viable , " the police report said
but on friday , district attorney garnett said that ridley altered his earlier statement to police
without referring to ridley by name , garnett cited how media accounts took note of the police report and how a " witness observed aurora taking a gasping breath
" " however , upon a more thorough examination of this witness by the longmont police department , the witness clarified that aurora was still and her mouth was open , but she was not breathing , which is consistent with medical evidence from the autopsy , " garnett told reporters
