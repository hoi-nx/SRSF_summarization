liverpool 's raheem sterling has put his contract talks on hold until the summer , brendan rodgers has said raheem sterling 's current deal runs until 2017 , and he had been in negotiations with liverpool over an extension ' not between now and the end of the season , ' said brendan rodgers
' it has been made clear by raheem sterling 's agent
i repeat that this is the best place for his development and it is clear
' raheem sterling is set to start as liverpool face a huge clash with manchester united at anfield on sunday , with a place in the top four of the premier league at stake
' it is an important game , ' continued brendan rodgers
' i do n't think the result will have an overriding factor but it will certainly give you a great boost psychologically if we were to win
we want to win , we want to be competitive
' brendan rodgers also confirmed that captain steven , who returned from injury at swansea on monday night , will have a big part to play between now and the end of the season , but refused to say whether he would be guaranteed a start or not
liverpool boss brendan rodgers ( right ) believes that anfield is the right place for raheem sterling to continue his development brendan rodgers also backed liverpool captain steven ( left ) , saying he is committed to the team ' it is very simple with me and steven , ' said brendan rodgers
' i think it has been really unfair on the boy
' when he was out injured , people tried to sensationalise a story about him getting in the team
it might not be the story you want but he is committed to the team
but his support to jordan henderson and joe allen has been fantastic
i see people trying to predict the team but he has n't been fit
he is going to have a big part to play , and is a wonderful , wonderful player who has so much still to give
' even when he does n't start , he comes off the bench and gives calmness to the team
playing or not playing , steven 's professionalism is outstanding
he is fit , available and whether he starts or comes off the bench , he will be ready to make a contribution
