she is being called zephany , though it is not the name with which the 17 - year - old south african girl grew up
zephany means " hidden by the lord , " a fitting name for a girl who was allegedly kidnapped at birth and found thanks to an improbable coincidence
south african police have been mostly quiet about the case
a police spokesman , andre traut , confirmed that a woman was arrested last week and charged with kidnapping and falsely pretending that she was the girl 's biological mother
zephany was a newborn when she was taken from a cape town hospital in 1997
she is 17 and in her final year of school
in fact , according to local reports , that 's how she crossed paths with her biological parents , celeste and morne nurse
according to the sapa , an independent news agency , students at their second daughter 's school unknowingly solved the kidnapping
the second daughter , who was born four years after zephany was kidnapped , started eighth grade at a cape town school this year , according to sapa
fellow students told her there was a girl in her final year of school who looked just like her , the news agency reported
the two girls became friends , according to sapa , and eventually , morne nurse made up an excuse to meet his daughter 's new friend
he , too , was taken by the similarities and contacted the police , sapa reported
a dna test was done , and last week police arrested the 50 - year - old woman who had raised zephany
the woman made an initial appearance before a judge who ruled that she would remain behind bars at least until her next hearing
the shocking revelation has no easy conclusion
while zephany 's biological parents have said in interviews over the years that they never lost hope of finding her , for now , the girl is in the custody of the social services
the nurses have been allowed to visit zephany for short periods , south african media reported
and on tuesday , zephany herself released a statement , via the centre for child law , which is representing her
" i want to say thank you to all the people who supported me through this , for continuously praying and never giving up on looking for me , " she said
" under the circumstances , i am doing fine
