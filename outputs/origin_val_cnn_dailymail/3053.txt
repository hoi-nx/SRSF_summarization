a restroom at a wal-mart in eastern indiana has been closed indefinitely after an employee discovered a working meth lab inside
state police say a wal-mart employee alerted police after seeing a man he described as suspicious enter the restroom about 11:30 pm thursday with a backpack and then leave without it
police were called , and determined that inside the backpack were items that constituted a miniature meth lab , with chemicals used to ' cook ' the drug were being mixed in containers
state police say people who make methamphetamine are leaving ' the deadly explosive chemicals in public places to return later to get the finished product , ' rather than risk explosions and contamination at their own homes
the fastest way to make meth is referred to as ' shake and bake ' , where the chemicals are mixed in two liter bottles , and later cooked in the oven until it crystallizes
however mixing the chemicals runs a huge risk of explosion , with the blast of one bottle capable of killing someone
the star press reports that members of a state police meth suppression team removed the dangerous chemicals
delaware county health department inspectors closed the restroom and a nearby women 's restroom until they could be ' decontaminated ' by a professional cleaning company
an investigation into who left the backpack in the restroom is now under way
brian nick , director of national media relations for wal-mart , said the store 's surveillance video was being provided to police for that probe
