a woman who lost half her leg to bone cancer had her foot reattached backwards - and it was n't a mistake
shanna decker , 24 , was seven when she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma after complaining about a pain in her leg
doctors said they would have to remove her left knee to save her life
but instead of an amputation , shanna decker opted for a ' rotationplasty ' : when the foot is attached to the thigh and rotated backwards
it means shanna decker , from minnesota , has more control over her prosthetic calf
the operation , which removed a cancerous tumor , saved her life the forward - facing heel acts as a new knee and the foot can move like a shin
if she needs to , shanna decker can even apply weight to the foot - which has retained its feeling - and walk on it
the then - novel procedure was one of three options available to shanna decker , while she endured a grueling chemotherapy program
doctors could have amputated her leg below the thigh or created a ' stiff leg '
more control : the decision shanna decker and her parents made when she was seven ( left ) means that she now has more control over her prosthetic leg and can manoeuvre it better than if she had undergone an amputation delighted : seven - year - old shanna decker was amazed at how quickly she learned to walk again after surgery due to her age , shanna decker was not eligible for ' limb salvage ' , where the missing tissue is replaced with transplanted or artificial tissue , as her legs were not fully developed
instead , she opted for rotationplasty , which removes the tumor and the knee and rotates the foot 180 degrees
writing on rotationplasty.com , her mother said : ' i remember this being the hardest decision our family has ever faced
when we initially learned of rotationplasty , i have to admit , it took time to absorb
we had many questions and desperately wanted to connect with others who had already chosen this procedure , but found that to be difficult
' no regrets : shanna decker has now set up a foundation to help children who are considering rotationplasty too aside from the difficulty overcoming the appearance of her new leg , shanna decker said she never thought twice about it
and learning to walk was simple - unlike the months - long process most amputees endure
' as soon as my leg healed , i was walking with a prosthetic and it took me about three seconds to learn how to rewalk , ' shanna decker told everyday health
hoping to inspire children who are facing the same predicament she tackled 17 years ago , shanna decker has founded a charity called brighter tomorrows that supports young cancer sufferers .
