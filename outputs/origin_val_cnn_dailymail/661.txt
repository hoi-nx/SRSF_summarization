what more can sanchez do to force his way back into the middle ? out on the left wing against qpr , where he has moved to make way for mesut ozil since his return from injury , he cut a frustrated figure for much of the game
but when he started making runs through the middle , testing qpr defenders and putting them on the back foot with his pace , the chances came
after 70 minutes , that was rewarded with a wonderful individual goal
sanchez takes on young qpr defender darnell furlong at loftus road mesut ozil , voted arsenal 's player of the month for february , holds off the challenge of nedum onuoha the talk ahead of kick - off was that sanchez simply does not perform as well when mesut ozil is on the pitch
in the first 45 minutes , they exchanged the ball a total of three times
that âs not to say that every player on the pitch must combine at all times , but arsenal fans are within their rights to expect Â£ 72.5million worth of talent , playing next to each other in an attacking midfield trio , to develop some kind of wavelength
in the first half sanchez , arsenal âs best player this season by far , could not get into the game on the flank , making way for mesut ozil as no 10 since his comeback from injury
in october , there were stories in chilean , from newspaper la tercera , that sanchez and mesut ozil had fallen out
sanchez felt the german was not giving him enough opportunities on the pitch , it was reported
from this performance , he would have a point
it took 22 minutes before they found one another , sanchez passing into his team - mate
sanchez cut in from the left hand side to score from a tight angle and end is run of eight games without a goal sanchez celebrates doubling arsenal 's lead mid way through the second half at loftus road at one stage , the chilean was screaming for the ball wide and free on the left , but mesut ozil went to play the switch and instead feinted
but perhaps it is not even about the pair of them being on the pitch together so much as sanchez being wasted on the left
by the 62nd minute , he was clearly frustrated out wide when he made a run down the wing and olivier giroud failed to send the ball into his path
he let his team - mate know
in one red - hot period after he scored his first goal for the club against besiktas he netted 12 in 14 games , from august to the start of november
now it is just one in eight games , coinciding with mesut ozil âs return
when he ventured into the middle in the 47th minute , carried the ball into the box with a step - over before aiming one for the far right bottom corner , it was hard to see why he is not guaranteed a central spot all the time
he repeated the act in the 58th minute , growing in confidence with every shot on goal
these two acts alone far exceeded anything mesut ozil produced

it is all well and good sanchez displaying an enviable work - rate down the wing , one that surely impresses arsene wenger , but it âs more well and good if he is through the middle stretching defences to breaking point
against qpr , this was not vintage arsenal and they made hard work of a team fighting relegation , a team they should be sweeping aside
it can not be denied that they are finding results , getting wins , but in the biggest match of their season , against monaco , they were found lacking
as this game drew on , sanchez displayed a lovely deftness of touch to control the ball with his knee then flick it over an opponent in one fluid motion
where was he ? in the middle of the attacking third
