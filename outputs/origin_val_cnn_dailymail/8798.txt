' brisbane coroner hutton delivered his findings on wednesday , saying that those restraining mr kumar had failed to release pressure on him despite his appeal
' i find that their failure to release pressure on mr kumar , despite mr kumar 's continual pleading with them that he could not breathe , fell well - short of any standard of reasonableness , ' he said
' the force they used to continue to restrain mr kumar in the circumstances was excessive
' the triple zero call made to police by one of group members at 5.37am on september 13 , 2012 was played at the coronial inquest

last month 's inquest heard the self - employed truck driver assaulted two staff - including jodie cassar - from a fishing charter boat when he was told he could n't join the trip because he had booked it under a false name of ' adam jones '
staff and customers from the fishing charter - five men and one woman - used zip ties to restrain mr kumar
the coroner found he died from the combined effects of restraint , heart disease and excess weight around his stomach
a pathologist concluded that contributing factors were the position in which mr kumar was held , pressure on his head and neck blocking his airway , and the stress associated with his struggle
mr hutton said the initial decision to restrain mr kumar was reasonable , but the group failed to recognise the danger to his life
he singled out a doctor among the six people who , the coroner said , acted unreasonably by not taking more control over mr kumar 's well - being
however , the coroner did not recommend anyone be prosecuted
' i find that the actions of the people who restrained mr kumar contributed to his death , ' he said
' however , i am unable to quantify the level of contribution their actions had to mr kumar 's death
' mr hutton did recommend that first - aid training providers consider raising awareness about the dangers of positional and restraint asphyxia .
