spotting a cat dart headlong under a car , he decided to give hot pursuit
but the heat of the chase soon turned into burning embarrassment for this little dog , as he became stuck in the car âs engine
woody the bedlington terrier was only discovered when his owner âs neighbour opened the bonnet of his vauxhall corsa to find a white furry face looking out from beside the engine
i think i 'm stuck : woody the bedlington terrier peers out from beside the vauxhall corsa 's engine they were eventually forced to call the plymouth fire brigade to release the three - year - old dog â who was covered in oil but otherwise unhurt after his ordeal last week
his master mike tracey , 52 , said : â my neighbour opened up the bonnet of his car woody was just sat there looking at me
it was almost like he was saying , â i âm stuck dad â
â after trying to free him , with the help of fellow residents in crownhill , plymouth , the 52 - year - old owner was forced to call the fire service for assistance
free ! plymouth fire brigade released the three - year - old dog mr mike tracey added : â we thought about using a jack to try and get him out but we were worried about something going wrong
â i did nât really want to call the fire brigade and be one of those â cat stuck in a tree kind of people â but they turned up and were absolutely brilliant
â a crew from crownhill fire station attended and helped free a bashful woody by removing one of the leads within the engine , to allow him to be pried out of the top
the three - year - old dog was covered in oil but did nât sustain any injuries during his mini-ordeal and was right as rain after a good bath
but woody may need a bit longer to deal with the embarrassment after his unique ordeal
mr mike tracey , who works for an employment centre , added : â i think he was feeling a bit sheepish as there was a bit of a crowd to watch the firefighters get him out
â even the firemen said â well , this is a new one â when they turned - up
â i plan to go up to the station and say thank you to them because they did nât take the mick at all and were really good about the whole thing
â woody does seems a bit sulky but i suppose he has been through a lot
