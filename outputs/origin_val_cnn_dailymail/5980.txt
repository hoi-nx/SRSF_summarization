' i still wake up in the night now and it âs like â s * * * â , it âs there and then you go back to sleep
' it âs eased over the years for sure
but i still have a few times a year when i wake up and , bang , it âs on my mind
it âs one of those things , it âs disappointing , and i was gutted at the time
' terry admits that while he has begun to get over the pain of the memory , it still comes back to him at night terry stands back on the half - way line with his team - mates to watch the rest of the penalties in moscow there was little time for terry to get over his horror moment in may 2008 , with the chelsea centre back called up to the england squad for a friendly against the usa almost immediately after the final

â the worst thing was , we had england the following week , we played usa at wembley and i had to go and sit at a table with all the manchester united players , ' terry told a chelsea pitch owners dinner this week

i did nât want to be there
it was a horrible time for me

despite not playing in the final , terry was lucky enough to win the champions league four years later having been sent off in the semi-final second leg , terry had to watch on from the stands at the allianz arena ' it was probably the worst 120 minutes i 've sat through , ' terry said of the final
' it is horrible because you want to do something , you want to make something happen , but for me , it 's still the best night of my life with chelsea
' it goes back to moscow , with that i was n't meant to be part of that
i feel part of it , i played a lot of games before that but i think for me , not playing , it was meant to be
i was n't meant to play , we were meant to win
that was it , as simple as that
' and for me that was the most pleasing thing , to see chelsea win the champions league after what happened in moscow ticked a box for me and definitely made those sleepless nights easier
