to make a few extra pennies that could go towards pocket money for the kids , or spending money for your family holiday , why not consider selling these items ? at nct sales , table hire is around Â£ 20 , but , if you have plenty of decent things on offer , you could walk away with hundreds of pounds

instead , take pictures of any bulky goods to place on a noticeboard on the day
you âll be surprised at just how popular these are

car - boots sales are a great way to have a clear - out of unwanted goods and also pick up a little extra cash 3 ) buy school uniforms from the supermarket school uniforms are expensive â but there are ways to cut costs
the first tip is to avoid buying items such as plain shirts , dresses and bottoms from uniform shops where the prices are significantly higher
for example , a plain polo shirt from a niche shop may set you back about Â£ 5 each , but a pack of two from the supermarket costs as little as Â£ 2.50 â that âs just Â£ 1.25 each
you could put the savings towards other expenses , such as school trips
some school uniform items do have to be purchased via a uniform shop because a certain logo or style must be adhered to
if this is the case , and if you 're looking to save some pennies , see if you can get them second - hand
many schools will sell once - worn clothes , but you may have to ask
you could also ask other parents if they are willing to sell anything that their child has outgrown
4 ) use cashback sites these are n't anything new , but if you 're not already using a cashback site , it 's the perfect way to easily save some money and earn rewards
they work by giving shoppers a percentage of their purchase total every time you shop online via a specific cashback site
simply register for free , then click through to your chosen retailer , such as mothercare or argos , and then shop as normal
the purchase is tracked and the cashback site will give you back some money ; rates can vary from as little as 1 per cent to as much as 10 per cent
some stores also offer you a cash lump sum
and it 's not just limited to retailers , you can also earn cashback for utilities ( broadband , tv , phone ) , insurance and even days out
new sky customers , for example , could get Â£ 151.50 cashback for tv and broadband packages via topcashback , Â£ 30 cashback for using uswitch via quidco and 2 per cent back on amazon purchases using kidstart
you really could end up with hundreds of pounds back into your pocket - but only ever use reputable cashback sites
5 ) use tesco vouchers to pay for days out if you âre collecting tesco points , then use your vouchers to pay for days out using clubcard boost
it âs tempting to stick them in your purse and pay for everyday groceries when you go shopping , but they are worth a lot more if you use clubcard boost â you could exchange them for up to four times the face value
use tesco vouchers to pay for days out instead - these can be exchanged for cinema tickets a Â£ 4.50 voucher is worth just Â£ 4.50 if you use it to pay for groceries , but if you boost it online , that will get you a day pass to a sealife centre where a child ticket otherwise costs around Â£ 20 â that âs a saving of more than 75 per cent
you could also use your vouchers to exchange them for cinema tickets or eating out
take a look at tesco to see the deals
6 ) plan your meals for a family , food is a huge weekly cost
but it is also an area where you can easily save some money
as well as shopping smart and buying own - brand products where possible , the next thing to do is to plan your meals
devise three or four and rotate them every week to ensure there is variety
but , this way , you wo n't get tempted by expensive treats while wandering around the supermarket - and it will ensure all food is used ; rather than wasted or thrown away
always go shopping with a list - and stick to it
better still , do your shop online â that way you can avoid all those ' buy one get one free ' or ' half price ' deals , not to mention it will probably reduce stress and give you more quality time with your children
7 ) there âs still time to make use of childcare vouchers childcare costs are rising faster than the rate of inflation
recent research from the family & childcare trust showed a 33 per cent increase in the past five years , and a report last week from single parent charity , gingerbread , found half of single parents have had to borrow money from friends , family or banks to pay for childcare in the last two years
with costs so high , it âs important to make use of all the financial help you can get
if you are working and are not making use of childcare vouchers , then you should â you could save as much Â£ 933 a year , per parent , towards the costs of childminders , nurseries , play groups and after school care or clubs
childcare vouchers are essentially salary sacrifice schemes and you make savings through tax
it is offered by employers , so talk to your hr department about it
the system is , however , changing in autumn 2015 , with a new tax - free childcare scheme being introduced , after which you will not be able to apply for childcare vouchers , but existing users will be able to continue using them if they want
some parents will be better - off with the existing childcare voucher scheme , as the new system will not help you if you have children over the age of 12 for instance â so , it is a good idea to apply for childcare vouchers now and then choose what is better for you in the autumn when the new scheme kicks in
some parents may also be able to get tax credits , but childcare vouchers can affect the amount of tax credits you get , so check the gov.uk calculator to find out whether you would be better - off
