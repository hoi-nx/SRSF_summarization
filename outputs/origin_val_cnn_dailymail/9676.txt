it 's one of indian 's most colourful festivals and when princess beatrice was invited to get involved during a london cocktail party thrown to celebrate it , she just could n't resist getting stuck in

this time , the princess , who was attending a party thrown by london - based indian designer lodha , opted for a striking emerald - green dress and a forehead decorated with bindis
ms lodha , who grew up in mumbai but has also lived in seoul and hong kong , launched her eponymous label in 2008 and counts samantha cameron and michelle obama among her fans
now stocked at net-a-porter and matches among others , she is famous for her love of colourful print and flatteringly feminine designs
but ms lodha was n't the only print fan at the party , with fellow designer , greek - born mary katrantzou , also in attendance
