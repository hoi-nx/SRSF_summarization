a blunder from norwich keeper john ruddy ensured that the championship promotion clash against derby at carrow road finished in a 1 - 1 draw
cameron jerome 's 18th goal of the season gave the norwich a deserved lead at the break and the hosts were controlling the game when disaster struck in the 66th minute
john ruddy had had little to do all afternoon but when required to catch an in swinging corner from debutant hanson he somehow fumbled the ball into his own net to gift the defensive - minded rams a point
norwich 's goalkeeper john ruddy reacts after fumbling the ball to concede an equalising goal norwich players stand dejected as derby 's players celebrate their fortunate equalising goal the clash between second - placed derby and fifth - placed norwich got off to a cagey start , with johnson 's off - target shot from long range for the home side the only effort of note in the opening stages
norwich were very much on the front foot though and tettey and jonny howson also tried their luck from distance with no success against a derby side who looked as though they had come for a point
on - loan midfielder graeme dorrans then had a clear sight of goal , only for a poor first touch to allow russell to clear for a corner , before cameron jerome steered the ball just wide after being put in by hoolahan
norwich 's cameron jerome scores his sides first goal of the game at carrow road on saturday without their main men up front - darren bent and chris martin - the rams barely posed a threat at the other end and it was no surprise when cameron jerome opened the scoring for the hosts on 31 minutes
a slick one - touch move instigated by tettey ended with martin olsson crossing low for norwich 's top scorer to slot home from close range
derby 's appeals for offside were waved away and norwich continued to dominate , although russell 's quick dart into the box did provide a rare moment of alarm for the home side
norwich maintained their grip on the game in the early part of the second period , with cameron jerome heading over from a corner before grant 's parry from a whittaker snap - shot prompted a scramble in the visitors ' box
norwich 's gary hooper ( right ) and derby 's craig bryson compete for the ball during the draw hanson and hoolahan compete for the ball as both side look for the winner at carrow road derby 's lack of a specialist front man was painfully obvious although tom ince 's low shot on the hour mark did draw a save out of john ruddy
but the norwich keeper then made a horrible mistake to hand the rams an equaliser they scarcely deserved
hanson 's 66th - minute corner from the right should have been a routine gather for the former england keeper but he took his eye off the ball and somehow fumbled it into the back of the net
norwich responded well to the shock and it required a brilliant one - handed save from grant to keep out sebastien bassong 's header from an in swinging hoolahan free - kick
grant then denied substitute gary hooper as norwich looked for a grandstand finish before cameron jerome wastefully headed a whittaker cross just over and johnson then followed suit with his left foot .
