there 's a steady stream of blood flowing down his face from a cut just above his eye
his rapid , open - mouth breathing inadvertently draws some of the blood inside , discoloring his teeth
he appears dazed , probably with a concussion
but there are no trained physicians around to evaluate
and even if there were , it 's doubtful anything a doctor could say would stop him from fighting
the crowd that has gathered in this backyard of a miami suburb wo n't let him
they have too much money invested
besides , this illegal fight is the safest way he can make money
and his best chance of reaching the american dream
when i first saw this footage from the documentary " dawg fight , " i recoiled
here we are recognizing the 50th anniversary of " bloody sunday " in selma , alabama , and in the next state over there are desperate , unemployed black men beating the hell out of each other for a hundred bucks
while the 1999 cult classic " fight club " made organized street fights look like a sexy form of psychotherapy for repressed men ( and some of the guys who participate in street fights do fit the bill ) , the vast majority in the documentary just need the money
because in the miami area the poor reportedly live on $ 11 a day
and in west perrine , the suburb where " dawg fight " takes place and where nearly 75 % of the residents are black , unemployment remains high
" this is the future of americans , " said the film 's director , corben
" when you look at the incarceration rate , especially for black men , and income inequality , the life you see in ' dawg fight ' is where we are headed
" we have these ridiculous drug laws , which makes it nearly impossible to get a job once you 've been arrested
and if you can get a job , it does n't pay enough to feed a family
" the numbers speak for themselves
the americans has 5 % of the world 's population but 25 % of its prisoners -- by far the most of any country
meanwhile , between 2009 and 2012 , the top 1 % of americans captured 95 % of all income growth
so while it is true unemployment is down and wall street is booming , the combination of a debilitating criminal justice system and low wages has created an environment in which men such as those featured in " dawg fight " feel backyard fights are actually one of the less nefarious ways they can make money
sens. rand paul , r-kentucky , and cory booker , d-new jersey , have become interesting bedfellows as they work to address the country 's runaway prison industry
this week , the pair , along with sen. kirsten gillibrand , d - new york , introduced a medical marijuana bill as another step toward decriminalizing the drug
this is a welcome step , because of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 - 2010 , nearly 90 % was for simple possession , according to the aclu
and while whites and blacks use the drug at the same rate , blacks were arrested four times as often , the aclu said
that 's not to say all of the ex-cons in the 12 - by - 12 ring are nonviolent drug offenders
some , by their own admission , have done worse
but they are out of jail now , and do n't have the luxury of waiting to see if debates going on in washington actually result in laws
" i do n't promote violence , i promote hope , " said dada 5000 , who started west perrine fights in his mother 's backyard and who was once a bodyguard for mixed martial arts fighter kimbo slice
" a lot of these men paid their debt back to society ; they did the rehab , but they still ca n't get a job
they do n't blame society for their life
... ( t ) hey are back here in these streets , and they would like a second chance , a chance to do the right thing , but those chances are not there
we are an alternative to the bad things
" i asked if the election of the first black president provided any inspiration at all , and he said , " obama 's black , but he did n't grow up black , not like this
" he never had to make do , to go without
he never was put inside those situations , those circumstances where desperation pushes you to the edge
he 's had what he thinks are hard times , but it 's nothing like this
if he came down here , he would be blown away
" corben echoes the sentiment
" the unemployment rate is all well and good for people in washington , but those are not the people who are trying to make it , " he said
" people think of miami , they think of beaches and ocean drive and all of that
this is the part of miami people do n't want to talk about
" but you know what ? miami is not unique
there are a lot of cities like this , " he adds
" dawg fight " certainly does n't sugarcoat anything
the fights are raw , vicious
but then so is the reality in which it is based
two of the fighters featured are dead -- including one on whom police used a taser
with prize money as little as $ 100 , the chances this lifestyle alone can elevate a family out of poverty is slim to none
but what are the alternatives ? i grew up in a rough neighborhood on the eastside of detroit
i was mugged in elementary school by a grown man
and even i do n't claim to know the desperation these men see on a daily basis
" we do n't have al sharpton and jesse jackson coming down here to this level of hood , " dada said
" this is the real miami
we may not want to acknowledge it , but it is
" and i bet if you go to some of the other cities where men do n't have any skills , they do n't have an education , they may have a record ... you 'll find the same thing , " he added
" what i 'm doing is n't barbaric , it 's a message
