but it does serve more than just plain bowlfuls of oats
a range of sweet offerings involve typical toppings such as apple , vanilla and hazelnut ; strawberry , cinnamon and cranberry and raspberry , peach and almond - the savoury toppings veer towards the unusual
made with spelt , arborio rice or grain buckwheat and quinoa , they feature slow - roasted chicken , leek and cream cheese ; bacon , avocado and roasted tomato ; and salami , pecorino and porcini mushroom
mr nik williamson said : ' our basic porridge will match pret 's prices
' customers will be able to top their basic porridge with sugar , jams or honey for Â£ 2.35

' the most expensive will be the ones with meat , with prices ranging from between Â£ 6 and Â£ 7
' the inspiration behind their latest venture came about when the duo were in scandinavia
mr nik williamson said : ' we were in copenhagen and we noticed there was a lot of great porridge
we tasted different grains â in scandinavia they use rye , buckwheat , spelt , barley and quinoa to make their porridge
grain buckwheat cooked with pomegranate juice and cardamom and served with orange slices , dates and dark chocolate shavings â you would think we were sick of the stuff but the different varieties and incarnations are endless
' we love how versatile it is and hope we can make people realise that porridge can be so much more than oats and water
â high fibre , high protein and low gi , porridge has long been known as the perfect food as part of a balanced diet
â eating porridge regularly can also help reduce stress due to the presence of magnesium in many grains , ' mr nik williamson added
the partners discovered the huge amount of grains that are used to make porridge all over the world , along with the different methods to make it
they finally decided on 11 grains which they think â taste great â

the cafe is the brainchild of nik williamson ( pictured ) who opened it with his business partner elly harrington the term ' porridge ' is used fairly loosely at nik williamson 's new cafe in trendy east london â all in all we 've chosen 11 grains we think taste great and have some really great health benefits , ' he said
â the recipes we 've developed are sweet , healthy and savoury flavours
' the cafe will open on 2 march on paul street , near old street station , london , and will serve from 7am to 6pm daily with a daily changing menu
at weekends there will be a brunch menu featuring three savoury and two sweet choices
initially a pop - up , if the concept proves to be a success , it will become a permanent fixture
' our hope is in we will see whether people like it in the initial month and if they will buy our porridge , ' mr nik williamson said
' if it 's successful we may extend in the location for a few more months and we will probably widen the menu so there will be other dishes involved
' the porridge cafe follows on the heels of london 's cereal killer and belfast 's simply crisp cafe
just crisps : businessman mcmenamin opened belfast 's simply crispy in january 2015 alan and gary keery of the cereal killer cafe in brick lane serve 120 cereals with 20 toppings and 12 milks belfast 's simply crispy which opened earlier in january was the brainchild of businessman mcmenamin who had planned to keep his pop - up going for just four weeks
but with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks , which have sold out every day , the cafe will now stay open until at least march , and could even expand to other shops in northern ireland , dublin , or even london
' we have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though , the bread , the baps
we ca n't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door , ' mr mcmenamin said
in december 2014 self - confessed cereal obsessives alan and gary keery launched the uk âs first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals , 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk
the identical twins â establishment opened in brick lane , london and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world
the duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe , for charging Â£ 3.20 for a bowl of cereal .
