' last year , boren defended oklahoma 's ownership , saying the school does not want to keep any items it does not legitimately own but also wants to avoid a bad precedent by automatically giving away gifts it receives to anyone who claims them
boren and the school have opposed the lawsuit on largely procedural grounds , saying the school has sovereign immunity and that meyer was not diligent in pursuing her claim and had sued in new york rather than oklahoma as a ' forum shopping strategy ' to avoid oklahoma 's more restrictive statute of limitations
