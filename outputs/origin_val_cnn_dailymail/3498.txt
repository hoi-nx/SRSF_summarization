the heartbroken father of ' jake ' , who died in a suicide mission in central iraq last week , has taken the blame for his son 's actions claiming ' the bucks stop here with me '
struggling to keep his emotions in check john bilardi told 60 minutes that it was clear his son suffered from psychological problems from an early age , but that they were never properly addressed , despite the fact all the warning signs were there
' i would just like everyone to know that the buck stops here with me
i knew there was something not right with his behaviour , ' he said
i feel totally responsible for that
' i should have been there for him
he obviously needed help , and as a parent i was n't able to do that
' jake was prone to random acts of aggression and on one particular occasion he attacked his father with a pair of scissors
' the worse times were when he 'd arm himself with a weapon and threaten you with a weapon , ' mr john bilardi said
more terrifying was that jake was stock piling chemicals to build bombs that were to be detonated in australian
' it 's hard to process this
but that was n't him
he was just a shy , lonely young man , ' mr john bilardi said
' how he got to this i can not even start to try and explain
only he knows ... he had a death wish
' he is still coming to terms with his son 's decision , to run away from their melbourne home and join islamic state , a move which ultimately cost him his life , at age 18
' to see him sitting there with that gun ... i just could n't believe that was my son , ' mr john bilardi said about the now infamous photograph of his son with isis members
' they put him in a car loaded with explosives
they probably just shouted ' praise allah ' or whatever , and sent him off
i ca n't imagine what he was feeling
' he poured his heart out in the interview about his late son
the teenager is believed to have converted to muslim in 2012 when he was in year 10 , shortly after his mother died of cancer
' just out of the blue he said , " i 've gone muslim " , ' his father said
john bilardi breaks down as he recalls what drove his teenage son into the arms of terrorists in the middle east he recounts his son 's final message , sent from the isis bunker to his father , as he was convinced to take his own life
it was : ' hi dad , i am very happy to be here '
jake 's radicalisation took place in the privacy of his own home where he went online to develop ties with isis
and mr john bilardi issued a chilling warning to other parents about the lure of terrorists to defenceless young australian
' this is a big warning
it 's going on , it 's real
' his revelations coming , as an islamic state propaganda website , geared towards celebrating the sacrifice made by the melbourne teenage jihadi , did anything but glorify the actions of the 18 - year - old suicide bomber
the post , titled as the story of abu abdullah al-austrälä« â the name john bilardi adopted after he travelled to iraq to join is â gives the teenager some praise as a devout muslims who prays and fasts often
but the rant describes john bilardi as having â a weak body â and having ' sold his soul for a cheap price ' , revealing how misguided his decisions were
john bilardi , who fled to the middle east last year from his melbourne home , reportedly died after he blew himself up in a suicide mission targeting the iraq armed forces at ramadi in central iraq last week
suicide bomber : isis leaked a photograph of 18 - year - old australian jake bilardi ( pictured ) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it john bilardi talks with michael usher on 60 minutes on sunday night , revealing the possible reasons around his son 's fateful decision to flee into the arms of islamic state the attack was a failure
iraq military official , general tahssin ibrahim , said no one was killed and just a few vehicles were damaged in john bilardi 's suicide mission
the extremist site sought to praise john bilardi but delivers backhanded comments describing his weakness and ultimately the futility of his sacrifice
â he started fighting in baiji against the isf räfidha and was a lion on the battlefield although he was at a young age and with a weak body , he was like a mountain , â the post , on a tumblr blog site associated with the muslim extremist group , said
it goes on to say that john bilardi volunteered for a ' martyrdom operation ' - code words for a suicide bombing - and that he was eager to carry out the mission
earlier social media posts suggested john bilardi had wanted to take part in a suicide bombing in baiji in iraq , but that he pulled out of this mission because he got cold feet
instead he fought in the city before again signing up for martrydom and being sent to ramadi in iraq
the post said john bilardi was ' full of happiness as he was finally going to meet his lord and receive the great rewards promised by him
' but it goes on to mock his sacrifice
' this brother originated from an atheist family & ended up selling his soul to allah for a cheap price , ' the post says
jake bilardi ( left ) in a school photo from year 10 - the year he converted to muslim according to school friends , and another image of him wearing a chelsea football club shirt ( right ) an image of john bilardi sitting in front of an islamic state flag was posted to twitter , ahead of his suicide mission in iraq , which authorities labelled ' a failure ' the post said that during his time in ramadi , john bilardi was very devout ' known for his worship of allah ' and would fast every other day
it said john bilardi accepted muslim three years ago â even though his parents basically went to war with him at home tried to stop him from reverting â
' happy - slapped ' : jake bilardi was bullied while at high school in craigieburn secondary college in melbourne 's north , and video emerged of the incident ahead of his suicide mission for islamic state the bullying tactic sees a group of people slap their victim and film it on a camera phone before uploading it on - line in order to humiliate them
here jake bilardi is ' happy slapped ' while at school the former craigieburn secondary college student , converted to muslim in 2012 when he was in year 10
a video later surfaced from his school days which shows john bilardi being ' happy slapped ' - a bullying tactic which sees a group of people slap their victim , film it and upload it on - line to humiliate them
in december , john bilardi reached ramadi , a city located in central iraq , and said he ' made hijra ( or departed ) â in august
he was considered a well - educated maths genius , who dreamed of one day becoming a political journalist and even founded a children âs soccer charity but by the time he âd reached his 18th birthday jake bilardi âs mind had been warped
if you believe his tale of events - detailed in an articulate blog called from melbourne to ramadi : my journey-bilardi joined islamic state fighters in iraq after years of historical research and a final realisation that ' i was growing tired of the corruption and filthiness of australian society and yearned to live under the islamic state with the muslims '
however , the picture john bilardi paints of himself â a scholar and a rational thinker â is very different to the lonely outcast that his former classmates at craigieburn secondary college have described
â at school he was a " loner "
he only really had two or three friends from memory but they were n't the type of friends that if he was in need of some help were good at helping , â a former classmate told daily mail australia
â he was obviously a kid that needed some help or guidance and he thought converting to muslim was right for him , â they opined
another classmate , after hearing that john bilardi may be dead , described him as not ' capable of punching his way out of a wet paper bag
' the kid ( was ) angry at the world and wants to take it out on innocent people
