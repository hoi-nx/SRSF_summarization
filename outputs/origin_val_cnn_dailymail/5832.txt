multi-millionaire hedge fund boss taylor who handed Â£ 600,000 to the labour party a multi-millionaire hedge fund boss who handed Â£ 600,000 to the labour party , also stands to cash in from the privatisation of nhs services
taylor was unveiled last week as the generous benefactor who has become the party âs fourth largest donor over the past three years
ed miliband , who has had at least one private meeting with him , has attacked the conservatives for being â the party of mayfair hedge funds â , the exclusive part of londoner where mr taylor âs firm is based
and yesterday it emerged that mr taylor âs company , nevsky capital , advises a fund with a Â£ 10million stake in united health , an us private healthcare giant which has run nhs - funded gp surgeries and is bidding for health service contracts
conservatives mps accused mr ed miliband of being a â hypocrite â for taking his money after labour party have hit out at nhs â privatisation â under the coalition and claimed they would prevent it if they win office
united health uk , its arm in this country , has run a number of gp surgeries over the past few years
but the firm was fined tens of millions of dollars in the us for allegations it over-charged patients
it is also bidding for other nhs work including a controversial Â£ 1.2billion contract for cancer and end - of - life care in staffordshire and stoke on trent , described as the health service âs biggest ever privatisation
the deal - for which a number of other private companies including richard branson âs virgin care ltd are also bidding - has been opposed by labour party âs andy burnham who said all private contracts should be halted until after the general election
the nevsky fund , managed by mr taylor âs firm , is based in the cayman islands , a secretive tax haven where investors can protect their identities and can avoid paying tax on the hedge fund âs profits
there is no suggestion mr taylor - who has said he is domiciled in the uk - or his investors have avoided tax
conservatives mps have accused ed miliband of being a â hypocrite â for taking money from hedge fund boss taylor mr taylor told the sunday times it might seem â a bit odd â for a hedge fund manager to support labour party but he believed that â everyone should contribute to society and that those who are lucky enough to earn a lot should contribute more
â last week labour party faced allegations it had tried to cover up his identity , after it emerged a newspaper had first asked about his identity several months ago
he has given Â£ 591,800 since 2012
parties are required to identify all donors who have given more than Â£ 7,500 , but because only the person âs name is given it can be difficult to identify those with common names such as mr taylor
the party issued a statement from him last week , saying : â there is no mystery
this â taylor is me â
i am a born and bred londoner , who also happens to be a hedge fund manager
and i am proud to support the labour party
â a labour party spokesman said yesterday : â we are grateful to people from all walks of life who support the labour party and our better plan
unlike david cameron and the conservatives who increasingly rely on the money of an exclusive group of donors â the same people who they have rewarded with tax breaks - ed miliband will enter downing street owing nothing to anybody
