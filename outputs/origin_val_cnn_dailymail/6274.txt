the agency veteran has been described as a true hero known by his agency identity roger , he presided over a campaign of espionage and armed drone strikes that have killed both terrorists and civilians
many of al qaeda 's most influential leaders have been slain under his leadership , but the main threat has since shifted to isis
in a post profile written in 2012 , he was described as chain - smoker and ' not at all a team player ' by colleagues
he was also the basis for the character ' the wolf ' in the film zero dark thirty and is said to have spent hours on the treadmill reading terrorism reports
but agency spokesman dean boyd paid tribute to the senior official as news of his departure surfaced
he said : ' after nearly a decade of outstanding work in this post , including the takedown of countless terrorists and many other successes in protecting the country , he will be moving on in connection with the cia modernization plan announced last month

kyle chandler ( left ) and jessica chastain ( right ) during one of the scenes the move was prompted after nine outside experts spent three months analyzing the agency 's management structure
these included what deputy cia director david cohen called ' pain points ' - or organizational areas where the cia 's bureaucracy does not work efficiently
us officials said that brennan decided the agency had to increase the resources and emphasis it devoted to cyberspace because advanced communications technology is rapidly becoming pervasive
historically , electronic eavesdroppers at the national security agency have been at the cutting edge of digital innovation within the us government
but the cia felt that it too had to reorganize to keep up with the technological ' pace of change , ' as one official put it .
