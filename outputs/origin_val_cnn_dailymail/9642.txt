blair achieved ' very very little ' in his role as middle east peace envoy and should withdraw from political activity in the region , a former senior british diplomat said last night
oliver miles , the former ambassador to libya , said mr blair was the ' wrong man ' who had ' not been able to do the job '
other critics branded mr blair 's role a ' fig leaf ' and said his role in the iraq war made it impossible for him to do the job
blair achieved little in his role as middle east envoy and should withdraw from political activity in the region , a former british diplomat has said he said the role , as the representative of the quartet of the un , the eu , russia and the us , was a ' convenient excuse for doing nothing ' and that was what he had achieved
mr blair has been the envoy for the four peace negotiators since shortly after he stepped down as prime minister in 2007
in that time , the office of the quartet representative has received a total of Â£ 20million in funding , mostly from the us and eu
mr blair is not paid for the role
his office did not confirm the reports yesterday that he was planning to ' step back ' from the job
it is thought an announcement is due later this week
there was no official reaction to the speculation about his change of role yesterday in europe or the us , and downing street refused to comment on the speculation
a downing street spokesman would say only that the former pm had been ' important work as the quartet 's representative
' oliver miles , a former british diplomat , said : ' i think he 's the wrong man and i also think it 's the wrong job ' but mr oliver miles was damning about mr blair 's role , and of the suggestion he could take on a ' wider role ' in the region
the job was , he said , a ' convenient excuse for doing nothing '
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : ' i think he 's not been able to do the job
i think he 's the wrong man and i also think it 's the wrong job
' ' he was appointed i think it was the day he ceased to be british prime minister and it struck me at the time as a very strange appointment in many ways
i 'm surprised he accepted it frankly
' asked if he was saying mr blair should play no role in the region , he said : ' yes i am
i think it 's a mistake
he 's the wrong man
i find it hard to believe , frankly , that the british government would support him having a wider role
' i find it even harder to believe that the russia , who are also members of the quartet , would support him having a wider role
' i 'm afraid if they do the reason is simply that he is a convenient excuse for doing nothing and that 's been the case over the eight years that we 've seen him in that
' the quartet has not achieved anything and blair as its representative has achieved very , very little
' tory mp crispin blunt said mr blair 's decision was ' well overdue
' ' his effectiveness was ended almost as soon as he was appointed when he was n't allowed to do the politics , he was only allowed to do the economics of the middle east peace process
' frankly it was a waste of time , he never had the mandate from the quartet to achieve peace
' andrew mackinlay , the former labour mp and former member of the foreign affairs committee said mr blair 's position was ' always a fig leaf '
he was disqualified from day one from fulfilling the role of peace envoy because of iraq â which runs like a vein through all conflicts in the middle east
' mr blair has been the envoy for the un , the eu , russia and the us since shortly after he stepped down as prime minister in 2007 on sunday a financial times report said mr blair was planning to ' step back ' from the job and in negotiations to ' recast ' his role while remaining involved in the peace process
he is thought to have met john kerry , the us secretary of state , and federica mogherini , the eu 's foreign policy chief , recently to discuss a possible job change
it follows months of concerns about potential conflicts of interest between mr blair 's role in peace negotiations in the middle east and his business pursuits
sources told the ft that mr blair has realised that his peace role is no longer tenable
there is also mounting unease in the us and eu over his poor relations with senior palestinian authority figures
mr blair does not disclose his clients , but they have included countries such as peru , colombia , kuwait , vietnam and kazakhstan
his corporate roster has featured petrosaudi , an oil company with links to the saudi royal family , finance firm jp morgan and mubadala , an abu dhabi wealth fund
senior diplomats told the financial times mr blair was being eased out
they said : ' it is long overdue
he has been ineffective in this job
he has no credibility in this part of the world
' a senior source in the us administration said : ' our position is clear
blair has been a valued partner in trying to bring peace to the middle east and we will continue to value his input and support
' last year , a group of former british ambassadors joined a campaign calling for the ex-prime minister to be removed from his role as middle east envoy , raising objections to the possible clash with his business interests and attempts to ' absolve himself ' of responsibility for the iraq crisis
david cameron 's official spokesman said yesterday : ' i have seen the reports that mr blair may be considering a revised role
' he has been doing an important role as the quartet representative since the second half of 2007
in terms of his own approach to how he thinks he may be best able to make a contribution , that is principally a matter for blair
' the prime minister thinks he has been doing important work as the quartet 's representative
