nicholls has set his sights on cracking the Â£ 3million prizemoney barrier for the third time in his career after revealing he expects many of his big names to be in action at next month âs grand national meeting at aintree
nicholls will run some of his biggest names at next month 's grant national meeting at aintree the man who has his ninth trainer âs title as good as in the bag also revealed he is likely to have more runners during the summer months in an attempt kick - start stable jockey sam â title challenge in the post-ap mccoy era
definitely not heading to aintree are champion chase winner dodging bullets and coral cup victor aux ptits soins , who have run their last races of the season
but aintree - bound are silviniaco conti , a disappointing seventh beind coneygree in the gold cup , as well as world hurdle second and third zarkandar and saphir du rheu , with the latter possibly reverting back to steeplechasing
nicholls â grand national challenge is headed by rocky creek and unioniste , whose denman chase third when trying to give weight to gold cup winner coneygree at newbury last month now looks a fair effort
nicholls , whose double at kempton on saturday following his three successes at the cheltenham festival took him to 97 winners and Â£ 2.63million for the campaign , said : â i love going to aintree and the aim is to crack the Â£ 3m in prizemoney
there is a long way to go in the season yet
it would be nice to do that
â but there are a lot of horses i will finish now and save for next year
we want to help sam be champion jockey
anything a bit below top class could run on through the summer to try to get him as many winners before we properly get going
silviniaco conti ( right ) , a disapponting seventh in the betfrd gold cup , will line up at aintree â last year we had a very slow start and sam only had five winners for us by october
â whether silviniaco conti runs in another gold cup has yet to be decided but after a third defeat in the race , nicholls knows his priority with the gelding will be trying to win a third king george at kempton on boxing day
nicholls , who revealed rsa chase runner - up southfield theatre has underone an operation to prevent infection in the bad leg cut he picked up during the race , added : â the plan with silviniaco conti will be aintree if he is alright
he likes it there and i have to accept now he is better on a flat track
world hurdle second place - getter zarkandar ( pictured ) and stablemate saphir du rheu will also run â noel ( fehily ) said he did nât travel well throughout the gold cup although watching , it looked like he did
i think coneygree got a lot of them out of their comfort zone
it is what denman used to do to them
â â we will have to think about what to do but next season will be built around the betfair chase and king george without a shadow of a doubt
â meanwhile , although mark bradstock - trained coneygree has run his last race of the season , younger brother flintham could represent the family in the three - mile novices â hurdle at the grand national meeting
