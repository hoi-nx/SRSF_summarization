when davis arrives back at hampden for the first time in four years it is sure to be a bittersweet occasion for the former rangers captain
the memories will come flooding back of his five cup finals as an ibrox midfielder that ended with the ibrox players being showered in champagne and drenched in adulation
there was a time when davis dreamed life would always be like this ; that his next trip to mount florida would be to add to those two scottish cup and three league cup wins secured under walter smith
southampton midfielder davis shoots at goal during a match against west ham last month yet those aspirations ended abruptly when the economics of the madhouse behind the scenes at ibrox intersected with cold hard reality and rangers plunged into the financial abyss in 2012
when davis returns to the city to skipper northern ireland in a friendly with scotland next wednesday night , he knows he could face a hostile reception from the rangers fans in the crowd who remain raw about the way their on - field leader walked out when the going got tough
yet with no clarity on what the future held for the club under charles green , davis was one of several leading players who opted to move on rather than remain to usher in the new era under charles green
while davis takes no personal pleasure from vindication , time has shown his switch to high - flying southampton to be a shrewd move , as rangers have , by contrast , stumbled between alternating humiliations and crises over the last three years
and while the 30 - year - old would understands any animosity , he hopes the fans realise he was left with no other realistic choice
davis ( centre ) lifts the scottish cup trophy after rangers beat falkirk 1 - 0 in the 2009 final at hampden â i âm really looking forward to the match against scotland , â said davis , who won three spl titles and was a uefa cup finalist between 2008 and 2012
â i âve always wanted to get back up the road to catch a game but with the number of fixtures we have nowadays i have nât managed
â i âve fond memories from the majority of my appearances at hampden and without doubt , i always hoped i âd play there a few more times with rangers
when you enjoy as much success as we did in finals , you clearly want to continue in the same vein
â we always seemed to do well in the cup competitions but none of us â whether you were a fan or a player â could have foreseen what would happen at the club
â when you play football , you do nât really have your mind on anything else but with the publicity rangers get , we started to get away from that
â when the new people came in , we did nât know who we were dealing with and there was no dialogue in terms of telling us which direction the club was going in
â we never heard from the new owners about how they wanted to take the club forward or what their ambitions were for the next four or five years
davis ( centre ) goes flying after being fouled during northern ireland 's match against the faroes last year â we did nât even hear how the next six months might pan out
there were no conversations had with us at all and it was an impossible situation for everybody
i did nât ever get a phone call to say what the plans were or what the aims of the club were to try to progress
â i was the captain at the time so if i was nât getting a call , it âs fair to say i do nât think anyone else would have been either
â it was difficult because nobody really knew what sanctions were going to be applied and if we were going to be relegated or not
we were put in a position where we had to make a decision on our futures without knowing what the future might hold in store
â we had to make choices without knowing anything and the biggest thing from the club was there was a lack of communication so we did nât know which way it was going
â i âm sure there will still be a few people who are unhappy with the way players left but we âve seen a lot of things unravel in the last couple of years
hindsight is a wonderful thing and everybody can now see the effect the new people had after they came in
â maybe the fans can start to see where we were coming from and how we looked at it a bit better because of that
â davis ( right ) celebrates with his rangers team - mates after the ibrox club won the 2011 league cup final as rangers struggle , davis has been a key player in southampton âs challenge for a european place this season
he has tended to keep his own counsel on the thorny issue of rangers but when he joined southampton , technically as a free agent , he pushed succeeded for the st mary âs club to pay rangers a fee
these days he just hopes the damage of three years of mismanagement at ibrox can by repaired
â it is difficult to say anything in the media about it because you âre never going to come across the right way in everybody âs eyes , â the 71 - capped ulsterman said
â it was obviously a difficult situation at the time but whenever i played , i always gave 100 per cent and i loved my time at rangers
â i âve got nothing but good memories of the fans , who were excellent with me and any supporters i âve met since have only been positive
â at the time , a lot of things were said in the heat of the moment but over time , i think people have been able to see we had to make the best decisions for ourselves and our families
davis ( right ) poses with rangers manager ally mccoist after winning the scottish premier league player of the month award for september 2011 â for me , as an international player at 27 as i was then , i wanted to play at the highest level and i had to take everything into consideration
â as we did nât have any real direction at rangers we were being made aware of , we wanted to know what was happening but got nothing
â when i joined the club at first , there was no need to have that conversation because we simply went into every competition looking to win it
the fans demanded that , as did the players , but things changed and i hope rangers can get back to that soon
â i âve always wanted to get back to ibrox to see a game and if it was nât for what happened , we could potentially all still be there just now
â it âs not like we were all angling for moves
at the time , we had a great dressing room and had had a lot of success over a number of years
there was no real need for any of us to look elsewhere and it was really unfortunate things went the way they did
