labour would overhaul school inspections in favour of a â light - touch â system allowing teachers to assess each other , tristram hunt said a labour government would overhaul school inspections in favour of a â light - touch â system allowing teachers to assess each other , the party âs education spokesman has said
tristram hunt said a new peer review system would free up teachers from an â avalanche of bureaucracy â and increase confidence in the regulation process
the proposals , which would result in ofsted taking a less hands - on approach , could be a reality by 2020 if labour was elected , he said
mr tristram hunt acknowledged that the regulator had been a vehicle for progress , but said it was beginning to â choke something far more precious â , and threaten the â joy â of schooling
speaking at the annual conference of the association of teachers and lecturers in liverpool , he said : â we can begin the process of â mass devolution â where important powers over professional standards , quality assurance , curriculum development and peer review are handed over to profession - led bodies â and we will
â ofsted needs to move towards a supportive , light - touch , profession - led , centrally moderated , peer review system of inspection
â i want this conference to hold me to account for moving towards it over the course of the next parliament
â the proposals would see teachers and head teachers helping to assess the performance of other schools
mr tristram hunt said : â let nobody tell you this is a soft touch
let nobody tell you this is a threat to standards
rather this is the embodiment of trust , collaboration and a 21st - century approach to rigour and under - performance
â the proposals would see teachers and headteachers helping to assess the performance of other schools ( file picture ) he added : â i want to see an inspectorate that moves beyond box - ticking and data - dependence
â i want to see an inspectorate that allows heads with a strong track record the space to innovate and develop a richer criterion of school achievement
â priya dutta , spokesman for the campaign for real education , said : â the system needs an overhaul , and in general we would welcome proposals for this
â but the problem with peer review is that it âs so open to abuse
â we would be sceptical about how impartial this peer review would be , so these things would need to be planned very carefully
â i âm slightly wary of ofsted taking a step back because i think there needs to be an independent teaching review body
i wonder how effective peer review would be in practice
