the queen is famous for her love of launer london handbags while the duchess of cornwall and the duchess rarely ever carry bags at all
one royal who has no such qualms about hand luggage is spanish 's queen letizia who arrived to chair a charity meeting cheerfully toting a black leather number by one of her favourite brands , hugo boss
the 42 - year - old was chairing the annual committee meeting of the spanish arm of unicef - an event that she has attended nearly every year since marrying king felipe
hard at work : spanish 's queen letizia was all business as she chaired a unicef meeting today serious though the business at hand was , letizia 's choice of ensemble proved a treat for fashion fans with the spanish queen combining a neat bouclÃ© with a silk shirt and tailored trousers
rounding it off was a chic tote by hugo boss and one of her trademark pairs of spike - heeled court shoes
letizia , who attended the meeting with the spanish secretary of state for welfare and equality , susana camarero , is unicef spanish 's honorary president and has long championed charitable causes
as well as her work with unicef , the royal is president of the royal board on disability , which works to make life easier for the physically and mentally handicapped in spanish , and is patron of a slew of culture and media charities
the latter comes as no surprise given letizia 's own journalistic roots , with the 42 - year - old enjoying a lengthy career in tv and newspapers before marrying king felipe in 2004
after a stint at asturian daily paper , la nueva espaã±a , she went on to work for abc , a popular national newspaper that enjoys the third largest circulation in spanish
glamorous : the royal opted for a businesslike ensemble comprised of a boucle jacket and silk shirt important : the spanish queen has been involved with unicef since marrying king felipe in 2004 next came a spell at spanish news agency efe before a move to guadalajara in mexico saw her take on a role on local paper , siglo 21
back in spanish a year later , she worked for the spanish version of bloomberg , a news channel and agency specialising in economics , before moving to cnn +
by the time she met her husband - to - be , letizia was working for popular tv channel 24 horas , where along with anchoring the popular telediario 2 evening news bulletin , she reported on a wide range of breaking news events , among the 9/11 attacks
perhaps as a result of her reporting background , letizia is one of the most enthusiastically pro-newspaper royals in europe and regularly turns out for media awards ceremonies
by contrast , prince philip is notoriously mistrustful of the media and once quipped to the matron of a caribbean hospital he was visiting : ' you have mosquitoes
i have the press ! ' queen of journalists : letizia is also patron of several media charities and regularly attends writing awards predecessor : letizia 's mother - in - law queen sofia preceded her in the honorary president role when asked by guardian journalist polly toynbee whether he read the paper during a buckingham palace reception , an affronted prince philip allegedly replied : ' no fear ! ' others to complain about the press include prince harry and the duke and duchess - all of whom have run into difficulty with the media
prince william , who last year threatened a pair of photographers with legal action after they were spotted taking photos of prince george , is fiercely protective of his - and his wife 's - privacy
although the british media has agreed to follow guidelines laid out in the editor 's code , foreign newspapers have printed a slew of controversial images , among them one taken as a gust of wind blew the duchess of cambridge 's skirt up in australia
most notorious of all was an incident in which a french paparazzi photographer took photos of a sunbathing duchess as she relaxed outside a secluded farmhouse from a road a mile away using a long lens
the resulting pictures , which were then published by the french version of closer magazine in september 2012 , left prince william furious and he later took legal action against the offending photographer for invasion of privacy .
