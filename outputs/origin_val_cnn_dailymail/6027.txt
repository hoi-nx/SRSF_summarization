uk airlines are planning to introduce rules ensuring that two crew members are on the flight deck at all times once an aircraft is airborne
the move was prompted by germanwings co-pilot andreas lubitz who commanded the autopilot on his airbus a- 320 to descend from 38,000 feet to just 100 feet while it was approaching the french alps after his captain stepped out to the toilet
the faa requires at least two crew members on the flight deck at all times to prevent similar types of disaster
disaster prevention : budget airlines easyjet and norwegian air shuttle will introduce new rules to ensure two crew members are in the cockpit at all times in the wake of the germanwings air disaster tragedy : it emerged today that germanwings co-pilot andreas lubitz ( pictured ) locked the plane 's pilot out of the cockpit and ' deliberately ' crashed the plane into the french alps , killing 150 people on board safety : now budget carrier easyjet has announced the new move will come into force tomorrow and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it ' mandatory ' across all airlines the uk 's civil aviation authority has written to all uk operators following tuesday 's tragedy asking them to review their flight deck protocols
already monarch , easyjet , virgin atlantic and thomas cook said they will implement a new two crew rule , while jet2 , flybe and irish airline ryanair said they already had such a system
british airways said it would not discuss ' issues of security ' as a matter of policy
according to virgin atlantic : ' we always ensure we have the highest safety standards and , while it is our common practice to have two members of our crew in the flight deck at all times , in light of recent events we are now in the process of formalising this to be policy
' an easyjet spokeswoman said : ' easyjet can confirm that , with effect from friday 27 march , it will change its procedure which will mean that two crew members will be in the cockpit at all times
' this decision has been taken in consultation with the civil aviation authority
the safety and security and of its passengers and crew is the airline 's highest priority
' the faa already has rules which require two crew members to remain on the flight deck at all times easyjet said a cabin crew member will temporarily enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet
the airline will not have a third trained pilot on board
the change is also being implemented by package tour operator thomas cook , whose spokesman said : ' we are adapting our procedures to ensure there will always two people in the cockpit
' an aviation industry insider said : ' there is some industry chatter about the policy becoming mandatory
' ryanair said : ' if a pilot needs to visit the bathroom the cabin crew supervisor is required to stand in the cockpit for these brief periods

' a jet2 spokeswoman said : ' this rule has been in place for a number of years to ensure the safety and security of our customers
' while a flybe spokespman said their operations manual ' states that two members of crew are to be present in the cockpit at all times during flight '
british airways and bmi regional declined to comment , while ryanair were unavailable
elsewhere around europe , the continent 's third - largest budget carrier , norwegian air shuttle , said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons
a civil aviation authority spokesman said : ' following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic germanwings incident , we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the easa ( easa ) and have contacted all uk operators to require them to review all relevant procedures
' all uk airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence
as part of this , aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot 's mental health at each medical examination which , for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot , is undertaken annually
' these detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards
' we will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident

long haul flights usually have more than two crew capable of flying the plane because shift changes are often required in flight
a spokeswoman for german carrier lufthansa , parent company of germanwings , said : ' a crew member may temporarily leave the cockpit during a specific phase of the flight
' so far , no decision has been taken to change the procedure as it is already approved by the german office of federal aviation but we will look into it
so far , we trust our procedure
it also transpired today that the germanwings co-pilot who flew the plane into the french alps at 400mph had to stop his training because he was suffering from depression and ' burnout '
mr andreas lubitz - whose family were at the scene of the crash in seyne today - postponed his pilot training in 2008 due to mental health issues and a friend said he was ' in depression '
airline bosses confirmed andreas lubitz had taken several months off work and had to retrain to join the firm but insisted he was ' 100 % fit to fly '
raid : german police have investigated andreas lubitz 's â¬ 500,000 family home in montabaur in german as well as his apartment in dusseldorf killer 's home : a french alps prosecutor in marseille said mr andreas lubitz 's breathing was normal as the plane descended rapidly before crashing into the french alps french alps german police have since raided andreas lubitz 's â¬ 500,000 family home in montabaur in german as well as his apartment in dusseldorf
at an extraordinary press conference earlier , marseille prosecutor robin gave a disturbing account of the cockpit voice recordings extracted from black box
he said andreas lubitz locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck
at that point , andreas lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent , something that can only be done manually - and deliberately
he said : ' the intention was to destroy the plane
the plane hit the mountain at 700kmh ( 430mph )
' i do n't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds '
earlier in the flight , mr robin said andreas lubitz 's responses were initially courteous , but became ' curt ' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane
the captain - named by local media as german father - of - two patrick sonderheimer - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter
mr robin said : ' we hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something
' so the co-pilot is on his own , and it is while he 's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane
' at this altitude , this can only be done voluntarily
we hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in , speaking through the intercom system , but there 's no answer from the cockpit
