a san francisco sheriff 's deputy who was accused of forcing inmates to perform sex acts on him in 2006 is now alleged to have organized ' gladiator style ' fights between prisoners
deputy neu was accused of orchestrating two fights at county jail no. 4 between inmates garcia and stanley harris as deputies placed bets on the outcome , adachi , the city 's public defender , said on thursday
three other deputies evan staehely , eugene jones and clifford chiba have also been accused of forcing the inmates to fight
the alleged matches took place in march when garcia and stanley harris were promised hamburgers if they won , or were threatened with mace , handcuffed beatings and transfers to dangerous housing quarters if they refused to fight , according to a report
all four deputies have been placed on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation
' these revelations are sickening , ' said adachi
' deputy neu forced these young men to participate in gladiator - style fights for his own sadistic entertainment
' garcia , 23 , pictured , said neu forced him to fight and promised him hamburgers if he won and beatings if he refused garcia , 23 , told investigators that he does not know why neu does it but believes he gets a kick out of it , according to the san francisco chronicle
' it looks like it brings him joy by doing this , while we âre suffering by what he âs doing , ' he said
garcia , who weighs 150 - lb , said he was forced twice to fight stanley harris , who weights 350 - lb. both men were injured in the bouts but were threatened with beatings if they sought medical treatment
in a recorded conversation with adachi , stanley harris said that neu , as part of ' training ' , made him do 200 push - ups within an hour , and also threatened to anally rape him
he also said neu had a tattoo reading ' 850 mob ' in reference to the address of the county jail at 850 bryant street
another inmate , jonathan christopher , said that neu carried dice and playing cards he would use to make inmates gamble against him for benefits such as food and clean laundry
adachi said he went public with details from the report prepared by private investigator simon to forestall a planned jailhouse fight meant to take place next week
he hired simon after a public defender heard about the fights from garcia 's father on march 12
sheriff mirkarimi ( above speaking during the press conference on thursday ) has moved both garcia and stanley harris from the jail and said he does not accept the alleged barbaric behavior in the county jail system the san francisco deputy sheriff 's association called the allegations ' exaggerated ' and that the fighting was ' little more than horseplay '
' ( adachi ) has done a cursory sham investigation by interviewing a few inmates over a scant two days rather than having the decency to request a serious impartial investigation , ' said harry stern , an attorney for the deputy 's union
' it is unfortunate that mr. adachi did nât initiate a formal complaint that would have been investigated thoroughly by the appropriate agencies
' the investigators would have had the opportunity to interview witnesses , including the accused deputies , and look for physical evidence
' san francisco sheriff mirkarimi said he does not accept any kind of culture within the county jail system that reports such barbaric and unlawful activities , according to abc
mirkarimi has moved the affected inmates to another facility , and adachi has called for an investigation by state or federal officials
another inmate said they had to bet neu for benefits such as food and clean laundry
adachi made the information public once he got word that there was another planned fight meant to take place next week ( above county jail no. 4 )
