it is the game which , ultimately , could define the success or otherwise of o'neill and keane âs expensive ireland tenure
installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago , Â£ 1million - per - year o'neill and his assistant keane â with a Â£ 600,000 salary - were given a remit of qualification for euro 2016 , a task made easier by the expansion to a 24 - team format
defeat against poland at the aviva stadium on sunday , however , would all but render redundant any hope of automatic progression to next summer âs finals in france
it would be they and scotland left to do battle for the play - off berth
aiden mcgeady jokes with ireland assistant keane during a training session earlier this week sunderland defender john o'shea catches a bib as the side prepare for the crucial qualifier against poland the mood here in dublin is not one of optimism
an inquest , you feel , awaits o'neill and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders
one newspaper described their manager as â bookish and vaguely befuddled â , while the â carnage â which follows keane was also noted
certainly , there has been a definite effort to play down the chaos around keane this week and the no 2 gave an untypically subdued and low - key performance in front of the press
o'neill , meanwhile , has kept all talk to football
he has ignored the opinion pieces which have called into question his impact since his arrival
he has , though , recognised the magnitude of the outcome against the poles
â the importance of the occasion should not be missed , â he said
â defeat would be a big dent in our hopes of automatic qualification
it might not decide everything , but it is very significant
we have to try to win
o'neill addresses his squad at the training session as they bid to go level with poland in group d the ireland players are out through their paces in preparation for the euro 2016 clash â i âve said all along that the home games will shape our destiny
this is the first of that group
we have to make them count
â o'neill , whose fourth - placed side trail poland by three points , added : â we can change all of that ( negative talk ) with one result and one fantastic performance
â we will not get very far with a pessimistic approach and i âm not overly concerned with what people say before the game
â we have given ourselves a chance ( of qualification ) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match
â one criticism of o'neill is that he does not know his preferred xi or , indeed , formation
that much was obvious by him talking this week of players winning a starting place should they impress at their coastal training base in malahide
o'neill is hoping to banish all the negativity around the squad with a result against poland one player not guaranteed to start is captain robbie keane
he was dropped for the morale - shattering 1 - 0 defeat in scotland in november
the la galaxy striker , 34 , was sat next to o'neill at saturday 's pre-match press conference and was diplomatic when pressed on his possible exclusion
â that âs up to the manager ( if i play ) , â he said
â i âll be ready whether that âs from the bench or starting
i âm the captain , i have to set an example
â but i would nât be here if i did nât think i could make a difference
i still want to be the best
â keane , sensing the air of negativity in his homeland , added : â it âs up to us to make this a turning point for the team
victory would give this squad and country a huge confidence boost
â lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for o'neill before they face scotland back in dublin
win , and that Â£ 1m salary would look like a shrewd investment .
