bill and freddi strauss are now experts at ' selfies ' , but when they met , online dating was a new phenomenon and they had to ask friends to help them build an internet profile flashback : the couple on their wedding day after first getting together online â we 're definitely one of the first ever dates and we believe we 're the first date that turned into a couple , ' said 72 - year - old freddi strauss
â when i first told my friends i was using the internet to find a boyfriend they were a bit anxious for me - because the internet itself was very new and online dating was unheard of ! â but as soon as they met bill they realised they did n't need to worry about anything
' although today 's online dating profiles are awash with dozens of perfect selfies , freddi strauss 's profile did n't even have a picture - as she did n't know how to upload one
' a friend had to help me set up the profile as the internet was very new , ' said freddi strauss , a travel agent
many adventures : bill and freddi strauss enjoy a meal out , despite their first date in a restaurant not going to plan the couple quickly fell in love after meeting online â i just about managed to get the profile done but a picture was an ask too far ! â he only had my personality and description to go on when i turned up for our first date
' after a week of messaging , the pair decided to start chatting on the phone and after another week decided to meet in person
a retired engineer , bill said he believed their meeting was fate
' i did n't know how i was going to get on with online dating - my picture was one of my better ones , ' said the 76 - year - old
â but as soon as i saw the lady walking in front of me i just knew it was freddie
â i guess it was meant to be
â bill , determined to impress freddi strauss , chose a chinese restaurant close to both of their homes and ordered the most expensive lobster dish on the menu
however , his idea of a romantic meal did n't go to plan when the bill came to more money than he had with him and freddi strauss had to chip in five dollars to cover the shortfall
' it was n't an impressive first date at all , ' said freddi strauss , â but i wanted to go on a second date to make sure i got my five bucks back ! â their next date did n't go any better after freddi strauss 's perm went wrong and she tried to cancel their meeting scheduled for that weekend
when bill said he did n't care what she looked like and arrived to pick her up anyway , freddi strauss opened the door with a paper bag complete with holes cut out for her eyes and mouth
despite the awkward start , freddi strauss and bill soon started seeing each other regularly and after 18 moths , bill moved into freddie 's home , before they tied the knot 18 months later

' our wedding was charming , ' said freddi strauss
' it was in a restaurant and because we 're jewish we had a huppa and lots of traditional elements
' god only knows what would have happened if we had n't had match.com - i probably would have married someone boring from my bridge club
