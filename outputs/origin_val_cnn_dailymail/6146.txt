six weeks after new zealand and australia kicked off the 2015 cricket world cup on valentine 's day with explosive wins , the two co-hosts will go head to head in what promises to be a spectacular finale at the mcg
the two sides met during the group stage , and it was new zealand who prevailed that day with a thrilling one - wicket victory in auckland when williamson swatted pat cummins for a six to the delight of the eden park crowd
ahead of sunday 's trans - tasman final in mcg , sportsmail tells you all you need to know about both teams
australia and new zealand will go head to head in the world cup final in mcg on sunday australia captain clarke and new zealand captain mccullum with the world cup trophy the 100,000 - seat mcg will host its second world cup final on sunday australia advanced to the final with a 95 - run win over india at the sydney cricket ground on thursday new zealand beat south africa by four wickets in a thrilling first semi-final at eden park in auckland australian captain â clarke the 33 - year - old has not hit top form with the bat during the tournament but showed his versatility against india , shuffling with the batting line - up to bring in the big hitters with his side in a commanding position
clarke missed the opening match of the tournament against england as he recovered from a hamstring injury , but is hungry to add world cup glory to his cv as australian captain
australian captain clarke has yet to hit top form after returning from a hamstring injury clarke , who will retire from odis after the final , practices a training drill on saturday in mcg star man â smith having become just the second australian batsman to make four consecutive world cup half - centuries after david boon , smith finally went on to make a century against india in the semi-final and heads to mcg in sparkling form
smith has spent pretty much all summer raising his bat to the crowd , scoring centuries in all four ashes test matches against india as well as odi tons against south africa in november and england in january
smith has been in stunning form all summer long , racking up the centuries in both tests and odis group a - beat england by 111 runs group a - no result vs bangladesh group a - lost to new zealand by one wicket group a - beat afghanistan by 275 runs group a - beat sri lanka by 64 runs group a - beat scotland by seven wickets qf - beat pakistan by six wickets sf - beat india by 95 runs biggest disappointment â warner aside from hitting a remarkable 178 against afghanistan , australia âs â bad boy â has failed to fire at the top of the order with his next highest score during the world cup a paltry 34 ( v new zealand )
fortunately for warner , australia 's formidable middle and lower order have been imperious , in particular smith
reason to be cheerful australia are the most successful side in world cup history having been crowned champions in 1987 , 2003 , 2007 and 2011
victory on sunday would be a fifth title and a third in the last four editions of the tournament
reason to be fearful australia have looked mighty impressive on their route to the final , but there was one blemish on their record - a defeat by sunday 's opponents new zealand in the group stages
though the four - time world champions boast a fearsome batting line - up they are susceptible to the swinging ball , as tim southee and trent boult proved on that day in auckland
former australian wicketkeeper adam gilchrist ( right ) talks to in form batsman smith australia were beaten by one wicket by new zealand when the teams met at eden park in the group stage omens australia have won eight of their last nine matches at the mcg since january 2011 with at least one of their top - five have scored a century in the winning causes , apart from when aaron finch fell for 96 against india this january
new zealand captain â mccullum mccullum âs attacking brand of captaincy on the field and aggressive batting when opening the innings have led many to label the 33 - year - old as the best one - day captain currently playing
mccullum has led new zealand from the front with his attacking , aggressive brand of cricket new zealand practiced at the mcg on friday in preparation for the final vettori ( second left ) will play his final one - day international for new zealand on sunday group a - beat sri lanka by 98 runs group a - beat scotland by three wickets group a - beat england by eight wickets group a - beat australia by one wicket group a - beat afghanistan by six wickets group a - beat bangladesh by three wickets qf - beat west indies by 143 runs sf - beat south africa by four wickets star man â vettori while trent boult has swung himself to the leading wicket - taker of the tournament thus far , 36 - year - old vettori has taken 15 vital scalps and is set to play his final one - day international on sunday in mcg
biggest disappointment â taylor the right - handed batsman came into the tournament under pressure and , apart from a half - century against bangladesh , taylor has failed to make any substantial impact on the world cup
reason to be cheerful new zealand have advanced to the final with a perfect record having already beaten australia in the group stages
sunday 's match marks their first world cup final having previously reached the semis on six separate occasions and will collect the icc 's Â£ 2.68million winning prize if they win in mcg
williamson hits the winning six in new zealand 's one - wicket win over australia in the group stage williamson shows off his football skill during new zealand 's practice session in mcg on friday reason to be fearful the co-hosts have yet to play a match outside of their country in this world cup and have nât beaten their opponents in australia since february 2009 â when they claimed a six - wicket victory at the mcg
will trent boult and tim southee be able to swing the ball in mcg as they have done in home conditions ? and how will mccullum fare with the considerably larger boundaries at the mcg than the ones in new zealand ? omens the mcg is not a happy hunting ground for the new zealand
