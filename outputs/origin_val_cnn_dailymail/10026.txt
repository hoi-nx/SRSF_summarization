a young woman , who had no luck when she posted an ad on gumtree to find the father of her unborn son , is determined to keep searching after her baby almost died at birth
bianca fazey had a one - night stand with a man in perth , western australia on april 23 last year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome
the 25 - year - old frantically searched for the father for five months but had no success as she only knew his name was jeremy who was from the perth suburb of morley
as a last - ditch attempt she decided to post the ad which only created unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers
two months ago , logan was born , but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him but now the little fella is fighting fit and healthy
now that life has returned to normal after the trauma , the graphic design student has continued to look for logan 's father , a fly - in , fly - out worker in his 20s , who she met at the harlem wednesdays night at amplifier capitol
' i 'm so appalled at comments that i am a bad mother and ' god help my child '
it makes me sick that people can judge so quickly off something that is 500 words long , ' she said on her facebook page
' yeah i am still looking , i will probably always be looking i am very curious as to who this person is and one day logan probably will be too
' i do n't ever expect him to come forward but if he did contact me , it would only be between us two and not the world
' bianca then responded to the accusations that she was paid to do the media interviews
' for the incredibly judgemental people thinking it is all about money , i have never accepted anything for the stories , i also have my own money , i work and i study full time , i am not this drop kick you assume me to be ! ' she said
' i love this beautiful boy with all my heart and i am a fantastic mother , he is strong , smart , happy and very , very loved ! ' she then went onto express her gratitude for the ongoing support of her family and friends in the town of jurien bay - 260km north of perth
' not only do i have the support of my family but also this beautiful town i live in and my amazing friends , i am so appreciative of everyone who has been kind to me even if you are holding your tongue ! ' she said
' i do n't know if this will be the end of this story , i will continue living my life and raising logan just as i have been , in no way is getting 15 minutes of fame a priority on my list
' logan , my family , our health and happiness is all that matters to me
' bianca fazey posted a gumtree ad last year in an attempt to find her unborn son 's father bianca 's ad ( pictured ) received a barrage of hateful remarks from complete strangers when bianca fell pregnant all she could think about was letting the pending father know the news
' i was at my wits end , ' she told daily mail australia in december
' i tried finding him for months and felt pressured by a friend who was adamant i do n't give up despite exhausting all avenues
' this when bianca , who was so stressed that she was losing sleep , decided to post an ad on gumtree which created a barrage of hateful responses prompting her to take to take it down
' i stupidly put it up thinking no one would even see it but who knows what will happen , maybe i will get lucky , ' she said
' unfortunately all i got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be jeremy
' the most offensive messages were from people saying that bianca should have opted for a termination
' when it was shared on the lad bible page a lot of people made single - minded comments aimed at me , no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant , ' she said
' sometimes i want to be like one of those people on maury povich screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they 're booing about ! ' bianca was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby bianca ( pictured before being pregnant ) never thought she could have children as she suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome bianca was n't exactly shocked to be called names like a ' sl * * ' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying ' kill it '
' it was sad to see people saying i should get an abortion , those were the only comments that hurt
' ' society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship , ' she said
' i was more mad at the amount of women ( mums included ) saying i should n't go through with it
' but bianca has risen above the horrendous backlash and ca n't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months
' all i can say is i chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because i did n't think i could have children , ' she said
' even though i knew this guy had disappeared i did n't want to give up my chance and i 'm so grateful i did n't
' bianca has hit out at people saying she is a ' sl * * ' , a bad mother and has only told her story for money despite the fall - out from the ad - bianca has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends
' it has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person , ' she said
' i could n't be happier , i am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment
' she is also looking forward to getting back into shape ' excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape ! ' she said
' i hate that i 'm so limited physically
' bianca still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son 's life
' i do hope that i can find him and let him know , he can make his own choice , ' she said
' but more for the sake of the kid , when he asks questions or wants to find him i want to be prepared
' she still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of logan 's life
