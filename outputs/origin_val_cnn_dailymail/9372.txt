remains sifted out of the ground zero rubble during the original recovery efforts following the september 11 attacks have been identified as those of a 26 - year - old new jersey man
yarnell , dubbed a ' merry prankster ' in an obituary that appeared in the times , became the 1,640th victim identified from among the debris thanks to dna testing , nbc times reports
yarnell was vice president of technology at fiduciary trust international
he was in a meeting on the 97th floor in the south tower when united airlines flight 175 struck
family remember the carnegie mellon graduate as a funny man
' he liked to have fun , ' his mother michele yarnell told the times not long after the tragedy

yarnell was working on the 97th floor of the south tower when ua flight 175 struck with ever - advancing technology yielding results that were impossible a dozen years ago , the unique genetic code gleaned from the bits of bone is the only hope for families waiting for anything tangible to officially confirm what they already know : their loved one is dead
in some cases , scientists have gone back to the same bone fragment 10 or 15 times , using new technology to attempt to extract dna diminished by fire , sunlight , bacteria and even the jet fuel that poured through the towers
the painstaking process involves pulverizing the bone fragments , adding a special chemical to the powder and then spinning it all in a centrifuge to break open the bone cells so dna can be extracted
then comes the last , critical step â looking to match it to an item with the victim 's dna provided by families â part of the medical examiner 's collection of 17,000 contributions
family members have long endorsed the ongoing identification process , even as some protested last year 's move of the remains to the museum site , which they fear could be prone to flooding
' do n't put them in the basement , ' rosemary cain , who lost her firefighter son at the trade center , said at a protest against the move
' give them respect so 3,000 souls can rest in peace
' other families supported the move , saying the repository is a fitting site for the remains
' it will show the world the way we treat our dead , ' lee ielpi , who lost his son in the attacks
' let 's get them back to the site
' new technology : with new technology yielding results impossible a dozen years ago , forensic scientists are still trying to match the bone with dna from those who died on sept. 11 , 2001 , and have never been identified a person demonstrates how to use a device used for milling and extracting dna , at the office of chief medical examiner in new york
yarnell became victim number 1,640 identified from the debris
over 1,100 remain unidentified the question is : how long and at what cost will the forensic team keep working to identify these last 9/11 remains ? the team 's annual salary budget is $ 230,000 , plus costs for follow - up work by other scientists and staff
desire said that as new technology becomes available , the efforts to identify the fragments will continue indefinitely
charles strozier , founding director of the center on terrorism at the john jay college of criminal justice , said that work must continue ' because our relationship to the sept. 11 disaster hinges on being able to identify and pay respects to those who died
' for desire , it 's not just a grim scientific task â it 's personal
he was under the still - standing towers minutes after the two hijacked planes hit them , having rushed down with the then - chief medical examiner , dr. charles hirsch
as the towers toppled , the men were struck and bloodied by falling glass and debris
' it 's a service and an honor , working on something that has transformed american history , ' he said
the death toll stemming from the attacks at the world trade center stands at 2,753
of those , 1,113 victims have not been identified through a dna match to items provided by families â toothbrushes , combs , clothing or swabs from relatives impossible to forget : there have been no identifications of 1,113 missing people and 7,703 of the samples of human remains can not be identified
