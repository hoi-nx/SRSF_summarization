they stood alongside each other , peering anxiously towards the kop
as a sea of red and white jerseys jostled and pointed fingers , sir alex ferguson and sir bobby charlton never blinked
then , as referee martin atkinson restored order , alex ferguson cracked
turning to see who was on the row behind him in anfield âs directors box , alex ferguson could not help himself
suddenly he was beaming , his smile born of elation and contentment : victory had been confirmed
winning at anfield mattered more to alex ferguson than anything else when he shaped manchester united âs destiny and retirement has nât dulled the desire
that smile and subsequent tap on bobby charlton âs shoulder , told you everything about how he was feeling
sir alex ferguson looked delighted by manchester united 's victory over liverpool at anfield on sunday sir alex ferguson acknowledges manchester united supporters upon his arrival for the game against liverpool sir bobby charlton ( centre ) and ed woodward ( left ) were also at anfield to see manchester united win alex ferguson takes his seat at anfield before manchester united 's game against liverpool in the premier league mind you , he was nât alone
crammed into the anfield end , 3,000 manchester united fans were exultant , noisily acclaiming the finest performance of the louis van gaal era : their team had not played with such panache and arrogance here since the mid- 1990s
they were going to enjoy this
â we played them off the pitch in the first half , i think , â louis van gaal mused afterwards
â it was the best 45 minutes ( of the season )
we scored a fantastic goal , we gave nothing away
it really was a superb first half
in the dressing room , i gave the players all my compliments
â louis van gaal might have been less than impressed by what he in the second half but do not doubt how much satisfaction this win provided
as he walked out of anfield later to catch the team bus , he stopped and took look around the famous old stadium
his contentment was beyond question
as well it might have been
this was the afternoon when the louis van gaal masterplan started to come together
for all the liverpool had shortcomings , the simple truth was that they could nât get near manchester united and were lucky that only one goal separated them at the break
all over the pitch , manchester united players stood out like beacons
phil jones , for starters , was terrific in the centre of defence , keeping daniel sturridge under wraps for much of the game ; antonio valencia personified diligence at right back
it was in midfield , however , were manchester united stamped their class
maroune fellaini dominated , setting an aggressive tone ; daley blind was impressively solid while ander herrara passed the ball with purpose and precision , most devastatingly when he set mata free for the opening goal

for large parts of the 15 months he has been at old traffford , you have wondered why they spent Â£ 37million on him â then you see how he played here , like when scoring that glorious second , and can understand why michael carrick called mata â little magician â
ed woodward , for one , was certainly impressed after he had exchanged passes with angel di maria and capped the move with a bicycle kick that arrowed past simon mignolet
â what a goal ! â ed woodward exclaimed , as he gave charlton a hug
mata , by contrast , was slightly more circumspect
â in the last few months i âve not had the best moments but i am the same player that i was when i came to england , â he said
â i have the same passion , the same illusion , but it is the manager who decides
but obviously i âm happy because we played well in a very difficult game
â much has been spoken about manchester united this year , largely about how they are a pale shadow compared to what has gone before
in some respects that is absolutely right : how many of this starting line - up would have got into the treble winning side of 1999 ? probably only wayne rooney
but time moves on and the 2014 - 15 squad are beginning to move in the right direction and what has been most impressive is the reaction they have produced since that chastening night against arsenal two weeks ago when they were bounced out of the fa cup
a 3 - 0 demolition of tottenham followed by a win against their most bitter rivals has made fourth place manchester united âs to lose and that will ensure louis van gaal has achieved the objective that he was set by ed woodward when arriving last summer
â we are coming back and we beat liverpool again , â said van gaal
â we beat them with their own weapons and pressure on the ball
now the gap is five points ahead of liverpool and six ahead of tottenham and southampton so the moment to win is one of the most important in my career
â manchester united manager louis van gaal ( centre ) described the win as one of the most important of his career manchester united 's players applaud their supporters after their 2 - 1 win against arch rivals liverpool when he talks about points gaps , maybe louis van gaal should really be looking forward than studying what lurks behind
after all , they are only eight points behind league leaders chelsea and there are still eight matches to play
manchester united to be league champions ? perhaps not this year
but why ca nât they finish runners - up ? should louis van gaal âs play as they did at anfield on the run to the line , nobody will enjoy to facing them
and that , more than anything , will give alex ferguson reason to smile again .
