the damning thing for leicester city in this match they really needed to win was that there was no cavalry charge , no guns blazing crescendo
tom huddlestone was dismissed for second bookable offence with 18 minutes to go but mcgregor in the hull goal had not one meaningful save to make as the clock ticked down

in the final minute he reacted expertly to stop an abel hernandez shot following a quickly - taken free - kick by dame nâdoye
had that gone in , the obituaries on leicester city âs premier league life could have been signed off

jake livermore of hull attempts to keep possession at the king power stadium under pressure from leicester city 's esteban cambiasso leicester city matched hull in a 3 - 5 - 2 formation , with half a dozen genuine defenders concentrating solely on keeping the ball away from danger
they did their jobs well , in a contest that began so short on opportunities or entertainment mass narcolepsy was an entirely possible outcome

vardy was a nuisance all match for the hull defenders , his pace and energy unsettling
