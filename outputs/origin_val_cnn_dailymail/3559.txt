a horrific video has emerged claiming to show a nine - year - old child being brutally murdered by members of a shia militia who accused him of being a supporter of the islamic state terror group
the footage was purportedly filmed near the iraqi city of tikrit , where a coalition of 30,000 iraqi army soldiers and private shia armies launched a campaign to oust isis militants earlier this week
the horrific film has not been independently verified and could easily be just the latest piece of propaganda to be released by the terrorist organisation
nevertheless the sheer brutality of the clip calls into question the policy of allowing local armed groups to lead the fightback against isis
' did you not fire at us ? ' one man towering over the boy shouts , to which the helpless child replies ' by god i did not fire one single bullet
' the armed men plead to be allowed to execute the young boy , who begs for them to spare his life
one soldier wearing camouflage trousers bravely steps forward and demands nobody shoot , asking ' what is wrong with you guys ? ' , which leads to an argument among the men
the militiaman is ordered not to stand in the way of the terrified child , who crawls on his knees in a vain attempt to escape while pleading his innocence and warning the men that ' god is watching '
seconds later a fighter to the left of the camera fires his automatic weapon several times , with the bullets striking the child in the head and killing him instantly
the camera then closes in on the dead child 's face and shows brain and the armed men ( left ) plead to be allowed to execute the young boy , who begs for them to spare his life ( right ) horrific : a fighter to the left of the camera fires his automatic weapon several times , with the bullets striking the child in the head and killing him instantly although the video clearly shows the murder of a young child , reports that the execution was carried out by shia militia battling isis militants near tikrit could not be independently verified
the film has been widely shared by pro-isis social media accounts since it was first uploaded to liveleak yesterday as it plays into the terrorist sympathisers ' narrative that the iranian - back shia militia attempting to oust isis from tikrit are no better than the jihadis themselves
this morning the us ' top general said iranian 's direct support for an iraqi push to dislodge isis from tikrit could turn out to be ' a positive thing ' if it does not inflame sectarian tensions
the statement by general general dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , reflected the delicate balance washington is trying to strike between limiting iranian influence and allowing iraqi leaders to determine their own path towards defeating isis
battle : shia fighters fire their weapons during clashes with islamic state militants near tikrit yesterday rockets are fired from the back of shia vehicles as they engage islamic state terrorists near tikrit shia fighters hide behind sandbags while fighting islamic state militants near tikrit yesterday afternoon an armed shia fighter takes up his position during clashes with islamic state militants close to tikrit us officials say iraqi did not ask the us to provide air support for the tikrit offensive , even though the us - led military coalition has been conducting air strikes in much of iraqi since august and has deployed hundreds of us soldiers to try to regenerate an iraqi army that collapsed last june
general dempsey said iranian and its proxies have been operating inside iraqi since 2004 , but the tikrit campaign signals a new level of involvement
he said that about two - thirds of the force seeking to retake tikrit is comprised of iranian - based shia militia fighters
iraqi government troops make up the other third
tikrit , the hometown of former iraqi president saddam hussein , is a predominantly sunni city
retaking the isis stronghold is considered vital if government forces are to succeed in their plan to force isis out of the oil rich city of mosul , the terror group 's iraqi power base which lies just 140 miles north of tikrit on highway 1 - a road that effectively marks the front line in northern iraqi .
