with her puppy dog eyes , millie the cocker spaniel knows exactly how to persuade her owner to feed her a treat
she stares up , pleading for a morsel of food , and when her owner maguire gives in , the dog waddles around wagging her tail in delight
but all those extra nibbles have added up - and now millie is morbidly obese
vets say that millie , who has now been put on a strict diet , is symptomatic of the ballooning uk population of obese pets
according to a report published today by the pdsa ( pdsa ) , there will be more overweight pets than healthy pets within five years
some 80 per cent of vets surveyed by the charity reported an increase in obesity cases they had seen in the last two years
mrs maguire , 75 , from romford , admitted that millie put on weight because she is fed too much
she said her dog has perfected the begging routine - even doing a â happy dance â when fed an extra treat
fat : bulldog daisy , from middlesbrough , is another of uk 's heavy hounds portly : but it is not just a problem with dogs - grace the giant rabbit also weighs far too much all creatures great and small : as does spider , the rotund rat , who was pictured by pdsa staff in swansea â i do give in to her begging far too often , â mrs maguire said
â i have four rescue cats and when i feed them she âs hovering around and grabs any food she can
i have to shut her in another room and feed them on the table
â even then , if i turn my back for a moment she âll be straight in , she âll steal and eat all the cats â food given the slightest chance
â according to a poll of 1,000 pet owners carried out by pdsa , nearly half do not realise weight is a problem for their pets
the problem is particularly acute for dogs
the estimate more than six million dogs - about 75 per cent - in the uk are exercised for less than an hour a day
the problem is getting worse , with fewer dogs than ever being properly exercised , fuelling an explosion in canine obesity
warning : the pdsa says obesity is exploding within the dog population , although many owners do n't realise it is a problem
poppy the pug ( pictured ) has been on a diet since she was rescued from a puppy farm diet : tina , an overweight border terrier with pdsa veterinary nurse laura meiklejohn at edinburgh chunky : guy the cat weighed in a 10kg , or 22lb - medium sized cats should weigh about half that walkies : bobby , a labrador from dundee , could do with more exercise - like six million dogs in the uk separate research found that 2.7million - a third of uk dogs - are not being given daily off - lead exercise , an increase of 600,000 since 2011
vets say obesity in animals creates the same health risks as it does in humans
overweight pets develop deadly conditions such as heart disease , cancer and diabetes , as well as debilitating conditions including arthritis
dr philippa yam , of glasgow university âs school of veterinary medicine , said : â it âs clear that pet obesity continues to be a major issue due to a lack of understanding about pets â welfare needs
â running : research has found that 2.7million - a third of uk dogs - are not being given daily off - lead exercise
duke the labrador , pictured going for a stroll in cardiff , weighs 61kg , but should be 28 to 30kgs hope : the owners of zorro the cat from dundee managed to get its weight under control once more pdsa is encouraging owners to join its pet fit club competition - an annual contest to help reduce animals â weight
nicola martin , head of pet health at pdsa , said : â our research has shown that pet obesity is a growing problem and that too many people are continuing to feed their pets inappropriate foods including takeaways , cake , cheese and chips and sadly many pets are nât getting enough exercise
â over the past decade , pet fit club has transformed the lives of some of the uk â s most obese pets , having helped nearly 100 animals shed over 60 stone so we are welcoming entries again and offering our expertise
