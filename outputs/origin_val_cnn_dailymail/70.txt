she said mr richardson , from great yarmouth , had little chance of surviving a cardiac arrest and attempting to save him would have been ' futile and cruel '
' i sat down and thought long and hard about it
' we had discussed his condition , he cried and he seemed quite upset about how it would affect his wife
' i felt bringing up resuscitation would be even more distressing for him ' , she said
patient confidentiality meant she could not approach mr richardson 's family without first talking to him
the inquest heard the hospital 's policy at the time said it was not necessary to discuss a dnr decision if it would be ' unnecessarily burdensome ' for the patient
the hospital 's policy was not to discuss such a decision if it would be ' unnecessarily burdensome ' for the patient
this was changed in light of a 2014 court of appeal ruling and now states patients should be informed of the decision , unless this would cause physical harm
dr blackburn added : ' if i was faced with mr richardson today , i would have that discussion
' mrs richardson challenged the doctor in the inquest , saying : ' my husband had a lot to live for even if it was for another week - i 'm sorry your decision was very , very wrong

' he said , " i ca n't breathe , take me home - i ca n't stand it any more
they 're trying to kill me " , ' she added
' i said , " i love you " , and then he said he loved me too
that was the last time i saw him alive
