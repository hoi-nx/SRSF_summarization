gove was the architect of the tory ' education policies , but after clashing with teaching unions , officials and other cabinet ministers he was shifted to the lower profile role of chief whip gove is still in control of schools policy , despite being ousted from his job education secretary last summer , the lib dem have claimed
david laws said the senior tory still has a grip on shaping government policy on education , eight months after being shifted to become chief whip
the claims are a fresh blow for new education secretary nicky morgan , who last month angrily denied claims mr gove was receiving confidential documents from her department despite being sacked six months ago
mr gove was the architect of the tory ' education policies , but after clashing with teaching unions , officials and other cabinet ministers he was shifted to the lower profile role of chief whip
but mr david laws , the lib dem schools minister , has claimed that with no.10 and the treasury he is still dictating policy rather than mrs morgan
mr david laws told the independent : ' while nicky morgan 's instincts are moderate , the people who control education policy in the conservative party are still gove , david cameron and george osborne
' the face and language may have changed but the tory policies have n't
' he added that there had been ' some pretty big rows ' over initiatives such as a 2 % pay rise for teachers and the prime minister 's 500 free schools plan , both announced last week
he told the paper : ' in all of these areas , the block seemed to be outside the department ( for education ) , not inside it
it is policy driven by an ideological approach rather than a calm appreciation of the facts and evidence
' mr gove was ' massively influential ' in the tory hierarchy , mr david laws added , but said he did not know if the senior tory was seeing ms morgan 's papers
responding to similar claims last month , ms morgan insisted that she is in charge of the department
she said : ' i just think that this is a complete load of nonsense
' gove has been nothing but supportive , as have other former education secretaries from different political perspectives
' david laws said mr gove still has a grip on shaping government policy on education , not his new boss as education secretary nicky morgan asked whether she would be alarmed if mr gove was seeing her papers , ms morgan said : ' i have no reason to suspect that that is the case , no conversations i have had have given me any indication that 's the case
' i am in charge of the department for education and we are all united in our reforms
' the chief whip is of course going to see paperwork that goes through a number of departments
' having been in the whips ' office i know the chief whip has to be across all portfolio areas
' but as i said i am very much in charge of the department for education
