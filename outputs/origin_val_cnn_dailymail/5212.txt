it was the clash that finally lifted the threat of napoleon âs imperial ambitions from europe and brought peace after decades of war
the battle of waterloo also marked a new era for french , freed from the yoke of napoleon tyranny
but it seems that the french do nât see it that way , even after 200 years
the defeat of napoleon âs army outside a belgium town by britain , prussia and allies from europe still appears to be something of a sore point
the victory by the wellington ( left ) in 1815 stopped dictator napoleon 's ( right ) conquest of europe , and sent the emperor into exile for the second and final time
paris is attempting to block the creation of a two euro coin commemorating the 200th anniversary of the battle of waterloo britain 's Â£ 5 coin that has been issued to mark the bicentenary of the battle of waterloo in an extraordinary intervention , french has blocked plans for a two euro coin to commemorate wellington âs 1815 victory over napoleon
president hollande claimed the belgium project would be a â symbol that is negative â and undermine eurozone unity
now the belgium have scrapped plans to have the commemorative coin produced next month to avoid a diplomatic row
hollande âs government argued the battle was still a bad memory for the french people
a brussels source said : â belgium have withdrawn the project because it would not be in their interest to cause upset to the french
â last night britain politicians said french âs reaction to the coin â and belgium âs subsequent cave - in â was â absurd â
peter bone , conservative mp for wellingborough , said : â i know the euro is a useless currency but i did nât know that the french still could not cope with the fact they were defeated
' it is absurd , i would have thought the french would have been quite keen to have got rid of an emperor
the french should grow up a bit
â mp philip davies added : â it shows how thin skinned and small minded the french are , how desperate hollande is politically and how weak the belgium are
â a draft design of the coin was submitted to the council of the european union by belgium in february this year
it was expected to go into production next month but french objected to the coin last week , claiming in a letter to the council of europe that producing the coin would â risk â¦ engendering unfavourable reactions in french â
a two euro coin marking the 200th anniversary of the battle of waterloo , in which the wellington defeated napoleon ( pictured ) , has been proposed by belgium , where the battle took place the battle of waterloo on june 18 , 1815 , stopped the advance of napoleon and sent him into exile for a second and final time
in the one day of fighting there were around 55,000 either killed , wounded , or missing in action
however , the battle ushered in more than 50 years of peace
while the proposed design of the coin has not been revealed , it is understood to have featured a battle scene
the britain has issued a Â£ 5 coin to mark the bicentenary
the battle of waterloo on june 18 , 1815 stopped the advance of napoleon across europe and sent the great french emperor into exile for a second and final time
french 's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition , led by the britain army under the command of the wellington
the armies amassed near the town of waterloo in modern - day belgium , not far from the border with french , and it was the french who made the first move around 11am
the two sides clashed for 10 hours , with the britain fending off repeated attacks from the french , until marshal blã¼cher arrived at the head of a prussian army
this was the decisive intervention which finished napoleon off , allowing wellington to counter-attack and forcing the french to surrender
the battle forced napoleon from the throne of french , leading to his exile on st helena - but wellington later admitted it was ' the nearest - run thing you ever saw in your life '
despite the popular image of waterloo as a heroic endeavour , it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed , with the french bearing the brunt of the losses .
