the firm behind a mock documentary shown on the bbc last night about the â disaster â of a world without the eu received eu funding , it has emerged
the great european disaster movie , a 75 - minute film screened on bbc4 , presented an apocalyptic vision of what would happen if the eu broke apart and warned that it would have â catastrophic consequences for all of us â
it imagined an army of islamic state terrorists advancing on vienna , spain cutting off all routes to gibraltar and the prime minister of â great england â â nigel farage â sending all immigrants home
but last night it emerged that the production company that made it had received eu funding to translate the film and dub it into different languages , so it can be shown in various member states
eurosceptic mps accused the bbc of showing â eu propaganda â
brian binley , a tory backbencher , said : â i think it âs disgraceful
here is the eu commission propagating itself throughout europe
it is not a governing institution âs job to use taxpayers â money to perpetuate itself
it is not the job of the commissioners who run the eu budget to perpetrate their vision
â the 75 - minute film presented an apocalyptic vision of what would happen if the eu ( pictured at the eu leaders at the 2014 wales nato summit _ were to fall apart the film , presented by journalist emmott , starred comedian deayton as an archaeologist explaining the single currency to a young girl on an aeroplane heading for berlin , after the collapse of the eu and the abolition of the euro
mr deayton laid out â with â flashbacks â to 2014 â the reasons for the eu break - up
the film âs production company , springshot productions , said it was depicting â a europe that is sleepwalking towards disaster â , and claimed the film showed that the eu was â well worth saving â
it created â a unique , choral portrait of the europe dream and how it could be lost forever â
director annalisa piras , an italian journalist , said it would be shown on a â europe - wide tour â of universities
but reckless mp reckless , who appeared in a panel discussion with mr emmott after last night âs programme , said he had confirmed eu funding was used to make the film
mr reckless said : â i asked him if he had received any eu money for it when we appeared on the panel together , and he said they had â for translation into different languages
political monopoly : the film imagined an army of islamic state terrorists advancing on vienna , spain cutting off all routes to gibraltar and the prime minister of â great england â â nigel farage â sending all immigrants home â i thought he might be a bit sheepish but he admitted it to me quite openly
i think he also put in some of his own money and they had other sources of funding for other elements of the film
â last night on twitter , mr emmott said the production company had received â eu top - up for language versions â
he said the bbc itself had not received any money from the eu for this programme
however , it has previously been reported that the bbc has received some Â£ 22million over a seven - year period from the eu âs communications budget
a bbc spokesman said : â no eu money was used in the making of the programme being aired on the bbc
impartiality is of paramount importance for the bbc
this fictional programme reflects the author âs vision
