it was a surreal start to the day for a bleary - eyed night shift worker , after he got a lot more than he bargained from his morning cereal
jarred smith , 22 , woke up at about 3pm last tuesday and headed into the kitchen at his home in davidson in sydney 's northern beaches
he took some food out of the fridge and walked over to the kitchen counter when he saw something strange and scaly sticking out of a corn flakes box
' i thought mum had bought some strange door stopper at first but then i saw the tail end of what looked like a snake and thought " no way its a snake " , ' he told daily mail australia
' then i peeked in the top of the cereal box and its head popped out , ' he said
' i dropped my food and ran out of the kitchen and screamed out to my dad downstairs " dad , there 's a snake in the kitchen ! "
' his father also took a while to comprehend the situation thinking his son meant there was a snake on tv
' when dad walked in it maneuvered even further into the box that 's when i took the video
' jarred smith then called the nsw wildlife information , rescue and education service ( wires ) and explained to the lady on the other end of the phone where the slithery reptile was hiding
' she burst out laughing and said " are you serious ? " , he said
the diamond python retreated into the box when jarred smith 's dad came to see the unexpected surprise the snake handler turned up minutes later and was surprised to see the size of the python , which he estimated at about one and a half metres long
' he asked if we minded if put the snake back in our garden which we did n't , ' jarred smith said
' the snake would n't fall out of the box so he had to rip it and the whole snake dropped out
' ' he was more surprised when he saw it properly because he said it actually looked about two metres long
' diamond pythons are known for being quite timid and the snake handler told jarred smith that the species is harmless and only attacked when aggravated
although jarred smith has never seen a snake before - let alone up so close and personal - he was impressed with how attractive the reptile was
' he 's a good looking snake so if he comes back it 's fine - i just did n't expect to find it in my cereal
' the snake handler had to rip open the cereal box to release the snake which was two metres long although jarred smith has never seen a snake before - let alone up so close and personal - he described the diamond python as ' good looking '
