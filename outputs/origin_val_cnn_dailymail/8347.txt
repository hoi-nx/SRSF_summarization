there has also been an increase in the number of babies weighing 12lb or more
seven clinics reported births of so - called ' sumo babies ' in 2013 - including two where the babies weighed more than a stone
tam fry , of the national obesity forum , said that although some mothers suffer from medical conditions , which increase the size of the baby , most just overeat
he said : ' quite simply , the number of pregnant women who are obese at the start is increasing
' it is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight
' as they have the same kind of nutrition as their parents there is a continuous upwards spiral
danica slavin ( second from right ) gave birth to two babies , eva ( right ) and jack ( left ) , who both weighed over 10lbs
they had to be delivered via caesarean at jessop wing maternity unit in sheffield but are now happy and healthy eva ( above ) was born in 2013 and weighed 12lb 6oz - 5lb more than the average baby girl one mother has given birth to two big babies in the last 18 months
danica slavin had her first daughter eva lily margerrison in 2013 and was shocked when she weighed in at 12lb 6oz
but she was even more surprised when three weeks ago she gave birth to her son jack , who , at 10lb 3oz , was nearly just as big
both babies had to be delivered via caesarean at jessop wing maternity unit
the 21 - year - old mother , from sheffield , met her partner sam margerrison four years ago when they worked at fast - food chain burger king
she said : ' i do n't know why eva and jack were so big because me and my partner sam were n't big babies
' i was tested for gestational diabetes with both babies but that was ruled out
' i just had big babies
' she explained that jack was currently on formula and eva enjoyed her fruit and vegetables
she also dismissed claims that the size of a baby at birth related to its parents
' you obviously do n't expect a baby of that size , ' she said
' successive governments have not really addressed the obesity problem
it starts at conception and sometimes even before then
' mr tam fry also suggested that the number of women having caesareans was increasing due to the increasing size of their babies
he said : ' some babies are so fat they can not come out naturally
' women have to understand that they have to keep themselves in shape due to the huge responsibility they have of producing the next generation
' if we get it wrong , it 's a vicious circle and it will just go on and on and on

childhood obesity can lead to a number of medical problems including diabetes , heart disease , strokes and cancer
a royal college of midwives spokesman said : ' it starts pre-conceptually
if a woman is trying to get pregnant then she should already be eating healthily and not drinking or smoking
' it is a common myth that the woman should eat for two
really , she should be just taking in lots of vegetables and a balanced diet
' long walks and gentle jogs can also help
