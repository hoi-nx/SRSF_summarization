in stark contrast to when the fourth in line to the uk throne made his way down under the previous two times , his trip next month will revolve around training with australia troops in army bases in sydney , darwin and perth
when the party boy harry visited just two years ago , he relished in witnessing first - hand england 's win over africa in the rugby world cup match in perth , and also joined in the festivities of the international fleet review 's centenary celebrations on sydney harbour

' we have prepared a challenging program that will see captain wales deploy on urban and field training exercises , domestic deployments , as well as participate in indigenous engagement activities , ' he said
