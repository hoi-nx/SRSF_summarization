ever wondered why we go grey or most men 's beards have a reddish , ginger tinge ? or why a young child 's golden locks often disappear before the age of 10 ? here , one leading expert , rodney sinclair , professor of dermatology at the epworth hospital and university of melbourne , explains the science of hair colour - and why some of us are cursed with more greys than others ... what determines the colour of hair ? hair colour is produced by cells known as melanocytes , which migrate into the hair bulb as the hair follicles develop in utero
the melanocytes produce pigment that is incorporated into the growing hair fibres to produce hair in a bewildering array of natural shades
hair colour depends on the presence and ratios of two groups of melanins : eumelanins ( brown and black pigments ) and pheomelanins ( red and yellow pigments )
while variations in the ratio of these pigments can produce an large number of colours and tones , siblings often have strikingly similar hair colour

genetic factors appear to be important in determining when we turn grey , rather than lifestyle , says professor rodney sinclair most of us find our first ' greys ' by the time we turn 30 , usually at the temples , then later , across the scalp how hair colour varies according to body site for example , eyelashes are the darkest because they contain high levels of eumalanin
scalp hair is usually lighter than pubic hair , which often has a red tinge , due to the presence of more phaeomelanin pigments
a red tinge is also common in underarm and beard hair , even in people with essentially brown hair on their scalp
hormones such as melanocyte - stimulating hormone can darken light hair , as can high levels of oestrogen and progesterone , which are produced in pregnancy
certain drugs , such as those to prevent malaria can lighten hair , while some epilepsy medications can darken it
why do blonde children often go dark ? blond children tend to see their hair darken around the age or seven or eight
the mechanism for this is unknown and probably not related to hormones , as the darkening precedes puberty by a number of years
new parents often find the first coat of their baby 's hair is darker than expected
it is not until this first hair is shed and replaced , at around eight to 12 months of age , that you get a clear indication of their hair colour

during the anagen phase , hair grows continuously at a rate of 1cm per month
anagen can last three to five years on the scalp and produce hair that grows to between 36 to 60cm in length
at the end of the anagen phase , the follicle turns off , hair growth stops and remains off for the three months
towards the end of this resting ( telogen ) phase , the hair is shed and the follicle remains empty until the anagen phase of the cycle restarts
pigment production also turns on and off in rhythm with the hair cycle
when pigment cells turn off at the end of one hair cycle and fail to turn back on with the onset of the next , hair becomes grey
how grey is really grey ? most of us find our first ' greys ' by the time we turn 30 , usually at the temples , then later , across the scalp
while many people find the salt and pepper look appealing , others go to great lengths to conceal these locks
the grey hair ' rule of thumb ' is that by the age of 50 , half of the population have lost the colour in 50 per cent of their hair
when researchers tested this rule , they found that 74 per cent of people aged between 45 and 65 had grey hair , with an average intensity of 27 per cent
generally , men have more grey hair than women
asians and africans have less grey hair than caucasians
by the age of 50 ( ben affleck , 42 , is pictured left and colin firth , 54 , right ) , half of us will be 50 per cent grey , says professor rodney sinclair
generally , men have more grey hair than women what causes grey hair ? genetic factors appear to be important in determining when we turn grey
identical twins seem to go grey at a similar age , rate and pattern , however we 're yet to identify the controlling genes
there is no evidence to link the onset of greying to stress , diet or lifestyle
certain autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo and alopecia can damage pigment cells and induce greying
however , these conditions are uncommon and can explain only a tiny fraction of greying
early greying occurs in premature ageing syndromes such as hutchinson 's - progeria and werner syndrome , where every aspect ageing in the body is accelerated
premature greying can also be seen in people affected by pernicious anaemia , autoimmune thyroid disease or down syndrome
so , why does n't pigment production turn back on ? at the end of each hair cycle , some pigment - producing melanocytes become damaged and die
if the melanocyte stem cell reservoir at the top of the hair follicle can replenish the bulb , this keeps pigment production going
but when the reservoir of stem cells is exhausted , pigment production stops and the hair turns grey
contrary to popular belief , there is no evidence to link the onset of greying to stress , diet or lifestyle how can we prevent hair changing colour ? scientists have long known that in order to prevent hair from going grey they would need to either prolong the life of the melanocytes in the hair bulb â by protecting them from injury â or expand the melanocyte stem cell reservoir in the upper or top region of the hair follicle so they continue to replace lost pigment cells
a group of french scientists have identified a new series of agents that protect hair follicle melanocytes from damage at the end of the hair cycle
this enables pigment production to restart as soon as the next hair cycle begins
the agents work by mimicking the action of an enzyme called dopachrome tautomerase
this enzyme is the naturally occurring antioxidant in the hair bulb that protects melanocytes from oxidative damage
by duplicating the effects of dopachrome tautomerase , melanocyte metabolism and survival improves
the new agents are being formulated into a product that can be applied as a spray - on serum or shampoo
but they wo n't re-colour grey hair or bring back the dead cells that produce hair colour
instead , they protect your melanocytes
so for those who can not find it within themselves to embrace the salt and pepper look , new options are on the horizon .
