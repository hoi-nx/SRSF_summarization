a judge on tuesday ordered jurors in the travis alexander case to keep deliberating after her lawyers said the panel had reached an impasse on whether to sentence her to death or life in prison for killing her lover in 2008
arias , now 34 , was convicted of first - degree murder in 2013 after a lengthy trial that became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with victim travis alexander
that jury deadlocked on her punishment
authorities said alexander , 30 , was found dead in the shower of his mesa home after arias shot him in the forehead and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated
on tuesday , maricopa county superior court judge sherry stephens denied a request by arias ' attorneys for a mistrial and instead read additional jury instructions to the jury in her sentencing retrial
the jury had deliberated about 17 hours over four days
arias is seen here in court on february 24 defense attorney nurmi pleaded for arias ' ( pictured with defense attorney jennifer willmott ) life during his closing arguments last tuesday , saying she was physically and emotionally abused by alexander defense attorney nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse , though the judge and prosecutor martinez never confirmed that in open court
jurors posed two questions to sherry stephens , who did n't reveal details
the judge and lawyers held closed - door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom
sherry stephens told them that she did n't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors should n't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors
if the current jury ca n't decide on a sentence , the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years
last week , nurmi pleaded arias ' life , saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend alexander
nurmi said alexander was a conflicted mormon , who used arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her ' soulless '
' those words have impact and they got to her , ' nurmi said

' but actually , in reality , it 's this
' alexander 's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed

arias stabbed alexander nearly 30 times , nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead in an act she claimed was in self - defense
alexander 's body was found in the shower of his phoenix home by his friends five days later

in november , arias pleaded for her life in front of the jury
the judge allowed her to testify in secret and sealed the testimony to the public , but transcripts were released after news organizations complained and an appeals court threw out the decision

if they reach deadlock the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and judge sherry stephens will sentence arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years .
