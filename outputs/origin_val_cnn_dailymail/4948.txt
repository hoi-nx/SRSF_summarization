it started as a conversation about how to photograph china 's famous golden monkeys , and ended with prince prince pledging to dress up as a tree
during his wildlife conservation visit to china , the duke of cambridge visited a photographer to learn about how he managed to capture such close up pictures of wildlife

it was pledged during the prince 's tour of the far east , which he used to foster uk business links as well as raise awareness of the dangers of the illegal trade in wildlife
golden haired monkeys of yunnan are native to the forests of china and are highly endangered - with less than 2,000 estimated to be living in the wild
while able to withstand plunging temperatures and even snow , the species is in danger because their habitats are slowly disappearing and their distinctive appearance has made them a key target for illegal hunters
yunnan golden haired monkeys are native to china but they are believed to be less than 2,000 in the wild they are also something of a mystery because they were first discovered by scientists in the 1890s , then lost and thought to be extinct until 1962
the monkeys are herbivores and give birth every two or three years
china has launched a conservation programme to try and protect the species
xi is a chinese wildlife photographer as well as an environmentalist
between 1992 and 1996 xi went to baimaxue mountain national nature reserve to raise awareness of the golden haired monkey
