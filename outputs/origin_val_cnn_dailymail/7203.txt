detective superintendent wallen , of west yorkshire police , said : ' the offence has been captured on cctv and while the footage is not of sufficient quality to identify the suspect as it stands , it clearly shows the very disturbing circumstances of the offence

' the young asian victim was grabbed from behind by the man , who is in his 20s and also believed to be asian , in the beeston hill area of leeds at about 10.52pm on friday

' her injuries are serious but thankfully not life - threatening and she has been left very badly traumatised by the ordeal
' specialist officers are working with her to support her and to elicit as much information as we can to assist with the investigation
' at this point we believe the suspect is of pakistani or middle eastern origin
' it is possible that the suspect could be somebody who is from abroad and has recently come to the country
' they may be staying locally in a bedsit or hostel and i would like to hear from anyone who runs such premises who thinks they know who it might be
' officers have combed the scene for any hair or fibres that could help them identify the suspect
police said cctv footage of the attempted murder incident shows the ' very disturbing circumstances of the offence ' police have described the suspect as asian or middle eastern , aged in his early twenties , slim , with receding black hair
he was wearing dark clothing and possibly a light blue coat at the time of the attack
mr wallen said that shortly after the ' unprecedented ' incident a man was seen running along nearby beeston road
he added : ' we would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or who may have seen the suspect in the area at any time that evening
' if you were the person seen running we would like you to come forward
' we would also like to trace a potential witness - a woman who was seen standing at the bus stop before the incident before getting on either a number 1 or number 74 bus
' this was a shocking incident which is unprecedented both for this area and for leeds as whole
however i appreciate it will understandably cause people in the community a good deal of concern
' officers from the local neighbourhood policing team have been carrying out increased patrols in the area and those will be continuing as part of our efforts to provide visible reassurance to the community
