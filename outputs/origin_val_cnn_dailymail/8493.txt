an unseasonable wildfire driven by strong winds prompted an evacuation of a ski lodge in southern montana
the blaze a few miles west of the community of red lodge had grown to 700 acres by saturday night , us forest service spokesman gildehaus said
the fire was first reported on open private land around 12.30pm , but it was driven by winds gusting 35 to 50 mph into the custer national forest , where the red lodge mountain ski area is located
it was zero per cent contained as of early saturday night
a wildfire near the red lodge mountain ski area in southern montana had grown to 700 acres after being reported at 200 acres earlier on saturday thirteen engines and two fire attack crews had been deployed , according to ktvq
' there 's snow between the ski area and the fire and the timber
but it 's also a solid run of timber from where the fire is to the ski area , ' gildehaus said
' so it gets up in the trees and starts running the crowns of the trees and it starts advancing toward the ski area
' he said that the decision to evacuate the red lodge ski area was made about 2:30 p.m. saturday as a precautionary move and because there was just one road for firefighters and skiers to use
the evacuations have since been lifted , and gildehaus said people were free to return to the ski area
he said the winds had eased somewhat and were expected to continue that course through the night
gildehaus was n't sure how many people had been evacuated , but he estimated about 500
the resort posted on its facebook page that guests were safe and being escorted down the mountain by law enforcement
red lodge mountain ski area had an evacuation order on saturday that was lifted
the us forest service said that no structures had been damaged in the blaze thus far ( file photo ) it plans on being open sunday
the fire burned around rural homes , but no structures were damaged , gildehaus said
with still no containment by saturday night , the blaze had more than tripled from the 200 acres reported earlier in the day
wildfires in the area at this time of year are unusual , he said
' but down in the low elevation , there is n't any snow and things are pretty dry , ' gildehaus said
' we have n't really had any green - up yet where grasses turn green
we got all the dry grass from last year , and things are pretty dry
' the fire actually started on wednesday after a subdivision 's controlled burn , according to the billings gazette
red lodge fire chief kuntz said that the blaze ' would have been a major fire in the summer , ' a rain shower helped firefighters , but kuntz said that several days would be required to deal with the fire
traffic on state highways was diverted on saturday
other wildfires were reported elsewhere saturday in montana and northern wyoming , leading to the evacuation of a subdivision
the southwestern portion of montana and northern part of wyoming are filled by a forest that stretches south to shoshone and yellowstone national parks .
