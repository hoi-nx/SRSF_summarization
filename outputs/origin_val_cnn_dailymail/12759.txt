lausanne , switzerland nuclear talks intensified sunday between world powers and iranian , but key sticking points remained unresolved as the countries tried to reach a deal to curb tehran 's nuclear program ahead of a tuesday deadline
as the negotiations entered their fourth day , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned the agreement coming together is worse than israeli 's deepest fears
the talks had hit a snag on saturday , with diplomats describing iranian as refusing to budge , but as the french , german and chinese foreign ministers arrived , the mood seemed more optimistic
the british and russia foreign ministers were expected late sunday
u.s. officials and western diplomats described the negotiations as tough and intense , which was expected as the talks reached the endgame
they said the contours of a deal are becoming clearer , but they were unsure it could be reached
two core issues are still unresolved : 1 ) limits on iranian research and development on advanced nuclear technology in the end years of the deal ; and 2 ) the pace of lifting u.n. sanctions
the u.s. officials stressed all of the elements were interrelated and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to , comparing the final deal to a puzzle
but they indicated most of the other elements were solvable if those two major hurdles could be overcome
the speed of which u.n. sanctions could be lifted remains in dispute
iranian wants them lifted immediately after the deal goes into effect
while diplomats say iranian could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade , oil and banking , sanctions adopted by the u.n. are more complicated
many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the u.n. nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , that iranian 's nuclear program does not have a military dimension
on saturday , iranian foreign minister mohammad zarif made clear the issue of sanctions remains a stumbling block , saying he believes the world powers " have realized that sanctions , pressure and an agreement will not go together
it 's only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating
" u.s. officials said that all sides , including iranian , agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as iranian confirms its compliance to the deal
but they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula
iranian also wants the ability to continue to research and develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect
those machines can enrich uranium much faster than its current machines
u.s. and european officials worry that could enable iranian to quickly produce enough uranium for a nuclear weapon
diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15 year deal would have the most stringent restrictions , with others being relaxed over the next five
" we will see if they are ready to swallow what we proposed , " a western diplomat said
" we are not asking them to do nothing , but they want to do more than we want them to do " referring to how much research the iranian want to be able to still undertake
but the diplomat added , " after 15 years , they can do what they want
" a senior iranian diplomat told cnn on sunday : " it 's not fair to characterize the state of affairs as iranian resistance on those issues
it can also be characterized as the other side 's intransigence in the talks
" diplomats said iranian has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium , a process that can lead to weapons - grade material
the figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started on thursday , but substantially more than the several hundred the u.s. had originally wanted
iranian currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges , but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile
u.s. officials maintain the number is abstract , because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges iranian can operate , which they believe will extend the time iranian would need to have enough fissile material produce a nuclear weapon -- known as the " break - out time " -- to at least a year
on monday , a senior state department official said negotiators had not yet decided anything about the disposal of fissile material
there had been word previously that iranian might export it to russia , but an iranian negotiator , abbas araqchi , told journalists sunday that iranian had not agreed to it
" the export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , and we do not intend to them abroad
... there is no question of sending the stocks abroad , " he said
benjamin netanyahu voiced alarm at the emerging deal
after meeting with visiting senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , a republican , benjamin netanyahu said , " this agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse
" " in parallel to the gathering for this dangerous agreement , the proxies of iranian in the middle east are carrying out a wide occupation of yemen , " he said
" the iranian - lausanne - yemen axis is very dangerous to mankind and needs to be stopped
" the parties are seeking agreement on the basic parameters of a deal before march 31
a comprehensive deal including technical annexes is supposed to be concluded by june 30
tuesday is seen as a critical milestone to the u.s. negotiators , who are trying to thwart a threat from congress to impose additional sanctions without the framework
that could prompt iranian to withdraw from the talks and scuttle the chances of a deal altogether
but even if a pact is reached , it is unclear what form it would take
u.s. officials say they will need to publicize something that quantifies iranian 's commitments before submitting it to congress
but u.s. and western diplomats say that iranian is looking simply for an " understanding " of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached
