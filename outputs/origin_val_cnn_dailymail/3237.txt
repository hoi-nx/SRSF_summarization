former new york mayor giuliani on thursday castigated president obama for setting a ' tone ' that inspires violent behavior in america and advocated for him to emulate cosby when it comes to talking about black crime
he also told radio host john gambling during an interview on am 970 the answer that obama is ignoring ' enormous amounts of crime ' being committed by blacks
roughly ' 70 percent ' of homicides in new york are committed by americans , giuliani said
' there are many , many extremely understandable ' reasons for that both historically and environmentally , he added
' and if an americans - americans president stood up and said - i hate to mention it because of what happened afterwards - the kinds of stuff that cosby used to say
the kinds of stuff that pasha says at the malcolm x mosque : this is our responsibility , ' he said , trailing off into an explanation of pasha 's doctrine
fresh off his trip abroad , giuliani contended on thursday that internationally , america is considered a ' racist state ' imam izak-el mu'eed pasha is a black , muslim leader in new york who giuliani has been friends with more than a decade
i remember pasha saying to his congregation , if there were less crime in the community , there would be less police in our community , giuliani recalled
when referencing cosby , the retired new york politician was referring to allegations that surfaced last year that black actor raped or otherwise sexually assaulted number of former cast - mates and other women throughout the ' 60s , 70s and 80s
prior to that ' america 's dad ' had earned a reputation for forcefully encouraging americans teens to clean up their act and make better use of the educational system their ancestors fought to earn access to
in on memorable - and controversial - address cosby touched on the perils of stealing and defended police against charges of racism
now known as ' the pound cake speech ' , cosby said , ' these are people going around stealing coca-cola
people getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake
' then we all run out and are outraged : " the cops should nât have shot him
" what the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand ? ' cosby asked
' i wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else
and i looked at it and i had no money
and something called parenting said , " if you get caught with it , you âre going to embarrass your mother
â ' ' america 's mayor ' has made a few contentious statements of his own as of late , saying late last month he 's not sure , based on the president 's upbringing and behavior , that obama ' loves america
' after several days of spinning , and counter claims that he had racist intent when the made the derogatory remarks about the nation 's first black president , giuliani finally ended the media - frenzy by penning an op - ed in which he explained that he simply wishes the president would speak more highly of americans exceptionalism
striving to avoid another kerfuffle , giuliani was careful to balance out his criticisms of obama on am 970 with a note of goodwill to the president
' i disagree with obama on almost everything , but i think obama 's a good family man , and he 's a good man
' ' this is the model we need , ' he said of the positive example obama is setting for the americans communities as a father and a husband
earlier in the interview , giuliani suggested the savage beating of a 15 - year - old girl in a mcdonald 's on monday , the shooting of two ferguson police officers this morning and an incident at a city council meeting involving nypd commissioner bill bratton , at which 20 protester heckled him until they were led out by the cops , all occurred because obama had n't done more to verbally build up america 's police
' it all starts at the top
it âs the tone that âs set by the president , ' giuliani said on radio station am 970 the answer
president obama , pictured here boarding air force one today , should seek to emulate cosby when it comes to talking about crimes committed by blacks , giuliani contended , prefacing the statement with his loathe to mention cosby ' because of what happened afterwards ' giuliani , who just returned stateside following a conference in germany on ' tolerance and equality against fundamentalism and misogyny and says he spent a large portion of the fall traveling abroad , contended that internationally , america 's police are considered to be ' racist
' ' it is the obligation of the president to explain , ' to americans and the global community ' that our police are the best in the world , ' he said
they are the best trained and better restrained than police forces in other countries and fire their guns less often , giuliani argued
' there are very few incidents that turn out to be bad incidents , ' the 2008 presidential candidate said in audio of the interview provided to daily mail online by the radio station
' and the one they tried to make out into a bad incident , ferguson , where they all went crazy , was a man who was shot in the commission of a crime
' and it turned out to be a justifiable homicide , ' giuliani said of the shooting of michael brown , citing both the state grand jury 's decision not to indite police officer darren wilson and the justice department 's announcement that it would n't bring charges against him , either
one person obama should not be listening to or promoting giuliani said is rev. sharpton , who is not respected by america 's police of all race
giuliani said the sentiment among police officers is , ' if you hang around sharpton you must be anti-police
' ' he 's got ta lose sharpton , ' giuliani said .
