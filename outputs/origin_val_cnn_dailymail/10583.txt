republican rep. paustian , 59 , was caught in the act of reading the book ' sex after sixty ' during the iowa house 's debate over collective bargaining rights for teachers after a photo of him surfaced online
paustian said the book by dr.alan francis did n't belong to him but was a gag gift passed over to him by fellow robert bacon rep. robert bacon who recently turned 60 and who sits next to him on the iowa house floor
paustian was barraged with critical emails after the des moines register reporter brianne pfannenstiel posted the photo onto twitter on wednesday
' i âm getting a lot of pretty vicious emails from people , so i have to explain , ' paustian said
' the main thing is i was totally engaged in what was going on the floor
â¦ i knew what was going on
i knew how we were going to vote on amendments
so it was nât like i was nât paying attention to what was going on
' ' if any of my constituents were offended , i apologize
i certainly was nât trying to offend anybody
i âm doing my job here for my constituents
' kcrg reports that democrats tried to use the photo to say that the republican were not paying attention to the nine hours of debate over the bill
' it âs unfortunate , ' paustian said
' that stuff always gets political , too
but that âs just part of the job
