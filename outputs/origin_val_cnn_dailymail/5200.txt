after wrapping filming on the 1979 movie , hemingway says then 43 - year - old allen flew out to her parent 's home in idaho for a visit , during which he asked her to go to paris with him
' our relationship was platonic , but i started to see that he had a kind of crush on me , though i dismissed it as the kind of thing that seemed to happen any time middle - aged men got around young women , ' hemingway writes
independent : hemingway , the granddaughter to literary legend ernest hemingway , says she refused allen 's offer when she realized they would not be staying in separate rooms the teenage granddaughter of ernest hemingway told her parents that she ' did n't know what the arrangement was going to be ' and ' was n't sure ' if she was going to have her own room
' allen had n't said that
he had n't even hinted it , ' hemingway remembers
' but i wanted them to put their foot down
they kept lightly encouraging me
' hemingway recalls waking up in the middle of the night ' with the certain knowledge that i was an idiot '
she then went to allen 's guest room , shook him awake and asked : ' i 'm not going to get my room am i ? ' controversial : in 1980 , allen started dating farrow , another leading lady
the couple broke up in 1992 when farrow found nude pictures of her then 20 - year - old adopted daughter soon - soon-yi in allen 's possession

the couple stayed together until 1992 , when farrow found nude pictures of her then 20 - year - old adopted daughter soon - soon-yi in allen 's possession
