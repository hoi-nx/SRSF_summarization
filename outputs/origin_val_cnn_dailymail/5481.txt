two - thirds of the laws passed by britain âs parliament over the past 22 years have either been made or influenced by the eu , according to a study
an analysis of the laws made between 1993 and 2014 found that 64.7 per cent carried the fingerprints of brussels
the study , by the eurosceptic campaign group business for britain , found that 59.3 per cent of the total are regulations â binding eu laws which must be accepted by member states without modification
some 49,699 have been enacted
some 4,283 have been implemented by the britain parliament
the study found that the largest number of eu - influenced directives passed into britain law was in 2009 when 294 were brought in
there were 171 last year
of the major pieces of legislation in 2013 , 35 out of 78 were implementing eu directives
the findings will fuel debate about david cameron âs plans to renegotiate britain âs membership of the eu if he wins a second term , ahead of his promised in - out referendum before the end of 2017
in his landmark speech on europe two years ago in which he offered the referendum , the prime minister said people rightly questioned whether â the balance was right â in terms of eu legislation
matthew elliott , chief executive of business for britain , said : â david cameron has rightly pointed out that bureaucratic eu rules unnecessarily affect our daily lives far too often
â the european commission and parliament almost always see regulation as the answer to every problem the eu faces , regardless of the impact on business and our economic competitiveness
access to the single market should not come at the cost of having two - thirds of our laws being decided by the eu
â there must be a significant reduction in the amount and scope of eu legislation and powers over certain policy areas should be given back to parliament so decisions are made far closer to the britain people
â business for britain , which is backed by business leaders who want to see britain either leave the eu or have a fundamentally different relationship with it , says it acknowledges that regulations and directives are needed for the single market to work effectively
the campaign group âs figure is far higher than an estimate from the house of commons library , which put it at 13.3 per cent
business for britain said the explanation for the difference was the fact that many eu regulations simply pass into britain law , without ever being voted on by mps
last year , lib dem leader clegg and ukip leader farage held two televised debates about britain âs membership of the eu last year lib dem leader clegg and ukip leader farage held two televised debates about britain âs membership of the eu in which mr clegg claimed only 7 per cent of our laws are made in brussels , while mr farage insisted it was up to 75 per cent
pro-europeans said the campaign group âs report was â misleading â
roland rudd , chairman of business for new europe , said : â it is wrong to imply that all laws originating at eu - level are undemocratic or over-burdensome
â the britain gets a seat at the negotiating table and most of the time , one eu law gets rid of 28 different national laws across europe , making it much simpler and easier for businesses to export
