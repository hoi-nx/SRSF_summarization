senator george brandis vigorously defended his position , claiming the public deserved to know why the government had lost confidence in prof triggs

the telecommunications ( interception and access ) amendment ( data retention ) bill 2014 bill will be debated in the house of representatives on tuesday
the government wants to be free to set the definition without consulting parliament after the bill becomes law
another twitter user promised to entertain mr george brandis with the harry potter series in imessage form those opposed to the government 's data retention plan began the social media hashtag # stopdataretention in its review of the draft bill , parliament 's intelligence and security committee recommended that the definition be set in the legislation rather than decided by government through regulations
in describing metadata , the government uses the analogy of traditional mail
the metadata is the information written on the envelope , not what 's written on the letter inside
with telephones , metadata includes the number called , the duration , time and date of the call , plus the location of the cellphone
it does not include the contents of the conversation
but the internet is a grayer area
george williams , a university of new south wales law professor , said the recommendations addressed his two major concerns with the legislation : that it failed to specify what metadata was and failed to say who could access it
attorney - general george brandis said the government would make a public response next week
it could ignore the recommendations , but to do so would likely doom the legislation to rejection in the senate , where the ruling conservative coalition does not hold a majority

it does not include the contents of the conversation several countries have laws on metadata retention
u.s. laws allow government access to metadata with or without a warrant
australians police say they already access metadata , but are concerned that many companies do n't store it for as long as they used to
several companies have warned that the new retention obligations would cost them and their customers millions of dollars
the attorney - general âs website unveiled the estimated cost on sunday
â the attorney-general âs department has engaged pwc ( pwc ) to cost the implementation of the proposed data retention regime in consultation with industry
â pwc estimated the upfront capital cost of the regime to all of business to be between $ 188.8 million and $ 319.1 million , which is less than 1 per cent of the $ 43 billion in revenue generated by the telecommunications industry annually , â the website states
â this estimate will inform the australian government in delivering on its commitment to make a reasonable contribution to the capital costs of implementation of the data retention regime
because australians are among the worst in the world for illegally downloading movies and video games , many fear that prosecutions wo n't stop at terrorists
the attorney - general âs website states : â australians needs a data retention scheme because telecommunications companies are retaining less data and keeping it for a shorter time
this is degrading the investigative capabilities of law enforcement and security agencies and , in some cases , has prevented serious criminals from being brought to justice
