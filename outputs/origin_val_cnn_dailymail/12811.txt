we ca n't settle iphone vs. android or " star wars " vs. " star trek " for you
but we can settle another long - running geek debate : those short , animated loops that have captivated the web for decades ? they 're pronounced like a brand of peanut butter
steve wilhite created the graphics interchange format , or graphics interchange format , while working for compuserve in 1987
when he received a webby awards in 2013 for it , and delivered his five - word acceptance speech ( that 's all the webby awards allow ) , he flashed a graphics interchange format on the big screens at the cipriani wall street in new york
and , in a flash , it all became clear : " it 's pronounced jif , not graphics interchange format
" of course , in the grand tradition of heated debate , a flat statement of fact by the creator was n't enough to sway some partisans
on twitter , " graphics interchange format " became a trending topic as some folks pushed back
# gif # hardg , " wrote web designer dan cederholm
" so instead of graphics interchange format , we 've got to say jif ? yeah right , " chimed in october jones , creator of the " texts from dog " tumblr and book
" and i suppose those animals with long necks are called ' jiraffes
' " and , of course , the peanut butter brand was getting lots of free publicity along the way
the always amusing hal 9000 account ( yes , somebody tweets as the robot from " 2001 " ) posted an " animated jif " -- which is to say , a swirling , animated jar of the tasty , high - protein spread
animated gifs were a staple of the early internet
remember the dancing baby ? that 's a graphics interchange format
they fell out of favor as more advanced graphics technology emerged
but in the past couple of years , the web has remembered how much fun it is to watch ridiculous things happen over and over again
steve wilhite has argued for the soft - g pronunciation for years
yet no less an authority than the white house has posted an image on its tumblr feed advocating for the hard - g. and the oxford english dictionary says both pronunciations are acceptable
so , here 's wishing mr. wilhite " jood luck
