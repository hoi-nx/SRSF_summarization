howard would like a little bit more reality on his hit show " empire
" the actor , who plays hip - hop recording mogul lucious lyon on the series , recently told entertainment weekly that 's he 's " mad that we do n't say n * * * * r in the show
" " why is tv showing something different from the reality of the world ? " howard asked
" why is there a thing called censorship that stop people from hearing everyday talk ? we use n * * * * * every day
it 's become part of a conversation
why are n't we using it in the show ? " he expanded on his thoughts during an appearance monday on " access hollywood
" " well , i believe if we 're gon na really tackle racism , if we 're gon na tackle bigotry , if we 're gon na tackle homophobia , we need to attack it dead - on
you do n't just sit up , you know , let 's give a little aspirin right here ; no , we need to take the sutures , open up the problem and reach in and grab it , " the actor explained
" and since n * * * * r is used in almost every conversation in most black neighborhoods , why is it that we do n't hear it on tv anymore ? are white people afraid of it ? did they create the word ? but if this is something that we use on a daily basis , then let 's address what it really means
" and what does the word mean to the " empire " star ? " oh , it could mean love ; sometimes it 's a noun ; sometimes it 's a verb ; sometimes it 's an adjective ; it 's all , there 's a spirit attached to it , you know , " howard said
" my dad uses it
i 'm sitting here , i 'm hoping maybe i wo n't use it with my son , but i do n't know if i 'll be honest if i did n't use it with my son
you know , my friends use it
i call my white friends ' what 's up , my n * * * * ? ' you know , that 's , it has taken on this term to us , but it 's blown out of proportion outside the world , so i do n't know
" but co-star taraji p. henson , who plays his ex-wife , cookie lyon , is not feeling it
when tmz asked whether she believed the fox series should be using the word , she responded , " naw , you might piss people off
" rambo , one of the show 's writers , told tmz that as a white man , he did n't think he could make the call on whether to use the word
context is everything , he said
" it 's a powerful word , " rambo told tmz
" it 's such a huge issue
it came up a lot in our writers room
