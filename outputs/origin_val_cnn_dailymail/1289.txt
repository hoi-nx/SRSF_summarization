despite the fact it 's illegal in the british , at least 65,000 british girls are at risk of having female genital mutilation as they are taken out of the country during so called ' cutting season ' aka the school holidays
the procedure - which involves having parts of their vagina cut out and then then sewn back together again - is usually performed before a girl turns 12 and is carried out without anesthetic or sterilised equipment
many of the girls are too scared to admit they have suffered fgm and can be stigmatised by their community for speaking out
recalling the moment she was cut , one of the women leyla , 32 , from east london , said : ' your whole body is in pain , the scream that you scream meant i lost my voice for a couple of days
' the moment your genitals are cut , a part of your soul dies
' another british survivor interviewed for the documentary said : ' i do n't think there 's any word i can use to describe that moment
they grab you with a woman holding each leg and another holding your head and chest so you ca n't move
' the practice first began in ancient egypt and remains a rite of passage in many africa and middle eastern countries and some parts of asia
parents cut their daughters because they believe that this will allow her to be accepted into society and improve her marriage prospects
a girl who is uncut is often seen unclean and sexually promiscuous
the idea that fgm is necessary and makes a woman more virtuous and attractive is so ingrained in some communities that mothers who have endured it themselves - and continue to live with the physical and mental consequences - will still happily arrange for their daughters to suffer the same fate
nimco ali was subjected to fgm as a child and said many british girls are at risk leyla explains : ' the cutting season in the british means holidays
if you do n't get this done , you wo n't be married to the right family so your status is questioned
' the anonymous victim added : ' it 's a business for the person doing the cutting and the family as once the child has been through fgm , whoever they will marry will pay a higher dowry , it 's all about money
' actress zawe , who presents the bbc documentary , flew to kenya to meet one of the women making money as a result of cutting thousands of girls who are taken to her from around the world
despite suffering the pain of fgm herself as a child , the elderly cutter said she 's happy to cut others - using a pair of sharp scissors she carries around in her handbag
she said families from across the british , europe and america travel to kenya for her services
the cutter said : ' when i had fgm i was cut with thorns , i can still feel it now
then they used thorns to stitch me back up
' justifying why she now inflicts this on other girls , she said : ' the girls father gives permission , the mother as well , her whole community gives permission and i get paid
' she added why her community believe fgm to be so important : ' if the girls are n't cut , they will start to love and start to chase men , they should be cut before they are 12 otherwise they will start to get horny
' our tradition is to cut them and make them bleed to calm them down
if you do n't cut them , they will think about pleasure all the time , they ca n't help themselves
' pleasure has been far from the mind of hoda , 23 , a british resident zawe meets who had type 3 fgm when she was a child
after she was cut , she was sewn back up with and left with a hole no bigger than matchstick that has left her with a host of health problems - and infertile
she said : ' i was seven when i was cut
it happened , i was cut and i got this pain every night , abdominal pain
' actress zawe , right , travelled to kenya for a bbc documentary to meet agnes pareyio , left , the founder of comic relief funded project which helps girls escape fgm hoda 's stomach pains where due to the fact she could n't have a normal period because of the tiny hole she had been left with
blood that was supposed to leave her body remained trapped inside causing internal damage
she has had a number of operations to try and restore her health and wellbeing but will never be able to have children
now married to a man she met in the british , hoda said she feels guilty she will never be able to have a family with the man she loves
leyla also has to live with the mental as well as physical consequences of her fgm
she said : ' i live at home with a panic alarm , i have to carry a personal alarm with me wherever i go , it 's difficult
' she added that many people may be surprised to learn she 's a victim of fgm because of her western appearance but she said many british girls like her are at risk
she said : ' there 's this code of silence , i associate it with the mafia
we describe ourselves as the " fgm " survivors
we are high street girls so do n't narrow it to one particular image
' the documentary reveals how many are duped into travelling out of british when they are young as they are told they are going on holiday or to a party
nimco ali , 31 , who lives in east london , campaigns against fgm after having it done to herself as a child , agreed that the practice is more rife in the british than people realise
she said : ' many are afraid to speak out as there is that fear of being judged
everyone thinks it 's not the girl in manchester , in cardiff or east london being taken away and having fgm but it 's exactly these girls , they are not girls who are immigrants or here on holiday
zawe with some of the children who are being helped by the comic relief supported project in kenya ' they are the girl at the back of your classroom or the girl you could bump into on oxford street but you do n't know they have just been through fgm
' the documentary reveals the steps that are being taken to try and stop the practice continuing
in an east london school , fgm workshops are held to educate young men and women on why it 's wrong , while border police operate at airports to try and stop girls they deem to be at risk leaving the country
