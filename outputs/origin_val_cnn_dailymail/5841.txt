moving from their mark , the russian tortoise named herbert immediately gets its head down and begins walking in the correct direction
the animals line up alongside each other and it initially appears to be no contest for the quicker rabbit the dwarf bunny named sven on the other hand becomes instantly distracted and hops off to the right
giving the rabbit a helping hand , a woman redirects it back onto the correct path and actually puts it into the lead
checking out the tortoise , the rabbit begins sniffing at its shell and the surrounding women can be heard laughing
the rabbit gets distracted and heads off to the right as the tortoise surges forward into the lead undeterred by the tactics of its competitor , herbert continues to storm forward and regains the lead as the rabbit once again tails off to the right
momentarily retaking the lead after a number of hops , the rabbit appears to finally have the upper - hand
but after getting distracted once more , the tortoise regains its advantage
the distracted rabbit sniffs the tortoise and attempts to put it off its stride but herbert is undeterred sven the rabbit is given a helping hand at the end of the race ( left ) but the tortoise is first to cross the line going in the wrong direction , the rabbit well and truly surrenders any hope it had of winning
and even with another helping hand from one of the women watching the race , the tortoise surges forward
the video concludes with the rabbit disappearing from the shot as the relenting tortoise reaches the door and the women cheer in excitement .
