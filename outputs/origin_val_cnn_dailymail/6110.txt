the president of the uva has questioned whether the virginia liquor agency should be able to arrest students , following the fallout from black student johnson 's brutal arrest
sullivan said the agency 's top priority should be to ensure that people who hold liquor licenses adhere to the law adding ' getting arrested should n't involved getting stitches
' video of the student 's bloody arrest by officers was shared on social media and sparked protests on campus after he was seen lying on the ground , hands tied , saying ' i go to uva , i go to uva
' johnson , a chicago native who is majoring in italian and media studies , was arrested by virginia 's department of alcoholic beverage control ( alcoholic beverage control ) at 12:45 a.m. wednesday
cops swooped in and arrested the student - who could be seen on video bleeding profusely - after he was accused of trying to get into trinity , near campus with a fake id
following widespread condemnation of the footage , sullivan , along with several high - profile lawmakers in virginia are now calling for a reexamination of alcoholic beverage control 's arrest powers
she told the washington post : ' as to the other issues , like having a fake id and underage drinking and son on â both charlottesville and university police do arrest people for that
' sullivan is backed by marcus l. martin , uva 's vice president and chief officer for diversity and equity
he said he spoke with johnson , and he was not intoxicated when he was arrested
on wednesday night , hundreds of students gathered at the uva campus to demand justice for johnson
there was also a separate march through the town support : marcus l. martin , left , uva 's vice president and chief officer for diversity and equity , said he spoke with johnson , and he was not intoxicated when he was arrested by state liquor control
state house minority leader david toscano , right , called the image of the arrest ' very disturbing ' johnson , pictured left , is an honor student at the university , which has seen a string of controversies this year but video of johnson 's bloodied face , caused by a gash to his head led house minority leader david toscano to call the arrest ' very disturbing
' meanwhile , senator donald mceachin has added his voice to the chorus of disapproval over alcoholic beverage control 's arrest powers
he now wants to consider sponsoring legislation that would give state police jurisdiction of the state 's alcohol laws
johnson , an honor student was charged with public intoxication and or swearing and obstruction of justice for the st patrick 's day night incident outside the trinity irish pub. he was released wednesday morning
protests erupted at the campus following the arrest
on wednesday night , a thousand students gathered on the prestigious campus to demand justice for their classmate
it has also emerged that contrary to officers ' suspicions , johnson did not have a fake id and had presented his real identification when a bar employee asked to see it , according to his friend
his roommate joshua kinlaw said : ' so the id that he actually showed to both the bouncer and to the alcoholic beverage control [ alcoholic beverage control ] officers was his real id
' now because the age on that id shows him to be 20 years old , i think that 's when dispute and discrepancies came in
' johnson , seen here on thursday , was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice
he said through his lawyer , right , that he was ' shocked that my face was slammed into the brick pavement ' defense : joshua kinlaw , left , pictured speaking to abc news , said the id that johnson actually showed to both the bouncer and to the alcoholic beverage control was his real id , but the zip code he gave was for his mother 's , right , address rather than the one listed on the id he gave to alcoholic beverage control officers on thursday , his lawyer , daniel watkins , backed these claims and said that the student was simply standing on the sidewalk when officers approached him
this led virginia governor terry mcauliffe to call for a state police investigation into the arrest
additionally , attorney general mark r. herring said he is now considering a review of arrest data to determine if there was any racial bias involved from the law enforcement agencies
but in a statement , trinity , ( the establishment that johnson tried to get in ) said managers refute claims made by a former employee that staff were instructed to racially profile
the statement , obtained by wvir-tv said : ' there have been reports that trinity engages or engaged , in this incident , in racial profiling in not permitting mr. johnson to enter
' the rationale for allowing patrons to enter â being familiar with the zip code on their own license â is color , gender , race , and ethnicity - blind
' comments made by a previous employee by the name of devito that trinity instructs its management to scrutinize persons of color for entry , are patently false
' mr. devito was employed by trinity for six months and was terminated by management for cause
his comments are those of a disgruntled former employee and are not accurate
' the pub also said that johnson was turned away after he gave an incorrect zip code to go with his id
yet , the student later said that he gave the zip code of the address where his mother currently lives rather than the one listed on the id he gave to alcoholic beverage control officers
the legal drinking age in virginia is 21 years old and johnson has maintained his innocence saying he was not intoxicated , according to cnn
johnson said his ' head lay bloody , but unbowed
' and : ' one thought raced through my mind : how could this happen ? '
