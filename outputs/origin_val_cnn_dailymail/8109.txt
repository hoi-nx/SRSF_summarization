a killer newt the size of a small car which roamed lakes and rivers in the time of the dinosaurs has been discovered in portugual
described as ' like something out of a bad monster movie ' , the metoposaurus algarvensis once took the place of crocodiles as one of the earth 's top predators when they lived more than 200 million years ago
a distant relative to today 's salamander , the fossilised remains were found during a dig at an ancient lake in southern portugual which may have been home to hundreds of the creatures
' it was as long as a small car and had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head , which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut
it was the type of fierce predator that the very first dinosaurs had to put up with if they strayed too close to the water , long before the glory days of t. rex and brachiosaurus
' the family of giant salamander - like amphibians to which metoposaurus belonged included other species found in parts of modern - day africa , europe , india and north america
all were wiped out during a mass extinction 201 million years ago , long before the death of the dinosaurs
a distant relative to today 's salamander or newt ( pictured ) the fossilised remains were found during a dig at an ancient lake in southern portugual which may have been home to hundreds of the creatures described as ' like something out of a bad monster movie ' , the metoposaurus algarvensis were the same size as a small car , such as this fiat 500 this event marked the end of the triassic , when the super landmass of pangaea , which included all the world 's present - day continents , began to break apart
the extinction killed off many groups of vertebrates , including giant amphibians , and paved the way for dinosaurs to take over the earth
members of the portuguese metoposaurus colony are thought to have died when the lake they inhabited dried up
only a four square metre fraction of the site has been excavated so far , and work is continuing in the hope of unearthing more fossils
co-author dr richard butler , from the university of birmingham , said : ' most modern amphibians are pretty tiny and harmless
but back in the triassic these giant predators would have made lakes and rivers pretty scary places to be
