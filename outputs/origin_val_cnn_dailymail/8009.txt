targeted ? sensburg , the head of german 's spying inquiry , claims his own encrypted mobile phone may have been hacked the head of a german inquiry into foreign spying believes his own mobile phone may have been hacked , it has been reported
sensburg is chairman of a committee set up last year over claims the nsa ( nsa ) had listened in to angela merkel 's phone calls
mr sensburg and other political figures had been issued with encrypted mobile phones that were said to be watertight against any hacking attempt
he is reported to have sent his phone to german 's it security service in a lead - lined sealed container by german courier company dhl to be examined
but when it arrived at the bsi ( bsi ) , the package had been opened and tampered with , according to the daily telegraph which cited a report by welt newspaper
the bsi is now examining the phone
if proven to be the case , it could have potentially damaging repercussions for relations between german and british , which has already expressed concerns about the investigation
it was reported last month that the british government had threatened to end its co-operation with german intelligence agencies if members of the inquiry were given access to classified information
this threat was neither confirmed or denied by the british , but a whitehall source said the government was ' working closely with the german government to engage with the parliamentary inquiry '
the german government has since been seeking a compromise that would only allow mr sensburg to see that data which he would then relay to the other members , german media reported
any apparent breach to mr sensburg 's security would most likely scupper what is already a fragile compromise
nsa whistleblower edward snowden claimed in october that the u.s. security service had been listening in on the calls of up to 35 prominent allies , including france and german
eavesdropping : the german parliamentary inquiry was set up last year over claims the nsa ( nsa ) had listened in to angela merkel 's phone calls that lead to claims angela merkel 's personal mobile phone was tapped and caused the german chancellor to demand answers from the u.s. government
while u.s. authorities never acknowledged whether spying took place , barack obama was forced to offer mrs angela merkel an apology
then in december it was reported that mrs angela merkel had also fallen victim to hacking after a sophisticated computer virus was discovered on the usb drive of one of her aides
the reign virus , which is believed to have been developed by u.s. and british spying agencies , was detected after one of mrs angela merkel 's employees plugged her personal drive into a work laptop
the woman , who works in close contact with mrs angela merkel , had loaded a speech she was editing on to the drive , took it home to continue working on it , before returning to the office
it is also not known what , if any , information was taken
reign allows users to take pictures of a computer screen , take control of the mouse , record passwords and restore deleted files .
