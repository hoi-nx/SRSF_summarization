he goes to bed early : by 9:30pm or sometimes 10pm
' the steve i knew was the guy pestering me to have a social life , not because he was being a pest , but because he knew how important family was in his life , and he wanted it for me , too , ' said cook in the book , an extract of which was published by fast company
. ' one day he calls my mom â he does n't even know my mom , she lives in alabama
' he said he was looking for me , but he knows how to find me ! ' he talked to her about me

' in a recent interview cooks revealed his average working day - which still leaves little time for socialising
he gets up at 3:45 every morning and begins to check his email , goes to the gym at 5am and to work at 6:30am , already fully briefed and with the day ahead planned out

the book includes unprecedented interviews with cook and other apple executives , many of whom were disappointed with the official biography written by isaacson
' i thought the [ isaacson ] isaacson book did him a tremendous disservice , ' said cook
' it was just a rehash of a bunch of stuff that had already been written , and focused on small parts of his personality
' you get the feeling that [ jobs 's ] a greedy , selfish egomaniac
it did n't capture the person
the person i read about there is somebody i would never have wanted to work with over all this time
' cook also revealed the moment jobs asked him to take over as apple ceo , when on august 11 , he went to jobs ' house
' he said , ' i want to talk to you about something , ' ' remembers cook
' this was when he was home all the time , and i asked when , and he said , ' now
' ' he told me he had decided that i should be ceo
' cook said he thought at the time jobs was on the road to recovery
' every time i saw him he seemed to be getting better
he felt that way as well
unfortunately , it did n't work out that way
