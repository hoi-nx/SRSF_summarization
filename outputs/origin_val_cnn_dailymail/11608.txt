the captivating motion of various satellites orbiting our planet has been revealed in a fascinating nasa video
created by the agency âs goddard space flight centre in maryland , it shows their entire earth - observation fleet and the paths they take around earth
while the iss sweeps across â diagonally â , in the video at least , others like the landsat series are seen travelling from pole to pole
it shows dozens of earth - observing satellites currently orbiting our planet
they include landsat 7 and 8 , part of nasa 's long - serving series
and the iss can also be seen sweeping diagonally across earth the animation solely shows nasa 's earth - observing satellites , and not any run by other space agencies or private organisations
the satellites measure rainfall , solar irradiance , clouds , sea surface height , ocean salinity and other aspects of the global environment
â together , they provide a picture of the earth as a system , â said nasa
the animation shows the day of 16 february 2015 from 00.00 gmt to 12.00 gmt. while the satellites might look close together , the amount of space in earth orbit is vast , and there is little to no chance of any colliding
in fact , they are all placed on specific orbits within their orbital bands that ensure the minimal chance possible of colliding with another satellite
this does n't always go to plan , though
in 2009 , a us iridium satellite and a defunct russian cosmos satellite collided , creating hundreds of new pieces of debris in orbit
but the precision of modern satellites is best seen by a quartet of satellites known as the â a-train â - aqua , aura , cloudsat and calipso - which follow each other closely in their orbits
the two closest , cloudsat and calipso , are just 12.5 seconds apart , but this equates to 58 miles ( 93km ) in distance
the four satellites work together to provide even better observations of earth
â it âs acting like one satellite with 15 instruments onboard , â ernie wright , an animator at nasa âs goddard space flight centre , told wired , referring to the 15 instruments shared between them
the landsat series of satellites have , since 1972 , been used to measure earth âs continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored
shown is an illustration of landsat , which launched on 11 february 2013 construction of the iss began on 20 november 1998
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house
it completes an orbit of earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of earth , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years
some satellites , like landsat 7 and 8 , orbit from pole to pole , known as a polar orbit
this allows them to see almost the entirety of earth as the globe rotates underneath them
the landsat series of satellites have , since 1972 , been used to measure earth âs continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored
the iss , meanwhile , has a diagonal orbit that keeps it relatively near the equator , which enables various command centres across the world to stay in contact with the crew
recently launched satellites on the animation include the smap ( smap ) mission , which measures the surface soil moisture on earth , and was launched on 31 january 2015
a full list of the satellites and their missions is available at nasa âs scientific visualisation studio website
the iss has a diagonal orbit that keeps it relatively near the equator ( shown ) , which enables various command centres across the world to stay in contact with the crew
as the earth rotates underneath , the iss appears to move up and down in curves , although in reality it is always moving in one direction
