noah , the new host of daily show , has spoken out in defense of himself following a social media backlash over comments he made about women and jewish in tweets dating back to 2009
the south-african comedian , who is little - known in the american , rocketed to national fame on monday after he was named as longtime host jon stewart 's replacement on the satirical news program
however , the excitement surrounding the announcement was tinged by hundreds of internet users accusing the 31 - year - old - who is a quarter jewish - of anti-semitism for his ' offensive ' posts
but in a tweet on tuesday , noah told his two million followers : ' to reduce my views to a handful of jokes that did nât land is not a true reflection of my character , nor my evolution as a comedian
' it comes as comedy central , which hired noah as a correspondent on the show just three months ago , has defended its newest star as a ' provocative ' comedian who ' spares noone , himself included '
' it added : ' noah is a talented comedian with a bright future at comedy central
' noah , the son of a half - jewish xhosa mother and a swiss father , was a trending topic on twitter on monday night as he drew fire for jokes that were described as tasteless , hateful , and unfunny
the controversial tweets were posted between 2009 and 2014
in may last year , noah tweeted : ' behind every successful rap billionaire is a double as rich jewish man
' a year earlier , he posted : ' note to self - langostines are not jewish prawns
' meanwhile , during a soccer match in january 2012 , he joked : ' messi gets the ball and the real players try foul him , but messi does n't go down easy , just like jewish chicks
' he also slammed the american ' midsection in a 2013 tweet , writing that ' when flying over the middle of american the turbulence is so bad
it 's like all the ignorance is rising through the air
' and in 2009 , noah , who can speak an impressive six languages , wrote : ' almost bumped a jewish kid crossing the road
he did n't look b4 crossing but i still would hav felt so bad in my german car ! ' on tuesday , the tweets were being posted online by enraged bloggers , who slammed noah as ' racist '
one said : ' jon stewart , born leibowitz , wo n't be happy about these highly antisemitic tweets
' roseanne barr was among those calling out the comic , who has a global following and two million twitter followers , writing : ' u should cease sexist & anti semitic ' humor ' about jewish women & israel
' meanwhile , a blogger posted noah 's tweets in an article , with the comment : ' noah , the racist , hack taking over for jon stewart is also quite the anti-semite too
obama and progressive liberals really will love this guy
among some of the skits that noah came up with was the black hitler
' however , one twitter user , jack obora@jackobora , had a different opinion on the matter
he tweeted : ' seriously who reads through six years of tweets to try and find something to be offended about ? # trevornoah # dailyshow
' viewers have lamented the end of jon stewart 's 16 - year stint on the show regardless of users ' opinions , the tweets showed a different side to noah than the picture painted by comedy central and the comedian himself just a day earlier
in a phone interview on monday from dubai , where he was traveling on a comedy tour , noah - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on - air - likened himself to new york - born jon stewart
he said : ' one thing we both share : we are both progressives , ' adding : ' traveling the world i 've learned that progressives , regardless of their locations , think in a global space
' noah , who joined daily show just three months ago and speaks an impressive six languages , was being pitched by comedy central as reflecting a new age of global multiculturalism
he is ' a citizen of the world , ' in the words of ganeless , the network 's president
his dry , cutting humor was also singled out by producers as the winning formula to win over viewers
successor : the 31 - year - old south-african comedian ( pictured in 2012 ) has been named successor to jon stewart , 52 , who will step down from his role on the show this year appearance : in 2012 , noah became the first south-african stand - up comedian to feature on nbc 's tonight show ( pictured )
in 2013 , he became the first to appear on cbs 's letterman noah was named as the program 's new host a little more than a month after jon stewart unexpectedly announced he was leaving daily show following 16 years as its principal voice
according to the times , a slew of better - known potential replacements chose to move on to competing networks
however , the reaction to his appointment was overwhelmingly positive
noah brings a wealth of hosting experience helping him , in ganeless ' words , check ' off every box ' on her network 's list of requirements
also important : he has kindred spirit jon stewart 's blessing
' all i needed in my life was jon stewart 's blessing
that 's what i have , so i 'm looking forward to being part of the best damn news show in the world , ' noah told the associated press
although no dates have been disclosed , jon stewart will likely depart by the end of the year
noah , who grew up in gauteng and starred on the south-african soap opera , isiding , will take over soon after
tough act to follow : noah was not surprisingly reverent of extremely popular departing host jon stewart as he tweeted monday about the news he 's the next host on monday , ganeless spoke of the advantage of introducing noah to a mainstream american audience through daily show , with viewers coming to the show he hosts with no preconceptions
' they will get to discover him , and form their opinions of him , as they watch him host , ' he said
but by tuesday , some opinions were already forming
weighing in on noah 's selection , a slate column compared his vetting to that of sarah palin as a running mate for presidential candidate john mccain
the choice of a new host for daily show is a critical decision not only for the satirical - news program , but for the network , whose identity has largely been forged by the daily show franchise , which for years was followed by the likewise signature the colbert report
by the end of this year , comedy central will have completely remade this programming block
in january , south-african - american comic larry wilmore replaced the the colbert report hosting the nightly show
born to a black mother and white father in south-african , 31 - year - old noah was not allowed to live with either parent and even passed off by family as albino because , under apartheid laws , different races could not mix noah , 31 , grew up in soweto , south-african , the son of a xhosa mother and swiss father
' my mother had to be very clandestine about who my father was , ' noah told the times
' he could n't be on my birth certificate
' for much of his childhood , his south-african family passed him off as an albino
under apartheid laws , different races could not mix and he was not allowed to live with either of his parents
he reportedly once cracked to an audience , ' i was born a crime
' noah began doing stand - up in south-african in his twenties and has since leveraged his ability to speak six languages into an international career
he 's hosted his own late - night show in south-african , radio shows and awards shows
noah is also the only south-african comedian to ever perform on the late show and tonight show
but do n't be too quick to connect him to the dark continent
he told letterman in 2013 : ' they make it sound like a guy in leopard skin 's going to come running on the stage
' nonetheless , noah 's past is firmly rooted in south-african 's turbulent racial history
' i did n't live a normal life , ' he told the times
' i grew up in a country that was n't normal
' more specifically , noah says that after he began to do stand - up in his 20s , he quickly became aware that ' speaking freely about anything , as a person of color , was considered treason
' news of his new role spread quickly in south-african
' over the years , mr. noah has proved that laughter is the best medicine and has helped our country and its people to find healing through laughing at themselves , ' said minister of arts and culture nathi mthethwa
' south-african is a microcosm of the world and there is no doubt that a global audience will find resonance in his humor , ' he added in an email .
