mecklenburg-vorpommern is quite a mouthful
which is why locals refer to this region of lakes , castles , and beaches in the north - east of germany as mecklenburg-vorpommern , or meck-pom
the pom refers to pomerania , now mostly in poland
it has a long coastline on the baltic and is the third largest of germany 's 16 laender - but the least populated
so you can walk for miles on a sandy strand or drive all day on the autobahn and not see a sausage , except in your lunch
back in focus : ' meck-pom ' offers blissful beaches along germany 's baltic coastline after world war ii , meck-pom was part of communist germany , which might account for its low profile
the regime concentrated on the cities and neglected the countryside , so castles and seaside resorts deteriorated
since reunification 25 years ago , all that has changed
the result is a clutch of wonderful hotels and beautifully - run resorts
the sea accounts for the region 's ancient wealth and the cities along the coast - wismar , rostock , stralsund and greifswald - were part of the 13th - century trading confederation , the hanseatic league , which did business with scandinavians and slavs around the baltic
two of the cities , wismar and stralsund , are world heritage sites
towering medieval cathedrals and customs houses on market squares as big as football pitches are built of ancient revolutionary red - brick , moulded and baked from the sodden clay
the harbour has bars , cafes and shops for windsurfers , anglers and bucket - and - spaders
on the road , go - kart tracks and wildlife parks fill gaps between the farms and forests
a day 's fishing off a boat costs â¬ 39 ( Â£ 27 ) , including lunch from a stewpot
at the beach resorts of boltenhagen and warnemunde , holidaymakers on hire bikes ( Â£ 6.50 a day ) pedal through pine - filled parks to the sea - front
a steam train called molli plies a coastal route to heiligendamm , location of the five - star grand hotel
it has a sanatorium , a michelin-star chef , a castle ( for weddings ) and a children 's house with games
quietly charming : the pretty alte markt square in stralsund sums up the region 's appeal meck-pom is a refuge in peace and war
forewarned of the allied bombing , citizens of hamburg , berlin and dresden fled here
' the castles were full of refugees , ' says freiherr helmuth von maltzahn , proprietor of 16th - century schloss ulrichshusen , which his ancestor ulrich built among the inland lakes
helmuth , born in 1949 , bought back his burnt - out family home and turned it into a 40 - room hotel
at sunset , cranes fly over the lakes in their thousands in what looks , for a moment , like an intricate , interweaving mv - formation
british airways ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to hamburg from Â£ 79 return
