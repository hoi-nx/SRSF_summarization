madonna had confessed that her eldest child , daughter lourdes , is ' horrified ' by the sexually explicit content of some of her mother 's new music
during the second half of an interview with the today show 's carson daly , the 56 - year - old singer , explained that all four of her children - nine - year - olds david and mercy , rocco , 14 , and lourdes , 18 - react to her music in different ways , adding that her daughter lourdes finds it the most difficult to deal with
' at this point , rocco does n't care , ' she said
' it just goes over his head
he 's like , " oh , mom
" the other little kids do n't really â they 're not tuned into that frequency yet
and lo [ lourdes ] is horrified by all of it
she just wants me to be her mom
' and i 'd be like , " ok , just could - i âll be - stay outside
i 'll be right out
" ' but , while her role as a chart - topping icon is clearly of great importance to her , madonna insists that her number one priority remains her children and her family
and , looking at her social media accounts , it 's clear to see how well she balances the two aspects of her life ; in among all of the promotional pictures from her album and the star - studded snaps taken at glamorous events or behind the scenes on - set are dozens of heart - warming pictures of the singer 's beloved children
madonna does n't deny that her work life balance can be tricky at times however - and she admits that keeping track of all of her commitments can be difficult , even at the best of times
' the more kids you have , the more responsibilities you have , the more you have to really be aware of time , time management , and juggling lots of balls in the air , and thinking , " oh , my god , this is how am i gon na do this ? how am i gon na promote my record and show up at my daughter 's show ? " ' she said
' you know what i mean ? it 's a tug of war
' horrified : madonna and lourdes , pictured here in 2010 , are incredibly close , however the singer admits that her daughter is embarrassed by some of the sexual content of her songs family ties : madonna and her four children ( from left to right ) - david , nine , lourdes , mercy , nine , and rocco , 14 - often go away on family vacations together but no matter what pressures she is facing in her working life , the music veteran is still determined to create as many memories with her children as possible ; in january the family enjoyed a fun - filled skiing trip together , while last november , madonna took her kids to visit malawi , where her youngest children , mercy and david , were adopted from
' i love taking all of my kids there , ' she said
' they walk into hospitals , and tell jokes and stories , and embrace children who are in some pretty extreme states health-wise
' and they 're not afraid
and i love to see them behaving in a generous way towards human beings , you know , outside of their world
â yesterday madonna , who dropped out of the university of michigan in 1978 , revealed that she offered daughter lourdes three key pieces of advice , before she enrolled at her mom 's alma mater at the start of this school year
' try to do everything in moderation , ' she said of the wisdom she imparted to her daughter
' try not to kill all your brain cells
and try to go to class
' and while to many , madonna is a globally - successful super star , she added that - when it comes to her daughter - she worried and frets just like any other mother
' i 'm very , you know , worried , ' she told father - of - three carson daly
' [ i always ask her ] : " are you ok ? are you getting enough sleep ? are you eating right ? " social media fun : madonna often shares images of her children on her instagram account , such as these pictures of mercy ( l ) and david ( r ) chart - topper : madonna 's newest album rebel heart ( pictured ) has just been released ' you know , i set up a humidifier in her room with eucalyptus oil
i was worried about the fact that she did n't have enough towels , q - tips , you know
' but , despite her constant worries about her teenage daughter , who is following in her mother 's footsteps by studying performing arts , it does n't look like madonna will be allowed anywhere near the campus in the near future - at least if lourdes has anything to do with it
' i 'm not allowed at [ football ] games , ' she admitted
' you think my daughter wants me at a game ? ' luckily , the chart - topper is n't short of activities to help her take her mind off her daughter 's college activities
the mother - of - four will release her 13th studio album , rebel heart , tomorrow , three months after someone leaked early versions of more than a dozen of the songs online
and although she is looking forward to the release - explaining that she is both ' excited ' and ' nervous ' - madonna admitted that she is still ' frustrated ' by the whole incident
' i mean , it 's a process , ' she said
' music is really personal to me
a lot of the stuff is out there that i had no intention of ever finishing
' they 're , like , scribbles on a pad
you know what i mean ? it 's unspeakably embarrassing
