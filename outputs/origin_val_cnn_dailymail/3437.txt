a member of the penn state fraternity has defended the disturbing facebook posts of unconscious female students that led to the fraternity 's suspension for a year
in an interview , the anonymous member of kappa delta rho described the group as ' satirical ' and accused the media of trying to ruin his fellow frat brothers ' lives and reputations
this came the same day that screenshots emerged of some of the facebook comments under posts made to a private group run by members of kappa delta rho , that included nude images of women , some of whom had passed out drunk
the screenshots show members of the group had commented referring to the women as ' sloots ' , saying ' i banged her lol ' , and then : ' lol delete those or we will be on cnn in a week '
' ' make that 373,218 , ' came the response
there were 144 members of the invite - only facebook page
the anonymous group member provided a statement to philadelphia magazine and gave an extensive interview
he attempted to justify the existence of the group as ' satire ' , that ' everyone ' does it , and laid a lot of blame on the media , while calling for a return to ' higher standards of morality ' and referring to the incident as ' minor '
in his statement he accused the media of attempting to ' ruin people 's lives and unjustly ruin reputations ' and was challenged in the interview that posting pictures of nude , unconscious women or intimate messages could ruin their lives or their reputations
at no point was the kappa delta rho brother apologetic
nor did he seem to understand why police and the university administration were investigating the matter
' how would it do so when it 's kept within the entirely , well , it 's supposed to be an entirely private group of 144 people ? ' he responded
asked if that puts a lot of trust in 144 people when any one of them could repost a picture publicly , he said : ' but nobody except the one kid who snitched out this group did that â¦ it just does n't work that way
' he added : ' it was nât a legitimate concern
... it is a brotherhood and nobody expects anyone to go and post stuff publicly or so forth and so on
it 's a real disappointment that this kid went and did this
' asked if the fraternity should accept some of the blame he responded : ' i think people should be responsible for themselves , and , i mean , i obviously had nothing to do with any of these postings , but â¦ just think , is it smart to post this on social media ? is this ethical in regards to the people who it involves ? ' ' but this is not a criminal thing
it 's not anyone else 's business , pretty much
it 's an inter-fraternity thing and that 's that , ' he added
he made clear that he had not posted any of the offensive material , nor commented on it , and that in retrospective , given the events , he regretted being part of the group
' it was a satirical group
it was n't malicious whatsoever
it was n't intended to hurt anyone
it was n't intended to demean anyone
it was an entirely satirical group and it was funny to some extent
' he likened the group to totalfratmove.com and ' raunchy ' snapchats that ' people send all the time '
the group was known as ' 2.0 ' and was started approximately eight months ago after its predecessor ' covert business transactions ' was shut down when a female student saw a topless photo of herself on a computer that had been left logged into the group
she was upset and threatened the fraternity who closed the group
members of penn state 's kappa delta rho fraternity ( pictured ) posted photos to a facebook page that showed unconscious nude female students asked why the group was relaunched , the group member said that its primary use was for communication within the fraternity about community service and social events
police learned of the page when a former member of kappa delta rho , but still a member of the facebook group , came to them and began acting as an informant
in addition to the photos of unsuspecting victims , the group was also used for drug sales and hazing
the informant told police that the drugs included marijuana and edibles , concentrates , add medication and some cocaine
the informant provided multiple print outs to police and said when asked about one of the pictures : ' this is the type of stuff that happens at kappa delta rho
' at a press conference on tuesday assistant police chief john gardner said : ' the images are disturbing , i âll tell you that
i do nât want to get into any more specifics
' police are working with the office of student conduct and penn state 's inter-fraternity council , in their investigation
they are trying to get the fraternity to cooperate and help identify any members that posted photos as well as any of the victims
possible charges include invasion of privacy and harassment , though police are not ruling out other options
