incumbent jonathan phoned former military leader buhari on tuesday to concede defeat in nigeria 's presidential elections , buhari 's party says
jonathan acknowledged the phone call and his defeat in a written statement to his countrymen
" i thank all nigerians once again for the great opportunity i was given to lead this country and assure you that i will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure , " he said
the inec is still announcing the final tally in the polls , but early numbers indicate buhari , now the president - elect , has an overwhelming majority of votes
buhari ruled nigeria from late 1983 until august 1985 after ousting his predecessor in a coup
his 20 - month rule was known for what he described as a " war on indiscipline , " a tough regime that some say was marred by human rights abuses
the 72 - year - old retired major general 's experience as a military ruler has variably been viewed as a plus or minus in present - day nigeria , where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group boko haram
his campaign has focused on security and ending corruption in nigeria
