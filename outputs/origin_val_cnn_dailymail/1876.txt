the robbery of a south african news team has sent shock waves through the country after the brazen muggers were filmed on the crew 's camera stealing their equipment at gunpoint

the men can then be seen demanding mr mvoko 's mobile phone before also taking a collection of the crew 's possessions and their work laptop
in a later interview with a sabc host , mr mvoko said they had spotted his phone , which was still in his hand after just having spoken to his producer in anticipation of going live on the news bulletin
he added : ' so i gave him the phone , then i think they took about two or three phones
