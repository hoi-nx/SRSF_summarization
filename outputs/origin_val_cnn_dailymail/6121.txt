the conservatives and labour have drawn neck and neck in the polls as ukip âs support continues to fall
nigel farage âs party is being squeezed as election day approaches and is now on just 10 per cent , its lowest showing since 2013 , according to a new comres survey for the daily mail and itv news
labour and the conservative have both advanced since last month and are level at 35 per cent
it is the best conservative showing since november 2012 , suggesting last week âs budget has gone down well with voters
the parties are both at 35 per cent in the polls - the best conservative showing since november 2012 any jubilation will be tempered , however , by labour âs showing â 35 per cent is its best vote share for six months
it is the third poll in recent days to put the two main parties neck and neck , suggesting the election race is deadlocked
today âs findings represent the highest combined two - party vote share since september 2013
ukip is down three points since last month to its lowest position in a comres poll since december 2013
the pollster said the party had suffered a â rapid decline â , falling from its peak of 19 per cent as recently as late last year
in recent days , ukip has been in crisis after the expulsion of one parliamentary candidate over allegations of expenses fraud , the suspension of another and the resignation of a third who complained of â open racism and sanctimonious bullying â
the liberal democrats remain on a miserable 8 per cent , down from the 23 per cent they won in 2010 , with the greens snapping at their heels on 7 per cent
despite being level with labour on voting intention , the poll finds that the conservative are in a strong position on the crucial issue of the economy
some 45 per cent of voters now think the economy would be better off under cameron and osborne , compared with 34 per cent who think the same of miliband and balls
