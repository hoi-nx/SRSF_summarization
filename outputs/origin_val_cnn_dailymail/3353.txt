all - rounder jp duminy took a hat - trick as south africa put one foot in the world cup semi-finals by dismissing sri lanka for 133 in their last eight clash at the sydney cricket ground on wednesday
bidding to win their first ever knockout match at a world cup , the proteas bowlers removed both openers inside the first five overs and never eased up the pressure thereafter
jp duminy ( 3 - 29 ) dismissed sri lanka skipper angelo mathews ( 19 ) with the final ball of the 33rd over and returned to send back nuwan kulasekara ( 1 ) and odi debutant tharindu kaushal ( 0 ) with the first two deliveries of the 35th
the ninth world cup hat - trick left the 1996 champions reeling at 116 - 8 after the loss four wickets for just two runs in three overs and when sangakkara was dismissed soon afterwards , the writing was on the wall
sangakkara , who had been looking for a fifth successive century , scored a measured 45 from 95 balls but was forced to throw off the shackles as the wickets tumbled around him and holed out to deep third man off paceman morne morkel
a heavy shower appeared out of the blue as if to mourn what looks like being the final one - day innings of one of the game 's great batsmen and the players came off the pitch for a 23 - minute rain break
it only delayed the inevitable , however , and lasith malinga ( 3 ) was the last man to depart , hammering the ball to david miller at cover off south africa 's other main spin threat tahir
tahir took 4 - 26 , including the wicket of mahela jayawardene to leave another retiring sri lanka batting great with a tally of four runs in his final innings in the 50 - over format
sri lanka , who won the toss and chose to bat , were never able to score at a pace that would have put pressure on the south african and test their mental resolve
while sangakkara was at the crease , though , they would have fancied their chances of putting on some kind of tally for their bowlers to defend
once he departed and the rain cleared , however , the semi-final appointment in auckland against new zealand or west indies next week would now seem to be south africa 's to keep
