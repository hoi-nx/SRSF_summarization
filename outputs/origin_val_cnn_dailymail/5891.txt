a fifth of patients turning up in a&e have self - treatable conditions including sore throats , athlete âs foot and head lice , a study has claimed
researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary â costing the nhs Â£ 290 million
doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover , their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair
more than four million a&e visits each year are unnecessary â costing the nhs Â£ 290million , a survey claims doctors have even reported patients showing up because their children had headlice , or because their false nails were hurting the analysis of data from 15 a&e units by consultancy firm ims health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a â self - treatable condition â
the data covered one in ten a&e units across england , so if the trends are mirrored across the country , then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments
the problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a gp , particularly out of hours
many go to a&e in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day , even if they have to wait four hours
even the health secretary jeremy hunt has admitted taking his children to casualty at the weekend rather than making an appointment with a gp
but the unnecessary visits are adding to the pressures of busy departments and diverting staff from treating patients who are very seriously ill. it all came to a head in january when 13 hospitals declared major internal incidents in a two - day period as they were unable to cope with the numbers coming through the door
now experts are urging patients to use local pharmacies , where they can be offered advice and treatment
matthew speers , from the proprietary association of great britain â which represents medicine manufacturers and commissioned the research â said : â pharmacists are well placed to provide advice to people with minor conditions , ensuring they get support without diverting nhs resources from people who really need them
â figures show that 21.7 million patients attended a&e in 2013/14 - a rise of more than a third in a decade but dr mann , president of the college of emergency medicine , which represents a&e doctors said attempts to divert patients did not work
dr mann , an a&e consultant at musgrove park hospital in taunton , dorset , added that the â a&e brand is well - known and trusted â so â patients will continue to attend
â he said the only solution was to install gp clinics at a&e units so patients with minor ailments could be sent there leaving staff to deal with the more serious cases
figures show that 21.7 million patients attended a&e in 2013/14 - a rise of more than a third in a decade
and the nhs has missed its target for ensuring 95 per cent of patients are dealt with within four hours every week for the last six months
in november , jeremy hunt admitted in the commons he had taken his own children to a&e â precisely because i did nât want to wait until later on to take them to a gp
â â if parents have an unwell child who needs medical attention a&e provides a trusted service
