the concert in moscow - believed to have been attended by 110,000 people - was the culmination of days of highly - choreographed nationwide festivities to mark the anniversary
he ended his speech with three words : ' long live russia
' despite condemnation from the west and kiev that the radical redrawing of europe 's borders amounted to an illegal land grab , people at the event echoed the belief of many russia that the annexation had corrected a historical injustice
' it means a lot to us , it was always ours after all
our grandparents shed their blood for it , ' said security guard alexei , 39
putin signed a treaty claiming the black sea region of crimea as russia territory with crimea prime minister sergei aksyonov two days after more than 97 per cent of crimeans voted in favour of joining russia in a disputed referendum on march 16 last year
the poll - unrecognised by the international community - was held under the eyes of elite russia troops who had swarmed key sites across crimea two weeks earlier in unmarked uniforms

to many russia , it was considered justified payback for soviet leader nikita khrushchev handing the region to ukraine in 1954 in what was then a largely symbolic move since ukraine and russia were both part of the soviet
the move sent relations with kiev and the west into a tailspin that has seen sanctions batter the russia economy and crimea placed under an effective economic blockade by ukraine
a pro-russian rebellion - which the west says has been orchestrated by moscow - quickly also engulfed part of ukraine 's industrial east , sparking a nearly year - long conflict that has claimed more than 6,000 lives
