she added : ' alex mckelvey had so much fun that day , you could see the joy on her face and so we said why not add an extra zero and go for 600 ? ' alex mckelvey said that she chose 600 because it was 10 times more than 60 , but she dreams of reaching many more people , according to the news tribune
the young girl said : ' we 're going to do thousands , then a million
i 'd like to reach so many people
