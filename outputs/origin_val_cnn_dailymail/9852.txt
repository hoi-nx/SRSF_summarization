allen tiller said he also had his own personal haunting experience while at beechworth , in a section of the asylum known as the ' bull pen '
' it used to house aggressive youths from 18 to 25 , and in there i heard a door slamming , and i audibly hear footsteps go up the hallway , ' he said
' then we had clear evps [ electronic voice phenomena ] of a couple of people say ' get out
' allen tiller â who says he is not a psychic or medium - uses a whole range of gadgets including full spectrum cameras , electromagnetic field detectors and voice recorders to gather ' evidence ' of the spirit world
rayleen kable - who is both a psychic and a medium â said her experience at beechworth was ' amazing '
' it 's definitely got activity and lots of it , ' she said
for rayleen kable , the most disturbing experience she has ever had was at the notorious north kapunda hotel in australia a disgruntled male spirit tried to attach itself to her in the ' hallway of hell ' ( pictured ) for allen tiller the most interesting experience was catching what he believes is evidence of the spirit of a young girl called ' sarah '
the hotel once served as a brothel , and legend has it that when a prostitute was murdered inside the hotel her young daughter ' sarah ' was taken in by the hotel 's madam ' we got some really class a ' evps ' â and basically what that is is a recording of a spirit so you actually hear it on a recorder
' i actually got this disgruntled spirit that said my name clearly â¦ you just hear this spirit screaming down my recorder
' for rayleen kable , the most disturbing experience she has ever had was at the notorious north kapunda hotel in australia when a disgruntled male spirit tried to attach itself to her in the ' hallway of hell '
' it was definitely a male spirit , but i would n't say a happy male spirit , ' she said
allen tiller said he and other tour guests had their own encounters with ghosts while at kapunda
one guest captured an image of what he believes is a man standing the corner of the hotel 's basement
for allen tiller the most interesting experience was catching what he believes is evidence of the spirit of a young girl called ' sarah '

' i was closing up the top of hotel after a tour and i saw a little girl standing in hallway , ' he said
' she ran down the hall to take her out of the hotel and she looked solid â¦ she was laughing
allen tiller said he had another haunting experience while at geelong gaol in victoria he was in a section upstairs on the third level when he says he heard a ' low whispery growl ' ' she 's been seen multiple times
' you can say " are you here sarah ? " and she 'll light up different devices
' allen tiller said he had another haunting experience while at geelong gaol in victoria
' i was in a section upstairs on the third level and i had a psychic tell me there was something evil in the corner , ' he said
' while i was waiting i actually heard a low whispery growl in there , and there was no way an animal could get in there
' that was pretty spooky
' at the same site fellow haunting : australia cast member gaurav tiwari captured an image of what he believes to be a prison guard standing near the stairs
the image appears red and purple because it is taken with a full spectrum camera â a favourite among ghost hunters who say it is like a video camera that has filters removed meaning it shows light spectrums the human eye ca n't see

' if they do n't want to move on my second objective would be to give validation to the spirit world
' for anybody who 's a witness and anybody in that location that really does want to believe and understand the afterlife , that there is a way for them to communicate from whatever realm they 're in to our realm
' allen tiller accepts that people may be sceptical of the existence of ghosts and supernatural beings , but that does n't stop him trying to prove they 're out there

' but if people knew there was a possibility that we move on , stress levels would drop off and people would have peace of mind
