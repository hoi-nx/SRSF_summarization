a young woman who vanished as a teenager may have been found hundreds of miles from home
summers of cleveland , ohio is believed to have been spotted in video footage taken from a bank atm in warwick , rhode island this january , eight years after the 14 - year - old first was reported as missing

when that did not work , the fbi stepped in to launch a wider search , even posting billboards along the east coast
despite the young woman 's possible criminal activity , this would be amazing news for the family as some believed summers may have been a victim of castro , the cleveland kidnapper who held three woman against their will in his house of horrors for years
castro , one of the victims , said upon her release that she remembered another girl being at the house at some point around the time summers first disappeared on july 6 , 2007
castro said the victim disappeared shortly after
authorities immediately believed the girl could have been summers as she lived in the same neighborhood as castro
it was thought by some that she may have been kidnapped by castro and kept at his house of horrors ( above ) , which was in her cleveland neighborhood summers ' mother , jennifer , has always been firm in her belief that her daughter was taken against her will and would never have run off from home on her own
summers was living with an uncle at the time of his disappearance , arguing with the man shortly before she vanished
she may have called her mother a year later , who claims she received a call from a woman who said ; ' it 's me mom
' and as the fbi calls on the public to help locate this woman , summers ' mother is hoping she will finally be able to see her daughter again after all these years and ' erase the pain ' she has felt since that day in 2007
' there 's nothing that tells us that it is her , but there 's nothing telling us that it 's not her either , ' said fbi spokeswoman vicki anderson
