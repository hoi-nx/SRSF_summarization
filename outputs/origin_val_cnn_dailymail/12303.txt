it was nothing if not predictable
take combustible issues like religion and sexuality , stir in a new law and talk of a boycott , then -- boom ! -- the debate on social media explodes
and so it has proved with indiana 's new " religious freedom " law , signed thursday by gov. mike pence
the new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner 's religious beliefs
supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose
opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty
the debate is nothing if not vitriolic
" libs shutup , " reads one tweet , which goes on to assert that indiana 's " relgious freedom restauration act ( sic ) " is modeled on federal legislation signed by president bill clinton in 1993
people on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and , it seems for the moment , more numerous
some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people , if perchance their religion dictated that
others say that indiana seems out of step with modern times
and then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that , law or no law , they have no intention of turning anyone away
" my team just canceled travel to in due to the # religiousfreedomrestorationact , " tweeted a user under the name mark c somerville , who says he works for @ salesforce
" we stand against discrimination
" and a tweet from a the st. elmo steak house , a business in indianapolis , the state 's capital and its largest city , pledged in capital letters to continue serving all
the word freedom should only be used when it 's inclusive and fair for all
supporters of the law , however , made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott
" before you go and get too self - righteous w / your # boycottindiana , " a user called caleb parke tweeted , " @ govpencein is protecting # religiousfreedom for everyone ! # equalrights
