here are the top 10 quotes from the interview with the chilean boss
manchester city manager pellegrini has spoken to read sportsmail 's pete jenson pellegrini on manchester city 's triumphs last season going unrecognised ' we were fighting on all fronts
we won the capital one cup , reached the quarter - finals of the fa cup , played in the champions league and we won the champions league scoring 157 goals
liverpool only had one competition and that 's an enormous advantage
' pellegrini on liverpool getting the attention ' the slip from ( steven ) gerrard ? they lost that game 2 - 0 , not 1 - 0
if he had not slipped , does it end in a draw ? we 'd still have been two points ahead of them
so why was it liverpool losing the league and not us winning it ? ' pellegrini on being told to buy england players â it is important to have england players but can you sign them ? can you get ( raheem ) sterling ? maybe if you go to liverpool with Â£ 100million you can
if i want an england player in the position of ( david ) silva who is there ? maybe ( wayne ) rooney , but who else ? ' pellegrini on europe silverware ' manchester united in all of that great era under ( sir ferguson ) ferguson only won two champions leagues
real madrid went 32 years without winning the champions league
it is important to be there in the later rounds but you ca n't think that not being there is a disaster
' pellegrini poses with the premier league trophy in may 2014 after he saw his team win the title pellegrini on barcelona ' you can talk about tactics and technique but if you go a man down against barcelona , you 're put in a terrible position
it is not a disgrace to get knocked out by them
their squad , if it is not the best in the world , it is the second best
no other team can put together leo messi , neymar and luis suarez but i want to play them with 11 and if they knock us out then let that be because they were better than us
' pellegrini on his days as a centre back before becoming a manager ' if you want to say i was a disaster of a player then say it
but give me another disaster of a player who played almost 500 games across 14 years
' pellegrini on manchester city 's riches ' this year liverpool , arsenal , chelsea and manchester united have all spent more than us
people do n't accept that we are trying to become a big club in a very short time
i do n't think there 's such a difference between the top five or six squads
' pellegrini feels england clubs are n't helped in europe competitions by the domestic fixtures during winter pellegrini on the festive fixture list ' england football gives other leagues an advantage
there are some traditions you ca n't change , i realise that
but you ca n't play nine games in december and nine in january
you have to stop at some point
' pellegrini on james milner ' it would be very difficult to find a more complete player than james milner
there are players who are better technically
there are players who head the ball better
but show me a player who does all the things that james milner does well and there is n't one
' you leave him on the bench and he is furious , but watch him during the game , encouraging and shouting
and in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes
it 's very difficult to find another james milner â an intelligent player , with big balls and a massive heart
' pellegrini on pressure in england compared to in argentina ' here the pressure is normal
there , it 's every day , and it 's life and death
i 've never had a problem with pressure because i believe in my own ability
last year i wanted to show i could win a major league in europe
this year the challenge is to repeat the title or to do better in the champions league
