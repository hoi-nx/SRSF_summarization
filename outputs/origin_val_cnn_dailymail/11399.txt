greeks ministers have threatened to send â millions of immigrants and thousands of jihadis â to western europe if it is forced out of the euro
the country âs defence and foreign ministers made the warning as eurozone creditors urge them to speed up promised reforms to receive payments on a Â£ 172billion bailout
without the funding , the country â which shares a border with turkey - will go bust , forcing it out of the eu âs single currency
hundreds of extremists have left western europe via turkey to join militants in syria ( a radical is pictured in raqqa , above ) turkey has become the preferred transit route for european jihadists travelling to fight in the middle east for extremist organisations such as islamic state
nikos kotzias , the greeks foreign minister , told eu colleagues in a meeting last week that there would be far - reaching consequences in the event of a breakdown of order in his country
he said : â there will be tens of millions of immigrants and thousands of jihadists , if you take out greeks
â the western balkans is not stabilized
then you have the ukraine , syria , iraq , north africa
â in a similar warning , kammenos , the greeks defence minister , said that if the eurozone allowed greeks to go bust it would give eu travel papers to illegal immigrants crossing its borders or the thousands held in detention centres
nikos kotzias , the greeks foreign minister , said there would be far - reaching consequences in the event of a breakdown he said : â if they deal a blow to greeks , then they should know the migrants will get papers to go to berlin
â if western europe leaves us in the crisis , we will flood it with migrants , and it will be even worse for berlin if in that wave of millions of economic migrants there will be some jihadists of the islamic state too
â mr kammenos , who is the leader of the right-wing independent greeks party which is in coalition with greeks âs ruling syriza government , said : â if they strike us , we will strike them
we will give to migrants from everywhere the documents they need to travel in the schengen area , so that the human wave could go straight to berlin
â most greeks want the country to keep the euro , but two - thirds also continue to back the government âs tough stance to renegotiate the bailout package
last month , greeks and its eurozone creditors struck a deal to extend the greeks bailout to june
alexis tsipras , the greeks prime minister and leader of the syriza movement , had to bow to german - led pressure to stick to the broad terms of its Â£ 176bn bailout in order to obtain the four month extension
the country âs creditors in the 19 - country eurozone endorsed greeks âs request for the extension after the european commission , european central bank and international monetary fund â the main institutions handling greeks âs loans â provisionally backed a list of reforms that athens proposed .
