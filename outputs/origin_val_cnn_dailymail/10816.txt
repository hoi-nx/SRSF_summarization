mr isaac , who lives in hampshire , has already been rendered unable to speak by his degenerative condition and like professor hawking , he relies on a computer system to communicate
his works by moving a cursor with his eyes and blinking to type but doctors have told him his eyes could also give in to the disease , which causes paralysis , and mr isaac has made it clear that it is at this point he would not wish to continue living
for four years mr isaac allowed his filmmaker son fraser , 24 , to record his decline in order to raise awareness about the illness and the truth about the devastating impact it has had on his family

â his wife of 30 years , debbie , 55 , said the achievements of professor stephen hawking , make it harder for others with the disease who are expected to cope just as well with the condition and flourish
after the film the theory of everything thrust the academic âs long life and success into the spotlight and won redmayne , 33 , an academy award for his portrayal of stephen hawking , miss isaac said people do not realise he is an â exceptional â case
mr isaac is the latest in a long line of terminally ill patients who have demanded for the right to end their lives , most notably debbie purdy , who died in december last year at the age of 51 after a year of refusing food
debbie , 55 , said the achievements of professor hawking ( pictured ) , make it harder for others with the disease who are expected to cope just as well with the condition and flourish she lived with multiple sclerosis for almost two decades and was a vocal campaigner for the â right to die â
under current laws in england , it is an offence to encourage or assist anyone to commit suicide
however , campaigners last night raised concerns that the programme could â normalise â suicide for the disabled and said the focus should be on improving quality of life
a spokesman for care not killing said : â we have deep concerns about this programme
it âs vital that we do not normalise , in any way , suicide as an option for those who are disabled
' there are many people who are suffering from a whole raft of debilitating conditions who would be horrified at the suggestion that they should end their life
' what we need to be doing is focussing on how we ensure he has the very best quality of life and does nât feel like he is becoming a financial or care burden on his family or on society as a whole
â while mrs isaac does not want to lose her husband and the father of her three children â carly , 27 , and twins fraser and hannah â she supports his wish to choose when and how he dies
she told the mail : â isaac should have what he wants
either way i do nât like the idea of losing him but i believe strongly that it âs his life and he should have what he wants
you have all of these thoughts and emotions but at the end of the day it is down to him
â i ca nât imagine what it will be like when we get to that but that âs what i believe
it âs his life and he should be able to choose
mr isaac is the latest in a long line of terminally ill patients who have demanded for the right to end their lives the documentary follows mr isaac âs struggles from diagnosis in february 2010 to his decision to have a tracheotomy in august 2014 , hoping it would allow him to live a further three years the family say the aim of the documentary , broadcast next wednesday , is to increase awareness of the disease â the whole thing is quite surreal , having end of life conversations , but he âs open enough to talk about it and while he wants to live if he ca nât communicate that âs the time he wants to end it
' you do nât get any practice at this , you âre just in it
there âs no way out and no happy ending
we know we âre going to lose him but as to how , if he ca nât communicate that âs the time
â but it is not a decision that sits easily with the whole family and fraser reveals his concerns to the camera
he said : â he says he wants to be switched off after he ca nât communicate but i ca nât actually imagine doing the tests and being like â can you respond ? â how do you judge what communication is ? â for him to be completely himself and alive and for us to say okay , bye dad , you ca nât communicate , and just turning off the machines
that to me is the worst way to go
â the family say the aim of the documentary is to increase awareness of the disease
mrs isaac claims the public view it largely through the lens of its most famous sufferer , professor stephen hawking
however , as he was very young when he was diagnosed , it progresses much more slowly than usual
even allowing for this , professor stephen hawking âs longevity is remarkable
while mrs isaac does not want to lose her husband and the father of her three children â carly , 27 , and twins fraser and hannah â she supports his wish to choose when and how he dies the impact the disease has had on mr isaac 's family is laid bare in the documentary , to be broadcast on wednesday mrs isaac said : â people do nât understand at all
people might see a tiny touch of it but they are not there to witness it , it âs ghastly
it âs a disease people just do nât know about
they might know the name , they might know it through stephen hawking
' i âm not medical but even i know he âs the exception to the rule
people look at him and probably think people with motor neurone disease will live a very long time
his is an extremely exceptional case
â the impact the disease has had on his family is laid bare in the documentary , to be broadcast on wednesday
it follows mr isaac âs struggles from diagnosis in february 2010 to his decision to have a tracheotomy in august 2014 , hoping it would allow him to live a further three years
in the intimate footage , which lifts the lid on what it is really like to live with a motor neurone disease sufferer , mrs isaac talks candidly about the strain it has put on their family and relationship
she said : â it âs incredibly hard
i do nât want to be a widow and i do nât want to lose him but how much more can you cope with ? â i âm really shocked
i thought , when he became ill we âd almost become closer and closer but almost it âs the opposite and i ca nât believe that âs happened
i âm shocked that it draws people apart rather than together
â speaking about the tracheostomy she added : â i was thinking the other day , if it was my decision , not that it ever would be
' it would be so hard to say no knowing that he wants it but really and truly , i think myself and the kids are just exhausted with the whole thing and he âs going to die , really , really sadly he âs going to die
' be it tonight or tomorrow or in a month or two months or a year
it âs just dragging out the inevitable
so if i had to say , i would say do nât do it
â filming my father : in life and death ( verve productions / channel 5 ) will be broadcast on march 11 at 7pm on channel 5 .
