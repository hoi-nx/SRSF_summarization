tim sherwood has hit back at claims hutton should have seen red for his high tackle on berahino by insisting referee jon moss got his decision spot on
hutton sparked a furious reaction from wba players for planting his studs into the midriff of berahino , missing a bouncing ball
a free - kick was awarded wba âs way and the pair were booked after coming head - to - head afterwards , with joleon lescott particularly angry at hutton , who is now banned for two matches for his tenth booking of the season
tim sherwood was all smiles during aston villa training having picked up his first win as aston villa boss hutton , who escaped punishment for kicking berahino , trains with his team - mates hutton appeared to raise his studs into berahino 's leg during aston villa 's win over wba berahino goes down in pain on the touchline following hutton 's nasty challenge at villa park berahino goes down holding his leg as hutton appears to proceed to move forward with the ball hutton and berahino squared up after the challenge ( left ) and were both booked by referee jonathan moss but tim sherwood said : ' i think the referee called it right
i thought he was just going to give him a talking to at first but on reflection he probably got it about right
' i do nât think it was a dirty game
it âs a local derby and i âm not used to players kissing and cuddling each other
' it was competitive , but that was always going to be the case
fans want to see commitment
â tim sherwood also said he did not intend to annoy opposition manager tony ahead of their repeat clash at villa park in the fa cup on saturday by suggesting wba needed to up their game
' i did nât do it to irritate tony otherwise i âd have put my gumshield in ! â he laughed .
