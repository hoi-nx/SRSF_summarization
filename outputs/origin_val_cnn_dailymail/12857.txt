what happens when john stamos shows up outside the " full house " home that made him a star ? nothing , apparently
for reasons unknown to us , john stamos was recently lurking outside the popular san francisco attraction when a group of tourists showed up
it appears they were too busy gawking at the house to realize " uncle jesse " was standing next to them
it appears that john stamos was amused and posted an instagram of him standing next to them
the caption ? " boy , these youngsters have 0.0 idea what they 're missing
" hopefully , he found some consolation in the 46,000 likes and thousands of comments from swooning fans
otherwise , john stamos is keeping busy with guest roles on " two and a half men " and " galavant " amid rumors of a possible " full house " reunion .
