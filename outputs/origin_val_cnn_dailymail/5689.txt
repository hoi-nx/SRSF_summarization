a poltergeist that maliciously terrorised a home for four months by hurling stones and knives at the people who lived there has been described as one of the most spookiest supernatural occupations in australian
tony healy and paul cropper spent several days at the humpty doo home in the northern territory when the poltergeist was in full swing back in 1998
the pair have published details of the encounter in their new book poltergeist : the stone - throwing spook of humpty doo and many other cases
words referred to their friend troy raddatz who was incinerated in a car accident just a few kilometres from their house the book details 50 of australian 's poltergeist occupations dating back to 1845 - with humpty doo coming in at number two
the ghostly encounters at the mcminns drive property started in january 1998 when the poltergeist started dropping pebbles from the ceiling onto the floor , tables , beds and heads
on the same night , residents andrew and jill summerville , dave clark , his partner jill summerville and their mate doug murphy noticed knives , small batteries , spanners , shards of broken glass and other objects being dropped or hurled across rooms
they called in two catholic priests and one greek orthodox priest to try and exorcise it
but all attempts failed and one priest even reported seeing a crucifix being hurled across the room
' whatever these things are they can run rings around us
my guess is some of the cases involve spirits of recently deceased people , ' mr tony healy told daily mail australia
jill summerville was photographed beside some of the graffiti left by the poltergeist on the walls of the house during its four month stint at the home the ghostly encounters at the mcminns drive property started in january 1998 when the poltergeist started dropping pebbles from the ceiling onto the floor , tables , beds and heads the residents were soon subjected to sinister words and symbols being drawn on the walls and floor in marker pens , scrabble tiles and pebbles
the first series of words that appeared in the house-' fire ' , ' skin ' , ' car ' , ' help ' and ' troy ' - referred to their friend troy raddatz who was incinerated in a car accident just a few kilometres from their house before the first sign of the poltergeist appeared
over the next couple of days the poltergeist cranked up the level of vandalism , causing serious damage - a cd player was thrown to the floor and destroyed , windows and glass cabinet doors were smashed by ashtrays and other flying objects
tony healy and paul cropper spent five days and nights at the property in april 1998
' we do nât know of anyone who visited the house and left sceptical
the poltergeist was pretty obliging by turning it on , ' mr tony healy said
pebbles from the driveway would regularly shower from the ceiling without warning , while knives , small batteries , spanners , shards of broken glass and other objects would be hurled across rooms this is a collection of the items the poltergeist regularly hurled across rooms , according to residents ' i saw an object materialise in mid-air
i was chatting to a lady and she was sitting across a wooden table across from me
she was reading a newspaper article with both her hands in plain sight
' there were other instances where knives , bullets â¦ whizzed past our heads
showering of stones also happened three times while we were there
' the messages on the floor and walls had a malicious flavour to them , but the thing is if it really wanted to hurt me â¦ it could have embedded the knife in my back rather than hurl it past
' after four months , the poltergeist left as suddenly as it arrived and its departure is still unexplained
