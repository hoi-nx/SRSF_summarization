contest : author james patterson has given Â£ 25,000 to encourage reading when they asked for entries , organisers expected a modest response
yesterday it emerged that more than 800 schools had applied for a share of a Â£ 25,000 book fund
world book day director grant said the response was proof of the continuing demand for books , despite the popularity of e-readers
â world book day is all about the celebration of traditional books , â she said
â for children there is still that wonderful thing of sitting down with their parents and reading a book and that amazing bond it performs
' children do nât want physical books to be replaced , they already spend so much time on the internet and devices so books actually provide them with a break from that
' to earn a share of the fund , which was donated by best - selling crime author james patterson , schools were asked to respond to the statement : why i ca nât live without books
miss grant and a panel of judges then drew up a shortlist , selected for their creativity and passion for books
the Â£ 10,000 first prize went to hexthorpe primary in doncaster
six other schools split the remaining Â£ 15,000 between themselves
she added : â world book day is all about the celebration of traditional books
children can go into a bookshop with a Â£ 1 world book day token and get an actual physical book
' so many children do nât have access to physical books so this is an opportunity for them to get one
there is definitely a huge demand
' school libraries are suffering , book budgets in schools are being slashed , so this is a brilliant way to counter that
â huge response : more than 800 schools applied for a share of a Â£ 25,000 book fund as part of world book day mr james patterson , who has also written several children âs books and has donated another Â£ 25,000 for an award fund next year , said : â libraries are shutting their doors left and right
' i firmly believe that every child needs access to a school library , which is why i âm supporting wobod : they encourage a love of reading in our children that we ca nât afford to lose
â reading is one of the building blocks of life and can take you to another world
reading encourages imagination and helps with education
