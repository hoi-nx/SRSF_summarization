short bursts of intensive exercise before a high - fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet , researchers have found
just eight minutes of high - intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes â the current recommended level
researchers say short bursts of intensive exercise before a high - fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet
file photo scientists at the university of exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters â few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day
performing any exercise before a high fat meal was already known to prevent this impairment in blood vessel function but the study found intensive exercise was better for blood vessel function in young people than the currently recommended moderate - intensity exercise
the study found eight minutes of high - intensity cycling was more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes
file photo cardiovascular diseases including heart attacks and stroke are the leading cause of death in the uk , and researchers said the processes underlying these start in youth
impairment in the function of blood vessels is thought to be the earliest stage of this process , and this is known to occur in the hours after consuming a high fat meal
scientists compared high - intensity , interval exercise against moderate - intensity exercise on blood vessel function in adolescent boys and girls after they had consumed a high fat milkshake
the research showed that approximately 25 minutes of moderate - intensity cycling prevented the fall in blood vessel function after the high fat meal , but performing just eight minutes of high - intensity cycling not only prevented this fall , but improved blood vessel function to a level that was superior to moderate - intensity exercise
dr alan barker , of the children 's health and exercise research centre , sport and health sciences at the university of exeter , said : ' our study shows that the intensity of exercise plays an important part in protecting blood vessel function in young people after the ingestion of a high fat meal
' ' furthermore , both the boys and girls found the high - intensity exercise to be more enjoyable than the moderate - intensity exercise
' considering that very few adolescents currently achieve the recommended minimum of one hour of at least moderate - intensity exercise per day , smaller amounts of exercise performed at a higher - intensity might offer an attractive alternative to improve blood vessel function in adolescents
' the study is published in the american journal of physiology-heart and circulatory physiology .
