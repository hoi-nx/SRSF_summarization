a father - of - three who was told not to go to a&e after paramedics dismissed his chest pains as a panic attack , has died from a cardiac arrest
former factory worker corbin was persuaded not to go to hospital despite suffering symptoms of a heart attack by an ambulance crew who told him he would have to wait up to seven hours in a&e for treatment
but he collapsed and died in his bedroom the next day after a shocking 70 - minute wait for a first responder to turn up because he was classed as low priority
because of extra demand over the easter weekend it then took a further 14 minutes before an ambulance finally arrived at his home in sneyd green , stoke-on-trent on april 20 last year
when the 59 - year - old was finally taken to university hospital of north staffordshire it was too late and he was pronounced dead
yesterday a coroner criticised the west midlands ambulance service and said if paramedics had done their job properly mr corbin would still be alive
mr corbin 's family , including widow kathryn , 53 ( centre ) , daughter sinead ( left ) and son drew 23 ( right ) have been left devastated by the loss mrs corbin is now suing the nhs and west midlands ambulance service for negligence after paramedics persuaded the father - of - three not to go to hospital an ambulance was called after his collapsed but it took more than 70 minutes to arrive - national government targets require an ambulance to attend an address within 30 minutes of a 999 call recording a verdict of death by natural causes , north staffordshire coroner ian smith said : ' clearly a wrong decision was made
' there 's no doubt corbin should have been in hospital and i 'm quite satisfied that had he been in hospital , tests would have been done , and the likelihood is he would have still been alive
' in the paramedic 's medical reports , there 's no mention of anything other than panic attacks and anxiety , but his post-mortem examination results showed he had recently suffered an acute heart attack
' but did they tell him he needed to get into an ambulance or did they give him an option ? the next day he collapsed on the bedroom floor
' an ambulance was called for at 2.27am , but due to increased demand a single paramedic did not arrive until 3.42am
' recording a verdict of death by natural causes , north staffordshire coroner ian smith said it was clear a wrong decision had been made in mr corbin 's ( pictured with grandson oliver howden ) treatment the coroner said there was ' no doubt ' mr corbin ( pictured at his wedding to wife corbin ) should have been in hospital mr corbin 's devastated widow kathryn , 53 , is now suing the nhs and west midlands ambulance service for negligence
she told the inquest : ' when the paramedics arrived , i did n't feel there was any urgency
' the paramedic said jeff could be at the hospital for about six or seven hours waiting for a doctor
' at the time i did n't think jeff was so poorly
' the paramedics gave him the option , but if we had been told on that morning that he really needed to go to hospital then we would have gone
' but there was just no urgency to get him there
' jeff was an absolute diamond
he loved everything and everybody
' paramedic richard harris denied he tried to dissuade mr corbin from attending hospital
when an ambulance crew arrived at his home in stoke-on-trent ( pictured ) they told him he would have to wait up to seven hours in a&e for treatment when the 59 - year - old was finally taken to university hospital of north staffordshire ( pictured ) after collapsing the next day it was too late and he was pronounced dead he told the hearing : ' i thought he would be better having further examinations at the hospital , which is what i recommended
' i would never make recommendations to a patient travelling to the hospital based on waiting times
' the post-mortem examination found mr corbin died from a heart attack
speaking today kathryn , who had been married to mr corbin for 25 years , said : ' i feel very strongly that if jeff had gone to hospital the first time he would still be with us
' it was 6am on the saturday ( april 19 ) when he woke up with shortness of breath , chest pains and a shooting pain going up and down his left arm
' i 'm not medically trained but that says heart attack to me
i dialled 111 and told them his symptoms and they passed it through to the ambulance service
' when the paramedics turned up they just said to me and jeff ' it 's a panic attack '
they also said he 'd pulled his chest in the panic attack which is why he had pain there
the coroner said that in all likelihood , mr corbin would have survived if he had been taken to hospital in proper time mr corbin 's family described him as ' an absolute diamond ' and said that he loved everything and everybody ' looking back now i wish i 'd pushed for them to take him to a&e but they did n't seem to bothered and we trusted them
' they put the frighteners on us basically
they said they could take jeff to hospital but said he 'd probably be in a&e for up to seven hours waiting for treatment
' he 'd only just come out of hospital after having a knee operation and was understandably not keen to go back but he would have done if the paramedics had advised him to

when no one turned up after 40 minutes i called again and they said a first responder was on their way
' he did n't turn up until over an hour later and as soon as he saw jeff his face dropped and he turned to me and said , ' what on earth is he doing here ? he needs to be in hospital
