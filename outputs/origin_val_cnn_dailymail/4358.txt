you can search far and wide for the answer to a problem , but sometimes it is right under your nose
when arsene wenger sent coquelin on loan to charlton in november it looked to be the final nail in the frenchman 's arsenal career
the gunners manager admitted as much recently , revealing he was prepared to let the midfielder leave in december
arsenal midfielder coquelin ( right ) controls the ball during his side 's win against queens park rangers the frenchman wore a protective mask at loftus road after fracturing his nose against everton coquelin , pictured challenging sandro , has become the gunners ' midfield enforcer in recent months but a spate of injuries in midfield saw arsene wenger recall coquelin in december
the 23 - year - old has n't looked back
he 's grasped his chance to become a key member of arsenal 's midfield with both hands , despite his reluctance to return to arsenal from charlton fearing he 'd simply be warming the bench
there 's an argument to suggest he 's the most vital component in arsene wenger 's plans at the present moment ; the central midfield enforcer they 've been crying out for in recent years
just weeks after his arsenal career looked to be drawing to a close , coquelin is on the verge of agreeing a new long - term contract to stay at the emirates stadium
arsene wenger would like to say coquelin 's emergence has been pre-planned ; a managerial masterstroke that has helped arsenal turn their stuttering league form around
but that is far from the case
coquelin played five games on loan at charlton this season but has returned to be a first team regular coquelin 's stint in the first team has earned him a new long - term contract with the gunners the frenchman midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot mathieu flamini in the pecking order following three substitute appearances after his return from the valley , coquelin was handed a rare start against west ham on december 28 in place of the injured mathieu flamini
he has n't looked back
his energetic and mature displays alongside santi cazorla in central midfield have been a revelation - none more so than in the win at manchester city in january
the concern with coquelin has always been about his physical stature
can his slender frame handle the rough and tumble of premier league football ? he 's answered those questions unequivocally in recent weeks
having fractured his nose in the recent win over everton , the midfielder insisted upon playing on - only coming off in injury time after taking another blow to the face
three days later he was back on the pitch , sporting a protective mask , in the narrow win over queens park rangers at loftus road
he 's waited so long to prove himself in an arsenal shirt , coquelin 's wo n't let a broken nose keep him on the sidelines now
gunners boss arsene wenger admitted that he was willing to let coquelin leave the club before his return arsene wenger is still interested in saints 's defensive midfielder schneiderlin ( left ) coquelin , pictured in training , still needs to convince arsene wenger that he can play for arsenal long - term the big question is whether coquelin is the long - term answer to arsene wenger 's holding midfielder conundrum
after failing to sign an enforcer last summer , the gunners will be back in the market for a midfield ball winner once more at the end of the season despite coquelin 's emergence
schneiderlin , for the time being , is favourite to land the role provided arsenal can strike a deal with saints , who will want at least Â£ 25milliom
that would leave coquelin 's regular place in arsene wenger 's team selections under threat
for now coquelin will be focusing on keeping his place in the team until the end of the season
the returns of aaron ramsey and jack wilshere following injury spells will cast further questions over the frenchman 's role
but , for now , the shirt is coquelin 's to lose
having waited so long for this chance - he 'll be desperate to keep it that way .
