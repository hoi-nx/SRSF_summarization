tax hikes in the last five years have raised an extra Â£ 16.4billion a year , equivalent of around Â£ 255 for every person in the uk
a new study by the institute for fiscal studies found that by 2015 - 16 , will have imposed tax rises worth Â£ 64.3 billion while tax cuts have totalled only Â£ 48billion
the figures come ahead of george osborne 's final budget before the election , with labour warning they lay bare the full extent of the government 's failure to fix the economy
chancellor george osborne , pictured today , is expected to use his budget on wednesday to announce a nother increase in the personal tax allowance tax rises introduced since 2010 include a Â£ 14 billion hike in vat and a Â£ 5.2 billion increase in national insurance contributions
at the same time the tax reductions of 48 billion include Â£ 8 billion from raising the personal threshold for income tax , Â£ 5.9 billion in cuts to corporation tax and Â£ 3.9 billion from real - terms reductions in fuel duties
however , the institute for fiscal studies said the changes were a ' missed opportunity to improve the tax system ' , because they had been introduced in a piecemeal way with little attempt to address ' fundamental structural deficiencies '
several of the changes have exacerbated ' unwelcome distortions ' in the system , said the institute for fiscal studies
it was difficult to find a ' good economic reason ' for lifting ever - more lower - paid workers out of income tax while leaving national insurance thresholds largely untouched , and it was an ' absurdity ' that the two taxes had not been integrated
mr george osborne is expected to use wednesday 's budget to announce another big rise in the personal tax allowance
deputy pm nick clegg said : â the main thing the government can do is just take less of your money away from you
â i very much want to give the biggest possible workers â bonus to millions of people on middle and low incomes
' the study by the institute for fiscal studies found that by 2015 - 16 , will have imposed tax rises worth Â£ 64.3 billion while tax cuts have totalled only Â£ 48billion the institute for fiscal studies highlighted the ' problematic ' failure to uprate tax thresholds in line with inflation , and warned of a ' rapid ' increase in workers paying higher rates of income tax as the economy improves
unless the phenomenon known as ' fiscal drag ' is dealt with , the number of families losing some or all of their child benefit will double within a decade , the report predicted
the report also warned that council tax had been allowed to get ' ever more out of date ' , with bands in england and scotland based on property prices in 1991
and it said that areas such as fuel duties and business rates had ' seen a stream of ad hoc , often temporary , announcements overtaking each other without a clear statement of principles or long - run intentions '
labour 's shadow chancellor ed balls said the tory idea that cutting taxes for a few at the top means wealth will trickle down to everyone else has nât worked authors stuart adam and barra roantree said : ' there is a better way to make tax policy
the corporate tax road map was a good start , setting out a direction of travel and providing an element of predictability
the next government would be well advised to apply this approach to more elements of the tax system , and indeed to the tax system as a whole
' that would help taxpayers to plan , provide a benchmark for assessing the policies actually implemented , and facilitate debate on whether the strategy laid out is the right one
taking the time to articulate a strategy might even lead to the adoption of better tax policy
' labour 's shadow chancellor ed balls told the standard : ' the old tory idea that cutting taxes for a few at the top means wealth will trickle down to everyone else has nât worked
and once again , a tory chancellor is giving with one hand but taking away much more with the other
' no pre-election tax cut can mask the Â£ 1,127 a year which the institute for fiscal studies ( institute for fiscal studies ) says families have lost because of tax and benefit changes since 2010 â from higher vat to cuts to tax credits
