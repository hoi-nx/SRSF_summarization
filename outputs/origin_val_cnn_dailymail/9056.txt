we were only nine years apart
the first thing she did was say , ' aunt tina , i 'm so happy for you , ' and gave me a big hug
' as the night went on they drank more , the court heard , and soon mr jeremy was determined to drive home
however francis demanded she be the designated driver and tried to take the keys off of him
george-harvan said : ' when i turned around , the glove box is open and i see this gun
i think i got ta move this gun
i go get it out of the glove box to move it and boom the gun goes off
the defense attorney then asked : ' did you squeeze the trigger ? ' and she replied : ' no. ' recounting the moment she realized she had shot her niece , she said : ' everything freezes , jeremy says , ' you just shot your [ expletive ] cousin '

' on friday prosecutor brittany smith told the jury , ' she shot somebody
do you think she used reasonable care ? ' the jury is now deliberating and is considering third - degree murder or involuntary manslaughter
