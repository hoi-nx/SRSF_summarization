a silicon valley venture capital firm has emerged victorious from a three - year high profile case accusing executives of gender discrimination
reddit interim ceo ellen pao , 45 , sued her former employer kleiner perkins for four counts of discrimination after she was fired
in a case that prompted a broad discussion about gender bias in the tech industry , pao painted the firm as sexist , crude , and quarrelsome
on friday , a jury of six men and six women rejected every claim after less than 72 hours of deliberation in san francisco superior court
the reddit ceo claimed her career crumbled at kleiner after ending an affair with a partner a jury of six men and six women rejected all of pao 's claims in san francisco superior court on friday over the course of three years , pao told the court her career at the silicon valley firm crumbled after she ended a brief affair with partner nazre , and was fired in 2012 when she complained
pao , who is married to wall street financier alphonse fletcher jr , said he ' falsely told her that his wife had left him ' and ' engaged in offensive , obstructionist , and difficult behavior ' until she ' succumbed ' two or three times
after she ended the liaison , he started to ' retaliate ' , she claimed
at one point , she said , nazre appeared at her colleague 's hotel room on a business trip wearing nothing but a bathrobe , carrying a glass of wine , according to testimony
the court heard ray lane , a former partner , said the woman , vassallo , should have been ' flattered '
kleiner countered that it investigated nazre after vassallo complained , after which he quickly left the firm
pao 's first claim , tabled in 2007 , also accused senior partner randy komisar of giving her a leonard cohen book , book of longing , filled with sexually explicit drawings and poems
later , he asked her to dinner adding that ' his wife would be out of town '
the case played out as silicon valley saw a steady decline in the number of female venture capitalists
recent figures collected by babson college show six per cent of the venture capital is female , down from 10 per cent in 1999
with that backdrop , pao 's lawyers described kleiner as a pressure cooker that was hostile toward women
one of pao 's mentors testified that subpar performance meant she was not promoted , rather than gender the firm disputed those charges , presenting evidence that kleiner went out of its way to hire women
during the case , the court heard one partner , chi-hua chien , said women ' kill the buzz ' as he argued only men should be invited to a dinner with al gore
john doerr , once pao 's direct boss , told investigators she had ' a female chip on her shoulder '
and senior partner ted schlein rebuffed the feminist rallying call from facebook 's coo sheryl sandberg that women ' deserve a seat at the table '
he said : ' i really do nât think it was a very big deal to us who sits at a table or who does not
' specifically , pao alleged that : the jury ruled against pao on the first three claims but was sent back to deliberate the fourth due to an apparent miscount
two hours later , they emerged in favor of kleiner perkins
the court requires a minimum of 9 - 3 votes to come to a conclusion
but initially , the verdict stated that four jurors supported pao 's view that she was fired because she sued for gender discrimination
on the pivotal claim that pao was fired for being female , ten jurors ruled gender was not a substantial factor
they came to their conclusion after completing this question - and - answer document
according to wall street journal reporter jeff elder , pao looked down and forced a smile as the judge revealed she had lost
some witnesses , including pao 's onetime mentor john doerr , testified that pao 's lack of advancement stemmed from subpar performance , not discrimination or retaliation
however , pao 's attorneys argued she played a pivotal role in the investment in rpx and twitter
pao testified for five days and faced questions from jurors such as whether it was ' professional to enter into an affair with a married partner ? ' ' going back i would not have done it again , but i did n't think it was inappropriate at the time , ' pao said
following the verdict on friday , pao released a statement via twitter
in nine tweets , she wrote : ' thank you , world
' i have been inspired by the thousands of people who have reached out to me over the past three years with support
' i âve heard from people in kazakhstan , bangladesh , australia , malaysia , france , argentina , norway , tanzania , finland , and beyond
' because of social media and live reports , the problem of gender discrimination in venture capital has received attention around the globe ' while today âs outcome is a disappointment , i take consolation in knowing that people really listened ' if we do not share our stories and shine a light on inequities , things will not change ' hopefully my case will inspire the venture capital industry to level the playing field for everyone , including women and minorities ' to support the entrepreneurs of tomorrow , we need to show leadership today
