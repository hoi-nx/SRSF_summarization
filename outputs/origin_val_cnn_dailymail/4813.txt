pellegrini has claimed that city âs players would never surround the referee in the way chelsea harangued dutch official kuipers during their champions league exit to psg
jose mourinho âs side were fiercely criticised for urging kuipers to send off psg star zlatan ibrahimovic on wednesday , and pellegrini warned there must be a limit to what teams will do to achieve victory
â you will never see the city players surround the referee , â said pellegrini
â maybe you can discuss with the referee about a decision but just one moment in the game
every time the referee has a decision you have all the players on top of him and it âs impossible for the referee to work
