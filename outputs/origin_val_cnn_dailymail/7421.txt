for steve clarke , there were no apologies , no guilt and no sense of remorse
he deemed the nine changes before their defeat at watford necessary if reading are to be ready for bradford in their fa cup quarter - final replay on monday night
of those nine , four were making full debuts
discounting simon cox , the rest of the reading side had made just 34 championship starts between them this season
whatever steve clarke says , this was an unwrapped gift to a team chasing promotion to the premier league
but the manager must be well down the list when blame is apportioned
karacan 's reading team - mates gather to congratulate the midfielder after his goal against watford steve clarke played a decidedly under strength side at vicarage road that will completely change on monday reading 's pavel pogrebnyak and bradford 's stephen darby clash in the 0 - 0 draw that forced monday 's fa cup replay at the madejski stadium , with both sides nursing their squads in the lead - up to the fixture it is the fault of broadcasters that he had just 48 hours between leaving vicarage road on saturday and kicking off against bradford on monday evening
domestic cup fixtures can not be played on the same night as champions league games and , as such , there is no way around this ludicrous situation
steve clarke is expected to name a completely fresh xi at the madejski stadium , while parkinson , who made six changes of his own side for the 1 - 1 draw at notts county , will mix and match , too
bradford had five players who retained their place from the fa cup game
fifteen changes was the sum total and for one reason only
steve clarke is dealing with a ludicrous 48 - hour turnaround between playing watford and bradford these will be two teams going hell for leather in a competition they have prioritised
their tedious goalless draw at valley parade last week may have been wretched to watch , but this tie is harking back to the fa cup âs old days , neither side giving an inch
they could not bear losing at this stage
reading supporters wo nât remember the 4 - 1 defeat at watford in a decade âs time , but a day out at wembley , taking on holders arsenal , would stick in the memory should they progress
the reading have nothing to play for in the league
they are safe and will not trouble the second tier âs play - offs
almen abdi ( centre ) scored the opener against a reading side with nothing to play for in the league and club captain karacan , who made only his second appearance for the club since september 2013 because of injury , backed his manager âs decision to ring the changes
â the gaffer has to bear the replay in mind , â said karacan , who scored his side âs consolation as watford ran riot with strikes from almen abdi , matej vydra , troy deeney and fernando forestieri
â if you put a team out that does nât win at watford you get criticised , but if you do nât win on monday you get criticised as well so it âs a catch-22 for the gaffer
â playing at wembley is one of those things that you just ca nât describe
the feeling we had when we went there before ( the 2011 championship play - off final loss to swansea ) will always stay with me
â reading 's yakubu aiyegbeni passes under pressure as his side struggled against the promotion hopefuls parkinson has had a trickier balancing act
bradford are three points beneath the league one play - offs and will have two games in hand once tuesday âs programme of fixtures is complete
he could nât afford to make changes quite so wholesale for their trip to nottingham , knowing promotion is by no means out of the question
those in west yorkshire will think of two years ago when they were capable of juggling that fairytale journey to the capital one cup final and the league campaign , which ended in promotion from league two
reading will doubtless have the fresher side tonight and parkinson knows his team blew their best chance of reaching the semi-finals
but they feed off adrenaline
just ask chelsea and sunderland
two games in three days will not faze this collection of loanees and cast - offs
after all , arsenal await
performance of the weekend maybe , just maybe , ronnie moore can inspire hartlepool to football league survival
marooned at the foot of league two for months , all looked lost
the 1 - 0 win at morecambe - thanks to an andy parrish own goal - was their first three points on the road since october , their first clean sheet away from victoria park for 12 months and puts them within two results of safety
no wonder defender scott harrison was close to tears in the dressing room afterwards
what 's caught my eye
