a young australian woman is spearheading a global campaign petitioning facebook to remove ' body shaming ' emoticons and status options from the social media site
rebecca guzelian , along with seven other women around the world , has partnered with endangered bodies , an international movement challenging body image standards , to launch a campaign to remove the â i feel fat â and â i feel ugly â emoticons from the social media site
ms rebecca guzelian , a counsellor and intern psychologist , is one of over ten thousand people to back the ' fat is not a feeling ' petition , and claims that the options perpetuate and normalise body shaming , especially in young people
endangered bodies has been petitioning facebook to remove the options from their site , and has partnered with the women to start national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website
women from the uk , ireland , the us , germany , mexico , argentina , brazil , and endangered have partnered together to post their personal stories and experience with body shaming to promote the campaign , which has garnered thousands of signatures in just a few days
facebook has long held itself up as a community driven social media site , and over the ten years since it 's inception , has introduced different features to reflect the habits of the millions of people on the site
the ' fat ' and ' ugly ' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the ' feelings ' feature for status updates , along with almost 100 other emoticons that can be individualised to reflect a user 's mood
ms rebecca guzelian said the emoticons normalise body shaming and encourages young people to use the words publicly to speak negatively about themselves
' encouraging this kind of ' fat talk ' is not okay â and that âs exactly what facebook is doing by offering these words as options , ' ms rebecca guzelian said
eight women have partnered with endangered bodies , a movement challenging body image standards the eight women have all started national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website psychologist mcmahon from endangered , along with her colleagues from around the world , have been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced but have received no response
' facebook has not been listening
not only do these features remain as emoji selections , facebook have not addressed the critcisms that this plays in contributing to culture of body shaming , ' ms mcmahon said
' this is despite the fact facebook claims that one of their core values is to build social value - which in this instance they are not doing
this is particularly concerning when research demonstrates that facebook use is already associated with increased risk of eating disorders , weight concern and anxiety , ' she said
' " feeling fat " was once the language of clinical eating disorders and it is now normative in our society
it is well documented that " fat talk " , as using such terms is known , perpetuates body image issues and body shame rather than reduce it
women from the uk , ireland , the us , germany , mexico , argentina , brazil , and endangered are campaigners endangered bodies has been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced over 10,000 people have signed the ' fat is not a feeling ' petition on change.org ms rebecca guzelian said that she and the other women hope that the social media giant will recognise that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues , and that it is a concern for australian
the petition explains that ' â fat â and â ugly â are adjectives
they describe physical characteristics , not feelings
' ' having these word choices completely normalises using derogatory descriptive terms in the place of real feelings
what âs worse is that these adjectives are judgemental and forced on us by society to make women ( and increasingly men ) feel negatively about their otherwise healthy bodies , ' the petition says
' when someone says â i feel fat â what they âre really communicating is that they feel unattractive , unhappy , embarrassed and insecure about their body
and believe it or not , these feelings are most commonly a response to the unrealistic , culturally promoted ideals of thinness and beauty that are shoved in our faces every single day
' ms rebecca guzelian , who works as a counsellor at the butterfly foundation , endangered 's leading body supporting people who struggle with eating disorders and body image problems , said that young people are becoming increasingly obsessed with how they look
' for young people , who are on facebook from nine , ten , 11 years of age , having a huge platform like this tell them it 's normal to speak about themselves like that is a huge issue
' ' facebook encourages people to focus on and scrutinise the way they look , so as to present the best version of themselves in the online world
doing this really places an extreme focus on the external , instead of the internal , ' she said
the ' fat ' and ' ugly ' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the ' feelings ' feature for status updates ms rebecca guzelian said that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues the petition explains that ' â fat â and â ugly â are adjectives
they describe physical characteristics , not feelings ' ' we begin to measure our worth by the way that we look â because let âs face it , facebook is nât the place that we are all posting about the important reasons why we are great , wonderful valuable and worthy people on the inside
' ms rebecca guzelian said that the campaign was as much about encouraging a positive discussion about body image as it was a bid to have the emoticons removed
' there are things everywhere in the world that tells us to be ashamed of how we look , and why we feel bad about ourselves , ' she said
' there are cues everywhere around us , guiding us down that path and if we can prick up our ears and take notice , then we can choose to see ourselves and others in a different light
