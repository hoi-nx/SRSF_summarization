the full extent of the impact of good schools on house prices around england is laid bare by research released today
a map produced by savills estate agents shows the cost of homes near the best performing schools can be more than 25 % higher than in other areas
each dot on the map represents a school , with the darker coloured dots representing better performing schools and the size of the dot showing the ' house price premium ' around that school
savills say the map shows that certain areas can be classed as ' educational hotspots ' , in which a choice of good schools leads to a spike in property prices
the company say the best examples of these are northwood in middlesex , brighton in west sussex , shrewsbury in shropshire and ascot in berkshire
the map also shows how selective grammar schools , such those in kent and buckinghamshire , drive up house prices in the surrounding area
lucian cook , director of residential research at savills , said : ' what it shows is there are clear house price premiums around high performing state schools
these are not uniform , there are exceptions where people can still get access to a well - performing school , but generally , there is a premium
' that said , i suppose there is a bit of a chicken and an egg situation of where you have to ask whether affluent families cluster around a high performing school , or are schools high performing because of the families who live nearby
' a graph produced by estate agents shows that house prices are higher than the regional average in places where pupils perform well at school the report states : ' for many [ house buyers ] , rather than pinning their hope on a single school , a choice of good schools will determine whether they will look to buy
' in locations such as northwood , brighton , shrewsbury and ascot that will be driven entirely by a cluster of high performing independent schools
' in others such as dorking , malvern , borehamwood , warwick , oxford and guildford these will be supplemented by one or two high performing state school alternatives
' in other areas , such as wallington , altrincham , orpington it might be exclusively a function of the grammar school system
' in others , such as bath winchester , york , colchester , tunbridge wells , chelmsford and cambridge the a network of a range of high performing schools underpins a high value family housing market
' the research comes after a study last year found a top state secondary adds an average of Â£ 21,000 to surrounding house prices - with one school in buckinghamshire adding nearly Â£ 500,000 to the price of nearby homes
the research shows how parents are willing to pay much more in order to live close to a good school
