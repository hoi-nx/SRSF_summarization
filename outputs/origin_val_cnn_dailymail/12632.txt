schools in ny have decided to observe two muslim holidays and close schools for them
after all , for decades , kids have gotten christian and jewish holidays off
why not add muslim holidays to the list ? conservative family research council president perkins went predictably apoplectic , saying that it was evidence of " discrimination " against christians
to perkins , " family " apparently does not include " non-christian families
" perkins ' position is that kids get easter and christmas off , but we call those holidays " winter break " and " spring break
" i hate to ally myself with such people , but i sort of agree that mayor blasio 's decision is a bad one
however , not for the reasons expressed by perkins
i simply find it to be a problematic endorsement of religion by the secular state
i can not support the government endorsing religion of any kind
there was once a time when most people considered the u.s. to be a " christian " country
however , that notion was never the intent of our founders and is not consistent with a pluralistic and enlightened nation
unfortunately , even recent events have shown us that there are a lot of ignorant u.s. who still think islam is " un-american
" because of that , i support measures that tell muslim that they are our brothers and sisters , too
nobody should feel less welcome or " u.s. " on the basis of the religion they practice , or whether they believe in any religion at all
but this is the wrong way
first of all , virtually every recognized religion is practiced in ny
unfortunately , now only three of them have some kind of " officially acknowledged " status
christians , jews and muslim have their holidays off , but what about ny 's other religions ? what about my religion ? march 6 has long been " the day , " and as a dudeist minister , should i not demand respect for my beliefs , by insisting that the school district " take ' er easy " on that date every year ? flying spaghetti monster is a recognized religion
pastafarians believe that every friday is a holiday
perhaps it is time for us all to be touched by the noodly appendage of the flying spaghetti monster on a weekly basis
by selecting only three " approved " religions for respect , we send the message that we value the beliefs of some over those of others
such a mentality has no place in a secular country -- even if we have a history of recognizing some abrahamic religions ' holidays
because therein lies a theory behind the establishment clause
we do n't rank belief systems here
in lemon , 403 u.s. 602 ( 1971 ) , the u.s. supreme court gave us a three - part test to determine whether governmental conduct violates the establishment clause : ( 1 ) the governmental action must have a secular purpose , ( 2 ) it must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion , and ( 3 ) it may not foster an excessive governmental entanglement with religion
de blasio 's action violates , i think , all three prongs
de blasio should have used this opportunity to change direction , and state that there would be no official religious holidays â that selecting just the abrahamic vein of religion as officially recognized by the state is simply improper
this would send the right message -- that the government is not going to get involved in matters of religion , at all
this is not to say that i disapprove of any " cultural " days off , or even simply pragmatic decisions
for example , in some school districts in ny , 60 % of the students were absent on chinese new year
the new york state legislature authorized local districts to call off school that day , as a practical approach to empty chairs
further , it did not improperly send a message that certain religions were valued over others
i see no problem with kids taking religious days off , if their family 's beliefs require them to
schools can accommodate that kind of thing as easily as they can accommodate kids who get stuck home with the flu
i do n't have a problem with even teaching about different religions ; in fact , i support doing so
but what blasio did here was wrong
montgomery county , maryland , officials handled it the right way ; they removed all mention of religious holidays on their 2015 - 16 school calendar , including rosh hashana and christmas
those days are simply " days off " as far as the government is concerned
myself , i intend to continue to observe the day of the dude every year by takin ' er easy for all you sinners
i do n't expect you to -- and as much as i would like the government to mandate that we all do so every march 6 , that would simply rot the lemon , so to speak .
