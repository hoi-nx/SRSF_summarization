the first five years i did nât do much with my life
it was pretty much spent inside the prison
i pretty much woke up every morning , i did some sport , i ate , i waited ( until ) lockdown
i woke up the next day and repeated again , ' news.com.au reported him as saying

i pretty much did that for five years , ' sukumaran says

slowly slowly it helped me with my life
it helped me be productive
i started learning and i was able to help other people learning

andrew chan is now a pastor
he has got a theology degree
