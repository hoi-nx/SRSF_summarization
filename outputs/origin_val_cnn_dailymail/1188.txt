michael brown 's death sparked global outrage and debates over racial equality the findings come three months after a grand jury refused to indict officer wilson over the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager michael brown on august 9 last year
michael brown was spotted by wilson after a robbery at a nearby convenience store

blacks accounted for 86 per cent of traffic stops in 2013 - despite the fact they only made up 63 per cent of the population , data published by the missouri attorney general revealed
once they were stopped they were twice as likely to be searched
