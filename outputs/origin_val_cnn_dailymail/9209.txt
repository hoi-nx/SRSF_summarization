atheists are the latest group that controversial duck dynasty patriarch robertson has decided to train in his cross hairs
at a florida prayer meeting last week , the 68 - year - old used a very graphic and brutal story about murder , castration and child rape to explain the inherent problems with non-believers
in his lucrative second career as a christian speaker , robertson used the hypothetical situation to illustrate whether or those who do n't believe in god can know right from wrong
scroll down to listen controversial : robertson has developed a second career speaking at christian events ( seen here at one prior to his speech in florida on friday ) the story begins with robertson challenging his audience to make a bet with him : ' two guys break into an atheist 's home
he has a little atheist wife and two little atheist daughters
two guys break into his home and tie him up in a chair and gag him
' with the unsettling scene set , robertson carried on with his morality tale
' then they take his two daughters in front of him and rape both of them and then shoot them , and they take his wife and then decapitate her head off in front of him and then they can look at him and say , ' is n't it great that i do n't have to worry about being judged ? is n't it great that there 's nothing wrong with this ? '' robertson said
' there 's no right or wrong , now , is it dude ? '' to finish off his point and leave his audience in no doubt about his point , robertson then took relish in describing a castration
' then you take a sharp knife and take his manhood and hold it in front of him and say , ' would n't it be something if there was something wrong with this ? but you 're the one who says there is no god , there 's no right , there 's no wrong , so we 're just having fun
we 're sick in the head , have a nice day
' outspoken : duck dynasty 's robertson ( pictured here in maryland in february ) made another controversial speech in florida on friday to finish off his modern - day parable , robertson then said , ' if it happened to them , they probably would say , ' something about this just ai n't right
' this of course is just the latest in a long ling of controversial comments the duck dynasty star has made
in 2013 during a gq interview he likened homosexuality to bestiality and adultery and also said that black people were happier before the civil rights movement
in response to the speech , the friendly atheist blog said that robertson probably does n't know any atheists and therefore is unqualified to make his damning assessment
' i do n't know a single atheist or agnostic who thinks that terrorizing , raping , torturing , mutilating , and killing people is remotely ok , and i frankly think that robertson does n't either , ' wrote the blog .
