' zlatan ibrahimovic 's comments towards jaffredo come less than a week after he was sent off in his side 's champions league victory over chelsea and accused the blues ' players of acting like ' babies ' after they surrounded referee kuipers
zlatan ibrahimovic had previously accused chelsea of acting like ' babies ' during their champions league defeat injured team - mate serge aurier faces uefa disciplinary action after labelling kuipers a ' dirty son of a bitch ' in a video posted on facebook , and the two incidents prompted a response from french 's elite referees organisation safe ( syndicat des arbitres du safe )
an open letter from safe president stephane lannoy on the organisation 's website read : ' we thought we had seen a peak in media outcry after chelsea - psg
we thought we had heard everything
but no. ' sunday night , for a back - pass , we had a new outburst of hatred and verbal abuse

' after mr kuipers on wednesday ( from what country ... ? ) , mr jaffredo on sunday - and ultimately , as the cup was not yet full , the whole of french
' the letter concluded : ' it is time to realise we can not say anything , do anything and accept anything
it is high time that finally , in football , everyone recognises the status of the referee and accepts and respects it

the national front leader told france info radio : ' those who consider that french is a s * * * country can leave it
it 's as simple as that
