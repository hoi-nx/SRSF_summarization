a native american language school for grades 6 - 12 will open in north carolina in a bid to keep cherokee culture alive
according to locals , cherokee is teetering on the brink of extinction with only 300 native speakers left in the state
the southern association of colleges and schools accredited the new division of kituwah academy in january
the school has been operating since 2004 but up until now only taken students from early childhood through fifth grade
continuing studies : a native american language school for grades 6 - 12 will open in north carolina in a bid to keep cherokee culture alive - the kituwah academy has only been open to young students up until now from their earliest years , children learn only in cherokee at the facility
only in the higher grades is english introduced , mostly as a bow to parents concerned about what happens after their children leave the school
cherokee had no writing system until the early 1800s , when the renowned silversmith sequoya wrote a syllabary to put its sounds on paper
while english has one symbol for every letter , cherokee has one symbol for each of its 80 - plus syllables
unlike many other languages , which focus on nouns and adjectives , cherokee focuses on verbs
one verb can reveal how many people are talking , what they 're doing and how near they are
the near demise of the language came largely thanks to the u.s. government
written words : this chart shows the cherokee alphabet - there are now fewer than 300 native cherokee speakers remaining in north carolina learning process : cherokee tribe member haley smith , 11 , works on an english assignment at kituwah academy in cherokee cherokee were forced to make a brutal march from the southeast to oklahoma in the 1830s
a few stayed behind , keeping a desperate grip on their way of life
then , beginning in the late 1800s , officials set up boarding schools to eradicate the american indian languages
teachers punished students for speaking their native tongues
without new kituwah or something like it , ' the cherokee language will for sure die , ' said walt wolfram , director of the north carolina language and life project at n.c. state university
' lots of people remain skeptical about whether languages can be revived
but the [ other ] option is certain death
in that sense , kituwah academy is the only antidote for what will be inevitable
' new new kituwah is one part of the eastern band 's effort to preserve the language , said annette clapsaddle , director of the cherokee preservation foundation , which has given almost $ 2 million to the school

the cherokee nation in oklahoma opened the cherokee immersion charter school in 2002 , said julie hubbard , a spokeswoman for cherokees there
students start at age three and go through eighth grade , when they can transfer to a public school or to sequoyah high school , where the cherokee immersion students study together , she said
new kituwah - which has about 90 students - has had problems finding teachers fluent in cherokee
most native speakers are in their 60s and 70s and struggle with health issues , school administrators said .
