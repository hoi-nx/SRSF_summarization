with bbq season on the horizon , bell peppers are set to come into their own
but slicing and dicing the colorful fruit for kebabs or salads can sometimes prove troublesome with hundreds of tiny seeds to wrestle with
however , thanks to a new ' life hack ' video from youtube user rumble viral , a pepper is opened up in a matter of seconds without disrupting any of the pips
first the pepper 's top and bottoms are sliced off before the remaining body is cut through on one side
this cuts out the heart of the pepper with all of the seeds included
so that no piece is wasted , the green stalk is popped out of the top of the pepper with the chef pushing it through with his fingers
to finish , the body of the pepper is cut into strips then the batons are turned the other way and diced into squares
the top and bottom parts of the pepper are chopped in a similar fashion
the whole process takes just under one minute
