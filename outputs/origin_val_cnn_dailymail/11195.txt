an oil painting has been proven to be one of monet 's - after scientists discovered the artist painted over his own signature
the 1891 painting , titled ' a haystack in the evening sun ' , was largely unknown and its origin had never been verified
but a team of researchers from the university of jyvã¤skylã¤ in finland painstakingly unearthed the signature
it is thought to be part of a wider series by monet with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season
the painting was verified after a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work
this allowed researchers to see different layers including a previous signature by monet
it is thought to be part of a wider series by monet ( above ) with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season ilkka pã¶lã¶nen , a researcher , said the camera scans one ' line ' at a time
he told artdaily : ' when the camera is moved using the scanner an image of the whole picture can be obtained
' the fine arts foundation said the artwork is the first monet painting to be held in a finland public collection
the other paintings from the series are held at various galleries including the art institute of chicago , the national gallery of scotland and the j. paul getty museum in california
x-ray fluorescence ( xrf ) is a non-destructive technique , which can identify the presence of certain pigments
it was first used in the 1940s and applied to paintings in the 1950s
the technique involves bombarding the artwork with x-rays so powerful that they cause atoms in the picture âs layers to emit â florescent â x-rays of their own
xrf can be used to identify the colours of hidden paintings or to see earlier versions of famous pieces
by mapping the x-rays of copper , for blue and green , iron , for yellow , orange and brown , and mercury , for red , scientists can see full - colour ' maps ' of previous versions
in this case a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work
this allowed researchers to see different layers including a previous signature - verifying that the painting was by monet .
