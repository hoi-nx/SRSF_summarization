a leaked internal email written by a casting agent at american apparel said that from now on they 'll only be hiring ' real models â and not â instagram hoes or thots ' in an attempt to rebrand their image
former ceo dov charney who created the concept behind the company 's diverse ads was fired last year following the brand 's willful misconduct claims that he ' acted inappropriately ' and ' harassed employees
' the new york post obtained the the email written on march 18 by model caster luon that read , ' â [ the ] company is going through a rebranding image , so we will be shooting models moving forward
' leaked email : a leaked email written by model casting agent luon said the company would only be hiring ' real models ' not ' instagram hoes ' ' real models
not instagram hoes or thots , ' he continued in the email meant for employee eyes only
thots is an acronym for the saying , ' that ho over there
' after the email surfaced , luon replied with an apology for what he wrote and said it ' was just an inappropriate off colour joke that was not intended to defame the clients name or philosophy / views in anyway , â reports news.com.au
news.com.au also reported that just last week , american apparel âs new senior vice president of marketing , cynthia erland , allegedly told employees that they would not hire models who were ' too short and round , ' three sources who were at the meeting told news.com.au
â it âs become a running joke around the office â like , " i ca nât do this , i âm too short and round , ' said one employee who alleges they heard heard the remark
' i âve never felt marginalised or unattractive working for this company until his past week or so , ' that employee added
real women : american apparel has been known to accept model submissions from around the globe and have featured models of all shapes and all sizes erland responded tonews.com.au in a statement that said , ' this is completely false
american apparel embraces body types of all shapes , ethnicities and sizes , and our model casting has and will continue to reflect this
' american apparel is notorious for their ads of scantily clad ' amateur models ' of all sizes and the company was known to accept model submissions from ' real women ' around the globe
despite the company 's public attempt to distance themselves from their old image , the american apparel website still says nothing about their desire to use more conventional models
â we find our models all over the world , through online submissions , word of mouth , and in retail stores , where we 've been known to do an impromptu test shoot or two
our ads have always been indicative of a time and place in american apparel 's identity , which has evolved into a 12,000 employee worldwide collaboration
explore the online ad archives for a closer look at our ads featuring models , factory inner - workings and the global vernacular that inspires us , â the website states
one rebranding change made obvious on the website last week is the company âs choice to airbrush out some of the models ' exposed nipples and body hair making them look more like plastic mannequins
nip no nip : the model on the left in see through white lingerie once had her nipples and pubic hair in full display more like the model in the back lingerie on the right animal first reported that the changes could be seen on the company 's lingerie page in the ' new ' section and a brunette model in translucent lingerie who once had more showing was edited to be much less exposed
dov charney 's replacement ceo schneider has said she is attempting to make the brand ' relevant to millennials ' without it bordering on ' pornographic
' ' this is an edgy brand and it âs always going to be an edgy brand , and it âs about social commentary , it âs about gay rights , and it âs about immigration reform
it âs about the things millennials care about , ' schneider told the new york times in january
while many may welcome the company 's attempt to shave away their previous image , some activists think showing nipple is perfectly fine and empowers women in what otherwise may be a mannequin 's world
lytle , co-founder of the nipple printed bikini line tata top thinks that by censoring women and making them look like mannequins or dolls , the company is actually taking power away from women who should not feel ashamed of their bodies
fired : former ceo dov charney was fired after the company accused him of willful misconduct lytle told animal that american apparel has tried to reach out to diverse audiences by coming out with t - shirts that say ' legalize gay ' and ' legalize la ' but have very little to comment on women 's equality
' to see them taking a strong stance on those issues but not on women âs equality is disappointing , ' said lytle who runs the feminist clothing line with her partner robyn
' this is a company that is clearly trying to distance themselves from their founder , ' she continued
' it âs kind of laughable for them to think that removing nipples from their images of their sheer lingerie is the best way to do this considering their questionable ad choices in recent years
this is a step in the wrong direction and is contributing to the sexualisation of a woman âs body at a time where there is a large and growing movement for equality
' the clothing company has a tab on their website dedicated to political activism and they offer a stance on gay rights and immigration reform
' as a company , we have certain resources that individual activists do not
we try to use that special ability to support political causes that need help
american apparel regularly uses its billboards , advertisements , press contacts and even printed t - shirts to speak out about important issues
our two biggest issues have been immigration reform and gay rights , ' says their website
the company 's female ceo has yet to comment on women 's sexuality and empowerment and the company 's choice to airbrush out nipples and pubic hair
the models of american apparel may soon have a new look altogether as the company attempts to truncate their old image .
