a new comres opinion poll for itv news looked at voting in 40 labour - held seats in scotland
it found that the snp is backed by 43 per cent of voters in the seats , up from 18.9 per cent in 2010 the snp insists it can end the shared ' ideological commitment to austerity ' of both the conservatives and labour if enough of its mps are elected to westminster
snp deputy leader hosie said mps from his party would work together with ' allies from across the uk ' such as the greens and plaid cymru to achieve this as he argued swapping the current conservative - led government for a labour one would not see a major shift in policy
he said : ' westminster 's obsession with austerity is holding back scotland 's economy and damaging communities across the country - pushing 100,000 more children in scotland into poverty and seeing a 400 per cent increase in people forced to rely on food banks
' austerity is failing on every level and people are crying out for a real alternative
' the tory are determined to ignore the fact that their austerity policies have failed even by their own standards - and , despite claims made in recent days , labour ca n't hide the fact that they have shamefully backed george osborne 's plans for a further Â£ 30 billion of cuts
' that both these parties are wedded to the same austerity agenda while supporting spending Â£ 100 billion on a new generations of weapons of mass destruction is n't just economically illiterate - it is morally indefensible
' mr hosie added : ' under the snp plans set out by nicola sturgeon , we could see a modest increase in public spending , allowing us to protect our nhs budget , invest in education and childcare , and create more job opportunities for our young people
' a strong team of snp mps working with progressive allies from across the uk will put an end to the ideological commitment to austerity of both the tory and labour leaderships - delivering real support for businesses , protecting our public services and creating more opportunities for our young people
