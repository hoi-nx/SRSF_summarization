the couple appear to have had some trouble in finding the right person to oversee their new ten - bedroom home on the queen âs sandringham house estate and was given to them by the monarch as a wedding present
william and kate have spent a small fortune renovating the georgian pile to their exact taste â including the building of a new garden room with a glass ceiling so they can dine under the stars
the house already has its own swimming pool , tennis court and extensive grounds
the royal couple plan to move to norfolk full time after their second child is born next month
prince george , pictured above , is set to turn two in july they had employed two of the queen âs trusted employees , amy wood and her husband , colin , to work at the mansion as housekeeper and gardener
they lived in a cottage in the grounds of the house with their five - year - old son
but earlier this month it emerged they had unexpectedly quit after less than five months to return to work for the queen at sandringham house , just two miles away
no reason has emerged for the move but it shocked locals who said : â it is the talk of the estate that they should be giving up their prestige jobs after such a short time
they appeared happy working there
â the royal couple have been desperate to find a replacement as soon as possible as they plan to move to norfolk full - time after their baby is born next month , coinciding with william âs new job as a pilot with east anglia air ambulance
now it seems they are placing their faith in the lady magazine
a spokesman for the magazine , first published in 1885 , said yesterday : â i ca n't comment on any individual advertisement , but the lady magazine has been putting households and the very best domestic staff in touch for 130 years
â princes use the lady magazine , paupers use the lady magazine , they 've even used the lady magazine in downton abbey
i would n't be the slightest bit surprised if mary poppins herself called to place an ad
â kensington palace declined to comment .
