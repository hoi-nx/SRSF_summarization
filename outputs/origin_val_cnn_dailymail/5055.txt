the costly legal standoff over julian assange took a dramatic turn yesterday when swedish prosecutors said they were prepared to question the wikileaks founder in uk
for almost three years julian assange , pictured , has been claiming asylum in london âs ecuadorian embassy to avoid extradition to swedish over rape allegations
the 43 - year - old faces arrest if he steps outside , and taxpayers have spent more than Â£ 10million on police who monitor him 24 hours a day
swedish prosecutors have offered to travel to london to question wikileaks founder julian assange swedish officials until now refused to question him in london over the allegations of rape , sexual assault and illegal coercion
but yesterday lead prosecutor ny announced that they will now travel to uk â because time is running out
under swedish law they only have until august to pursue the claims relating to sexual assault and illegal coercion
miss ny said that an interview conducted at the embassy would be of lower â quality â , but added : â now that time is of the essence , i have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies
â her team will also seek a dna swab
julian assange , who is currently holed up in the ecuadorian embassy , is wanted for questioning in swedish over sexual assault allegations today one of the australian 's lawyers welcomed the offer by swedish prosecutors to travel to the uk and said it was likely their offer would be accepted
' this is something we 've demanded for over four years , ' said per samuelson
' julian assange wants to be interviewed so he can be exonerated
so of course we welcome this
' however , julian assange may stay in the embassy for another five years until the more serious allegation of rape also expires in swedish law
by then the bill for scotland yard âs sentry duty would be around Â£ 30million
julian assange âs spokesman hrafnsson has repeatedly said that the activist â who denies the accusations â has no intention of turning himself in
yesterday , mr hrafnsson called the offer by swedish prosecutors â a victory for julian assange â , but insisted the delay had been â absolutely outrageous â
he said : ' i assume this is because it is extremely likely that julian assange will win a case in the supreme court in swedish , determining that the arrest warrant be dropped
julian assange 's lawyers welcome the move by the swedish prosecutors to travel to london to quiz him the surveillance operation outside the ecuadorian embassy has so far cost the uk taxpayers Â£ 10million ' the court has recently announced it will hear the case , and it is quite obvious it will rule in julian assange 's favour
' mr hrafnsson said the swedish prosecutor had ' done nothing ' to move the case forward for years
julian assange has been fighting extradition to swedish since it issued a warrant for his arrest in august 2010
two years later he was granted political asylum by ecuadorian
he believes that if he goes to swedish , he will be extradited to the us and questioned over classified state documents that were published by wikileaks
last month stephen greenhalgh , london deputy mayor for policing , said the cost of guarding the embassy was â eye - watering â
police have been station outside the embassy building in knightsbridge round the clock since julian assange arrived in june 2012
he has been granted asylum by the government of ecuadorian but can not travel there because he will be arrested first
in that time he has given a series of speeches from the balcony of the building and ' attended ' conferences around the world by video message .
