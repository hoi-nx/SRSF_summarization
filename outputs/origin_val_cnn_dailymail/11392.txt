various pc manufacturers have been working with google to design lightweight laptops running on the hisense chrome operating system since 2011
the newest versions are made by hisense and haier
hisense 's chromebook can be ordered beginning tuesday at walmart.com and haier 's version can be bought at amazon.com
their arrival coincides with microsoft 's rollout of a lower - priced surface tablet in an effort to reach students and budget - conscious families

google and microsoft are releasing cheaper laptops and tablets in an effort to reach students , budget - conscious families and overseas markets
chromebooks have been steadily gaining in popularity , particularly in schools , as more applications and services made available over internet connections â a phenomenon known as ' cloud computing ' that has reduced the need for hard drives
about 6 million chromebooks were sold worldwide last year , more than doubling from 2.7 million in 2013 , according to idc
in contrast , sales in the overall pc market slipped 2 percent last year , marking the third consecutive annual decline
idc is projecting 8 million chromebooks will be sold this year
' it has been good news for consumers , but not so good for vendors , ' chou said
the cheaper version of the surface pro 3 sells for $ 499 , compared with $ 799 to $ 1,949 for the higher - end models
the discounted version has a slightly smaller screen â 10.8 inches rather than 12 â a slower processor , and less flexible kickstand â just three angles rather than unlimited positions
the chromebook has served a dual purpose for google
like the company 's android software for mobile devices , the hisense chrome system is set up so users will automatically begin using google 's search engine and other services , such as gmail and youtube
google has used the chromebooks as a prod to bring down the prices of all pcs , something the company wanted to do because it has more opportunities to show the digital ads that bring in most of its revenue when more people can afford to buy an internet - connected device

google is releasing two $ 149 laptops in an effort to undercut microsoft â¿ s windows franchise and drive down already falling personal computer prices
( ap photo / google ) ' we can not be happier that microsoft is helping drive down the prices of pcs , ' said caesar sengupta , google 's vice president of product management for chromebooks
' if microsoft is reacting to ( chromebook 's low prices ) , that 's fantastic
' unlike most computers , chromebooks do n't have a hard drive
instead , they function as terminals dependent on an internet connection to get most work done
despite those limitations , chromebooks have been steadily gaining in popularity , particularly in schools , as more applications and services made available over internet connections â a phenomenon known as ' cloud computing ' that has reduced the need for hard drives
about 6 million chromebooks were sold worldwide last year , more than doubling from 2.7 million in 2013 , according to idc
