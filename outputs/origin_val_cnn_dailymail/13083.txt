a 17 - year - old male fatally shot an iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new united states hometown , targeting him and then continuing to fire as the immigrant rushed to get inside , dallas police said friday
authorities do n't believe the suspected shooter knew the victim , al-jumaili , dallas police maj. cotner said reporters , nor do they believe he knew al-jumaili 's ethnicity
and they have n't given any indication al-jumaili had anything to do with what led the teen to head out armed in the first place -- a purported shooting at his girlfriend 's apartment , if that in fact happened
cotner said that , while there have nearby shootings that might be tied to gangs , " we ( have been ) unable to substantiate ... whether or not there was an actual shooting at the apartment
" what police do believe , based on witness testimony and other evidence , is that the teenager shot and killed al-jumaili , for whatever reason
" when he saw mr. al-jumaili and their family , he targeted them , he shot at them with intent , " cotner said of the suspect , who is under arrest
" and as mr. al-jumaili ran back toward his apartment , he tracked him with his rifle and continued to fire
" dallas police named the suspected shooter , though cnn is not identifying him yet since he 's a minor and it 's not clear if he 'll be charged as an adult
the teen turns 18 in may , police said
until the fatal shots ended al-jumalli 's life , march 4 had been a day of fun and joy for al-jumaili and his family
the 36 - year - old , who had immigrated to the united states 20 days earlier , joined his brother and wife taking pictures in the parking lot of a dallas apartment complex amid the snow
" just like all of us , a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us , " cotner said
then came the gunshots and al-jumaili 's cry , " i 'm hit ! " a few hours later , the iraqi immigrant was dead
three days later , a dallas detective found surveillance footage from a nearby elementary school showing four people coming from the apartment complex
the black - and - white soundless surveillance video shows one person apparently carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person seemingly carrying a hand gun , dallas police officer monica cordova said
approximately 13 seconds later , another person comes into view and passes by the camera , followed by a fourth individual who is walking , she said
then , on tuesday , a witness walked into the richardson , texas , police station and provided a nickname of a possible suspect -- kaca
that nickname eventually led to the 17 - year - old police believe shot al-jumaili
investigators interviewed him for the first time thursday , at which time he denied ever leaving his girlfriend 's apartment
then , authorities got the ok to search his apartment and found an unfired rifle cartridge , cotner said
the teen was brought to dallas police headquarters for another interview , and he changed his story
yes , he had been at the scene of al-jumaili 's killing
but no , he had n't done it
yet that 's not what someone who 'd been with him said
according to cotner , this witness said he saw al-jumaili taking pictures in the snow , " the witness stated that he observed ( the suspect ) raise the rifle , " the police major said
" ... the witness then heard one shot , followed by several more
" then all of them bolted
the incident caused waves in dallas ' muslims community
while police have n't given any indication this was a hate crime , though alia salem -- executive director of the council on american-islamic relations in the dallas and fort worth area -- noted " a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against muslims
" speaking friday on behalf of al-jumaili 's family , salem expressed gratitude to police and others for their work on the case and said " our community has been at a loss for words and very saddened by this tragic death
" " we just want to see justice happen here , " she said
" and this is the first step in that
