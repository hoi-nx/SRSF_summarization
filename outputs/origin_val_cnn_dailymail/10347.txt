guests got their money 's worth when a herd of elephants appeared out of the bush to drink out of a private swimming pool on the exclusive phinda private game reserve in kwazulu-natal , south africa
more than 60 of the beautiful creatures decided to make use of the resort 's pool , taking turns to drink from it three at a time
rangers and visitors at the resort were treated to a very up - close view of the wild animals as specialist guide mark lautenbach snapped these amazing pictures
he said that the elephants had initially arrived to use a nearby waterhole , but soon turned their attention to the lodge
' this morning after a rather quiet game drive i had breakfast with the guests and headed off to a rangers meeting in the south of the reserve , ' he wrote online
' the lodge i work at - the homestead - has a beautiful open plan deck , small gym with two rooms on either side and a pool on the deck overlooking a small waterhole
' while i was away something spectacular occurred and i was fortunate enough to return just in time to get some photos
' although there is thick woodland surrounding the waterhole , several herds emerged to go to a nearby waterhole - which was all mud the elephants had initially arrived to use a nearby waterhole , but soon turned their attention to the lodge and its sprawling pool ' the view from the lodge is rather open with thick woodland beyond the waterhole , but at around 11 o'clock that morning a herd of elephants emerged from the woodlands and came to drink at the waterhole - a usual but privileged site for guests at homestead , ' he added
' what we did n't expect was that right behind them another herd arrived , and then another and then another
' they all went to the small waterhole which had now been depleted at a rapid rate and found there to be just mud
elephants can drink up to 100 litres of water a day on average and its estimated that these herds drank about 6,000 litres in one sitting ' instead of moving off to find water elsewhere , they had a mud wallow then turned their attention to the lodge swimming pool
' by the time i had arrived there were over 60 elephants all around the lodge drinking from the swimming pool two or three at a time
' they did not have the decency to drink first before wallowing in the mud , turning the water muddy brown before finishing over half the pool water
' the herd spent over three hours drinking , wallowing and socialising around the lodge before disappearing back into the bush experienced guide mark lautenbach who has worked on the reserve for eight years , was on hand to photograph the amazing sight ' elephants can drink up to 100 litres of water a day on average , ' mark lautenbach explained
' with easily over 60 elephants all helping themselves to the fresh blue waters of homestead pool , they must have dank over 6,000 litres of water in one sitting
' apparently , the elephant herds spent around three hours drinking , wallowing and socialising around the lodge before disappearing back into the bush
he said : ' i can not say it was as if they were never here
' it looked like a thailand beach party after a full moon with piles of stinky , half - digested dung littered all over the front of the lodge and a few bucket scoops of dirty mud water at the bottom of the pool
' the deck was splattered with mud and the grass flattened to the ground
