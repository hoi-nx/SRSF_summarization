annie power âs last hurdle fall in tuesday âs olbg mares â hurdle has been described as the fall that saved the bookmaking industry a Â£ 40million payout by a ladbrokes spokesman
a loss out on scale similar to that when frankie dettori went through the card with seven winners at ascot in 1996 looked on the cards as punters piled cash won on the first three winners of the day trained in ireland by willie mullins â douvan , un de sceaux and champion hurdle winner faugheen â on to 1 - 2 favourite annie power
she was well clear and heading to victory before she hit the deck with jockey walsh
thankfully , both annie power and walsh emerged seemingly none the worse
l'unique was another faller , but also got up

david williams of ladbrokes said : ' had annie power won we were facing up to the worse day âs betting in our history
we were looking at a pay - out in the region of Â£ 50m
â we estimate the industry loss is still Â£ 10m but we have dodged the most expensive betting bullet ever
it has turned out to be a bad day at the office rather than an horrendous one
