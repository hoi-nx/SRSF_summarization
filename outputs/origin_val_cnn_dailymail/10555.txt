david cameron has complained about the ' buggeration factor ' of trying to push policies through whitehall
the prime minister used the colourful phrase as he expressed frustration with the civil service 's processes of consultations and reviews
the word buggeration is defined by the urban dictionary as a term ' used to describe a feeling of absolute c * * * but with a hint of light - hearted optimism '
mr david cameron 's remarks echoed blair 's famous phrase about the ' scars on my back ' when he spoke about the difficulties of nhs and education reform
in an interview with the financial times , the prime minister insisted the conservatives needed another term in power to restore the country 's economic fortunes
' the first thing is finish the job , ' he said
' with a five per cent budget deficit and still too many people unemployed , with growth that has n't worked its way through so everyone feels the benefits , the job is n't done
' the ambition is for british to be the best place in europe to start , grow and run a business , schools where we are not lagging in the tables but we 're absolutely busting through the top , a welfare system where it pays to work , where you 're always better off in work
' and from this a sense that the values of the country will have changed to be ones where people feel deep national pride
' mr david cameron said kenneth clarke , the former chancellor of the exchequer , was crucial in maintaining cabinet support for austerity measures over the last five years
' he sat round the cabinet table and said , look , this is going to take longer than you think , stick with it â there 's no alternative package
' apart from presiding over a recovery led by the private sector mr david cameron says he hoped to be remembered as the prime minister who resolved two key questions facing british
history : the pm 's remarks echoed blair 's famous ' scars on my back ' phrase about difficulties of nhs and education reform but mr david cameron said that sounded ' a bit fifty shades of grey ' ' one is , does the british want to stay together ? yes
secondly , does the british want to stay in a reformed eu ? yes , ' he said
mr david cameron said his pledge to hold an eu referendum would mar ' the moment when british stops sleepwalking towards the exit '
' i think that 's what 's happening now
the british public can see what 's happening : europe is changing before their eyes and they have n't been asked about it , ' he said
he conceded some conservatives would ' vote to leave altogether ' whatever deal he strikes with brussels on a looser , more trade - based relationship
but he added : ' i think there can be a coming together after that
' mr david cameron sought to dismiss speculation that if reelected , he intends to stand down in 2018 after holding the referendum
' i 'm standing for a full term and that is what i want to serve , ' he said .
