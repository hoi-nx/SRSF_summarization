republican presidential hopeful bush already has so much capaign cash in a super pac that supports him has reportedly asked his biggest donors to limit themselves to giving $ 1 million each
at least during the current fundraising quarter that ends march 31
insiders told the washington post that bush is telling his super-wealthy supporters to put a cap for the moment on the high - dollar checks they write to his right to rise super pac
super pacs can collect unlimited money from individuals and corporations , and spend it to support candidates , as long as there 's no ' coordination ' with their campaigns when the spending happens
bush reportedly met with a group of powerful financiers in new york in the final days before he decided to launch the pac
the perception that 2012 republican presidential nominee romney was a detached , wealthy candidate who identified most with americans 's ' 1 per cent ' was among the factors leading to his defeat
the pac 's first campaign finance report is due to the federal election commission on april 15 , and the story it tells may determine whether bush 's expected candidacy is plagued with similar accusations
bush is expected to turn in a report showing tens of millions of dollars collected
almost no one else in the potential republican field is thought to have the capacity to match his fundraising juggernaut
new york real estate tycoon trump is one exception
his own wealth could fund a super pac independently , but a trump aide has told daily mail online that he would embrace a retail campaigning strategy as well
' this campaign is about much more than money , â republican fundraiser howard leach told the washington post
' they need substantial funds , but they do nât want the focus to be on money
' bush spokeswoman kristy campbell did not immediately respond to a request for comment , and declined to offer a statement to the washington post
the washington post noted that some of the $ 1 million donors are likely to becoe repeat contributors once bush 's campaign is formally launched
big names bush has visited on fundraising swings include las vegas casino legend steve wynn
he 's in the middle of an aggressive national criss - cross designed to bulk up his campaign cofferd in what his aides have described as a ' shock and awe ' campaign
its success could discourage others with less access to big money from running against him

bush 's effort could dwarf that
but casino money has gotten at least one republican presidential candidate in trouble before
in 2012 former house speaker newt gingrich got a public black eye because of a $ 15 million cash infusion from gambling titan sheldon adelson
in that same year , the washington post notes , former pennsylvania sen. santorum benefited from large donations made by investor foster friess
santorum is expected to run again in 2016
the bush circle 's caution to their richest contacts ' shows they are disciplined and appreciate that the dominance of a few key people early on is not a productive thing for the campaign or for bush , ' republcian fundraiser rick hohlt told the washington post .
