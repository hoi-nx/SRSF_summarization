biohacking has brought us the ' frankenburger ' and vegan cheese but the latest developments could lead to cultured designer fragrances
experts in boston are developing a perfume that smells exactly like roses but is made from genetically engineered strains of yeast
they hope to use the technology to create a range of perfumes that even the most discerning customer wo n't be able to tell apart from the real thing
experts in boston are developing a perfume that smells exactly like roses but is made from genetically engineered strains of yeast
they hope to use the technology to create a range of designer perfumes that even the most discerning customer wo n't be able to tell apart form the real thing the plans were revealed to aviva rutkin at new scientist by bioengineers from gingko bioworks
rose oil used in perfume is typically harvested from large fields of the flowers planted across europe
but because these crops can be affected by changes in weather or natural disasters the yield can vary wildly , which has led to perfumers searching for artificial alternatives
to make the cultured fragrance as close to the real thing as possible , the bioengineers at gingko bioworks coded the genes of the rose to discover which enzymes are responsible for producing its smell

from these enzymes the experts can identify specific chemical compounds involved in the odour
they then modify the genome of yeast to engineer multiple strains of the fungus which each produce different metabolic reactions
the key is to engineer reactions between microbes that create the compounds found the scent of a rose

the key is to engineer reactions between microbes that create the same compounds found in the scent of a rose
and the firm told ms rutkin that this can involve adding genes from a rose or other plant to the yeast 's genome to force these reactions
the boston - based firm is working with flavours and fragrance company robertet and sends samples of each stage to the french firm for analysis and feedback
the goal is to create a designer fragrance that can be created in bulk and sold to consumers
gingko is also working on other fragrances as well as cultured flavours and sweeteners
' we 're working on a number of cultured flowers where the scent of the wild flower is difficult or impossible to capture through traditional extraction - such as lily of the valley and hyacinth , ' jason kelly from gingko bioworks told mailonline
' these flowers smell wonderful when growing on the plant but the extracted floral oil does n't capture the scent
' perfumers would love to bring these novel scents to life in perfumes and using ginkgo 's technology to design cultured fragrances we hope to grant their wish
' ' the natural next step in the evolution of cultured foods is the advent of cultured ingredients , ' added gingko bioworks 's reshma shetty
' aroma chemicals that previously were made via extraction from plants or synthetic chemistry can now be made via fermentation
' the mechanics of the process of making cultured ingredients is much the same as those used for thousands of years of cultured food production : the raw material ( often sugar ) is converted to the desired ingredient using microbes as processing aid
' in 2013 netherlands scientists grew â cultured beef â in a lab using cells from a living cow
the world 's first test - tube patty was dubbed frankenburger , cost Â£ 250,000 and took three months to form

the key is to engineer reactions that create compounds found in rose scent the world 's first test - tube burger made from lab - grown meat ( pictured ) was cooked and eaten in london in august 2013
the patty was developed by professor mark post ( pictured ) of maastricht university in the netherlands and cost Â£ 250,000 to produce its creator , netherlands scientist mark post , believes it could revolutionise the food industry and help save the planet
he believes that artificial meat products could be sold in supermarkets within a decade
similar to the cultured fragrances , the burgers are created in a four - step process
in 2013 netherlands scientists grew â cultured beef â in a lab using cells from a living cow
the world 's first test - tube patty was dubbed frankenburger , cost Â£ 250,000 and took three months to form
the stem cells are cultivated in a nutrient broth , allowing them to proliferate 30-fold
next they are combined with an elastic collagen and attached to velcro ' anchor points ' in a culture dish
between the anchor points , the cells self - organise into chunks of muscle
electrical stimulation is then used to make the muscle strips contract and ' bulk up ' - the laboratory equivalent of working out in a gym
finally thousands of beef strips are minced up , together with 200 pieces of lab - grown animal fat , and moulded into a patty
around 20,000 meat strands are needed to make one 142g burger
other non-meat ingredients include salt , egg powder , and breadcrumbs
red beetroot juice and saffron are added to provide authentic beef colouring
first , stem cells - which have the power to turn into any other cell - are stripped from cow muscle , which is taken during a harmless biopsy
next , the cells are incubated in a nutrient â broth â until they multiply many times over , creating a sticky tissue
this is then bulked up through the laboratory equivalent of exercise - it is anchored to velcro and stretched
finally , 20,000 strips of the meat are minced and mixed with salt , breadcrumbs , egg powder and natural red colourants to form an edible patty
the project was backed by billionaire google founder sergey brin
professor mark post spent seven years trying to turn stem cells into meat , and was first successful with mouse burgers
he then tried to grow pork - producing strips with the rubbery texture of squid or scallops - before settling on beef
more recently , biohackers in california discovered a way to create cheese protein genes based on sequences in cow dna , before growing them in baker âs yeast and using them to create a â milk â substitute
this milk can then be churned using traditional cheese - making methods to become real vegan cheese
real vegan cheese is the brainchild of biohackers from counter culture labs and biocurious in california
the technology has already been proven on an individual scale
last year mark post , a professor of tissue engineering at maastricht university , the netherlands presented the first lab - grown hamburger to create the proteins , the researchers studied animal genomes to find natural milk - protein genetic sequences
they optimised the genes for use in yeast and created the resulting yeast milk protein dna from scratch
this dna is then put into yeast cells where the cells take over and produce real milk - protein
the genetically modified yeast creates cheese protein as it grows , and raw cheese protein is extracted and separated from the yeast
to make real vegan cheese , the researchers then take the cheese protein and combine it with the three other main cheese ingredients , including , fat , or in this case vegetable butter , vegan sugar in place of lactose , and water
mixing these creates the vegan milk , which can then be then turned into cheese
although the genes are inspired by the genetic sequencing of mammals , they are actually made from scratch
