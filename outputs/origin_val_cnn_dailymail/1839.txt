it is a secretive nation that is not known for its open and transparent nature
but french photographer eric lafforgue was among the first visitors to be allowed to visit the north korea fishing village of jung pyong ri - a model community so remote it is not located on any maps
the rural outpost is part of a project to create homestays for tourists , allowing them a glimpse of life in north korea , albeit a very sanitised version of reality
photographer eric lafforgue experienced life in the beautiful north korea fishing village of jung pyong ri , which is opening the doors for tourists to witness rural life he stayed in a well - kept homestay , home of the chief of the village
there are only 23 families in the area , which is so remote it is not located on a map the decor inside included an assortment of plush toys , plants , coloured mats and photographs of the country 's leaders the village is open for homestays and is a far cry from the poverty surrounding it , with its air conditioned facilities and houses equipped with three televisions
described by eric lafforgue as an airbnb - style local property that tourists can visit , he also admits the conditions of a stay can be somewhat restrictive
eric lafforgue explains that the fleeting view from the bus windows is very different to what he finds at the homestay
he explains : ' the roads on the east coast are very muddy and filled with potholes that workers have tried their best to fix
' i see an electric fence lining the beach as an attempt to stall possible japanese invasion
' the poverty in these rural villages is palpable
from the comfy seat in my bus , i see old , dilapidated houses with roofs ready to collapse
' only huge murals of the smiling kim il sung bring color to these bleak landscapes
my guide informs me that most tourists do not journey this far into the countryside , and that i may be the first european to ever visit this area
' however , the journey to the village and views from the house windows reveal traces of the surrounding hardship experienced by locals
' it 's a good opportunity to show tourists a flattering image of rural life , the fragile pillar of the country 's economy , ' eric lafforgue said
' the beautiful portrayal of rural life provides the north korea government a flattering image to capitilise on
' the photographer travelled to the myongchon county , situated in the north hamgyong province , wary of what he would discover
' only 23 families resided here
immediately , i fear i 'm in a north korea tourist trap , complete with actors portraying reality
' eric lafforgue stayed with the village chief , in a well - kept house , which , although it came complete with ensuite bathrooms , had a bed consisting of a futon on the floor
each house in the village is identical
eric lafforgue describes the decor as ' kitschy ' , with huge plush toys , plastic flowers , large plant pots being watched by the propaganda portraits lining the walls
and the village is still reeling from a visit 11 years ago by kim jong il , when the community was first unveiled as a model village
the house the general entered was a two - storey building with the best view of the local sandy beach , and his visit is immortalised by a plaque above the door documenting the occasion
his visit still brings sobs to the homeowner , and she emotionally relayed the encounter to lafforgue , explaining : ' i did not know general kim jong il would come
it was a great surprise for me
' the neighbors were so jealous
as we took a picture together , which i will forever treasure , he told me the house was nice
this made me so happy , ' she said

' the village proudly remembers the occasion and said it inspired them to work harder for their leader 's country the junior suite eric lafforgue stayed in has a private bathroom complete with a toilet , which is quite a luxury in the area
the water is heated by placing an antique electrical warmer in it eric lafforgue was treated to a sumptuous meal of duck for dinner , although he learned that the village members sometimes go hungry during the winter months
american are banned from visiting , but the french photographer asked if any american arriving would be welcomed to the homestay
the smart response was : ' american are our enemies , but i would welcome them in the name of legendary north korea hospitality
' despite the built - up houses , when asked about cell phones , his question was met with confusion , and electricity only runs until 9pm daily
the village members require a permit to travel within their country , and they are kept as treasured possessions when granted
foreign tourists are hosted in the village , where locals can be seen collecting wood , flowers , and food
eric lafforgue has been banend from north korea for his photographs revealing the reality of life in the secretive country stunning location : the beautiful fishing village where tourists can experience rural life
' it 's a good opportunity to show tourists a flattering image of rural life , the fragile pillar of the country 's economy , ' eric lafforgue said as a present to the local boys eric lafforgue offered them a french football magazine
inside , they find photos of their national team and beam with excitement the chief proudly showed eric lafforgue a photograph of his son , encased in a mickey mouse frame
he is serving his army conscription , which is mandatory for between three and five years for males , and selective for females
other children in the village similarly aspire to be soldiers , with one mother stating to lafforgue her sons were destined for the army
' our main goal is to defend our country , and for that , we need soldiers , not only musicians or doctors
' eric lafforgue gathered that the area had received government funding and support to become as developed as it is today
despite being impressed by the homestay , and the stunning beaches and landscapes in the fishing village , eric lafforgue could not help but notice the poverty of the surroundings creeping in when they thought he was n't looking
' the guides wanted to hide from me the reality of this life , but from my bedroom window , i can see emaciated oxes with carts full of wood and women carrying heavy loads
i also see some girls picking flowers for a bouquet , and others picking grass in red cross bags to eat for lunch
' the photographer has been banned for his work depicting the realities of life in north korea , and had to smuggle photographs out of the country on memory cards , after his camera was confiscated
eric lafforgue spoke candidly to the chief of the village , who explained what life was like in the rural outpost , which was completely cut off from the retsof the ocuntry until the 1990s
' life is very hard in the winter and sometimes the food supply is low , ' the chief told eric lafforgue
eighty per cent of the tourists here are from china
the china , especially those from beijing , are amazed by the cleanliness of the air
' they wonder how laborers like us can afford such luxurious houses ! he continues
' i tell them that it is because the north korea regime is more successful than the american government ! ' the chief laughs
the chief also recounts the best day of his life
' it was when the great leader kim il sung visited the village
' he was already quite old at this time , and it was such a great honor to meet him
coming from a poor family , it motivated me to work harder for my leader âs country
' the chief 's son , serving in the army as a sergeant until the reunification of north and south korea
when asked when he had last spoken to his son , he was told it was a long time ago the visit of kim jong il in 2004 still brings sobs to the woman of the house who hosted him
' as we took a picture together , which i will forever treasure , he told me the house was nice
this made me so happy , ' she said soldiers walk along the sandy beaches of the fishing village which is in myongchon county , situated in the north hamgyong province north korea agriculture works under quite difficult conditions , most of north korea 's territory is occupied by mountains and is thus not arable , the little land that is left faces many problems
floods have washed away rice and corn fields in previous years , destroying a good part of the crops as is tradition in north korea , the night ended with music
two twins perform , but their guitars strings are so old that they can not be tuned.they have never heard western music , according to laffague a north korea woman collects picks grass in a red cross bags to eat for lunch
the chief stated that life is very hard in the winter and sometimes the food supply is low the guide informed eric lafforgue that most tourists do not journey this far into the countryside , and that he may be the first european to ever visit this area eric lafforgue was able to communicate with the locals thanks to the help of a guide who provided a fluid translation for conversations ' there is a disparaging difference between the attitudes of the children in metropolitan areas and those of the children in the rural areas
many wave hello and gaze at me with astonished faces , ' eric lafforgue said children are playing on the beach in the chilbo region , which is on the north east border with china
they are part of the national karate team and enjoy holidaying at the beach
a sign reading ' stop ' is shown of the tourists who visited the village , 80 % are from china , and they are amazed by the cleanliness of the air
' they wonder how labourers like us can afford such luxurious houses ! ' the chief said
' i tell them that it is because the north korea regime is more successful than the american government ! ' eric lafforgue reported on the the tourists â impact on the food supply during the winter , as the boats can not go out to sea as often a north korea girl picking a bouquet of flowers
eric lafforgue learned that until the 1990s , the area was fairly cut off from the rest of the country women pull sacks through the village
one woman stated it remained a mystery as to why foreigners would want to visit her village
she admited the community enjoys a better standard of living than the average north korea village thanks to the tourists
