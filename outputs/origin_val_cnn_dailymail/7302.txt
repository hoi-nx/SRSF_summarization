a woman has written a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways
sleep - deprived melbourne based - actor , lucy gransbury , even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics
also a comedian , gransbury used her humour in the two - page rant to get her rage across to the party - hard residents who live next door and cause her never - ending grief
gransbury posted the letter on her blog with the precursor : ' so if you never hear from me again , i 've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours ' sound system
' please turn your funking music down so i can get some funking sleep , ' the letter opened with
she then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them ' all the funking time '
' last night , like many other nights , it was at 4.30am , a time of morning that should be reserved for breakfast radio hosts , international flight passengers , and parents of infants , ' she said
she signed off with her twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just ' head towards the loud house and turn left ' lucy gransbury said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but would n't have been heard over the revving of their friend 's engine of their ' sh * thouse fancy ute
' ' they were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty , that i am worried that the man behind the wheel was : ' a ) drink driving b ) not sure how to drive c ) brain damaged d ) actually a potato
' her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar ' over and funking over
' ' i 'm not sure if it 's you , or perhaps a friend , but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling ' derpa , derpa , derpa , derpa ' at the top of his lungs
is he okay ? ' she asked sarcastically
' i have genuine concern that this man is : a ) not sure how to human b ) brain damaged c ) actually a moron
' she also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a cd she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the cd was actually blank because she was ' too funking tired ' to burn the songs lucy gransbury said she bought this card because ' shut the f * * k up ' was not available in a large size the music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before gransbury had to go out and begin her day
' everyone in my street probably feels the same
and the street behind us
and the deaf man in the next suburb
and anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away
' as the thoughtful neighbour , lucy gransbury gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a cd she compiled herself with the apt songs : respect by aretha franklin , ' wake me up ' by avicii , ' all about the bass ' by meghan trainor , ' stop right now ' by the spice girls and uptown funk ' by bruno mars ' because it 's just a funkin ' good song , really '
but she later revealed in the note that the cd was actually blank because she was ' too funking tired ' to burn the songs
after suggesting to catch up over a g&t sometime , she asked them to ' grow up
' lucy gransbury also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time
