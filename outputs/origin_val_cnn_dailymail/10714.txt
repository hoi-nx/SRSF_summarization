a washington news anchor got a real earful during a live broadcast on monday when an exotic insect got so cozy on his ear that he laid two eggs
fox 5 's bob barnard was broadcasting from the smithsonian 's museum of natural history for a story on museum week when a palm - sized african moon moth unexpectedly landed on his head
largely unfazed , bob barnard continued with his broadcast
when he was done , he discovered the the exotic bug had left behind a gift
he had no clue it had happened until after the broadcast the moth had previously caused bob barnard a bit of a tickle , which he at first appeared to believe was a bite
however , the insect zookeeper bob barnard was interviewing informed him that african moon moths do n't have mouths at all and are thus incapable of biting
their plump , green larvae , the zookeeper explained , do all the eating
the moths then live off the fat stores once they become adults
' moon moth on my ear on live tv laid two eggs ! ( yuck ) , ' bob barnard tweeted monday
big and beautiful : the african moon moth measures around 4 inches across with tail - like structures dangling majestically from its wings
the moth likely laid hundreds more eggs after the two he left behind on barnard perhaps that sensation he thought was biting was actually the moth laying her eggs
either way , the moth wo n't be around long enough to see if barnard helps raise her young
the moon moth , unable to eat , lives only a handful of days
she does , however lay hundreds of eggs -- just a few at a time -- before she dies .
