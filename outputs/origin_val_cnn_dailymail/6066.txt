the scheduled wednesday execution of a convicted cop killer that would have used up the state 's last dose of a lethal injection drug has been halted by the highest criminal appeals court in texas
the texas court of criminal appeals ruled to stop the scheduled execution of 55 - year - old mays late on monday
mays was convicted of murder after a shootout in 2007 left henderson county sheriff 's office investigator paul steven habelt and deputy tony price ogburn dead
his punishment would have used up the texas department of criminal justice 's last dose of pentobarbital
the drug is used for lethal injections and it is now difficult to obtain for capital punishment
thanks to the delay , texas has enough pentobarbital for its next scheduled execution on april 9
the state has at least three other executions on the calendar for april
mays was going to receive a lethal injection
the delay means texas ' next execution can go on as planned as a result of this order , mays ' case will be sent back to henderson county
an expert will need to determine whether he 's competent to receive the death penalty
the eighth amendment bars the execution of a person who does not understand that his execution is imminent and does not understand why he are being executed
the state believes mays was aware of the execution and why it was going to happen
texas prison officials , like those in other death penalty states , have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use
the state 's penultimate portion of pentobarbital was used in the execution of a mexican hit man who was convicted of beating and strangling a san antonio woman
vasquez killed the woman because she did n't pay a ten per cent tax on her illegal drug sales
vasquez was executed on march 11 and he was the fourth texas inmate put to death this year .
