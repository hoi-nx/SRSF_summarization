the tactics used by conservative party chairman grant to convince people to hand over cash so he could get them ' stinking , filthy rich ' have been revealed
mr grant , posing as his business guru alter - ego michael green , used online leaflets to boast of his wealth and status in a bid to prove that he knew how to make millions
using pictures of himself in his private plane and six - bedroom mansion , the future conservative party minister offered his ' friends ' the chance to learn how to make their fortune â as long as they handed him $ 197 , worth Â£ 130
the revelations come just days after mr grant , 46 , faced calls to quit after being forced to admit he had continued to offer get - rich - quick advice after becoming a conservative party mp despite vehement denials to the contrary
the conservative party minister had insisted he had not had a second job since being elected mp for welwyn hatfield in may 2005 , but was later forced to admit he had ' screwed up ' by denying the allegations ' over firmly '
it comes after a recording emerged from 2006 , a year after he was elected to parliament , capturing the mp selling self - help guide stinking rich 3 and claiming his products could make listeners a ' ton of cash '
the full extent of his toe - curling sales pitch was published in the sunday mirror today after pictures were published on the website political scrapbook
in it he offers punters the chance to buy his toolkit on ' how to become stinking rich online ' for $ 197 â even though he claimed it was worth $ 100,000
the toolkit , he claimed , would make those who bought it ' 11 to 22 times more successful than the crowd as a result '
mr grant boasted about how he made a fortune in just 30 months from his howtocorp firm and other projects
pictured in his sports car he wrote : ' that 's me ... and i 'm sitting in my brandspanking - new crossfire convertible 3.2l ' but he warned punters they would have to move fast because he had taken the ' difficult decision ' to limit supply to just 250 copies , saying : ' i will delete the webpage and the mastercopy of this toolkit '
mr grant offered his online kit to people throughout the uk and across the world from his howtocorp business based in north west london
he wrote : ' since owning an online business has enabled me to live in a $ 2m home ... to drive 3 high - end luxury cars and to own and operate my own aircraft , i suppose a toolkit that exposes every secret used to build that kind of wealth should rightfully sell for say $ 100,000

it 's one of the first dozen on the road here in the uk
' conservative party chairman grant faced calls to resign last week after admitting he had had a second job while working as an mp but he revealed he and wife belinda also own a ' wonderful elan turbo '
the car , he says , is ' complete with in - car dvd , satnav and just about every other refinement you could imagine in a vehicle
why it even has a fridge ! ' he also boasts about his lavish six - bedroom house in hertfordshire and its new extension
next to a picture of him sitting in a plane with his son , he writes : ' everyone a hobby
but buying and maintaining an aircraft ( and this is my second machine ) is n't cheap ! ' but i just hate to rent ... so i took out my pocket - book and bought a plane
that 's me and my son in the cockpit
( one of us is a three - year - old with a passion for flying : ) ' revelations about mr grant ' methods comes just days after he was branded a ' liar and a bully ' for threatening a constituents with legal action for highlighting the fact he had a second job
dean archer , 50 , said he had feared losing his family home after mr grant warned he would take him to court over a facebook post that mentioned his internet sales sideline as michael green
despite the revelations david cameron last week insisted he had full confidence in the conservative party chairman
he said : ' grant did have another job when he first became an mp and he declared that in the register of members ' interests which is what you are meant to do
' but he obviously made a mistake by saying in some interviews that the work had stopped earlier than it had
he 's put that right so i think we can put that behind him
he 's doing a good job
