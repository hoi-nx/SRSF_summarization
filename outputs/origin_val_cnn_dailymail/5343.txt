anti-police : lawyer akunjee with a woman believed to be his wife great orator , reads a glowing reference from one of lawyer akunjee âs appreciative former clients
the testimonial is included on mr akunjee âs cv on a professional networking site ; the person who wrote it is named , so it âs not made up
but the identity of the individual in question is something we shall come back to because it tells us rather a lot about this silver - tongued solicitor
in any event , mr akunjee âs skills as an â orator â , for want of a better word , have been much in evidence on the national stage recently
you might have heard mr akunjee in full flow on the radio or caught a glimpse of him on the evening news earlier this month in his ( very lawyerly ) charcoal - grey , three - piece suit and swish purple silk tie
what he had to say was certainly splashed across the papers
mr akunjee , 37 , was giving evidence to mps on the home affairs select committee with his latest clients : the families of the three girls from tower hamlets , london , who fled the british to join islamic state
mr akunjee denounced the authorities for allowing kadiza sultana , 16 , and 15 â year - olds shamima begum and amira abase to leave british and reach syria after going missing in december
he castigated the police for failing to inform their parents that a school friend had vanished in similar circumstances a few weeks earlier
and he demanded â and got â a grovelling apology from the country âs top police officer for the â mistake â that , in the eyes of most neutral observers , probably had little or no bearing on what happened to the youngsters
â relations can be built after they have broken down only after an apology , â mr akunjee insisted loftily
the audacity takes your breath away
for we now know that the father of amira abase , one of the missing schoolgirl â jihadi brides â , is himself a supporter of militant islam
images posted online show abase hussen taking part in a notorious islamist rally back in september 2012 in london , when flags of israel and the american were burned
also in attendance that day was hate preacher anjem choudary , as well as michael adebowale , one of the two muslims converts who went on to murder soldier lee rigby
abase hussen could not have found a more suitable lawyer to front the families â anti-police campaign
abase hussen ( circled right ) , whose daughter fled the british last month to join isis , was pictured at an islam protest alongside lee rigby killer michael adebowale ( circled left ) vicious : in 2012 , abase hussen ( left ) marched at the head of a violent rally held by muslims extremists in london , taking part in the burning of an american flag akunjee has gone on record in the past to declare that no muslims should co-operate with the british police force because the government âs prevent counter-terror policy is â straightforward , paid - for spying on the community â
he once asked in an internet rant : â does she [ home secretary theresa may ] have nazi blood in her veins ? â imagine the furore if someone had insulted a muslims leader in the same vein
the wider public might not have heard of mr akunjee until now but behind his self - righteous performance in the commons , behind his fancy legal credentials , behind his respectable upbringing ( his father and two younger brothers are all doctors ) , is an individual with links to what some might describe as the â who âs who â of islam extremists in british
consider , to begin with , a cartoon posted on his facebook page on january 12 , less than a week after the charlie hebdo atrocity in paris
it depicted murdered editor stephane charbonnier blowing himself up by detonating a suicide vest comprising of rolled - up copies of the magazine which resembled sticks of dynamite , the clear implication being that the journalist was to blame for his own death and those of nine colleagues for frequently publishing satires about the prophet mohammed
that message reinforced a previous facebook entry on the day of the paris attack itself
â please do nât repeatedly poke a sleeping bear , â wrote mr akunjee , â then cry when it bites â your head off , â parce que ce est vraiment tres stupide [ french for â because that is really very stupid ]
â could there be a more inappropriate way of behaving , given his profession ? mr akunjee ( right ) , 37 , gave evidence to mps on the home affairs select committee alongside mr abase hussen and his family mr akunjee âs father arrived in this country from bangladeshi in the seventies
he runs a gp surgery with his two other sons in haringey , north london
mr akunjee âs nauseating performance before mps closely echoed preposterous claims made by â human rights group â cage last week that mi5 was responsible for radicalising mohammed emwazi , the is butcher known to the world as jihadi john
just a coincidence ? unlikely
in only january , mr akunjee â surprise , surprise â shared a platform with cage when he argued that the british had a â jekyll and hyde , two - tier legal system â which was â a breeding ground for fascism â
mr akunjee said lee rigby killer adebolajo was ' created ' by the security services in an article carried on the cage website , he also claimed that the security services â created â adebolajo â who with michael adebowale killed woolwich fusilier lee rigby â by â making his life so difficult â
mr akunjee represented a close friend of adebolajo , who was sentenced to three years for terrorist offences in 2013
and who do you think the glowing testimonial mentioned in the opening paragraph of this article was from ? it was penned by someone called abbas iqbal , a former member of the so - called â blackburn resistance â
he served two years back in 2010 following the discovery in his home of gruesome beheading videos and an arsenal of weapons , including knives , machetes , a sword and ammunition
â i recommend mr t. akunjee for all muslims brothers and sisters arrested under the terrorism act , â he wrote
â he is a true and genuine friend and brother to all who meet him
â the reference is included on mr akunjee âs biography on professional networking site linkedin
they say you can judge a person by the company he keeps
might the same yardstick be extended to the company a person keeps online ? among his other facebook friends are a notorious hate preacher , a former member of banned terror group al-muhajiroun , a one - time guantanamo detainee , and , almost inevitably , asim qureshi , the leading figure in cage , the man who for years was in regular contact with jihadi john , to name but a few of mr akunjee âs unsavoury contacts
this was the man , remember , who was given a public platform in the commons
mr akunjee â as the mail has revealed in previous articles â is part of a network of extremists spreading poisonous propaganda that is turning the heads of so many young muslims
but mr akunjee , like asim qureshi , has much for which to thank the country he despises
the solicitor is also friends on facebook with asim qureshi - the leading figure in cage who was in regular contact with jihadi john we now know that the father of amira abase , one of the missing schoolgirl â jihadi brides â ( pictured ) , is himself a supporter of militant islam he studied law at two of its universities : he was an undergraduate at sussex uni and a postgraduate at westminster
he was at westminster , a college with an appalling reputation for campus radicalism , in 2007/08
mohammed emwazi / jihadi john was enrolled at westminster at that time on a computer programming course , but there is nothing to suggest they knew each other
mr akunjee , also known as mohammed tasnime akunjee , now works for waterfords solicitors in brentford , west london
radical : amira abase , 15 , daughter of abase hussen , travelled to syria with two other girls home is a victorian terrace in north london , where the curtains and blinds were drawn yesterday
but he was also recently living in a flat in a block near marble arch , where flats typically sell for more than Â£ 1 million
mr akunjee is pictured in the vicinity on facebook in the company of an attractive blonde
asked by one friend : â who is she brother ? â , he replies : â new wife
â when another friend commented that she was â without hijab â â a veil that covers the head and chest â mr akunjee informs him : â working on it
â mr akunjee âs first marriage to a law student he met at sussex uni lasted less than a year
â in bangladeshi culture , â said someone who knows the family , â it is usually the groom âs mother who finds the wife
she [ akunjee âs mother ] was not happy that he married so quickly and divorced so quickly
â but his career has gone from strength to strength
his latest case was given star billing at his law practice
the firm âs rolling twitter feed repeated three tweets ; all refer to the missing schoolgirls from tower hamlets in syria and mentioning mr akunjee as having â conduct of the case of the three girls â
how mr akunjee , who is based on the other side of london , came to be representing the families or why they should need a lawyer in the first place is not clear
however , the families â decision to effectively absolve themselves of any responsibility for the disappearance of their daughters , and scapegoat the police instead , has left them facing a backlash of criticism
senior figures , led by david cameron , insisted parents must take responsibility to help stop the spreading of militant beliefs
not in the eyes of akunjee , who once claimed that even a shop assistant who â sold a terrorist a toothbrush in boots â would be guilty of aiding and abetting terrorism under terror laws
in a recent video on an extremist youtube channel , he also denied that those who call for the death of british soldiers should be defined as extremist because â i think it is actually a soldier âs job to die â
mr akunjee âs views are shared by others in his online community
are nât they , and not the police , the ones who are really driving so many young british muslims into the hands of is ?
