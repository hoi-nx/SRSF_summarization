the nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the white horse leisure centre in abingdon , oxfordshire , saw him lurking near the women âs changing rooms and raised the alarm
andrew hutchinson was arrested in november 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre
detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone , computer , a memory stick and a camera

theft : the nurse stole this nasopharyngoscope - used for inernal examinations - and used it to film up a woman 's skirt as she visited a friend in hospital outside court , detective chief inspector mark johns from thames valley police said : â i am pleased that andrew hutchinson has pleaded guilty to his offences and spared his victims having to endure a trial to receive justice
this has been a complicated and unusual case as the victims of his sex offences were not aware that offences took place because they were not conscious
â the victims showed great courage when informed of such distressing news
i have no doubt that andrew hutchinson would have continued to offend had he not been arrested
â power , of the trust , added : â we have been shocked and horrified by the behaviour of the individual , who so badly let down both the patients he was entrusted to care for and his fellow colleagues and who totally failed in his professional duties and responsibilities as a nurse
â i would wish to reassure members of the public that the welfare and safety of our patients is always our first priority
â mr power added : â thames valley police has been conducting an extensive investigation and we have done everything possible to support this process
â since his arrest , the individual has not worked in any part of the trust and is no longer an employee of ours
