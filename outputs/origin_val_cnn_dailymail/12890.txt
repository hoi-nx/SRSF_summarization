lindsey vonn lifted her crystal globe prize with pride after winning the world cup downhill title for a seventh time , wednesday
a crystal ball might be more useful for the american star , who has faced plenty of slippery slopes in her dramatic skiing career
the 30 - year - old has twice fought back from a career - threatening right knee injury but this season she has been back to her brilliant best
at the final meeting of the ski season in the pretty french resort of meribel , vonn raced to more records on the women 's world cup tour -- a seventh downhill season title and her 18th crystal globe overall
the sparkly spheres are handed out to winners of the world cup individual disciplines
" this downhill title probably means more to me than the others because i 've been through so much , " vonn told cnn 's alpine edge
" it means everything to me , this is what i 've been working so hard for for the last two years
" this season definitely got off to a better start than i expected and i 've had some ups and downs for sure but to come away with a globe after a long season is something that i 'm really proud of , so it could n't be better for me right now , i 'm so thrilled
" vonn , who credits boyfriend tiger woods with inspiring her recovery , fended off the challenge of austria 's fenninger to claim the downhill crown by 103 points
despite the softening snow , the american won the downhill race with a fastest time of one minute , 29.87 seconds while fenninger finished off the pace in eighth
as she crossed the line , she punched the air and screamed at the crowd when she saw she was in first position
after receiving her crystal globe , she celebrated with her team by popping champagne and spraying it over her nearby supporters
vonn and fenninger will renew their rivalry thursday for the super-g title , where vonn holds an eight - point lead over her challenger
if vonn wins tomorrow she will equal swede ingemar stenmark , who owns an overall record of 19 crystal globes
" i 'm not thinking about that , " vonn insisted with a laugh
" it 's always hard to get titles - it 's a long season , and it takes a lot to win the crystal globe but tomorrow i 'm just going to be focusing on skiing my best , just as i did today
