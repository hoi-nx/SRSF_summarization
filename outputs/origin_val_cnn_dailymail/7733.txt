the bond between a handler and their k-9 can only be built over time
it 's a closeness that becomes intrinsic , with the dedication of the dog built not on money or benefit , but love
so having to say goodbye is always going to be heartbreaking
such was the sad situation faced by the sfs at joint base san antonio - lackland in texas recently , when a beloved member of their unit , daysi , had to be euthanized for an aggressive form of cancer and a malignant tumor
she had never had a handler before , and her partner with sgt. paul olmos , had never had his own dog
' daysi and paul olmos were an ideal team pairing , ' said tech. sgt. nelson , 802nd sfs kennel master
' their relationship is immense because this was their first experience as a daysi team
' paul olmos would spend all of his free time with his charge
' i 'm single and i do n't have immediate family here , so i 'd come on the weekends just to visit her and take her on runs , ' paul olmos said
' i could n't even tell you how much time we 've spent together
' together they participated in the texas toughest dog competition
however in january this year , trainers noticed something was wrong with daysi 's left leg
sick : daysi had an aggressive form of cancer and a malignant tumor and could not be operated on an initial check - up did n't show anything abnormal
however a follow - up evaluation detected a tumor
daysi 's certification was subsequently canceled and she was taken in for treatment
the tumor was found to be pushing on a nerve and causing her pain
but due to the location , doctors were unable to operate , which would cause the cancer to spread to the rest of her body
' the news of daysi 's declining health hit us hard ; this sort of news always does , ' tech. sgt. nelson said
' euthanasia of mwds is a last resort and we try to approach every option available before it comes to that , ' ' most of our dogs get adopted out or continue on with their service in a civilian police department
' final goodbye : military members line up and salute daysi as she is walked into a veterinary clinic to be put down by her partner , sgt. paul olmos on february 27 , all of those who had worked with daysi lined up outside the veterinary clinic
a police procession blared sirens that resonated throughout the base
the officers then saluted as daysi was lead into the facility to be put down
' these dogs are our brothers and sisters in arms as well , ' nelson added
while highly - emotional , no one seemed to be more affected than sgt. olmos
' through all the training we 've done together and the long 12 to14 hour days ; it was just me and her , ' he said
' she 's my partner
