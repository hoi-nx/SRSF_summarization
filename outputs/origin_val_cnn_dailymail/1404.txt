as same sex relationships become more acceptable , the more visible they are and the more we can learn about them
or should i say learn from them , since most of the research that is emerging about gay relationships suggests they can teach us straights more than a thing or two ! it âs not easy being gay and being different to the norm
but turns out there âs a huge pay off for having to fight for the right to love who you want without judgement
gay relationships appear to work better than straight relationships in lots of key ways
gay relationships work better than straight relationships in lots of key ways , says tracey cox here âs what we can learn from same sex couples : 1
they âre not hung up on male or female stereotypes of who should do what in a relationship
couples in same sex relationships do nât just slot into what âs expected
they divide up the chores and roles in their relationship on who is best at them , rather than â that âs the man âs job â or â woman âs job â
the result is they work better as a team - and there âs less resentment over silly , sexist things like secretly thinking â he should be earning more than me â or â she should be the one emptying the dishwasher â
they fight fair us relationships guru gottman , one of the world âs foremost experts on relationships , says same sex couples are far kinder and nicer to each other during arguments than straights are
they do nât personally attack each other , they âre more positive , less domineering and belligerent
same sex couples also laugh more during a row - which is the best way to remind you both that you actually like each other , even if you do nât like what one of you did or did nât do ! gottman found gay men and women were also more affectionate , listened more and were less defensive in arguments
the sexpert says it âs not easy being gay and being different to the norm , but that there âs a huge pay off for having to fight for the right to love who you want without judgement why are they so much better at it than heterosexuals ? one reason is that power is equal
there âs less bullying and less blaming of problems on gender because you do nât have set expectations of each other âs roles
in society , women are expected to be the pacifiers and men the â fixers â
but sometimes it âs women who are good at coming up with practical solutions and men who are good at soothing
same sex couples tend to let whoever is best at something take over
they âre more experimental sexually male / female sex falls into a set pattern from a very early age
usually , the guy initiates , there âs foreplay ( generally more for her than him ) and intercourse is very much the main event
lesbians , on the other hand , are much less penetration orientated and orgasm orientated : they just do whatever they feel like in that particular sex session
gay men are far more experimental with different types of sex rather than sticking rigidly to the â vanilla â , basic type of sex straight people in long - term relationships tend to have
they âre happy to show and tell lots of straight women are often too embarrassed to let their partner watch them masturbate
gay men love showing off - and watching other guys turn themselves on
they also watch carefully to see what technique they use , so they can copy it later
lesbians often have mutual masturbation sessions and consequently know a lot more about what techniques their partner likes than the average straight couple
they do nât have to deal with the in - laws meeting each other âs parents and seeing them regularly as a couple is pretty much standard for most straight couples
but not all gays are at the same point in the coming - out process and not all families are tolerant and open to gay relationships
this means less forced visits with relatives you might not necessarily get on with - which means less rows about the in - laws
they do nât get hung up on porn partners watching porn is often frowned upon and seen as threatening by women in straight relationships
gay men understand that men simply like looking at sexy things and same sex couples generally are more tolerant of each other âs differences
