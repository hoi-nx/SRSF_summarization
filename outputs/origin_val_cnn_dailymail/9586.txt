not only can mcilroy play golf better than anyone else , he can throw clubs further than anyone else as well
with perhaps the most extraordinary act of frustration we âve seen on a golf course in recent years , the northern irishman left no - one in any doubt as to what he thinks about his current erratic form
after a wild three iron plunged into the water at the par five 8th on friday , the world no 1 hurled his club 60 or 70 yards into the adjacent hazard
world no 1 mcilroy threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on friday mcilroy swings and releases his club after finding the water during the wgc-cadillac championship the northern irishman watches as his club soars into the air and towards the lake the 25 - year - old 's club makes a splash as it lands in the water on friday afternoon maybe when he âs finished breaking golfing records he will take up the javelin
of course it was conduct terribly unbecoming and will lead to an inevitable fine
but the vast majority of golfers will have recognised what was going on
â it was just heat of the moment stuff and not one of my proudest moments , â admitted mcilroy
â i âve never done anything like that before
i probably would nât have done it here but i knew i did nât need a three iron for the rest of my round
so i thought : " yeah , why not ? â â his playing partner knew exactly what was going on
stenson is a prince off the golf course but on it the swede has broken more than his fair share of clubs in anger
â it was an impressive release from mcilroy , â he said , smiling
â you know , for a small guy he âs got a strong throw and he had good speed on that one
â worried perhaps that one or two of the american press might not get the joke , he added : â be nice to him
he âs a good guy
â for those who would rather bounce up and down with righteous indignation , here âs what the great american amateur jones said almost 100 years ago : â there are some emotions that simply can not be endured with a golf club in your hands
â the game might be unrecognisable from jones âs day but in that regard it remains the same
of more concern for mcilroy followers is what it says about his current state of mind
under plan a , he âs only got six more competitive rounds at most to play before the masters , when he will be trying to complete the career grand slam
clearly , his game is not where he wants it to be but at least he âs not lost his sense of humour
mcilroy takes his tee shot on the seventh hole of the second round in florida mcilroy missed the cut in the honda classic last week and struggled to an opening 73 at trump national doral asked what will he do for a three iron on saturday , he replied : â there âs one on the way , but i âm not sure if it âs courtesy of nike or a scuba diving team
â the curious thing was he seemed to play better with 13 clubs than 14
this was mcenroe-esque rather than mcilroy
with the frustration no longer pent - up , he made a birdie with his second ball at the 8th , before birdieing the 10th and 12th holes
another birdie at the 17th meant he finished with a 70 and , on one under for the event , stands on the fringes of the top ten
â what âs annoying me is there âs no sign on the range of the sort of shot i hit on the 8th , â he said
â so it âs a little bit of a mental thing and a bit physical and something i need to work on
â mcilroy is eight shots off the lead held by american jb holmes , who double - bogeyed his last hole to give everyone a break
he is now just two shots ahead of fellow american ryan moore , with scott lurking in third place , a further shot behind
then come stenson and bubba watson champion bubba watson at five adrift
scott is not only playing his first competitive round for three months , he is also using a short putter in competition for the first time in four years
you could say it is working
so far he has had 30 putts inside 12ft â¦
and holed 28 of them
welshman jamie donaldson , runner - up in this event last year , is seven behind after a 72
alongside mcilroy on one under is lee westwood , who is playing in his 50th wgc â the first man to reach that milestone since the four events to enjoy such status were conceived in 1999 .
