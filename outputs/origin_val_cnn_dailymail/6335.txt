prehistoric hunters may have tipped their stone arrows and spears with poisons to help them bring down prey , scientists believe
researchers have developed a new technique that allows them to test ancient weapons for residues left by toxic plant material added to them
preliminary tests have suggested that a set of 4,000 - year - old stone - tipped arrows from egypt were coated with poisonous compounds including the plant acokanthera
dr borgia , a specialist in paleolithic hunting weapons at the mcdonald institute for archaeological research at the cambridge university , believes hunters may have been using toxic chemicals on their weapons up to 30,000 years ago
the image above shows arrows from chinese that were used in a crossbow that were dipped in poison she said that paleolithic hunters may have used poisonous pastes made from plants to help make their weapons kill prey more swiftly
early humans may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago , a new study has suggested
scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans
a study of fossils of homo erectus , an extinct human ancestor , shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully
this would have enabled homo erectus to become a proficient hunter , able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey
she said : ' it made good sense for people to use poisons
' on their own , palaeolithic weapons with stone arrowheads may not have been deadly enough to immobilise or kill a large animal such as a red deer
' poisonous plants were plentiful and the prehistoric population knew the environment where they lived , they knew the edible plants and their potential as medicines and poisons
' to fabricate a poison is easy and economic , and the risk is minimal
in addition , the making of poisons is often part of the tradition and the rituality of hunting
' dr borgia has been working with forensic scientist michell cralin from northumbria university and dr huw barton , from the university of leicester , to test for the presence of poisonous plants on prehistoric weapons
using a technique called liquid chromatography mass spectrometry , which is used to detect traces of drugs by modern forensic scientists , they are examining residues left on the tips of ancient weapons
they are also looking for the presence of starch grains that may have been left on the weapons from toxic plant material
this wooden spatula from malaysian wrapped in a palm leaf was used to apply poison to darts used for hunting dr borgia has conducted tests on 4,000 year old arrow heads found in egypt ( left ) that are thought to have been tipped with a poisonous black residue
the image on the right shows a pot of curare , a plant - based poison which is still used by some indigenous hunter - gatherers in south america to coat darts and arrows they can then compare the results from these tests against a database of known poisonous plants
dr borgia has already collected samples from a number objects known to have contained poison and ancient weapons to test the technique
these include a 1926 chinese pot containing aconitum poison inside , malaysian darts tipped with the poison upas , chinese crossbow arrows and a number of africa arrows
many hunter gatherer societies are known to use poisons when they are hunting
the yanomami people in the amazon rainforest use curare - a mix of bark scrapings from strychnos vines - to tip their darts and arrows when hunting
the use of curare was once common among indigenous populations in south america
the researchers have used starch grains like the ones shown on the left from the plant aconitum napellus to help identify poisonous materials
aconitum was found inside this pot on the right thought to date from 1926 in africa hunters use another species of strychnos to produce the poison strychnine , while other plants like acokanthera , and strophantus are also used
hunters in asia are also known to have used monkshood to kill large animals such as bears and siberian ibex
the seeds from yew trees are also thought to have been used to poison arrows
dr borgia has also collected black residue from six arrows that date from pre-dynasty egypt
these 4,000 - year - old arrows were first studied by scientists 40 years ago when small portons of the residue from the stone tips were injected into a cat
opium , magic mushrooms and other psychoactive drugs have been used by humans for thousands of years
an anthropologist has discovered that humans have been cultivating and using mood - altering substances since the stone age
professor elisa guerra-doce has compiled evidence from around the world that neolithic people were taking drugs derived from cacti in 8,600bc and that they were cultivating opium poppies by around 6000bc
researchers have also found reddish stains on 13,000 year old human teeth found in a burial pit in duyong cave on palawan island in the southern philippines , which are thought to be caused by chewing the leaves of the betel plant
it is still chewed through out much of asia as a mild stimulant
charred cannabis seeds have also been found in bowls that date from the bronze age pit-grave culture that appeared in romania around 2000bc
this bone harpoon in a museum in cambridge carries a warning label that reads ' care , has been poisoned ' the animal did not die but became ill , suggesting the presence of a poison
dr borgia said : ' nowadays we have the right instruments to get more information without cruelty to animals
' initial tests strongly suggest the presence of acokanthera , a poisonous plant on our database , but we ca nât be completely certain as there are a number of components in the compound
' we know that the babylonians , greek and romans used plant - based poisons both for hunting animals and in war
' in fact , the word â toxic â come from toxon , the greek for bow
taxus is a genus of the yew tree with a springy timber traditionally used to make bows
' it also produces seeds used to poison arrows
in britain , yews grown for their timber were planted in churchyards so that animals would nât be poisoned by eating their berries
â few hunter - gatherer societies remain today but all the groups that have survived employ poisons
