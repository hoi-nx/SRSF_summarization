ms maddy jobson said : ' i am disgusted and sickened
i have n't slept a wink since i saw the footage
' what if their actions had caused her heart to stop ? would we have just thought mother died peacefully in her sleep ? it does not even bear thinking about
' there 's a sign on the door of the home that states , " dignity , respect and care "
but where was the dignity , respect and care for my 84 - year - old mother ? ' our family put its trust in those who are supposed to be professional carers
all we wanted was end - of - life dignity and care for my mother
