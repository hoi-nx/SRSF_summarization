as her son entered the dock at hove crown court , ms mann was seen mouthing ' i love you ' in his direction
she required surgery for multiple punctures to one of her lungs and was wounded on her arms , head and neck following the attack
the court heard how she made a frantic 999 call at 6.20am on december 29 , telling operators : ' my son 's just attacked me and stabbed me and he 's going mental downstairs with the knives
' ms mann was woken when her son returned home and began ' trashing ' his room
the court heard how he followed her into the kitchen where he stabbed her 11 times
the 21 - year - old , who received treatment at a psychiatric facility before being transferred to lewes prison , was so high during the attack he was ' not responding to pain '
' he was not reacting to pain and was described as manic and deranged , ' said prosecuting counsel amy packham
when police arrived at the family home , he is said to have told officers : " i have stabbed her multiple times , i have killed her
the 21 - year - old was sentenced to 16 months behind bars after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm
his mother , right leaving court , was seen mouthing ' i love you ' during the hearing " i have stabbed my mum and i need to be punished for what i have done
" ' he said he had taken miaow miaow , loads of lines of it , and a lot of alcohol
he appeared manic and deranged at the time
he was said to have described himself as a ' paedophile ' to police officers and begged : ' i do not want to live
' take me to the light , i can see the vampires
' after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm at an earlier hearing the 21 - year - old was jailed for 16 month , reduced to eight
he will only serve another four weeks owing to the time already spent in custody
sentencing , judge rennie described the family 's case as ' wholly exceptional '
earlier ms mann spoke at the difficulty of seeing her son 's fate ' already sealed '
' this case has a number of features which make it if not unique wholly exceptional
the lack of total awareness and capacity to form intent was the direct result of drug induced psychosis , ' said judge rennie
' i further recognise that in your psychotic state you inflicted life altering injuries on yourself and have taken this cocktail of drugs before without any particular side effects
' your mother is an extraordinary human being who has conducted herself with enormous dignity , and i thank her very much indeed
' david etherington qc , representing mann , said the defendant had become involved in taking drugs after completing his gcses and had spent time in the priory trying to overcome his problem but had relapsed
mann is undergoing physical and psychiatric treatment following the incident in december 2013
he is seen being led away from the hove crown court in handcuffs the 21 - year - old was sentenced to 16 months reduced to eight months in jail at hove crown court ( above ) he told the court : ' his parents even sent him to work on a kibbutz in israel but the problems would come when he came home and fell in with the same crowd
' he told the court mann had had hallucinations on occasions after taking drugs but ' had never had a reaction which caused him to be violent to another human being , particularly his mother who he loves very much and who he never had any conscious desire to hurt '
mr etherington said mann had relied on evidence of the attack because he had ' virtually no coherent memory of what happened '
he continued : ' looking back , in a mind that was very troubled at the time , he can only really rationalise it as being a suicide attempt by him in the grip of a delusion in which his mother somehow got involved
' the court heard that although mann had been ' extremely mentally unwell at the time of the offence due to a drug induced psychosis " he had now recovered but remained " fragile and vulnerable
