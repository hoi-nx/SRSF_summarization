the prosecution 's first witness , a bellboy , testified today that he saw pemberton at the motel on the night ms laude was killed
however the proceedings were closed to the media , and scant details were only initially available via de los santos
she said that , although laude 's family rejected the plea bargain offer , it could be revived and introduced ' anytime ' during the trial
but lawyers for ms laude 's family accused de los santos of promoting the plea bargain , and separately filed a request with the justice department on monday asking for her to be replaced
ms laude 's death re-ignited long - simmering anti-us sentiment in the philippines , a former us colony that still allows a significant us military presence via joint training exercises
judge roline ginez-jabalde is overseeing the trial , though both sides spent the past two weeks discussing the possible plea bargain

' there have been talks on plea bargaining
it is possible for an accused to plead guilty to a lower offense , in this case from murder to homicide
' the difference here lies in the number of years , ' lawyer virgie suarez , one of two private lawyers for the laude family , told the paper
she added : ' indeed the laude family wants nothing else but to see pemberton being immediately convicted and his sentence be imposed
' if this will happen it will do well if pemberton will publicly apologize to the laudes and to the philippines people
' lawyer harry roque , the other private counsel of the laude family , earlier told members of media that their position is non-negotiable
both lawyers have also expressed their belief that they have ' overwhelming ' evidence and any judge handling the case will find the accused guilty
pemberton , who was on shore leave after participating in the joint us - philippine balikatan military exercises , met laude at the ambyanz nightlife bar located along magsaysay avenue on october 11 and the two later checked in at the nearby celzone lodge

laude 's sister , marilou , had mixed emotions on seeing pemberton for the first time at an earlier hearing in december
' i wanted to ask him why he killed my brother , ' said marilou , whose transgender sibling was born jeffrey eventually became laude
' i wanted to bang his head against the wall
i wanted to be angry , but i am also afraid
' pemberton is temporarily detained at the mutual defense board facility inside camp aguinaldo in quezon city while remaining under us custody
the us embassy in december rejected a foreign ministry request to hand pemberton to philippines authorities , citing the visiting forces agreement ( vfa )
legal rules on the treatment of erring servicemen are laid out in the 1998 pact signed by manila and washington to allow us forces to hold military drills in the philippines to test the readiness of the allies
the prosecution had earlier said the case is a special one and should be heard , tried and decided within a year starting from december 15 , 2014
both the prosecution and defense had agreed to a two - day continuous trial , set every monday and tuesday , starting today and running until september 22 this year .
