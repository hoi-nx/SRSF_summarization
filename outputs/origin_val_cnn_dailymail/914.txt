the 47 kent street terrace is just one of several recent harbourside properties sold under the hammer â how can they [ government ] offer us all these homes to relocate to when the waiting list is still growing ? â mr gardner told daily mail australia
â why are nât they offering these homes to the people on the list first ? i do nât understand what the rush is for when there are others who need a roof over their heads more
â i have lived here most of my life and if they want to evict me â they 'll need to fix the waiting list first - then i âll move
â however , last september , the minister for family and community services upton said the sale of the millers point properties will return hundreds of millions of dollars to the public housing system to help the 58,000 people currently on the housing waiting list
' this is all about reinvesting money back into the public housing system by selling properties that are very costly to maintain , ' ms upton said
' the age and heritage nature of the millers point properties mean they often cost four times as much to maintain as the average social housing property
' the government said that for every house sold in millers point , it can build three houses elsewhere

but mr gardner , who has lived in the area for more than 65 years , said the heritage of sydney âs first neighbourhood will be lost with the sales with critics claiming it is a ' social cleanse '
â the thing we âre really angry and upset about is the fact that some of these properties have been vacant for as many as seven years , â he said
â there are properties on kent street that have been vacant for so the last three to five years â meanwhile we have all these people sleeping rough on the streets who are still waiting

' it 's hard for some of the more elderly people here , they do n't have the energy , but i 'll fight this to the end , it 's my home
