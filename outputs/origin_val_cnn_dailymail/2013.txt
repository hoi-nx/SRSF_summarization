a month after the meeting , mr thompson broke into her apartment while the young woman was home , wearing medical gloves and carrying a gun , and hid behind the door of her bedroom while she was in the bathroom
the court reported that when she entered the room , wearing only underpants , mr thompson grabbed the woman , put his hand over her mouth and told her not to scream , before forcing her onto her bed with his gun resting on her chest
' that situation is immediately productive of terror , ' said acting justice robinson during friday 's sentencing , noting that the young woman said she could still smell the glove to this day
after three hours , mr thompson left the apartment , and the now 22 - year - old went to the police , reporting that she was in fear for her life and believed that he might come back

' [ she ] had exhibited a distinct dislike of guns

mr thompson , who has already served a month in jail , was sentenced to two years for his crimes , and was to continue serving his sentence until december this year , from which time it will be suspended .
