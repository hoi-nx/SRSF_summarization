a cape york fisherman accidentally pulled in a crocodile that was taking a bite out of a salmon he had hooked ben stack has warned other far north queensland fishermen to be wary while out on the water after he came face - to - face with the salt water crocodile mr stack thought the fish was stuck under a log , so he leaned over the side of the boat and started pulling in the line
' i was hanging right over the side of the boat because i was trying to look in the dirty water to see what the fish was caught on , ' he told daily mail australia
describing the close call in a post on his cape york guide to explore , hunt and fish facebook page , mr stack said what happened over the next few seconds ' felt like a lifetime '
' first , i saw a bit of silver , then i saw my lure with the fish 's mouth wide open , ' he said
' i lifted the leader some more and leaned over further to see what the fish was hooked up on
it was at this moment , i realised i was staring eye to eye with a solid salt water crocodile
mr stack said he was grateful he was able to capture the incredible moment on film ' we were face - to - face and no more than 20 inches ( 51cm ) apart
fright kicked in , i released the leader and flew backwards into the boat
' mr stack said he had his camera poised to take a photo of his catch , and he was grateful he was able to capture the incredible moment on film
' i could n't believe what i had just experienced and i did n't think anybody was going to believe me , ' he said
' thankfully these pictures had turned out
' be careful while fishing creeks and rivers with crocodiles in them because one may be hiding under your boat
