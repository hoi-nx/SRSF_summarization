millions still use easy - to - crack passwords such as â qwerty â and â 123456 â , but many people are choosing to use more complex sets of characters for our online accounts
however , a new study has found these seemingly random passwords may be more obvious to hack than you realise
researchers have shown that passwords such as â mnbvcxz â , â qaz2wsx â and â adgjmptw â can be cracked in seconds - and adding numbers to your codes does little to boost its strength
they spotted that a number of complex passwords were being used by multiple people , such as â mnbvcxz â , â qaz2wsx â and â adgjmptw â
this is because each of these words follow a certain pattern , or ' walk ' on a keyboard ( shown ) the analysis was made by hosting firm wp using 10 million passwords recently released by security consultant mark burnett
as with previous studies , researchers discovered the most common passwords are still â 123456 â , â password â , â qwerty â and â 111111 â
they also went a step further and listed all 50 of the most used words , which additionally included â superman â and â letmein â
these lists were then divided into sections including the top 10 colours , days of the week , fruits and animals used as passwords - which are â red â , â friday â , â apple â and â fish â respectively
but during the analysis they spotted that a number of complex passwords were being used by multiple people
like with previous studies , the analysis discovered common passwords are still â 123456 â , â password â , â qwerty â and â 111111 â
these lists were then divided into sections including the top 10 colours , days of the week , fruits and animals ( pictured ) - which are â red â , â friday â , â apple â and â fish â respectively on average more women were found to have longer passwords than men , with an entropy - or password strength - score of 25 and above
more than one in five people who added numbers to a word simply chose ' 1 ' for example , â qaz2wsx â was in the top 30
they also noticed that a website called zxcvbn scored these words as zero , or low , for so - called entropy
the 20th most common keyboard pattern in the list was â adgjmptw
this pattern is created when the nine keys on a number pad are pressed in order entropy is used to determine the strength of a password in terms of â information entropy â
this comes from information theory and is measured in bits
the more bits a word is assigned , based on the number of guesses it would take to crack , the stronger the password
other words that received a low score include â qwertyuiop â , â 1qaz2wsx â and â zxcvbnm â
this is because each of these words follow a certain pattern on a keyboard , known as â keyboard walks â
there was an anomaly in this list , though , because the 20th most common keyboard pattern in this list of passwords was â adgjmptw â - which on face value does nât appear to be an obvious keyboard pattern
however , following further investigation the team realised this pattern is created when the nine keys on a telephone number pad are pressed in order
the study said that his pattern in particular shows how password selection is changing as more people create them on touch devices
in addition to these passwords being common , the researchers added that password crackers such as passpat specialise in such patterns , leaving them more vulnerable than some simpler passwords
people born in the 1980s were the most likely to use the word â love â somewhere in their password
almost 1.5 per cent of these passwords belonged to women compared to 0.7 per cent of men âs elsewhere , nearly half a million - or 420,000 ( 8.4 per cent ) - of the 10 million passwords ended with a number between 0 and 99
and more than one in five people who added those numbers simply chose 1
hackers can therefore try adding these numbers to the ends of words when trying to hack into an account
on average more women had passwords with an entropy score of 25 and above and people born in the 1980s were the most likely to use the word â love â somewhere in their password
in may 2013 a team of hackers managed to crack more than 14,800 supposedly random passwords - from a list of 16,449 - as part of a hacking experiment for a technology website
the success rate for each hacker ranged from 62 % to 90 % , and the hacker who cracked 90 % of hashed passwords did so in less than an hour using a computer cluster
the hackers also managed to crack 16 - character passwords including ' qeadzcwrsfxv1331 '
rather than repeatedly entering passwords into a website , the hackers used a list of hashed passwords they managed to get online
hashing takes each user 's plain text password and runs it through a one - way mathematical function
this creates a unique string of numbers and letters called the hash
hashing makes it difficult for an attacker to move from hash back to password and it lets sites keep a list of hashes , rather than storing them insecurely as plain - text passwords
this means if a list is stolen , the plain text passwords ca n't be obtained easily however , this experiment shows this does n't mean its impossible
when a user types a password into an online form or service , the system hashes the entered word and checks it against the user 's stored , pre-hashed password
when the two hashes match , the user is allowed entry to their account
gosney , the founder and ceo of stricture consulting group , managed to crack the first 10,233 hashes , or 62 per cent of the leaked list , in 16 minutes
he used a so - called ' brute - force crack ' for all passwords that were one to six characters long
brute - force attacks is when a computer tries every possible combination of six letters and characters , starting with ' a ' and ending with ' / / / / / /
' mr gosney then used brute - force to crack all passwords up to 16 digits long and managed to brute - force 312 passwords in three minutes and 21 seconds .
