mrs bojelian , who announced adam 's death on social media this week , previously explained how she noticed his special way of communicating when he was a toddler
she said : ' adam was about one when he went to a playgroup for children with disabilities
they used to sing " if you 're happy and you know it clap your hands "
' adam could n't clap his hands , but i noticed every time they said " clap your hands " he blinked
' as time went on it became clearer he was blinking when we asked him questions , and as he got older he counted by blinking
over time it became obvious that 's what he was doing
' just a day before he died , adam had been given an inspirational champion award by charity group young epilepsy for his work representing young people with the condition
