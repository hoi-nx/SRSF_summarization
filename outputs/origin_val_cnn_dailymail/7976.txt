waking up one morning , leesa barrell was alarmed to find that everything seemed very different
â it felt like somebody had put a brick wall up against my right side , â she says
â i called out to my husband lee and when he replied i could only hear his voice in my left ear
â leesa barrell ( pictured ) woke up one morning unable to hear out of her right ear initially , leesa barrell , 45 , who lives in norwich with lee , 49 , a school caretaker , and their son ashlee , 12 , thought the problem was probably caused by a wax blockage and would correct itself within a few days
but when it did nât , a week after her first symptoms she went to see her gp and was referred to an ear , nose and throat consultant
the specialist dropped a bombshell â she had lost the hearing in her right ear , possibly for good
â at that point i became very tearful
i was so worried my hearing would never return , â she says
leesa barrell , a finance assistant , was even more overwhelmed when doctors could not explain why it had happened
leesa barrell is one of up to 6,000 adults a year estimated to develop idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss , or unexplained hearing loss , that usually develops suddenly , or within three days , usually in one ear
often , sudden hearing loss can be attributed to infections , certain medications , head injuries and meningitis , because these can all affect the inner ear
but in some cases , such as leesa barrell âs , there is no clear explanation
the hearing organ , the cochlea , is found deep in the inner ear
it is filled with fluid â when soundwaves enter it , the fluid moves and tiny hair cells then trigger signals to the auditory nerve , which passes the signals to the brain
these are recognised as sounds , allowing us to hear
sensorineural hearing loss is down to problems in the inner ear or with the auditory nerve
the other type â conductive hearing loss â occurs when something has physically blocked transmissions of sound , such as wax
â eighty - five per cent of the time no one ever knows why sudden sensorineural hearing loss occurs because we ca nât get to the inner ear to examine it without risking damaging it , or damaging the brain , â says phillips , the consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon at norfolk and norwich university hospital foundation trust who treated leesa barrell
the most popular theory is that it âs caused by a virus damaging the nerve in the inner ear
another is that a blood clot blocks a blood vessel that leads to the inner ear
a benign tumour on an inner ear nerve may also cause sudden hearing loss â but this is rare
whatever the cause , losing your hearing suddenly can be â very traumatic â says mr phillips
â hearing loss usually occurs in one ear so people get scared it will happen in the other ear , too
they often get balance problems because the inner ear contains the balance organ , the labyrinth , too
leesa barrell ( pictured ) initially assumed that the problem was caused by a wax blockage and that it would correct itself within a few days â losing balance function on one side can make someone feel disorientated before the brain eventually adapts
â and the damage is often permanent
one year after sudden hearing loss , a third of patients do nât recover any hearing , a third recover fully and the remainder have some hearing loss
waking up one morning having suddenly lost your hearing is considered a medical emergency and , if this happens , you should see a doctor that day , advises mr phillips
it may be hard for patients to distinguish a genuine emergency from the muffled hearing that comes with a cold , so see a gp if in doubt
steroids are currently the only treatment option to help patients regain some hearing â they can improve the outcome , in some cases , if taken within two weeks and are thought to help by calming inflammation
they used to be given orally , but the latest thinking is to inject steroids directly into the eardrum
the number of people in britain with hearing aids
â if someone loses all their hearing , cochlear implants can cost up to Â£ 40,000 , so prevention of permanent deafness is key , â says mr phillips
a study in the new england journal of medicine found there is â less recovery of hearing when treatment is delayed â
it âs also less likely to return in under - 15s and over- 65s , although it âs not known why , as well as in people who suffer from vertigo or who had poor hearing beforehand
thankfully , leesa barrell âs hearing has partially returned â which is likely to be down to her seeking medical help quickly
when she saw mr phillips , a week after her symptoms appeared , he prescribed a three - week course of steroid tablets
â on the fifth day of the course i started to hear a muffled , squeaky noise through my right ear , â she says
â i had a couple of side - effects â shakes and tiredness â from the drugs , but it was worth it
without them i could have been deaf in that ear my whole life
â a couple of weeks after finishing the course she regained 50 per cent of her hearing in her right ear , but nonetheless needed to have a hearing aid fitted
leesa barrell ( pictured ) was given a three week course of steroid tablets and she eventually regained 50 per cent of the hearing in her right ear although she still needed to have a hearing aid fitted this has helped â a lot â , she says , though she admits : â i feel much too young for one
â a nasty consequence of her hearing loss has been severe tinnitus ( in which a phantom ringing or buzzing is heard ) in her right ear
â it âs the worst part of the whole experience , like a constant waterfall in my ear
â people with hearing loss often develop tinnitus , explains mr phillips
â because the brain is nât receiving sound from the ear it tries to strain to hear more and so picks up sounds that do nât have a genuine source
â hearing aids are usually the first option
people with severe or profound hearing loss , especially in both ears , may find hearing aids do nât help
one option is a cochlear implant â an electronic device that is surgically implanted that does the work of the damaged section of the ear
helena martins had one fitted in october 2013
the 41 - year - old marketing manager , from south-west london , suddenly lost hearing in one ear in 2009 and the other in 2010 , both overnight
this happened after she was diagnosed with meniere âs disease , which is caused by pressure within the inner ear and causes vertigo , tinnitus and hearing loss
â i was in complete panic when i woke up one day in 2010 and everything was awfully quiet
i saw my partner âs lips move , but i could nât hear any words coming out
i knew that my hearing had completely gone
â people with meniere âs often develop total hearing loss
helena tried hearing aids , but they became ineffective after a few months and so a cochlear implant became her only option
â after it was turned on i could hear people âs voices again â i was so happy , â she says
as for leesa barrell , she has learned to live with her hearing loss
â without my husband and son âs support this would have been much worse , â she says
