washington the us ambassador who resigned his post in 2012 amidst official criticism that he used a private email account for official business told cnn friday that he was " very surprised " to learn that his boss at the time , then - secretary of state hillary clinton , had been doing essentially the same thing at the same time
" i was very surprised to learn of the double standard , " former ambassador to kenya and air force general gration told cnn
gration noted that cheryl mills , the then - state dept. chief of staff " obviously knew secretary hillary clinton was using commercial email , yet she stated my use of gmail was one of the reasons i had to move on
" the retired air force major general , who flew 274 combat missions over iraq as a fighter pilot and served as president obama 's special envoy to sudan , recalled he had been " prohibited from sending a gmail message to a state dept. computer except in an emergency
" considering that " department of defense dot mil accounts , usaid accounts , and every kenya account used the same routers and security firewalls as a gmail account , " he took issue with state dept. protocols
" it did n't make sense to me that the state dept. would ban my ' gmail ' while letting all other commercial and foreign accounts through its computer firewall , " he told cnn
a spokesman for hillary clinton declined comment
spokespeople at the state dept. repeatedly declined to address whether any sort of double standard had been applied and instead continually noted that in the state dept. inspector general report about the us embassy being run by gration there were " several concerns with management and leadership " discussed , not just about his use of private email
the inspector general report charged that gration " lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission " and " damaged the cohesion of embassy nairobi 's country team
" gration said he makes " no apology for ' rocking the boat ' in the state dept. to improve physical security , to enhance cyber policy , and to conduct several other initiatives that the state dept. inspector general misrepresented to build the case that secretary hillary clinton 's chief of staff used to terminate my tenure as the us ambassador in 2012
" the state dept. 's continued referencing of the other allegations against gration came amidst fruitless attempts by cnn to ask the department spokespeople to explain why it was acceptable for hillary clinton to use private email to conduct official business given that the 2012 inspector general 's report against gration repeatedly hammered him for the use of " commercial email for official government business " which was considered to be " flouting of direct instructions to adhere to state dept. policy
" as cnn reported thursday , the report stated clearly that it " is the state dept. 's general policy that normal day - to - day operations be conducted on an authorized information system , which has the proper level of security controls , " the report stated
" the use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss , phishing , and spoofing of email accounts , as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information
the use of unauthorized information systems can also result in the loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions
conducting official business on non- state dept. automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies
" asked if he was subsequently surprised to see this controversy erupt about his then - boss doing essentially the same thing , gration told cnn " i 'm not surprised when any political issue becomes a controversy
i learned long ago to do your best , do what was right , and to have a thick skin
i still wake up each day without regrets because i still have my integrity
that said , illegal , immoral , or unethical activities should be investigated properly , not just for political gain , but because we demand this of our public leaders
that 's the only way we can preserve trust in our system of governance
punish crimes and forgive mistakes
" gration said that his " experience was somewhat different than secretary hillary clinton 's use of her commercial account , yet i was ' fired ' for the use of gmail in the us embassy , my insistence on improving our physical security posture , and other twisted and false allegations
i 've chosen to move on and to be better , not bitter
" he said that " the state dept. inspector general investigators and diplomatic security cyber investigators conducted a full and formal investigation into my use of gmail and the state dept. computers " and " they dismissed the allegations against me
" the former ambassador and his wife currently live in kenya , where he is executive chairman of a company that works to bring international investment and innovation to kenya and east africa
he is no longer involved in us politics and diplomacy .
