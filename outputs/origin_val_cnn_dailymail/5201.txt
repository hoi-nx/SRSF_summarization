manchester united manager louis van gaal insisted he and assistant ryan giggs ( left ) are on good terms the dutchman refuted claims that there were problems between himself and the former manchester united player ryan giggs ( left ) appeared subdued after ashley young scored a late winner against newcastle on wednesday ' everybody can see we have a good relationship
' we work very hard together me with the players and the staff
' i am very irritated about this
a suggestion about a poor relationship is wrong
' i am a fact man
' minutes before thursday 's press conference , manchester united defender evans had denied spitting at cisse on wednesday night in a statement released by the club
cisse , on the other hand , has apologised for his actions
evans ( left ) and cisse clash after the unsavoury incident at st james ' park on wednesday night cisse has apologised to evans after reacting while the manchester united defender has denied all allegations van gaal said : ' i have spoken with evans and that is why i am late
' when he was spitting on the ground maybe it was a human reaction
it was not his intention and i believe him
' the fa are waiting for referee anthony taylor 's report
as he missed the incident between evans and pappis cisse , it is unlikely the it will be included in his report - meaning the fa can retrospectively punish the pair
hull striker george boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at manchester city goalkeeper joe hart
however , the fa have issued new guidelines to move in line with new fifa guidelines meaning evans and cisse could now be banned for six games
asked about whether he feared the fa would charge evans , van gaal replied briefly
he said : ' i think the fa is very wise
' evans released a statement on thursday , denying the allegations that he spat at the newcastle striker
the statement on manchester united 's official website read : ' having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night 's match
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at cisse
' i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor
during the game cisse and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting
' it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do
it is certainly not something that i did last night
' conversely , cisse has said since apologised to his team - mates , fans , and even evans , saying he spat back at the northern irishman as a reaction to something ' very unpleasant
