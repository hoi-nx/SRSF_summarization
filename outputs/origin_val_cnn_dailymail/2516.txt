a burger flipper from worcestershire has reinvented his fast food business after spending an intense period in the kitchen of one of the country 's top restaurants as part of a new tv programme
now hungry burger - lovers keen to try his gourmet - influenced meat are travelling from far and wide to buy them
a new six - part channel 4 programme , burger bar to gourmet star , put sampson , 27 , under the tutelage of one of the country 's top chefs , daniel clifford
what happened when the more humble end of the country 's dining spectrum met with the higher echelons of british cookery ? top chef daniel clifford ( left ) tutored sampson ( right ) prompting him to turn his food van business around flipping great : sampson , 27 , has seen his burgers fly off the shelves of his van after appearing in the television programme
plans are afoot to sell burgers wholesale and even open a restaurant previously , sampson made a living serving burgers to passing lorry drivers from a lay - by on the a38 near worcester
by his own admission , the meat he presented , in a plain white bap , might have left burger aficionados running for the hills
his signature dish wasan artery - straining ufo burger , a carnivorous concoction that comprised four burgers , four sausages , eight rashers of bacon and , somewhere in between , eight squares of processed cheese
however , since his brush with the higher echelons of british cookery , word of mouth has seen people travel from all over the country to sample his fast food
he told the worcestershire news : ' i âve had people travel from chester , london and even lincoln - that âs a 125 - mile trip - just to try them
' chef daniel clifford admits he fully expected sampson to wilt under the pressure and was amazed by the young chef 's stoic attitude his fortunes changed after an intense cookery lesson with respected chef daniel clifford of midsummer house , cambridge which prompted a culinary epiphany
the results ? hand - pressed 5oz burgers so in demand that sampson often has to turn people away
so far , the chef admits he 's tinkered with his popular new recipe , which includes rump and chuck steak , cayenne pepper and worcestershire sauce , more than thirty times
chef daniel clifford admits the two men were operating in separate universes
' i âve never stopped in one of these places in my life ' , says the chef as he arrives at the burger van in the show in his audi
sampson , whose previous experience as a cook amounted to a stint at mcdonald 's and working at a pub , was thrown into the deep end of the kitchen at midsummer house
it was assumed he would falter under the pressure
instead sampson thrived on the one - on - one time with the chef and despite plenty of less - than - friendly words aimed in his direction , he saw the short apprenticeship through
sampson is planning to sell his burgers wholesale after local farm shops flocked to stock them before his training at midsummer house , sampson served up standard burgers from a below par butcher
now his new beef patties , which the recipe for has been tweaked no less than 31 times , includes the following : rump steak chump steak herbs and spices including : cayenne pepper worcestershire sauce after leaving midsummer house , the married father set about trying to adapt what he 'd learned to his own business
he quickly dismissed the fancier dishes but did realise that there was a lot he could do to up the quality for his existing customer base
he kept the price of favourites the same - a bacon sandwich will still set you back Â£ 2.70 - but found a butcher selling better quality meat
he cleaned his van within an inch of its life
he says the chance to aspire for more has been ' life - changing '
he told the times ' it was life - changing for me on a number of levels
' ' it âs made me a better cook for sure , but it âs also made me appreciate what i have at home too
' the sky 's the limit for his business plans too
local farm shops are going to stock them raw and sampson is planning to sell them wholesale too
a restaurant in worcester might also be on the cards
