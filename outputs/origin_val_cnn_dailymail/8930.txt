cheat : whiting , 33 , from darlington , who used illegally claimed benefits as a ' financial security net ' while enjoying foreign holidays and a lavish lifestyle a mother - of - three who used illegally - claimed benefits as a ' financial safety net ' while enjoying foreign holidays and lavish spending on her home was receiving thousands from her well - paid boyfriend , a court heard
whiting told officials she lived alone with her three children and raked in income support , housing benefit and council tax relief , a court heard
but in reality , she was sharing her darlington home with boyfriend mark briscoe - a former soldier working in private security in the middle east
in one year , he was able to deposit Â£ 9,000 into his 33 - year - old girlfriend 's account - all the while claiming benefits , using them as a ' financial safety net '
it also enabled her to pay for family holidays to majorca and bulgaria , as well as a Â£ 1,000 - plus sofa , fridge , washing machine , flooring and a sky subscription
her deception was discovered in 2013 , although she initially denied being in a relationship with mr mark briscoe
however , her neighbours knew they were a couple , and teesside crown court heard mr mark briscoe also had his car registered at the darlington property , and his pension correspondence from the army went there
eventually , whiting admitted two charges of failing to notify a change in circumstances , and yesterday she was given a two - month suspended prison sentence
the judge , recorder martin bethel , qc , described her dishonesty as ' blatant ' and also ordered whiting , of chestnut drive , to pay Â£ 400 costs
bottomley , mitigating , told the court that the fathers of whiting 's first two children ' contributed very little to their upbringing '
she added : ' her explanation to the probation service for continuing to claim benefits is it was a financial safety net for her and her children
' that 's somewhat understandable given she had spent the past 11 years receiving very little money from their fathers
' she accepts it was wrong
' miss bottomley told the judge that unemployed whiting had struggled with a gambling addiction at one point , but that was ' now being managed '
the youngest of the defendant 's three children - mr mark briscoe is the father - is three , and the others are aged seven and 11 , the court was told
prosecutor nigel soppitt said the allegation was she claimed more than Â£ 11,800 over 18 months , but the defence case is that it was Â£ 5,000 over nine months .
