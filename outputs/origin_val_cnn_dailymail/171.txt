the submission called for commissioners to spend two weekends working in industries such as aged care or hospitality , rule out considering income from tips in its findings and to study the economic benefits of penalty rates
however , industry representatives have said penalty rates have to be up for discussion if a major review of workplace relations is to take place
australian hotels association chief executive ferguson said omitting them from the conversation would be ' ridiculous '
' the current structure of paying 275 per cent [ of ordinary wage rates ] on these public holidays - our research says this does n't stack up , ' mr ferguson said
' we do n't step away from the fact that a sunday is different from a monday , for example , all we 're talking about is the quantum
' mr ferguson said the australian hotels association 's submission to this year 's productivity commission will be lodged on monday , and will push for changes that would see unsociable work hours instead called ' additional rates ' and make the wages mark - up less generous
hospitality worker and united voice delegate nicolette marks said her hourly rate was about one - third higher during night hours but was well earned
