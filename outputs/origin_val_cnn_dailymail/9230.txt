they 've been pumped up as tv 's toughest cops , with endless promotions running on network ten âs website and on television
but now the gold coast cops show appears destined for the television scrapheap after a decision to dump the stars known as the â rapid action â ( rap ) , after they were labelled â a bunch of show boaters â , and who some internal critics say are not really responsible for proper policing
season two is set to air tonight but a political power play , along with anger and jealousy which has gripped the rank and file about the so - called ' elite squad ' , has all but sounded its death knell
samuel johnson returns as narrator for the second season in gold coast cops on the beat
the team has been criticised for ' showboating ' by some queensland police colleagues but their boss , keogh , says the results speak for themselves network ten says it expects the second season to run its full course
' it is business as usual
we are concentrating on producing season two of gold coast cops which airs tonight on ten at 7.30pm , ' the network ten said in a statement
ten 's website continues to promote the series , saying : ' the elite taskforce is responsible for policing everything from bikie gangs and street violence to drug heists and organised crime
' ' led by superintendent keogh , the unit offers the community a permanent police presence on the gold coast
' ' superintendent keogh said : " officers are committed to restoring public confidence by focusing on public disorder and street violence through high visibility policing
' officers will respond to incidents requiring a priority response
should the matter involve a protracted investigation , specialist units will be utilised as necessary , ' he said
the second series , narrated by actor samuel johnson , returns to screens on tuesday night ( from 7.30pm ) which much of the content derived from the december and january holiday periods on the gold coast
since it was first formed in september of 2013 , keogh has overseen the task - force , growing from a team of 50 to double that size with the majority of whom were hand - picked by him
a former member says it is not right to call then ' the elite ' one of the stars of the gold coast cops show on network ten , senior constable kristee " k rock ' la rocca the problem for the rap squad , which was set up to tackle the state 's tougher anti-bikie laws , is that members of the new government front - bench have openly criticised the decision by the the previous newman government to allow unfettered access to the unit by ten cameras
privately , premier annastacia palaszczuk is also believed to have concerns about the team and the vision made available by the crack police squad on the gold coast
what is abundantly clear though , is the displeasure of rank and file , who have labelled their colleagues ' show - boaters '
leading to further speculation it will be shut down is that rap commander , superintendent keogh , is due to return to duties in brisbane
it 's believed the squad members will now be absorbed back into the general police population and the 3 - year lease on the high - tech set - up at varsity lakes allowed to run out
the rap crew is not particularly well liked in their home state because of the hype and publicity they have been receiving , since the show first went to air
one colleague , who also works the surfers paradise beat , told daily mail australia : ' what they are doing and have done is not widely respected , they 're glorified actors and this is a serious business
two of the stars of the show , supt keogh and sgt carla sara , who is affectionately known as the ' pocket rocket '
she moved from bondi to the gold coast and is now a team leader ' what 's worse is they are not the sole reason things are getting cleaned up on the coast , it 's the rank and file , to be honest
' they think they are the best or toughest or something but they 're pretty ineffective , despite what the super might say and the figures they quote
' and a former member of the rap team actually agrees with the criticism
' the promotion of it was the problem because in the first couple of episodes they called the team the elite , and i think they still do , so i can understand why some of the others got their noses out of joint , ' one source said
' to term it " elite " when it was n't right made it them against us sort of feeling , they should never have used elite
' they were mostly just young kids that after their first year , got a station for three years and the bosses went through and picked the ones they thought were good workers
' yes , there was that sort of picking and choosing , but not elite
' the crew , hand - picked by supt keogh , has been run out of a new technology hub on the gold coast
a current member of the rap team dismissed claims they were ineffective
' mate , i have been bombarded by everyone wanting to know why are being disbanded and i have no idea , ' he said
' people have asked why would they do this when the gold coast is as clean and safe as it has ever been
' it looks like we are on borrowed time , i do n't know why
' and the numbers back up those claims
almost 4500 arrests have been made since its inception in 2013 , on the back of more than 400 raids
daily mail australia understands all members of the team will be placed under the control of the gold coast police district , when inspector shane holmes , like keogh , is also expected to return to brisbane
' it 's a good squad , we were formed to clean up the streets of the gold coast and we have but there are political games at play
' even the production company has not committed to a third season
the palaszczuk government , for its part , denies it has anything to do with decisions about the future of rap
inspector shane holmes ( left ) is the operations co-ordinator for the patrol group , while constable daniel lees ( right ) has been quote in promos as saying ' the main thing i do nât like about bikies is they âre bullies
and i âve never liked bullies ' minister for police , fire & emergency services , jo-ann miller did not exactly give the group a ringing endorsement when asked if it would be disbanded
' the palaszczuk government supports gold coast police 100 per cent in their effort to keep the community safe , ' she said
' the rapid action and patrol group is not being dismantled by this government
i do nât have a view about where individual officers should be based
' that is , rightly , a matter solely for the commissioner , ' she said
daily mail australia is still awaiting an official response from queensland police
however , an email sent to members of the rap group has been obtained by daily mail australia , which attempted to hose down the speculation
' i am aware that there has been considerable discussion about the future of the group , i have had lengthy discussions ( with senior officials ) who insist there will be no deviation from the current plan
