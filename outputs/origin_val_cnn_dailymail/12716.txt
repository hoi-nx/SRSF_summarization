the owner of a chinese restaurant in nairobi , kenyan has been arrested following an uproar over its policy of banning africans customers at night , according to reports
owner zhao yang was arrested for operating a restaurant without a valid license shortly after local press ran a story alleging that kenyan reporters were turned away from the restaurant -- for being africans
kenyan 's daily nation newspaper carried a story monday that its reporters had been barred entry to the restaurant , being told by a guard at the entrance that " the time for africans is over " when the journalists arrived at 7 p.m. only locals accompanied by chinese , european or indian patrons would be admitted , the newspaper reported
it also reported that two local politicians , " loyal patrons " nairobi senator mike sonko and former cabinet minister raphael tuju , had been admitted , the latter being a friend of the owner
kenyan social media users were quickly up in arms about the ban , taking to facebook and twitter to voice their displeasure , using the hashtag # noblacksallowed
the establishment , known only as chinese restaurant , in the kilimani neighborhood of nairobi , has subsequently been closed after it transpired that it lacked several necessary licenses , said reports
the daily nation reported that the chinese - owned eatery lacked liquor , health or change - of - use licences -- the latter needed as the property had been converted from a residence to a restaurant
co-owner and restaurant manager esther zhao told the newspaper that the " no africans at night " policy had its roots in security concerns
" we do n't admit africans that we do n't know because you never know who is al-shabaab and who is n't , " she said , referencing the islamist militant group that is active in kenyan and neighboring somalia
" it is not like it is written on somebody 's face that they are a thug armed with a gun , " she said

" because of the concern of the business environment at night and the bad memory of ( a robbery in ) 2013 , we adopted certain measures
unfortunately , some of the measures were inappropriate , we sincerely apologize for this , " the management said in a statement

" one kenyan reporter commenting on the restaurant 's ban likened the policy to a new form of colonialism in africans
