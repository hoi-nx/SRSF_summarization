owen failed to get his hands on silverware at a dubai world cup when playing for england but brown panther , a horse he both bred and co-owns , ensured he came away from saturday 's dubai world cup meeting with a trophy
the seven - year - old , trained by tom dascombe at owen âs manor house stable in cheshire and ridden by richard kingscote , was always close to the pace in the two - mile dubai gold cup and quickened to beat star empire by a decisive three and a half lengths
the victory , the 11th of brown panther âs career , secured a first prize of Â£ 384,000 , by far the biggest owen has ever won in his racing venture
brown panther had a convincing victory for co-owner owen at the dubai gold cup former england striker owen watches on at meydan on saturday in dubai owen , who won the 2014 irish st leger with brown panther , said : â he is the horse of a lifetime and a superstar in my eyes
that was a tough race â two miles in this heat and he kept on galloping like he did in the final furlong
â he is a talented horse but has great courage
i am very proud of him
â the success was also rewarding for kingscote
he has had a race against time to get fit after suffering a broken collar bone , snapped arm , broke wrist and elbow plus punctured lungs in a fall
there was a second win on the meydan card for europe when sole power , trained in ireland by eddie lynam and ridden by richard hughes , landed the al quoz sprint
while british jockey william buick landed the $ 10m dubai world cup on saeed bin suroor - trained 14 - 1 shot prince bishop , who beat 2014 kentucky derby winner california chrome
the success for an eight - year - old who has never won at group one level in europe and was running in his fourth dubai world cup was another surprise result in the race
it again showed the dubai world cup may be the richest race on the globe but it is of questionable quality

" that 's the first time i 've ever seen him really pin his ears back and have a real go as he 's a bit of a character
