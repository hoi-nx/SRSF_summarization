cher has petitioned a court to allow a 96 - year - old woman to return to her home in northern virginia
hill was taken away from her new 95 - year - old husband last year after a court accepted she did not have the mental capacity to enter into a marriage
however , the 68 - year - old singer was so moved by the story of mrs hill and harrison that she has pledged to help mrs hill return home
cher was moved to act after she saw a documentary on hill and her husband harrison a court ruled that hill , left should be removed from her home and transferred to florida
her husband harrison remained at home in virginia but later died a couple of weeks after they were split apart unfortunately mr harrison died several weeks after his wife was taken away
however , cher was inspired by the story and decided to act on behalf of mrs hill and see whether it was feasible to return her to her long - term home
a judge in mcclean , virginia has ruled that mrs hill should be returned home following cher 's commitment
mr harrison died in december , just weeks after hill was taken away to florida on the recommendation of a court - appointed guardian , but a custody dispute continued over who should care for hill and where she should live
cher said she will help pay for needed upgrades to hill 's family home in alexandria
in a telephone interview , cher expressed frustration that harrison and hill had been split up against their wishes
she said : ' this whole thing is a travesty , what happens to old people
once they do the repairs and she comes back home , it 's going to be bittersweet because she only wanted to be with him
' earlier this month , after cher offered to pay for the home improvements , a judge ordered that hill should return to alexandria once repairs are complete
mrs hill 's daughter wright said : ' mom 's coming home ! ' mrs hill was in favour of her mother 's marriage to mr harrison
mr harrison and mrs hill had been companions for more than a decade before they got married
in december , the court ruled that mrs hill should be moved to florida and later that same month , mr harrison died
mrs wright said : ' he actually gave his life to this effort
' she said mr harrison became depressed after mrs hill was taken away as he thought it was unlikely that they would ever see each other again
cher became aware of the case when a tv news broadcast showed the couple dancing
the singer said she would pay for any repairs inside the alexandria home and ensure it was suitable for a 96 - year - old woman
she also pledged to help with her ongoing medical bills
cher saw a documentary about the couple when mrs hill was taken to florida
she said she was impressed by how in love the pair seemed to be and was outraged over their treatment
she added : ' i think this is an important story
it 's not right what is going on
