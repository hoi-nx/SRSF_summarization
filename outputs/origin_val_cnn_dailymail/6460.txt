appalled : eric holder said he was shocked by ferguson police department , and prepared to tear it apart and start over u.s. attorney general eric holder has threatened to dismantle ferguson 's police department to force through reforms after a damning report found widespread racism in the force
eric holder told reporters that the justice department is ' prepared to use all the power that we have ' to push through change in the beleaguered missouri force , which was castigated nationwide over the killing of michael brown
the threat follows the publication of a report which showed officers swapping racist emails , as well as finding that 93 per cent of all arrests in the town , and most uses of excessive force were directed at the african americans population
president barack obama has called the policing in ferguson ' broken and racially biased ' which requires a ' fix ' from the federal government
eric holder , speaking today in maryland in front of air force one , told reporters that justice department plans include ' everything from working with them to coming up with an entirely new structure '
when asked if that meant dismantling the force and starting over , he said : ' if that 's what 's necessary , we 're prepared to do that
' he seized in particular on parts of the report showing that ferguson police overwhelmingly issued fines for offenses like traffic violations and speeding to african americans - seemingly in an attempt to bolster the city 's revenues
' and that is not something that we 're going to tolerate
' however , ferguson 's mayor countered eric holder 's threats with a warning that some measures would be an ' overreach ' of executive power , and insisting that the city would not comply unless there was ' mutual satisfaction '
civil rights lawyers have previously said the county could absorb the functions of the ferguson police department

eric holder also said president barack obama 's task force on policing will issue guidelines to address jailing citizens who owe money to the city , a practice used in ferguson
but he noted that the federal government does not have the authority to demand such a change of local governments
