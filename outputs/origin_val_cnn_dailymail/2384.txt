repeated exposure of children to secondhand smoke is child abuse , a leading doctor has warned
adam goldstein , a professor in family medicine , says exposure is as abusive as leaving children unattended in hot car , or drink driving
he claims he was forced to speak out after caring for ' too many children hospitalised with asthma and pneumonia , caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke '
adam goldstein , a professor in family medicine , says exposing children to secondhand smoke is ' as abusive as leaving them unattended in hot car , or drink driving ' his controversial opinion piece has been published in the latest issue of the annals of family medicine
in it , he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse
' but what if the substance is secondhand smoke ? , ' he asks
dr adam goldstein , who is director of the tobacco intervention programs in the university of north carolina school of medicine , says the damage from smoke is ' as abusive as many other commonly accepted physical and emotional traumas of children '
his comments come after years of caring for children who have suffered severe respiratory illness due to secondhand smoke exposure
in the opinion piece , he writes : ' scientific research over the last decade has increasingly demonstrated that exposure to secondhand smoke is not simply a nuisance ; it is deadly
' secondhand smoke exposure causes multiple diseases in children , including asthma and pneumonia , and results in thousands of avoidable hospitalisations
' it is a major cause of sudden infant death syndrome and may cause lung cancer and heart attacks with repeated exposure
he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse ' no safe level of exposure exists
' [ therefore ] , purposefully and recurrently exposing children to secondhand smoke - a known human carcinogen - despite repeated warnings , is child abuse
' in the paper , he goes on to explain how he and his colleagues treated two children of smokers ' at least 10 times over three years '
despite repeated attempts to get the parents to quit , they continued to smoke - and the children , aged 5 and 7 , repeatedly visited the clinic with ear infections , coughing , bronchitis , and asthma
in the end , the younger child developed pneumonia , he says
after treating her with antibiotics and inhalers , ' dr adam goldstein and his colleagues implored the parents to stop smoking - or at least avoid smoking anywhere near the children - and offered them counselling
' the parents , however , refused to engage with us about quitting smoking , pharmacotherapy for cessation , or about not letting their children be exposed to cigarette smoke , ' he says
shortly after , the child appeared in the emergency room with a recurrence of pneumonia and severe asthma
' by the time we heard about it , she was already on a ventilator in the pediatric intensive care unit , where she stayed for several days before ultimately improving
' out of the 10 adults gathered in the waiting room - parents , extended family members , and several friends - six were heavy smokers , ' he writes
' in retrospect , it is easier to see where and why we failed : our patient was suffering from child abuse , and we had failed to intervene beyond offering medication , counseling , and referral
' as a result , dr adam goldstein says it is time for society - including doctors - to do much more
dr adam goldstein claims he was forced to speak out after caring for ' too many children hospitalized with asthma and pneumonia , caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke '
' we must intervene to stop this abuse , ' he writes
options he suggests include counselling of parents that smoke , legislation , and even taking children away from their parents
the key message , he says , is that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke
he points out that some u.s. states , including texas , vermont and washington - already prohibit foster parents from smoking around children in cars and homes
' if this is true for foster families and smoking , should n't it be the case for all parents ? , ' he asks
additional legal protection for young children exposed to secondhand smoke makes common ' sense '
he adds that children already suffering from chronic lung illnesses should be protected from ongoing exposure
' secondhand smoke exposure decreases lung function and has dozens of carcinogens ; yet often the most vulnerable children continue to be exposed , and these children often have no voice
