labour failed to appreciate the britain jobs market would prove a magnet for polish plumbers , one of tony blair âs most senior advisers admitted yesterday
the admission was one of a series of revelations about how the last government chronically mishandled eastern europeans immigration
one ex-cabinet minister said he had warned the influx was having a huge impact on hospitals and wages - but was largely ignored by his colleagues
in the end , more than one million travelled â with at least half that number settling in what is one of the biggest waves of immigration in britain history
they were attracted by wages which are significantly higher than back home
sir stephen wall , who was mr tony blair âs most senior eu adviser between 2000 and 2004 , said : â we simply did nât take account properly of the pull factor of england for people with skills who could probably find a bigger market [ in the britain ] for their skills - you know , the polish plumber
â in comments which will pose a huge headache for ed miliband , sir stephen wall also admitted the decision to throw open britain âs borders at a time when other countries were imposing transitional controls was â political â
the remarks risk re-igniting the debate about labour âs record â for which the labour leader recently apologised
green of deddington said the figure of 13,000 polish workers settling in the britain originally given by labour was ' completely worthless ' ( file image ) sir stephen wall said : â the primary argument was the political one â this was the right thing to do , we attached a lot of importance to them as democratic countries and keeping our position as the number one friend of eastern and central europeans
â last night , green of deddington , chairman of the migration watch campaign group , told the mail : â it is astonishing that nobody properly considered the impact of the wage differential between britain and a huge country like polish
â we said at the time the forecast of 13,000 - a - year was almost worthless
in fact , it was completely worthless
â yesterday , it also emerged that ex-labour cabinet minister denham had written to chancellor gordon brown and home secretary charles clarke to warn the new arrivals were having a huge impact
he said the government failed to recognise what was happening in constituencies like his own in southampton , where wages were driven down by as much as 50 per cent , a&e departments came under strain and 1,000 migrants attempted to sign up for an english - as - a - second language course in a single day
mr denham added : â the whole irony of this is that in some respects tony blair was obsessed by immigration , particularly about illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system , but on eu migration there was a catastrophic failure of the civil service machine
â in further bombshell remarks , the respected economist ormerod , writing in the left - wing guardian newspaper , exploded labour âs economic case for mass migration
he argued that , at best , it had a â barely perceptible â impact on economic growth per head while supressing the wages of the less well - off
mr ormerod said : â labour allowed direct competition to enter the britain labour market on a scale unprecedented in our history â¦ it is the relatively unskilled in the bottom half of the distribution who have lost out
former home secretary david blunkett ( pictured ) has defended labour 's record on mass migration , saying he is ' confident ' it was the right policy , ' even though very few people now will stand up for it ' â the liberal elite do not suffer
indeed , they benefit because many of the services they consume are provided at lower prices than would have been the case without mass immigration
â his comments were echoed by ex-labour home secretary jacqui smith , who said : â the person that benefits from â¦ growth is often not the one worried that their kid is going to get less attention from the teacher in the class room because there are people speaking polish
â but two more home secretaries from the labour years were unrepentant about the party âs record , despite the fact ed miliband has since apologised for how it handled the influx
charles clarke , who was sacked over the foreign prisoner scandal in 2006 , said : â it âs nonsense to suggest it has terrible impact on public services â most of the people coming here were working , did nât have children , and were not of age to be a big burden on nhs
â david blunkett said : â i âm confident that it was the right decision , even though very few people now will stand up for it
i just think that allowing people to move [ to the britain ] but not to work would have been a complete own goal
