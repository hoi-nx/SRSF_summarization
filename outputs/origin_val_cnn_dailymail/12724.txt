zimmerman says he bears a grudge against president obama , accusing him of inflaming racial tensions around the trayvon martin case
zimmerman , who was acquitted of murder in 2013 over trayvon martin 's death , made the allegations against obama in a video posted on his lawyers ' website
the february 2012 killing of trayvon martin , an unarmed black teenager , by zimmerman , a hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer , stirred fierce debate about race and the justice system
zimmerman , who is now 31 , said he shot trayvon martin in self - defense during a confrontation in sanford , florida
but critics allege the death was spurred by racial profiling
in the new video , zimmerman claims it was obama who stoked racial tensions surrounding the case
he cites the president 's remarks in march 2012 , when the case was still being investigated , in which obama said , " if i had a son , he would look like trayvon martin
" " to me , that was clearly a dereliction of duty , pitting americans against each other solely based on race , " zimmerman says in the conversation with his lawyer howard iken , who does not appear on camera
zimmerman notes that obama 's press secretary at the time , jay carney , had said previously that the white house would not wade into the case , calling it " a local law - enforcement matter
" asked if he felt there was one government agency or official who brought the most unfairness to his situation , zimmerman is quick to respond
" by far , the president of the united states , obama , " he says
zimmerman 's comments are the first since the department of justice announced last month that it would n't bring any civil rights charges against him
he says that he feels that " the department of justice process worked , " but also that it should have investigated whether his civil rights were violated
" they had various numerous examples of bounties place on my head , credible threats placed against myself and my family , " he says , adding that " the president and the attorney general and the federal government declined to do anything about it
" zimmerman says he has a clear conscience over trayvon martin 's death
" only in a true life or death scenario can you have mental clearness to know that you can not feel guilty for surviving , " he says .
