' recording a verdict of suicide , assistant coroner fox said : ' she had been a great lover of horses in particular her horse jake , who had been ill with a bad leg
she had n't been able to ride him for 18 months or so

steph was not able to watch jake die and was clearly very , very distressed when that took place
' despite having a good circle of friends it seems clear to me that she felt she could live no longer
' having heard the circumstances relating to jake and in relation to the way her body was found and a note saying goodbye i have no doubt at all that steph did intend to take her own life
