built - in sensors detect human shapes and will start recording automatically if a person is spotted
the clips are uploaded to a free cloud service , and footage is taken at 720p with 10 frames per second to limit how much data the camera uses
when connected to a wi-fi network this increases to 30fps at 1080p
in addition to 4g , the nubo works on 2g and 3g connections and because it is ip - 66 weather resistant it can , in theory , be mounted anywhere with a mobile data signal
mobile support including gprs , 2g , 3g and 4g : nubo will offer connectivity with leading wireless carriers , with the vodafone being the first partner to launch with in europe outdoor ready ( ip - 66 ) : nubo is ip - 66 rated weather resistant and can be used indoors and outdoors smart human detection : nubo âs advanced video analytics identify when a person walks in front of the camera and sends an alert to a mobile app links with smart home devices : nubo âs wireless radio technology means it can communicate with external sensors , such as door or motion sensors

â to solve this problem , panasonic cameramanager is launching nubo , a new standalone camera that allows users to have all the benefits of a mobile security camera , with the advantage of 4g connectivity
â â consumers have long had to compromise on mobility and connectivity when it came to their surveillance needs , bound either by location or connectivity , â added tijmen vos , cto of panasonic cameramanager
â our vision is to deliver a product that allows users the freedom and flexibility of choosing where the camera can be used and the confidence in knowing that the data created is securely transmitted and stored
â with the introduction of nubo , we âre putting the control of safety and surveillance into the user âs hands
â when a recording begins , the owner is sent an alert via a smartphone app and can then use the nubo âs two - way communication tool to talk to the person being filmed

during its press conference , panasonic also announced it is launching its own mobile network using vodafone âs infrastructure - making it a mobile virtual network operator ( mvno ) - and service plans for the nubo on this network will start at Â£ 5 ( $ 7 ) a month
this includes cloud storage , but a microsd card slot will store footage if the mobile data fails
this means it can be used without a service plan , too
the cheapest plan will include 250 alarms per month and seven days of cloud storage for video clips
additional plans will be available up to in a Â£ 33 ( $ 50 ) a month for 2,500 alarms and 90 days of cloud storage
once the data runs out alarms will still be sent but users will need to buy more to view the clips
nubo 's app will work with android and ios and users will be able to watch footage live , control how long nubo records for and see a history log of activity
nubo ships in november but can be pre-ordered in the uk and netherlands from april
panasonic said it plans to launch the camera in the us and other regions by march next year .
