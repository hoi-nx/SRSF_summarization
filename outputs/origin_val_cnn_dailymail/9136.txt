for a city with some of the strictest gun control laws in the country , the sudden opening of a gun store on new york 's lower east side raised eyebrows
the gwh gun shop was open for only two days last week and had a very specific purpose - to put people off buying guns
potential shoppers were lured in by a large sign in the window that stated : ' first - time gun buyer ? we are here to help you
' in the apparently well - stocked store , in a space usually used as an art gallery , each gun is labelled with information about how that make and model was used in a particular tragedy
the ' sales pitches ' from the actor posing as the store clerk are brutal and hidden cameras captured the startled reactions of customers
adam lanza 's mom had this in her collection , too , until he took this and several other guns and killed her and then went down to sandy hook and killed six teachers and 20 innocent children
twenty little kids â¦ gone like that
' for a customer interested in ease of use he said : ' this revolver , it 's the easiest gun we have to use
it 's our most popular one
it 's a .22 - caliber , six - inch revolver
it 's also a gun that a five - year - old found in his parents ' bedroom , went down and shot his nine - month - old baby brother with it
' in another part of the video he showed a 9mm semi-automatic weapon to a customer : ' a very handy gun
it 's a great gun to carry in your purse , like that gal from the walmart , her two - year - old son reaches into her pocketbook , pulls it out , shoots her
' the store - and its accompanying website , guns with history - were part of a campaign put together by states united to prevent gun violence , a gun control non-profit organization and new york against gun violence , one of their affiliates
the ' sales pitches ' from the actor posing as the store clerk are brutal descriptions of tragedies committed with the make and model of the weapon all the weapons , which were unloaded movie props , also have a tag with information about the tragedy to which the clerk refers - the descriptions are also on the related website hidden cameras captured the reactions of potential first - time gun owners to the ' sales pitches ' customers were visibly shocked or upset by the descriptions of gun accidents and mass shootings working with grey , a new york - base agency , and production company rival school pictures , the goal was to ensure that people are aware of how many accidents and tragedies occur as a result of having a gun in a home
the groups were also particularly keen to reach out to parents
the pro-gun lobby was quick to label the stunt as misleading
' this is a tasteless pr stunt designed to further an anti-gun agenda , and it 's out of touch with reality , ' national rifle association spokeswoman jennifer baker told foxnews.com
' as gun ownership has risen to an all - time high , violent crime has fallen to a 43 - year low , and the firearm accident death rate has fallen to the lowest that it has been in over a hundred years
' ' a clear majority of the american people support the use of firearms for protection and put more faith in gun ownership rights than in gun control
' julia wyman , executive director of supgv said : ' our aim is to ensure those looking to purchase a firearm are aware of the potential risks [ and to promote responsible gun ownership ]
' ' often gun purchasers wrongly believe guns will keep them safe when , in fact , a gun in the home greatly increases the risk of homicide and suicide
' ' this sets the record straight so consumers can make an informed choice to buy a firearm or not
' the store has an accompanying website which carries the same information potential shoppers found the information sobering
