it was n't one for the scrapbook , but koeman wo n't care a jot
when sadio mane fired home eight minutes from time , not only did it end a run of three games without a win - it ended a 387 minute spell without a home league goal
this was n't a display that said much for southampton 's champions league credentials , nevertheless their top - four dream is still alive after this scrappy win over palace
sadio mane races away to celebrate following his 83rd minute strike at st mary 's sadio mane watches on as his strike secured a much - needed three points for koeman 's side southampton ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : forster 6.5 ; clyne 6.5 , fonte 6.5 , maya yoshida 6 , bertrand 6.5 ; victor wanyama 6.5 , schneiderlin 6.5 ; elia 6 ( dusan tadic 59 ) , djuricic 6 ( ward-prowse 78 ) , sadio mane 6.5 ; graziano pelle 5.5 ( shane long 70 )

' we scored and we won at home , so i 'm relieved , but i ca n't say we deserved to win , ' said koeman
' it 's all about confidence and we did n't have that tonight
but i think it can one of the key moments in our season
' qualifying for the champions league will be difficult , but we will try our best
' palace manager pardew was n't as contented in his post-match press conference , however
the palace boss was angered by referee martin atkinson 's decision not to award the his side a second half penalty after fonte bundled over bolasie in the 70th minute
' fonte was over aggressive in the box , ' insisted pardew
' it should have been given , but we 've been harshly treated by officials in the last few games and sometimes you get a run like that
' in response to pardew 's comments , koeman said : ' it 's easy to tell that story after losing game , the ref was n't involved in final result
' we scored , they did n't
i know that feeling , it 's too easy and people talk too much about referees
i do n't like that
' pardew may change his mind once he sees replays of fonte 's shoulder - to - shoulder collision with bolasie
palace 's wilfried zaha ( right ) controls posession under pressure from southampton defender maya yoshida eagles forward zaha makes a run as saints midfielder schneiderlin ( left ) gives chase at st mary 's stadium perhaps the palace manager , who was without skipper mile jedinak , who on tuesday accepted a four match suspension for elbowing diafra sakho on saturday , was trying to mask his disappointment at leaving the south coast with nothing when they could easily have left with all three points
the fact palace players hardly appealed for a spot - kick tells its own story
southampton enjoyed the upper hand during the opening exchanges , filip djurcic fashioning the first chance , controlling victor wanyama 's mishit shot only to fire over the bar in the 11th minute
but despite their dominance in terms of possession , this looked a southampton side void of invention in the final third
even 25 minutes into the game , you could sense the anxiety from home supporters
earlier this week a local newspaper scrapped an idea to print full - page arrows for saints fans to display as a tongue - in - cheek reminder to players of where the opposition goal is
palace 's bolasie takes a tumble following the twin challenge of clyne ( left ) and victor wanyama sadio mane is upended by the challenge of palace midfielder joe ledley graziano pelle ( left ) and scott dann both hit the turf as the italian chases his first goal looked to add to his single goal in 13 appearances but on the evidence of the opening 45 minutes , koeman 's side needed all the help they could get
the anxiety in southampton 's attacking play even trickled back to their usually tight defence in the 36th minute , goalkeeper forster misjudging a high ball , nearly allowing wilfried zaha to tap into an empty net
palace keeper julian speroni made the first real stop of the night in the 40th minute , saving elia 's shot from a half - cleared schneiderlin corner at his near post
saints midfielder elia ( left ) rises high to beat james mcarthur to a high ball in the palace box southampton goalkeeper forster gets down to secure the loose ball under pressure from the onrushing zaha southampton striker graziano pelle blows a great chance to break the deadlock as he shoots wide from close range southampton manager koeman ( right ) watches on from the technical area with palace boss pardew not far away the rebound fell to graziano pelle , but the struggling striker could only stab his effort wide from close range
during the opening months of the season , the ball would have nestled in the back of the net for the italian
how he must long for those heady days
so to must have koeman as he faced up to yet another half - time team talk without a goal from his side
likewise , palace offered next to nothing in the attacking third during the opening 45 minutes , nevertheless pardew would have been satisfied with the outcome of their first half
he 'd have been even happier if forster had n't produced an excellent save from jason puncheon in the 48th minute after the saints forward turned maya yoshida brilliantly in the box
seven minutes later the visitors went even closer , zaha hitting the inside of forster 's far post after the england goalkeeper 's initial save from bolasie
koeman replaced elia with dusan tadic just before the hour mark in search of attacking impetus , shane long and ward-prowse soon followed
saints boss koeman was fearing another goalless 90 minutes from his side in the 69th minute when maya yoshida somehow fired wide from three yards after schneiderlin 's corner
but eight minutes from time , st mary 's erupted as sadio mane fired home after julian speroni failed to hold from ward-prowse 's shot
