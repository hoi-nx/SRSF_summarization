switzerland star shaqiri says roberto mancini was the reason he decided to swap bayern for inter
shaqiri struggled to secure a regular starting place in his three years at bayern and made the move to the san siro in january after speaking with roberto mancini
the 23 - year - old had offers to move to spain and england but opted for inter and hopes to repay the faith shown in him by roberto mancini
shaqiri says he moved to inter to get more game time shaqiri helped inter get passed celtic in the europa league speaking in la gazzetta dello sport , he said : â inter had been in contact with my agents and my brother erdin for some time
' then there were two phone calls from roberto mancini
we had two good chats
i immediately felt like i would be very important for him
' at my age , what interested me most was the chance to play regularly , which had nât happened a lot lately
shaqiri says he turned down offers from england and spain to join inter shaqiri spoke to inter manager roberto mancini and he swayed him to move to the san siro ' roberto mancini explained to me that i would see a lot of time on the pitch
he spoke about his philosophy and that of the club , and his desire to take inter back to its glorious recent past
â inter travel to napoli on sunday and will look to get back to winning ways after defeat by fiorentina last week , but shaqiri knows it will not be an easy game
he added : â it is not easy to win at napoli , but getting three points there would be very important psychologically
we must play well and try to grow
we have everything it takes to do that
