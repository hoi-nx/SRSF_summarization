he made his white sox debut on may 1 , 1951 , and homered in his first plate appearance against yankees right - hander raschi
it was the start of a beautiful relationship between the cuba slugger and the white sox
minoso , regarded as baseball 's first black latino star , was a havana native who spent most of his career in left field
he is one of only two players to appear in a major league game in five different decades
he got his final hit in 1976 at age 53 and went 0 for 2 in two games in 1980 for the white sox , who tried unsuccessfully over the years to get the ' cuban comet ' into baseball 's hall of fame
' when i watched minoso play , i always thought i was looking at a hall of fame player , ' reinsdorf said in an informational package produced by the team for a 2011 hall of fame push
' i never understood why minoso was n't elected
he could run , he could field , he could hit with power , he could bunt and steal bases
he was one of the most exciting players i have ever seen
' saturnino orestes armas minoso arrieta was selected for nine all - star games and won three gold gloves in left
he was hit by a pitch 192 times , ninth on baseball 's career list , and finished in the top four in al voting four times
despite the push by the white sox and other prominent latin players , minoso has never made it to hall of fame
his highest percentage during his 15 years on the writers ' ballot was 21.1 in 1988
he was considered by the veterans committee in 2014 and fell short of the required percentage for induction
' my last dream is to be in hall of fame , to be with those guys , ' minoso said in that 2011 package distributed by the white sox
' i want to be there
this is my life 's dream
' minoso , who made his major league debut with cleveland in 1949 , hit .298 for his career with 186 homers and 1,023 rbis
the speedy minoso also led the al in triples and steals three times in each category
playing in an era dominated by the yankees , minoso never played in the postseason
' every young player in cuba wanted to be like minoso , and i was one of them , ' hall of fame slugger tony perez said
' the way he played the game , hard all the time , hard
he was very consistent playing the game
he tried to win every game
and if you want to be like somebody , and i picked minoso , you have to be consistent
' minoso appeared in just nine games in his first stint with the indians , but he took off when he was dealt to white sox as part of a three - team trade in 1951 that also involved the philadelphia athletics
he went deep in his first plate appearance against yankees right - hander raschi , and hit .375 in his first 45 games with the white sox
