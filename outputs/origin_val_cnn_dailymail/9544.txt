ross has returned to radio two - the station that sacked him over a prank phone call - despite hundreds of complaints from listeners
it is more than six years since he disgraced himself when he and comedian brand crudely mocked fawlty towers actor andrew sachs and his family on air the incident provoked 42,000 complaints after brand boasted of sleeping with the actor âs granddaughter georgina and joked that the fawlty towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls
brand later resigned and ross , who had his own regular radio 2 show , was suspended for 12 weeks ross had been hired to cover the afternoon show in february while steve wright was on holiday and was once again hosting the show today
but listeners have been left far from impressed
one posted on the points of view message board : â i have read all 70 messages
many reflect my opinion of this dreadful man
' i just want to put in a fervent request to the bbc
please do nât let him back on radio or t.v
i could avoid him on the other channel
at the moment he is just spoiling my afternoons , please make him stop
â another added : â i âll find another station to listen to when i go out in the car tomorrow
â one posted on twitter : â bbc âs shown double standards over clarkson case - ross and brand get away with murder ! ! â in 2008 , ross used an appearance on comedian brand âs radio 2 show to leave obscene messages on sachs âs answering machine
the andrew sachs family have refused to forgive ross and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career the incident provoked 42,000 complaints after brand boasted of sleeping with the actor âs granddaughter georgina and joked that the fawlty towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls
brand later resigned and ross , who had his own regular radio 2 show , was suspended for 12 weeks
he subsequently moved to itv , while the bbc was fined Â£ 150,000 by ofcom for the shameful episode
after last month 's show listeners questioned the choice of ross to stand - in for steve wright
one wrote on twitter : â all is forgiven then ? did nât think @ wossy would ever â darken â hallowed bbc premises again
â another posted : â and ross is on radio 2 hosting a show because ? my god , just shows you can get away with anything and still asked back
shameful ! â others said they had switched their radios off , with one tweeting : â disgrace they let this clown back on radio
â although ross â who left the bbc in 2010 after it decided not to renew his Â£ 18million contract â has said he feels â immense regret â , the andrew sachs family have refused to forgive him and claimed he used the publicity to advance his career
last month andrew sachs âs wife melody said of ross : â i think it âs dreadful that he âs back at the bbc
i do nât like it because of what he did to us
he âs never off the box now , is he ? â he can do what he likes â walk over anybody , say what he likes
i just put it out of my mind and ca nât be bothered any more
' but i âm careful to switch the tv or radio off when he âs on
it âs not very nice , especially the way andrew âs worked all his life for the bbc on radio and tv
it âs an absolute insult , really
â ross will cover another ten shows for steve wright next month
the presenter , who has also been guest on radio 4 panel show just a minute since his fall from grace , hosted steve wright âs show for four days over the august bank holiday weekend last year , for which he was paid an estimated Â£ 4,000
a bbc spokesman told mailonline : ' ross has stood in as holiday cover on several occasions previously and is popular with the radio 2 audience
' of the 8 million listeners who tune in each week , we 've received many messages of support and only a small number of less than 100 complaints
' we hope the majority of listeners will continue to enjoy ross âs show
