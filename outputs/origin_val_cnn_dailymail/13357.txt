kentucky is so awesome right now you are probably watching the ncaa men 's basketball tournament to see who is going to get second
the undefeated wildcats were scary good thursday night in crushing west virginia
the score was so lopsided the game was over before the first television timeout
while the wildcats won in a blowout , notre dame and wisconsin also advanced to the elite 8 with less - than - comfortable wins
the irish pulled away from wichita state while the badgers shook off pesky north carolina
during the nightcap a lot of televisions -- outside the commonwealth of kentucky -- probably changed channels
the good news was arizona and xavier played a terrific game in the final contest of the night
perhaps you should n't provoke the beast that is kentucky
in the week leading up to the game , west virginia 's miles said , " i give them them their props
salute them getting to 36 - 0
but tomorrow they 're gon na be 36 - 1
" mr. miles missed his guaranteed win by miles
the wildcats smoked the mountaineers 78 - 39 thursday night in a midwest region contest that was never a contest
kentucky raced to an 18 - 2 lead -- they should have stopped it then -- and had five players score in double figures on the night
trey lyles was the wildcats ' top scorer with 14 points
west virginia could n't guard anyone , except maybe the official who went down when he tripped over a mountaineer waiting at the scoring table
kentucky 's 37 - 0 record is the best start in ncaa history , which has kentucky superfan ashley judd super excited
it was n't a pretty game for the wildcats ' offense , but arizona scratched its way past xavier 68 - 60 in a west region semifinal
arizona shot 40 percent , while xavier was n't much better at 43 percent
the wildcats tightened their defense toward the end , closing out with a 19 - 7 run that pushed them to a win and a meeting saturday with wisconsin
it 's a rematch of an elite 8 game last year , which the badgers won by one point
t.j. mcconnell topped all arizona scorers with 17 points while matt stainbrook led xavier with 17 points
the irish found the right balance in the second half , putting the shockers away for a 81 - 70 victory in the midwest region
notre dame trailed by 1 with 16:43 left when it went on a spurt that saw six different players score as the lead grew to double digits
demetrius jackson , who started the run with back - to - back three - pointers , led the irish with 20 points
two - sport star pat connaughton had 16
steve vasturia , who one cbs analyst called a baby - faced assassin , chipped in 13 points
jerian grant , a national player of the year candidate , had a rough night shooting , so he set up his teammates for buckets instead
he had nine points but 11 assists
junior fred vanvleet led the shockers with 25 points while darius carter maneuvered inside for 22
wisconsin played cool and shot hot from the free - throw line in holding off north carolina 79 - 72
sam decker was trending on twitter but the heels were concerned about dekker ( two ks , folks ! ) , the wisconsin forward who was n't having any trouble scoring against the fourth - seeded heels
dekker , who was guarded by the heels ' best defender , j.p. tokoto , sliced his way for 15 first - half points to keep the badgers in the game
the junior had a career - high 23 points on the night while kaminsky , one of the best players in the country , struggled
but the 7 - foot tall center hit a big three and big free throws as the minutes wound down
the badgers were 20 for 23 from the free throw line
kaminsky hit all eight of his attempts
folks also got worked up over seeing green bay packers quarterback rodgers and actress girlfriend olivia munn at the game
seems like tbs cut to a shot of the two at every break in the action
how 'd you like to be the guy next to rodgers ? he won two u.s. open golf titles , yet is n't famous enough to get all the way in the celebrity fan shot
it 's ok , andy north .
