a gang that allegedly specialized in organized , armed and violent crime that were often referred to as ' joloperros '-spanish for ' stick - up guys ' - will finally go to trial this summer for their role in the elaborate kidnapping and assault of two men in boston
the fbi says the ' veloz crew ' - headed by veloz , who is known as ' the maestro ' - went to elaborate lengths to kidnap a man they believed to be a major dealer of homemade percocet pills , which deliver a heroin - like high
the plot was one of many underground kidnappings that police say targeted dealers in order to obtain large ransoms of cash or drugs , believing that going after criminals reduced the risk of involving authorities
the joloperros tagged the victim 's car with a gps tracker and monitored his movements for months on a big - screen tv inside veloz 's house , the boston herald reported
on july 12 , 2012 , they were ready to pounce
the gang had a kidnap bag full of police shirts , skeleton masks and guns
according to the herald , guzman , maldonado , thomas wallace , luis reynoso , and gadiel romero all suited up and got into a white toyota minivan
veloz , the leader , was on the phone to guzman from another location
as the victim pulled into his driveway about 7 p.m. , the abductors pulled in behind and came out with guns
both the target and the man he was with were abducted
the target was hit in the head with a handgun , causing ' blood to spray throughout the van , ' according to an affidavit
the two were taken to maldonado âs apartment in manchester , n.h. , where the crew demanded payment
the target victim refused to cooperate , and was beaten and burned with a hot iron , the affidavit said
he suffered several burn injuries
scene : the tracking devices would call veloz 's cell phone once the cars started moving , and the maestro would track the cars from a television in the living room of his lawrence home ( pictured ) however the victim was lucky enough to escape through a bathroom window and found his way to a neighbor 's house for help
police descended on the property arrested three suspects who were leaving the premises
another suspect was found hiding , according to fox 25
inside the alleged kidnapper 's apartment , authorities found their tools of the trade : police gear , a mask and guns
four irons were also seized , one of which " appeared to have human flesh on it , " records show
police in boston have been focusing on this case and others like for over two years
lawrence mayor daniel rivera told the herald : ' today we are adding more police officers and we âre making this place inhospitable for those guys to do business here
... we have to fight the crime that we have every day , but in order to ensure that this does nât ever happen again , we have to create an environment where every family feels safe by putting enough police officers on the street
