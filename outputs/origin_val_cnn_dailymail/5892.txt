he was one of the uk 's most controversial fashion stars , a man whose flamboyant public image concealed a private life blighted by depression and battles with drink and drugs
now a retrospective of mcqueen 's work is to go on display at london 's v&a , with pieces taken from his ground - breaking 1992 ma collection shown alongside his last
savage beauty , which opens next month but had a preview for a-list stars this evening , includes pieces from the unfinished 2010 collection as well as new pieces lent by mcqueen 's friends , among them stylist katy england
the son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher , the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in lewisham , south london , where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters
after leaving school at 16 with a single o-level in art , the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at savile row tailors gieves & hawkes , before a stint at theatrical costumiers , angels and bermans
both would have huge influence on his later career
mcqueen 's big break came following a spell in milan working for romeo gigli
on his return to london , he applied to central st martins for work as a pattern cutter
impressed by his portfolio , bobby hilson , the head of the master 's course , persuaded him to enrol as a student instead
his faith in mcqueen paid off
the designer 's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by isabella blow
talented : mcqueen , pictured left during his s / s06 show and , right , backstage with a model , was one of the uk 's most talented designers striking : his pieces were adored by fashion press and fashion - buying public alike hard to walk in : his shoes were notoriously elaborate and hard to walk in , as several models discovered while on the catwalk finishing touches : a curator works on an exhibit ( left ) , while right , one of the structured gowns for which mcqueen became famous last pieces : these designs are taken from mcqueen 's s / s10 collection which was inspired by sea creatures from there , mcqueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation , designing david 's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous ' bumsters ' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans
the same year , he was appointed creative director at givenchy , replacing fellow briton john galliano , and relocated to paris
but despite his success , mcqueen never forgot his london roots , often speaking of his love for the uk capital
indeed , he once spoke of how inspiring he found the v&a itself , saying : ' the collections at the v&a never fail to intrigue and inspire me
the nation is privileged to have access to such a resource ... it 's the sort of place i 'd like to be shut in overnight
' the museum repaid the compliment , first by including the designer 's work in cutting edge : 50 years of british fashion in 1997 , and then again in its fashion in motion series
but it is the new savage beauty retrospective that will be the largest retrospective of mcqueen 's work hosted by the museum , with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show
enfant terrible : one of mcqueen 's more shocking stunts involved spraying model shalom harlow with paint during his s / s98 show striking : a v&a assistant poses next to a dress taken from mcqueen 's the girl who lived in the tree a / w 2008 collection magnificent : as with his shoes , the headgear shown on the catwalk by mcqueen was usually difficult to wear changing times : mcqueen 's sea creature inspired s / s10 collection ( left ) and a dress from his a / w08 widows of culloden collection among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection , as well as some of his a / w10 designs - the last the designer would ever create
his final collection was never completed , with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in paris a month after he died
but while mcqueen might be gone , his brand lives on and , in the capable hands of his former assistant sarah burton , continues to go from strength to strength
' lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries , challenged and inspired , ' she explains
' he believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless
savage beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time
' ' i am thrilled to announce that the v&a will bring this wonderful exhibition to london to celebrate the extraordinary creative talent of one of the most innovative designers of recent times , ' adds v&a director martin roth
