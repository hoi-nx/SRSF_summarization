london the bbc producer allegedly struck by clarkson will not press charges against the " top gear " host , his lawyer said friday
clarkson , who hosted one of the most - watched television shows in the world , was dropped by the bbc wednesday after an internal investigation by the british broadcaster found he had subjected producer tymon " to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack
" tymon went to a hospital emergency department to receive treatment for a split lip following the march 4 incident at a hotel in north yorkshire , it said
north yorkshire police said they had asked the bbc for a copy of the report and would assess whether further police action needed to be taken
" no one who was present at the hotel during the incident came forward to report an offense to the police
nonetheless , we have a duty to investigate where we believe an offense might have been committed , and that is what we have been doing with this case , " police said in a statement thursday
" as is usual in these circumstances , we have made contact with mr tymon through his lawyers , to ask him to speak to us so we can ascertain how he wishes to pursue this matter
" tymon issued a statement through his lawyer friday saying he had informed police he did not want to press charges
" the events of the last few weeks have been extremely unpleasant for everyone involved
the matter has taken a great toll on tymon , his family and his friends , " lawyer paul daniels said
" quite simply , mr tymon just wishes to return now to the job at the bbc he loves , as soon as possible
further , the bbc have , in his view , taken action with a view to addressing the issues at hand
" mr tymon agrees with the bbc 's stated view that all parties should now be allowed to move on , so far as possible
" tymon had earlier said he was grateful to the bbc for their " thorough and swift investigation into this very regrettable incident
" " i 've worked on top gear for almost a decade , a program i love
over that time clarkson and i had a positive and successful working relationship , making some landmark projects together
he is a unique talent and i am well aware that many will be sorry his involvement in the show should end in this way , " he said
clarkson was suspended on march 10 after what the bbc initially described as the " fracas " with tymon
macquarrie , who conducted the internal investigation into the incident , said tymon had been struck " resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip
" the physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness , macquarrie said , but clarkson continued to use " derogatory and abusive language " for a sustained period of time
macquarrie said clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to bbc management
announcing wednesday that clarkson 's contract would not be renewed , bbc director general tony hall said a " line had been crossed
" " a member of staff -- who is a completely innocent party -- took himself to accident and emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature
for me a line has been crossed , " he said
" i know how popular the program is and i also know that this decision will divide opinion
" in 2013 , guinness world records named " top gear " the world 's most widely watched factual program , with an estimated 350 million global viewers
the show -- fronted by clarkson , james may and richard hammond -- is sold to 214 territories worldwide
local versions have been made in the united states , china , russia , australia and south korea
after his suspension by the bbc , clarkson changed his twitter profile to " i am probably a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear
" on wednesday , the wording became past tense : " i used to be a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear
" co-host richard hammond tweeted : " gutted at such a sad end to an era
we 're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it 's been an incredible ride together
" on friday james may also tweeted , saying : " i 've written some blues lyrics : oh i woke up this morning , and ... # still unemployed
" fans had earlier expressed outrage at the bbc decision to suspend clarkson
an online petition to have clarkson reinstated has been signed by more than a million people
fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired
last week , a fan dressed as the " stig " -- the anonymous racing car test - driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the bbc 's london headquarters in an armored tank to present the " bring back clarkson " petition
clarkson later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times
while clarkson 's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers , his on - and off - air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense
last year , he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n - word in a clip that was n't aired
" i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure
i was mortified by this , horrified
it is a word i loathe , " clarkson said in video statement posted online
he 's been accused on other occasions of racism , including characterizing mexicans as " lazy and feckless " and using the word " slope " over footage of an asians man crossing a bridge during a " top gear " special in myanmar
producer andy wilman later apologized , calling it a " light - hearted word play joke , " and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to asians
last week , clarkson launched into an expletive - filled rant at a charity auction in north london , verbally attacking his bbc bosses
a cnn reporter who was at the event said clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the bbc had " f * * ked themselves " and had ruined a great show
clarkson later brushed off the incident , saying the rant was meant " in jest " and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the " top gear " race track .
