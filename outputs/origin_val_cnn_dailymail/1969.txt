the evil stepmother make - over on the app gives anucyia piercing eyes anucyia ( before , left ) said she could n't see much difference between the two looks ( princess look , right ) the new element to the already hugely successful app comes just ahead of the new cinderella film 's release this friday
femail put the app , which has previously claimed it could turn us into supermodels , to the test to see how princess - like we could look ... whilst we certainly looked more made up than before , did we really look like cinderella ? bianca london thought she looked ' terrifying ' as the evil stepmother but liked the blue eyes bianca london ( before , left ) was n't pleased with the droopy eyebow ( right ) writer olivia foster said : ' while i was pleased that the app seemed to smooth out my imperfections , i would have liked it to add a few more sparkles and perhaps a crown
