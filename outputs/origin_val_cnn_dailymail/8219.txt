a cold saturday in ashington on england 's north east coast is a far cry from some sun - baked cricket pitch in the tropics but for harmison there is no other place he would rather be as he upholds a family tradition

his side are also in the semi-final of the northern league cup
the northern league side have won three and lost two in harmison 's first five games in charge the former england cricketer have a chance of some silverware after reaching the semi-finals of the cup his aching back , a legacy of the punishing strain of bowling balls at nearly 100mph , still causes him pain , but the camaraderie of a team environment makes up for it
' i 've always been asked if i miss playing ( cricket )
no , not one bit , ' harmison , who retired from cricket in 2013 , told the sunday times
' but i miss the dressing room like you 've never seen
' ashington is not a very big place so if you come from ashington you support the cricket team and you support the football team
the northeast is like that
' the ex-fast bowler admits he does n't miss playing the game of cricket but he misses the dressing room ashington holds a special place in harmison 's heart
he was born in the town and his father was a stalwart for the club as a player and later an assistant manager
' managing anyone else would not have been interest to me , ' harmison added
' it tells you what ashington means to all of us
' to the family it means a hell of a lot
it tells you a lot that in 1966 he 's there as a boy in the background and in 2015 i 'm managing the place
' did anyone from my family say , ' are you sure ? '
yes , james ( harmison 's brother and first signing as manager )
he knew what was coming
my wife was fine , the kids are loving it
it all fell into place
ashington fc are the only club harmison would manage due to how much the club means to him ' it gave me a purpose to get out of bed
