irish 's prime minister has reacted angrily to a st patrick 's day video message from prime minister abbott who he accused of promoting a ' stage irish perception ' of the country
enda kenny told the irish he had watched mr abbott 's video and rejected the implication given by mr abbott that irish was synonymous with drinking copious amounts of alcohol
mr abbott came in for criticism last week for the video message where he awkwardly described st patrick 's day as the one day of the year when ' it 's good to be green '
' abbott has come under fire for his ' patronising ' st patrick 's day message ' it has been said that the english made the laws , the scots made the money and the irish made the songs , ' mr abbott says in the video he proclaims irish 's most famous day ' a great day for the irish , and the english , the vietnamese , the cambodians and everyone who cares to come to a party '
mr abbott even apologises that ' i ca n't be there to share a guinness or two or maybe even three '
the irish prime minister , known in gaelic as the taoiseach , said he had heard mr abbott 's comments and was n't happy with them
' i 've heard the prime minister 's comments
i do n't agree with that , ' mr enda kenny said in the irish
' i think that it is perfectly in order for so many irish people in australia to have an enjoyable celebration of st patrick 's day and st patrick 's week , and to do so in a thoroughly responsible fashion
' there has been a long - term view of a stage irish perception
i think it 's really important that we understand that we have a national day that can be celebrated worldwide , st patrick 's day
' mr abbott apologised that ' i ca n't be there to share a guinness or two or maybe even three ' ' i would have hoped for a more business - focussed message in a video that was designed for business functions , ' an irish businessman told the irish times is this what i think it is ? defence minister kevin andrews gets ready to celebrate st patrick 's day the sydney morning herald reported that defence minister kevin andrews also drew a link between st patrick 's day and alcohol consumption , tweeting a picture of himself holding a can of guinness
foreign minister bishop was asked about mr enda kenny 's comments and whether australia had received a complaint from the irish ambassador on the video message
ms bishop said : ' i have not had the irish ambassador complain about a conspicuous consumption of alcohol
' last week mr abbott came under fire from irish leaders who dubbed his st patrick 's day video message ' patrionising '
mr abbott said st patrick 's day is a ' great day for the irish ... and anyone else who wants to come to a party ' , and that it is the ' one day of the year when it 's good to be green , ' in the video posted to the liberal 's youtube page
' this is the love of life and good humour the irish have given australia , ' he continued
' it has been said that the english made the laws , the scots made the money and the irish made the songs
' an irish businessman in australia said the prime minister 's message is ' patronising ' , according to the irish times
' i would have hoped for a more business - focussed message in a video that was designed for business functions , ' he said
the video was supplied to both the irish australian chamber of commerce and the lansdowne club to be played during st patrick 's day celebrations , but reportedly neither party will show it ' there are so many good stories of irish people in business in australia , mr abbott 's lack of awareness of any of that is astonishing
' the video was supplied to both the irish australian chamber of commerce and the lansdowne club to be played during st patrick 's day celebrations , but reportedly neither party will show it
the lansdowne club said it was unable to find space on the day 's schedule to show the 70 - second video
irish australian chamber of commerce chief executive barry corr said the video was ' a generic st patrick 's day message ' and ' on that basis it is not part of the event ' .
