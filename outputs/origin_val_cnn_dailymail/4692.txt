blackpool pier is facing an uncertain future after being put up for sale for Â£ 4.8million
the historic attraction is one of three piers which have been put on the market by owners cuerden leisure for a collective asking price of Â£ 12.6million
blackpool central pier - home to the famous 33 metre high ( 108ft ) ferris wheel and the closest of three piers to blackpool - blackpool south pier and llandudno pier in wales , were all constructed in the 19th century
blackpool central pier , which stands at 341 metres long ( 1,118ft ) , and blackpool south pier , which is 150 metres long ( 492ft ) , do not benefit from listed status , despite opening in 1864 and 1892 respectively
but baldwin , a director at bilfinger gva , who are selling the piers for cuerden leisure , said it would be very unlikely that a new owner would make significant changes
he said : ' in order to sustain their value and ensure that value appreciated , they would not change dramatically under new ownership
' in our opinion , the value is in the existing use and this is unlikely to change at either of the blackpool piers
' the victorian piers , which were constructed using cast iron piles , steel frames and wooden decking , all boast amusement arcades and rides and generate a collective income of around Â£ 1.6 million a year for cuerden leisure through annual concession agreements
grade two listed : llandudno pier is also on sale - and altogether they can be bought for Â£ 12.6million st john stott , director at cuerden leisure - which also owns eastbourne pier - said the group was selling three of the four piers as it was ' restructuring its assets '
he said : ' these assets are jewels in the crown of the uk 's coastline and we are delighted to offer them to the market either as separate lots or collectively
' mr baldwin added : ' each of these piers are truly iconic structures , having been popular visitor attractions in two of the uk 's best known resorts for over a century
' each pier is being offered for sale freehold , subject to the various concession agreements in place
' as profitable attractions , we 're confident this sale will attract major interest
' a spokesman for the national piers society , which promotes the preservation and continued enjoyment of seaside piers in the uk , said : ' these piers are all in good order and trading successfully , and , given that easter is almost upon us , i have no doubt that they will quickly find a buyer or buyers
