harmony jones ' 10th birthday celebration last week was marred by a letter penned by a friend saying she could not make it to the party because harmony is black
the note , written in pink , blue and green markers , and sprinkled with spelling errors , read : ' maby i will not be able to come to your birthday sleepover , because my dad will not let me go because you are black not trying to be races [ sic ] , but my mom let me no [ sic ] happy birthday ! ' both harmony , who is african-american , and her unnamed friend , a 10 - year - old who is presumably white , attend highland oaks elementary school in memphis
' birthday girl : harmony , seen on the night of her birthday sleepover wearing hello kitty pajamas and a tiara , met the no - show friend at school harmony 's father , christopher jones , told the station wreg he was surprised and upset when he read the missive from his daughter 's school friend
â it angered me a little bit , it hurt me that my 10 - year - old girl had to deal with this , and i myself never thought i would have to deal with this , â he said
but harmony jones , who also has a younger daughter , added that he does n't blame the other girl for her parents â apparent bigotry
â i guess us as parents need to be more aware and conscious about what we teach our children , â he said
hurt : harmony 's father , christopher jones , said he was surprised and upset when he read the letter , but he does not blame its young author the harmony jones family said they did not let the ugly incident ruin harmony 's sleepover

according to the dad , harmony has made many new friendships since enrolling at the school , including with the 10 - year - old girl who penned the offensive note
' [ i ] never thought anything like this would happen , â he told fox 13 .
