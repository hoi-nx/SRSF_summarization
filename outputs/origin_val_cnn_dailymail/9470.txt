an australia woman who contracted a life - threatening infection after a breast implant procedure at a thailand hospital , later requiring a partial double mastectomy , said she was ' butchered ' by cosmetic surgeons
ms o'keefe chose a $ 7,500 cosmetic surgery tourism package as a reward to herself after losing 35kg and her breasts appearing ' like pancakes '
she said she was told she was going to have ' the best time of her life '
but ms o'keefe said she was shocked at the result of the operation
' i 've been absolutely butchered , ' she said
with implants : o'keefe is pictured here , with her implants , after spending more than six months in hospital for a deadly infection
ms o'keefe has since had the implants removed and a double mastectomy , but still has a long path of reconstructive surgery ahead after they were taken out : this picture shows ms o'keefe 's breasts after her implants were extracted from her body
she will receive re-constructive surgery from the cosmetic institute in sydney , who have stumped up to assist her ms o'keefe is pictured here following her double mastectomy , holding both of her implants in each hand
the implants were removed on december 17
ms o'keefe has not worked since she was struck down by the infection ms o'keefe said she was in ' agony ' upon returning to australia and her mother whisked her to hospital shortly after she arrived back home in perth
' we went straight to armidale emergency , ' she said
' i was there for 5 minutes and she admitted me up to a room
' i was in an isolation room becaues they didnt have any clue what i had ... they swabbed , and it took four days to figure out what it was
' it was the beginning of a six month ordeal , with ms o'keefe spending time at both armidale and fremantle hospitals
she was diagnosed with the rare bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa , which the centre for disease control said is often contracted by patients in hospital , particularly those with wounds from surgery or hooked up to medical devices
ms o'keefe is pictured here after her stay in hospital , when she still had implants her condition worsened
' it was also turning septic and was starting to shut down my liver , my kidneys , my heart , my brain , ' she said
' mum and dad had to come and say goodbye to me twice , ' said ms o'keefe
doctors called in respected specialists to treat the condition , and they concocted a special substance to fight it
a pic ( peripherally inserted central catheter ) was installed inside her so she could receive a constant stream of antibiotics
on december 17 , 2014 , nearly a year after her ordeal , surgeons removed her implants because the infection had returned
because the infection had spread to her surrounding tissue , both her breasts were also removed
' i will never be able to life a normal life ' : ms o'keefe is pictured following the surgery to remove both of her breasts but her ordeal is not completely over
ms o'keefe has suffered kidney and liver problems because of the medication required to treat her infection
she told daily mail australia she had coughed up blood and that doctors said she may require surgery if she does not improve
she lost her job and has not worked since the ordeal began
she had to move back in with her mother
' i 'm never going to live a normal life , ' she said
ms o'keefe urged australia examining plastic surgery overseas to reconsider
' someone said it to me a couple of weeks ago
if you would n't drink the water there why the hell would you have surgery there
' ms o'keefe will undergo reconstructive surgery at the cosmetic institute in sydney .
