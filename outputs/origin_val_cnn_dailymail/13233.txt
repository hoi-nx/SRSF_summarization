two former neighbors of bieber have filed a lawsuit against the pop star , claiming he and his bodyguards repeatedly harassed them and their family , vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them with anti-semitic remarks
in the lawsuit jeffrey and suzanne schwartz say bieber hosted frequent loud parties and spat in jeffrey schwartz ' face after he complained about the pop star driving his ferrari at dangerous speeds down the street of their gated community in calabasas , california
the suit , filed thursday in los angeles superior court , also alleges bieber 's bodyguards dismissed jeffrey schwartz 's complaints by taunting him repeatedly with " what are you going to do about it , jew boy ? " the suit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial
representatives for bieber did not immediately respond to requests for comment thursday afternoon
the lawsuit comes after bieber , 21 , pleaded guilty last july to a misdemeanor vandalism charge stemming from a january 9 , 2014 incident in which the schwartzes ' house was pelted with dozens of eggs
bieber agreed to pay $ 80,900 in restitution for damages to the house and was placed on two years ' probation
it 's the latest chapter in a string of legal troubles for the polarizing former teen idol , who in recent years has been convicted of careless driving and resisting arrest and is facing dangerous driving and assault charges after his atv collided with a minivan last august in canada
thursday 's lawsuit alleges a nine - month pattern of " offensive " behavior by bieber and members of his entourage from march 2013 to january 2014
the schwartzes , who lived next door to bieber , claim the harassment escalated after a march 27 , 2013 episode in which bieber spat in jeffrey schwartz ' face and threatened to " f --- ing kill " him
the following year , after the egging episode made headlines , the schwartzes say they and their children were subject to " constant harassment " by bieber 's entourage , fans and the media
the couple are seeking damages on the grounds of assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress
bieber sold the calabasas house for $ 7
2 million last year to khloe kardashian and has since been renting a $ 60,000 - a - month home in beverly hills , according to forbes .
