today 's long awaited report into british 's surveilance powers was sparked by the snowden revelations gchq was last night cleared of carrying out mass surveillance of the public using vast trawls of internet traffic
the intelligence and security committee said the central claims made by the guardian newspaper on the back of documents stolen by us whistle - blower snowden were wrong and it cleared the government âs listening station of wrongdoing
after an 18 - month inquiry , the committee dismissed the claims that gchq had â blanket coverage â of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages
in reality , it said , gchq can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a â tiny fraction â of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process
the committee concluded that the only items seen by analysts were those of the â highest intelligence value â , and these amounted to several thousand a day
tory mp mark field , a member of the committee , said : â the big mistake that snowden and the guardian made in its coverage was to equate bulk data with bulk surveillance
â the truth is that the filtering process means that a tiny proportion of the bulk data that is collected is ever examined
â that point was never really made by the guardian , who gave the impression that with every phone call , every email and every text message , the public had a spy on their shoulder
â labour mp hazel blears said the â two main claims â made off the back of the snowden leaks were untrue and surveillance was neither blanket nor indiscriminate
â what we âve found is that the way in which the agencies use the capabilities they have is authorised , lawful , necessary and proportionate
labour mp hazel blears chaired the press conference on the intelligence and security committee 's long - awaited report into british 's spy agencies gchq headquarters , based in cheltenham , is the government 's main listening post and is allowed to monitor people 's ' communications ' to uncover terror threats â but what we âve also found is there is a degree of confusion and lack of transparency about the way in which this is authorised in our legal system
' it is that lack of transparency that leads to people reaching the conclusion that there is blanket surveillance , indiscriminate surveillance
â another committee member , tory mp dr julian lewis , compared the process to using a magnet to pull a needle from a haystack
the agency does not have the â legal authority , the resources or the technical capability â to intercept such vast amounts of material , the report concluded
the committee recommended a new law bringing together all the intelligence and security legislation
' the allegation arising from the [ snowden ] leaks is that gchq â hoover up â and collect all internet communications
some of those who gave evidence to this inquiry said â the agencies are monitoring the whole stream all the time â , referring to the â apparent ubiquity of surveillance â
' we have explored whether this is the case
it is clear that both for legal reasons and due to resource constraints , it is not : gchq can not conduct indiscriminate blanket interception of all communications
â it would be unlawful for them to do so , since it would not be necessary or proportionate , as required by [ the regulation of investigatory powers act ]
moreover , gchq do not have the capacity to do so and can only cover a fraction of internet communications ' british 's spy agencies have to get a warrant to monitor an individual 's emails , phone calls and other communications
the warrants are signed off by the foreign secretary philip hammond ( left ) or home secretary theresa may ( right ) shami chakrabarti , director of rights campaign group liberty , said the parliamentary committee was ' clueless and ineffective ' councils were given more authorisations to access private communications data last year than gchq and mi6 , it emerged last night
town halls accessed records of telephone , text or internet use 2,110 times last year , the interception of communications commissioner said
that compares to 1,291 approvals for gchq and 652 for mi6
mi5 , which makes the vast bulk of such applications , was given 48,639 authorisations last year
councils can use the powers to investigate fly tipping , benefit fraud , and trading standards â crimes â
communities secretary eric pickles said : â the use by some town halls seems excessive â as if they were acting out their james bond fantasies
i would encourage the press and public to investigate their actions further on why use is so high
â there is also a case for further tightening of these municipal snooping powers
â snowden , who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in hawaii , released 1.7million files in one of the biggest security leaks in us history
he fled to russia , where he was granted asylum
shami chakrabarti , director of human rights group liberty , condemned the report , adding : â no doubt it would be simpler if we went along with the spies â motto of â no scrutiny for us , no privacy for you â â but what an appalling deal for the british public
â a guardian spokesman said : â the snowden revelations provoked a global debate about the role of intelligence and surveillance in the free world , and the extent to which it should be the subject of democratic and judicial oversight
following the recent investigatory powers tribunal ruling , it is now clear that the gchq and nsa mass surveillance programmes revealed by snowden were illegal
