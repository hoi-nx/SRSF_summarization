cruise companies last night cancelled all stops in tunis following the terrorist attack
an association which looks after more than 50 cruise operators â including p&o , thomson and cunard â said no ships would be calling at the city â in the foreseeable future â
the mass cancellations follow a stark warning from the foreign office that â further attacks are possible â
the foreign office has also advised holidaymakers to only travel to the interior of the country with a â reputable tour guide â
holiday companies thomson and first choice said they had also cancelled voyages to tunis , while p&o , princess and celebrity cruises said they were taking advice from security services
a spokesman for the clia said last night : â no clia member ships are scheduled to call at tunis in the foreseeable future
â cruise lines coordinate closely with national and international authorities when visiting destinations around the globe to help ensure passenger safety
â last year , 425,000 british holidaymakers visited tunisia and last night there were fears that as many as 6,500 could still be in the country
however a spokesman for thomson and first choice said : â our customers stay in beach destinations , not tunis , and we can confirm that none of our customers or staff were affected by wednesday âs events
â he added that , as a precaution , all excursions to tunis have been cancelled
meanwhile a spokesman for travel agent association abta said the tourist season was only just getting under way but safety was always a priority
he told sky news : â tourist numbers to tunisia have picked up over the last two years and we have had very healthy bookings for this summer
the season really picks up around mid-april to may
warning : it comes following a stark warning from the foreign office that â further attacks are possible â
pictured : tourists flee from the bardo museum in tunis after wednesday 's attack â we now have a developing situation
abta follows foreign office advice very closely and safety is always the main concern
â bob atkinson , a travel expert at travelsupermarket , added : â tour operators have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their tour operators
â consumers who already have holidays booked this year will want to be convinced of the safety â most of them will be staying at beach resorts and the vast bulk would not even go to tunis on a day trip
â the tunis outrage has tragic echoes of the november 1997 luxor massacre in egyptian , when gunmen killed 58 foreign holidaymakers including six british
tour operators pulled out of the egyptian market and it was some time before holidays started again
the clia spokesperson continued : â cruise line security personnel , in addition to ongoing communication with national and international security authorities , enhance the security of cruise ships
â clia members maintain rigorous policies and procedures designed to safeguard passengers
