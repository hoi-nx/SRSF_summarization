last summer , for a party at home in devon , we thought it would be fun to make an earth oven where you dig a hole in the garden , light a fire and cook meat â in this case , lamb â in the ground
but by 7pm , it was clear the meat was nât cooking quickly enough
already , the children were starting to go rogue
i had lots of mouths to feed , but nothing to put on plates
if my guests were nât going to go home hungry , i âd have to do something quickly
i rushed to my larder and breathed a sigh of relief
there on the shelves were enough ingredients to feed the five thousand
indeed , my sister sofie always jokes that we could survive a nuclear winter with the contents of my larder
kirstie allsopp ( pictured ) says her well - stocked larder is the pride of her home , and even had a bespoke larder specially made after discovering her second home did n't come with one already built - in i âm not saying it was something jamie oliver would have been proud to put his name to , but from a range of foods that included tomatoes , flour , milk , cheese , pine nuts and chilli oil , i made three types of sauces and served them with pasta
my larder had saved the day
according to research , the larder has come back in from the cold
john lewis say that half of their customers shopping for new kitchens want to integrate a larder into their design
last week , david cameron was photographed preparing a meal in his kitchen at downing street
next to his super-huge fridge was a modest but perfectly formed larder , stocked with everything from marmite to mango chutney
some say the resurgence is thanks to downton abbey , with inspirational scenes of patmore and assistant cook daisy in their larder
indeed , the very word â larder â makes you think of the cavernous cold rooms found in stately homes such as highclere castle ( where downton abbey is filmed ) , which traditionally were bursting with salted meat , pickles , preserves and fresh bread
but you âve never had to be a lord to own a larder
in the fifties , even the most modest new - build would have had a walk - in space at the back of the kitchen where food was stored
there was wall - to - floor shelving and often a marble shelf to keep food such as butter and cheese as chilled as possible
kitchen suppliers and property agents have reported that more buyers are now looking for built - in larders like kirstie allsopp 's ( pictured )
' a good larder can even add value to a property , ' says the tv presenter it was the arrival of the fridge in the mid-fifties that dampened our ardour for the larder
though the first ones cost the equivalent of Â£ 4,500 in today âs money , as prices came down and more people were able to afford one , larders went out of fashion
and that âs a shame
in the american , where summers are baking hot , i can see why the fridge is a necessity
but in our damp , cold climate , do we really need quite so much of our food kept at temperatures close to freezing ? the simple answer is â no â
unless we âre in the middle of a heatwave , most food can be kept for several days in the dark , cool climate of a larder
eggs , for instance , should keep beautifully fresh for several weeks in a cool larder
tomatoes taste infinitely better straight from the larder , as do avocados , bananas , apples and oranges
some say the resurgence is thanks to downton abbey , with inspirational scenes of mrs patmore ( right ) and assistant cook daisy ( left ) in their larder i do nât keep any of my jams , pickles or sauces in the fridge : i do nât want chilled jam on my toast
i do nât even keep my cheese in the fridge , particularly runny french varieties
health and safety would say i âm endangering the health of my family â but i have nât poisoned anyone yet
to be honest , my larder is one of my favourite things in our home
there was already a larder in our house in devon , so when we moved into our second house in west london nine years ago , i had one built into the kitchen
it âs 5ft by 6ft , with four deep shelves around three of the walls
it has a wine rack and spice rack , as well as a free - standing rack for veg
true to tradition , there âs a marble shelf and a small window , which we keep open
kirstie allsopp ( pictured ) loves her larder so much , she chooses to use it more frequently than her fridge
' not only does food taste better , there âs also far less waste , ' says the location , location star my partner ben hated it and wanted me to knock it down as soon as he saw it
i stood my ground , and he now admits it âs one of the great triumphs in the house
to start with , i confess , my use of the shelves was pretty chaotic
but a few years ago , while we were on holiday , our super-organised nanny heather rearranged all the shelves
she bought dozens of containers and jars from lakeland and transformed that little room
now , i âm a slave to its military precision
sometimes , i âll go in and just stand there , admiring the neatly lined - up packets and jars
i took a picture of it at its tidiest and attached it to the door , with a note : â please keep the larder this way ! â as we only have two cupboards in our entire kitchen , it âs not just food that we keep in the larder
our medicines , alcohol , mixers , tupperware , picnic stuff and thermos flasks are stored there , too
kirstie allsopp reveals that she now only has two storage cupboards in her kitchen ( pictured ) , instead storing everything from spices and sauces to alcohol , medicines , tupperwear and picnic sets in her beloved larder the only things we do nât keep in it are chemicals for cleaning and washing
we do own a fridge
in fact , we recently got our first new fridge
( ben is a property developer , so we âve always had hand - me - down fridges
) but while most people âs fridges are bursting at the seams , if you open the door to ours , it looks as if we have nât shopped for a month
so , why do i love my larder so much ? well , not only does food taste better , there âs also far less waste
we âre a shockingly profligate nation , throwing a third of the fresh food we buy
i wonder how much of this is due to our groceries getting â lost â at the back of a crammed fridge ? it âs so much more convenient to walk into a single small area and see exactly what items you have at a glance
' unless we âre in the middle of a heatwave , most food can be kept for several days in the dark , cool climate of a larder , ' says kirstie allsopp ( pictured in her kitchen ) my tv colleague phil spencer says he âs noticed an increase in buyers asking for a larder when searching for property
that does nât surprise me
there âs something about a larder that appeals to our emotions to do with providing for our family
though i âm not a hoarder when it comes to things like clothes , there âs something reassuring about seeing enough pasta , rice and even medicines on the shelves to know that if the shops all shut tomorrow , and civilisation collapsed , i could feed my family for a while longer
a larder is more ecological , too
these awful american monolith fridges use an extortionate amount of energy , while even the average fridge uses two units of electric power per hour â enough to run a small tv for 20 hours
but a larder , well , apart from a light switch , it âs energy free
what âs more , it adds value to the house â though it âs hard to say precisely how much
but this is nât about money
i âve always said that a house only works if the kitchen works â and for me , the larder is the secret of a truly successful kitchen
i would nât be without mine
