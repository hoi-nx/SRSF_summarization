an artist has created the world 's smallest sculpture only for it to be accidentally crushed by a finger while being photographed
hurwitz 's creations are so tiny they can rest on a human hair and are the same size of an ant 's head
having spent months working on the pieces , the 45 - year - old from chichester , west sussex , took them to a photographer to have them pictured under a microscope
but within minutes his work had been destroyed by the stroke of the lab technician 's finger
' the technician went to change the orientation and then for the next half an hour we were looking for the piece through the lens
' eventually i noticed there was a fingerprint exactly where the sculpture used to be and i was like " man you have just destroyed the smallest art pieces " ever made - i slightly freaked out
' the sculptures are less than 1mm tall and are produced via a process called nano - painting
they are too small to be seen with the naked eye so must be viewed and photographed under a microscope
mr hurwitz uses a 3d printing technology to produce them
describing the process on his website , he said : ' the structure is created using a ground - breaking new 3d printing technology and a technique called multiphoton lithography
mr hurwitz has produced a number of nano sculptures using the same technology though the naked woman above is believed to have been the smallest the artist from chichester , west sussex , described his work as a combination of ' art and quantum physics ' ' ultimately these works are created using the physical phenomenon of two photon absorption
art , literally created with quantum physics
' this two photon absorption occurs only at the tiny focal point - basically a tiny 3d pixel ( called a voxel )
' the sculpture is then moved along fractionally by a computer controlled process and the next pixel is created
slowly , over hours and hours the entire sculpture is assembled pixel by pixel and layer by layer
' the sculptures are believed to be the smallest representation of the human form ever created by man .
