magic from juan mata at times i âve felt like a bit of an apologist for juan mata
at anfield on sunday , he showed his class
all game his touch was like velvet and he showed fantastic technical quality with two devastating finishes
i âve heard some man united fans and ex-pros saying he âs got no pace or he ca nât do this or that
when he gets in the right place at the right time , he can cut open any team
he has a fantastic football brain and his decision - making is so quick that he does nât need to be fast
if you can read the game that well and take up intelligent positions then pace is not necessary
nothing moves faster than the ball
juan mata scored twice as man united beat liverpool at anfield - he showed his class throughout juan mata has a fantastic footballing brain his decision - making is so quick that he does nât need to be fast juan mata has made 91 passes in his last two games , more than any other man united midfielder sunday âs performance was a nod to all those who have written him off
he was good against tottenham but he was sensational at anfield
the acid test for any player is how well you perform in big games and they do nât get any bigger than liverpool against man united
it was a game for cool heads and that âs what juan mata had
it âs a shame the same ca nât be said for steven gerrard
watching on , he will have been at boiling point
he must have been wondering why he was on the bench when players not in his class were struggling to make an impact on the pitch
but even though i have some sympathy , that âs still no excuse
steven gerrard will have been fired up after coming off the bench but there is no excuse for what he did it 's perfect for pardew alan pardew was delighted after crystal palace came back to win at stoke
when he left newcastle for crystal palace , even he could nât have seen things going this well
he is at a club where he âs loved and since the switch crystal palace âs results have been far superior to newcastle âs
six wins and a draw means crystal palace have overtaken newcastle , so all credit to him
harry must be in dreamland what a week for harry kane
he gets called up for england duty and responds with a first premier league hat - trick
the boy is on fire
last month i picked him out as my player of the season
a few people might have laughed at me for that , but i âm sure they âre not laughing any more
only one player could take it off harry kane now , and that âs eden hazard , but with three more goals , harry kane âs done nothing to make me change my mind
harry kane scored his first premier league hat - trick against leicester and is still my player of the season bristol booming bristol has always been a big rugby area , but it âs got a great football tradition as well and steve cotterill added his own chapter of history at wembley on sunday
bristol city controlled the game in the johnstone âs paint trophy final and deserved their success
steve cotterill is an excellent coach and an ambitious manager and that result should set them up to go on and win league one
with excellent fans and committed backers , it âs time for bristol city to dream big
steve cotterill 's bristol city deserve their success and should go on and win league one this season chelsea close in when i saw the score at the kc stadium go to 2 - 2 , i started to look at the league table
would this bring bristol city back into the title race ? would it give arsenal a sniff ? were man united even in with a chance ? then loic remy scores a late goal and chelsea keep their lead at the top
when we look back at the end of the season , that could well be the result that wins chelsea the title
after going out of the champions league and drawing at home to southampton , a draw at hull would have piled the pressure on
defensively they were poor and john terry and gary cahill found hull âs pace hard to deal with
now they have breathing space
they have tough games to come , including man united and liverpool at home and arsenal away , but results like this will help get them over the line
chelsea 's win against hull on sunday could prove to be the result that wins them the title what more can big sam do ? the last time west ham had 42 points at this stage of a premier league season was in 2007 - 08
that year they finished 10th with 49 points in total it may not have been a pretty watch at upton park on saturday , but it was a significant win for west ham and big sam
victory over sunderland took the club to 42 points , which is more than they won in the whole of last season
and i do nât care what anybody says , big sam has done a good job at west ham
he saved them from relegation last year , rebuilt over the summer and some of their attacking football in the first half of the season was fantastic to watch
but for whatever reason , his face does nât seem to fit and i suspect he will move on in the summer
if that happens , i âm sure there will be plenty of suitors for big sam
he is a talented manager and something of a relegation specialist , so do nât be surprised if he waits until a struggling club comes calling
big sam has done a good job at west ham despite what people say - some of their football is fantastic meeting the maestro it was a privilege to be at the nou camp last week to see lionel messi put in a magical performance in the champions league
i used to worry that we might have seen the best of the little magician
his delivery to set up jeremy mathieu âs opener in el clasico on sunday night was spot on and he was sensational against bristol city last week
the only problem was he would nât stop bugging me and carra for a photo ... lionel messi ( centre ) poses for a photograph with jamie redknapp and jamie carragher at the nou camp
