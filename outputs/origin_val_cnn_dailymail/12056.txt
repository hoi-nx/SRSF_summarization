while abbott is in new zealand spruiking his national security plans , it looks like the security of his job as prime minister is , for the second time this month , in question

but they 've said the move would have to be initiated by senior ministers from the cabinet
since these reported emerged on saturday , supporters of ms julie bishop have claimed the foreign affairs minister is against the move however she would stand against mr turnbull if the spill were to eventuate
however it is believed ms julie bishop ( left ) is against another spill motion but will stand against mr turnbull if it goes ahead ms julie bishop publically backed mr abbott on saturday saying she supported the ' the leader that the party has elected '
' i am not aware of any attempt to bring a spill motion to challenge the leadership
' ms julie bishop is n't alone with rumours that trade minister , andrew robb , is vying for the role , however , mr andrew robb has also publically backed abbott , saying he had earned the right to contest the next election
senior cabinet ministers claim mr andrew robb has labelled the communications minister as ' not conservative enough ' to lead the party , reports the daily telegraph
trade minister , andrew robb , stands by mr abbott claiming mr turnbull is n't conservative enough to lead the party reports say although a significant group of frontbenchers are publicly loyal to the prime minister , many admit behind closed doors , he will not make the next election

with a state election looming and the party rife with the same instability that was labor 's undoing , some ministers are claiming the prime minister is ' toxic ' and will drag mike baird 's vote in new south wales by up to seven per cent in some key seats
ms julie bishop ( left ) and mr abbott ( right ) have been fielding questions about the leadership challenge while in new zealand for the annual australia - new zealand leaders ' meeting communications minister , turnbull , has been told he has the numbers to take leadership in a spill motion mr turnbull has chosen to stay tight lipped about the speculation , instead focusing his and the media 's attention on the upcoming election
' the question the people of new south wales have is do they want to put back into power the party of eddie obeid , ' said mr turnbull
federal mp bob katter chimed in , likening the liberal to a ' pit of snakes '
' if you 've got no belief system and what you 've got is a pit of snakes , that 's all you 've got , ' he told the nine network
' everyone wants to be leader , everyone wants to be in the ministry
' it would be really nice if the lnp put some people in government who are interested in governing the country , instead of being interested in getting promoted into a ministry or from the ministry into leadership positions
' speculation is rife in canberra about what could be a second spill in a month as more liberal mps are believed to have joined the 39 out of 102 who supported a spill motion on february 9 .
