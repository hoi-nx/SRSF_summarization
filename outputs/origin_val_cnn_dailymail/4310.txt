england 's opponents in next week 's friendly , italy , have the best defence in europe and the statistics prove it
having shipped four goals in 14 games , italy , who face bulgaria in a euro 2016 qualifier on saturday before hosting roy hodgson 's side on tuesday , have the meanest rearguard in europe in terms of goals conceded in this qualifying competition and its predecessor
with next best england having let in six goals in 12 games , italy defender leonardo bonucci said on thursday that is clear that when it comes to shutting out the opposition , italy are the best in the business
leonardo bonucci trains with the italy squad ahead of their games against bulgaria and england leonardo bonucci says his italians defence , with buffon and chiellini , is the best in the world ' i believe so , ' juve and italy defender leonardo bonucci told a news conference
' i do n't want to sound boastful but ( buffon ) buffon ( chiellini ) chiellini , ( andrea ) andrea barzagli and myself are the best when you 're talking about international competition
' the numbers do n't lie
' with andrea barzagli recently returning to fitness , italy coach antonio conte can field the same defenders that helped him win three league titles in his previous role as juve manager
' i 'm very happy that andrea ( andrea barzagli ) is back
we 've been playing together forever and this helps , ' leonardo bonucci said
' especially , when we are a back three , i can lead them in pressuring opponents and they know that i 'll be a few steps behind and help out , if they need me
' italy visit bulgaria on saturday , where they have not won in five previous attempts
england managed to score once against the italians at the world cup , but still ended up losing in manaus leonardo bonucci says having his juve team - mates together in international football is an advantage buffon and chiellini have been two key players for juve and italy for many years ' our attitude is to try to dictate play and put pressure on them starting in their own end but we 'll have to be careful as their counterattack is dangerous , ' leonardo bonucci said
italy are second to croatia on goal difference in group h on 10 points and have conceded two goals in four games
antonio conte , who replaced cesare prandelli after last year 's disappointing world cup campaign in which italy failed to make it out of the group stage , is , according to leonardo bonucci , meticulous in his attention to detail
andrea barzagli ( right ) returns for italy after an injury layoff , and will offer even more stability antonio conte worked with the juve back three , and buffon , for several years , and is now italy boss the coach has his players sit through two hours of video every morning , where he goes over past games and talks about upcoming matches
' the boss is a very charismatic person , ' leonardo bonucci said
' he prepares each game in minute detail
' as soon as we got here he showed us our last two matches ( against croatia and albania ) and not a day went by , when he was at juve , in which he did not have us watching recorded games
' i believe it 's very helpful to look at what you did in the past and learn from it
