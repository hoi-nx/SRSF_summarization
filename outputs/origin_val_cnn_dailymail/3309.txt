bags of dead dogs and roosters - believed to be from illegal animal fights - are being dumped alongside a suburban dallas roadside
local residents and animal rights activists have joined together to force the local police to attempt to discover the source of the gruesome fights - and try to put a halt to the brutal baiting
some are more worried that local gangs are acting with impunity nearby and have complained about the safety of their children from those who dump the dead animals and from the rotting , disease - ridden carcasses
gruesome : inside this bag are the dismembered bodies of dead dogs and roosters that are turning up alongside southeast dallas highways ' my daughters live right here , my son , ' said a man who spoke to cbs and wished to be identified only as michael
' if they 'll do that to a dog , what will they do to a human ? ' michael said that he usually finds stray dogs lining the roadside but recently he and another animal rescuer saw someone throw bags from a pickup truck
' it was the bags with all the dead dogs , mush , decomposed bodies , roosters , matted hair
it was hor - i mean , it stunk
you can imagine how it smelled , ' said michael to cbs
gross : locals fear that a gang - related animal fighting ring is dumping the dead bodies along the dallas road strays : dogs are usually left by their owners along the stretch of road - but now dead dogs are turning up - much to local residents disgust on another day michael found bags full of dead chickens and then sadly , more dogs
' it was something you might see in a horror movie , ' said michael to cbs
local residents fear an animal fighting ring and the involvement of gangs and say that police are not investigating
however , a local dallas police department spokesman said that they are working with animal control to find the culprits .
