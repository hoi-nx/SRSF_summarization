' i regret stooping to the level of those threatening and abusing my family
' my mobile number was placed on a social media website recently and it led to a barrage of abuse about my mother , father , wife , children and myself
' in hindsight the aim of this was clear , and i foolishly opted to challenge some of the abuse , harassment and threats
' given my position , i should have acted with more responsibility and reported the abusive text messages , phone calls and answer phone messages to the police , rather than get embroiled in such an exchange

he has no choice but to resign
