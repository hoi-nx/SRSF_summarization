sometimes negotiations concerning adding or removing point from the list were really tough
' in the first part of our trip we were travelling by bus
we were going from santiago through melipeuco to pucon
in bariloche we decided to rent a car
so we rented small city car , but sometimes it was hard to drive hundreds of kilometres on gravel roads of ruta 40
