hall , who suffered from rasmussen âs syndrome , died from a brain haemorrhage nine days after he was attacked by two teenagers a teenager changed his facebook status to â full - time killer â after a disabled man he attacked later died of a brain haemorrhage
hall died 11 days after he was punched to the ground and repeatedly kicked by the 15 - year - old and an accomplice of the same age in an unprovoked attack
but despite one of the attackers taking to facebook to mock his victim â who was known to the youth âs family â and calling himself a killer , the pair walked free from court yesterday
they were given community orders and told to attend a rehabilitation programme
the sentence followed the cps âs insistence that it could not link the attack to 28 - year - old mr hall âs death
his family criticised the decision not to charge the youths over the death and said â the punishment should fit the crime â
instead , the teenagers were taken to court to face the lesser charge of assault causing actual bodily harm
newton aycliffe magistrates â court was told that mr hall , who had both physical and learning difficulties , lived his final days in terror following the attack
he was confronted by the youths in newton hall , durham , last july , beaten up and left unconscious
he was taken to hospital and later released
nine days later his mother found him lying at the foot of the stairs at the family home in framwellgate moor , durham
despite being taken back to hospital and regaining consciousness , he died two days later
an inquest found that a â blunt force trauma â led to mr hall âs death from a brain haemorrhage but said it could find no evidence the attack was directly linked
the youths , who can not be identified for legal reasons , initially denied the assault but admitted the offence at the magistrates â court on wednesday
the victim âs sister zoe hall , 25 , told the court : â [ the defendants â ] actions resulted in him being frightened for the last week of his life
he was constantly upset and could nât understand why someone would want to hurt him
â thugs : hall was kicked as he lay on the ground outside newton hall library ( pictured ) in durham atkinson , prosecuting , said mr hall had been trying to walk away from a verbal altercation with his attackers when he was pounced on
he said : â he was punched in the face
that knocked him to the ground and witnesses describe both young men kicking him while he was on the ground
â witnesses ran to mr hall âs aid before he was taken to hospital and later released
â mr hall suffered from rasmussen âs syndrome , which affected his balance , speech and the way he walked , â said mr atkinson
â his disability must have been apparent to his attackers
â the youths , now 16 , had no previous convictions and were said to be remorseful
mr hall âs family discovered they would not be charged with causing his death at an earlier hearing in january
at a hearing at newton aycliffe magistrates ' court ( pictured ) , both teenagers pleaded guilty to assaulting mr hall and were given community orders at the time his mother carol hall , 56 , said : â i âm totally gutted
the punishment should fit the crime
â a cps spokesman said : â the coroner found no evidence to link the death of mr hall with an alleged assault some two weeks before
â the mother of the teenager who boasted of being a killer said : â i do nât know why he attacked hall , he has never been able to explain it
' i knew some of hall âs family quite well and it âs hard to describe how sorry i am
â it has devastated us as a family but of course nowhere near the suffering the hall family has experienced
â they could never prove there was any link between the attack and hall âs death but we all know the attack should nât have happened
