william tallon was more than just the mother âs favourite servant
he rose from impoverished beginnings to become her confidant and close friend
as the first part of a remarkable new biography revealed last week , william tallon was also a predatory homosexual who breached royal security by bringing young men back to clarence house at night
and he made powerful enemies
here , in the final extract of backstairs billy , we reveal that courtiers took their revenge by banishing him from the mother âs side , shamefully disregarding her wish that he should be allowed to live at clarence house for the rest of his life
and whatever became of his meticulous diary , the â black book â of life with the royals ? so close : backstairs billy with the mother on her 88th birthday in 1988 ( right )
he cuts a lonely figure in 2003 ( left ) , a year after her death within days of william tallon âs death in november 2007 , a small group of men were seen entering his flat in kennington , south london
all backstairs billy âs possessions were boxed up and put in storage
there is no proof that things went missing , but the speed with which events occurred shocked his friends , one of whom said : â it was all very odd
would you expect your former employer to visit your house and go through your things ? we do nât know for sure , but that âs what we think happened â the royal household had sent a team to go through backstairs billy âs possessions before they were sold ... â william tallon would tell anyone who listened that the mother had promised him that his little gatehouse cottage at clarence house would be his home for life
â i thought she had left instructions to that effect but i could hardly ask her to put it in writing to me , â he said
â i suppose i was rather naive in thinking that a letter would survive if it meant everyone had to put up with me for a few more years
in some ways they were quite ruthless , you know
â rumours : backstairs billy said he knew princess diana was having affairs while still married to charles some months after the mother âs death in march 2002 , backstairs billy received a short letter telling him that gate lodge had to be vacated
the deadline gave him little time , but he obediently packed his things and left
there was no leaving party , no letter of thanks , no formal goodbye
an official made sure he was out on time
backstairs billy did nât find his new life easy
his 51 years of service had given him no time to learn how to live in the evenings and at weekends
for years he had organised lunches and dinners for the mother , but he had never had to make his own meals
now his life of privilege was over : he shambled along to the shops like any other elderly single man
he began to eat irregularly and sometimes not at all
he was also shocked at the cost of a good bottle of wine
backstairs billy had developed a taste for the finer things in life and he was suddenly cut off from them all
backstairs billy was an amusing man with a remarkable history and he was invited to an endless series of parties , which gave him a faint glow of the life he had once enjoyed with the mother
â i go to these things because i find it so difficult to be on my own , â he confessed
â i enjoy the parties , but would happily give them up if i could go back to my old life
â backstairs billy spent night after night in his local pub , the dog house , where he would get drunk and invite all and sundry back to the flat â anything was better than being alone
a friend recalled : â backstairs billy sometimes went into terrible glooms that were alleviated only by alcohol
it was a habit he had got into at clarence house
alcohol restored some of his charm , his confidence and his wit
but the fact he was no longer drinking the finest wines in the finest company â as he saw it â took a lot of getting used to and he never really managed it
â despite being regaled as the grand old man of royal service , his friends say that backstairs billy became a humbler figure in exile
power had corrupted him and he knew it
he had been beastly , he once said , to some of those who worked for him and i think he felt rather bad about it
â i was naive , i suppose , â he said
â the household disliked me because i was too close to the mother
i remember one of the advisers saying , â who on earth do you think you are ? â i replied , â i âm a shopkeeper âs son from coventry but i âm afraid my company is preferable to yours
â i enjoyed my little victory , but i ca nât imagine he ever forgave me
â in his most bitter moments , he recalled how , in the mother âs last months , when she was too confused to know what was going on around her , he became so frustrated by repeated refusals to let him see her that he became hysterical
he was told that if he did not calm down , the police would be called
close friends : the loyal servant dancing with the mother at balmoral as prince charles watches royal advice : the queen mother ( pictured with queen elizabeth , left , and princess margaret , right ) had told backstairs billy to ' never trust anyone ' â i was upset and they did nât care , â he said
â as far as the household was concerned , i was simply an ex-employee as if i âd worked in the palace for six months washing bottles
it hurt , but the truth is some members of the royal household enjoyed my unhappiness
it was time for their revenge
they knew the mother could no longer protect me so the knives were out
i suppose i was silly not to have known it would happen
â perhaps backstairs billy , more than anyone , should have heeded the advice given to him by the mother , who told him at the beginning of their relationship : â whatever you do , william tallon , never trust anyone
â backstairs billy often told me he wanted to save his best stories for publication
the royals , he explained , are very careful about what they say and do
but backstairs billy knew their secrets
he knew , for example , or at least said he knew , that princess diana was having affairs while still married to prince charles and long before it was generally known that the marriage was in trouble
he also knew a great deal about the younger generation of royals
ironically , given his own lifestyle , he was scathing about the younger ones drinking and tumbling out of clubs at 2am
a close friend of backstairs billy âs said : â he was definitely writing something , which is perhaps why so many odd things happened after he died
â i âm sure that in the same way that someone probably destroyed the mother âs instructions that backstairs billy should be allowed to stay on at gate lodge , they also destroyed whatever it was he had written about his life at clarence house
â when , some months after his funeral , backstairs billy âs possessions came up for auction at a provincial sale room in colchester , essex , they represented just a small part of his possessions
i know that because i visited the flat regularly
another oddity is that not a scrap of written material survived the visit by the unidentified team of young men seen visiting his apartment , including the memoir he was thought to be writing â and especially his â black book â , as his diary was known
william tallon would tell anyone who listened that the mother had promised him his little gatehouse cottage at clarence house ( pictured ) would be his home for life his solicitor , who was also his executor , clearly felt a few letters and mementos were unlikely to fetch a fortune
in the event , however , it took more than ten hours to dispose of more than 700 lots that raised a total close to Â£ 500,000
the highlight was a short , handwritten letter from the mother to backstairs billy asking him to prepare for an outdoor lunch on a trip to scotland
it finishes : â i think that i will take two small bottles of dubonnet and gin with me this morning , in case it is needed
â the letter went to an anonymous bidder for a Â£ 16,000
but the assumption that these memoirs might have been especially revealing , vindictive or damaging to the royal family are probably wrong
backstairs billy felt uniquely privileged to have worked for so long in a job that he loved
