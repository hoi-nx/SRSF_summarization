sunrise panellists whalan and obermeder have come under fire after suggesting parents had the right to choose whether to vaccinate their kids
both mums joined host david koch and commentator shelly horton on the program for a spirited debate about vaccination on wednesday morning
the discussion came just weeks after baby riley hughes died in a perth hospital after suffering complications from whooping cough
in views later labelled ' dangerous and irresponsible ' , ms whalan suggested parents should take anti-vaccination views into consideration
and in a fiery exchange with host david koch , ms obermeder said that parents choose whether or not to vaccinate out of love for their children
shelly horton ( left ) said parents should ' definitely ' vaccinate their children under fire : the daily edition host obermeder ( pictured left ) is the mother of toddler annabelle , while former swimmer whalan ( right ) is pictured while pregnant in 2011 with her husband thomas whalan ms whalan said : ' we are hearing this terrible story ( about riley ) but we are also not hearing figures of people who have also died from being vaccinated as well
' the former olympic swimmer said she vaccinated her children , adding that people need to ' research both sides of the story '
ms obermeder , the host of the daily edition and a mother of one , argued : ' is n't it the parents ' right to choose what they want for their child ? ' ' no parent chooses to do it or not do it because they do n't love their child , ' she told the panel
' parents love their kids , and they make the best decision ... ( they ) think they 're making
' her remarks sparked a heated riposte from david koch , a grandfather and the dad of four adult children
david koch said parents must depend on the word of experts , not ' dr google ' ( or information parents find online )
' there is no argument , ' he said
ms obermeder said parents should speak to their doctors about vaccination and that people would then ' probably decide ' to vaccinate
' no parent chooses to do it or not do it because they do n't love their child ' , ms obermeder told the panel david koch ( left ) said : ' if you talk vaccinations in general , it is n't their decision if it effects somebody else 's child ... not if it affects my grandkids '

i am pro vaccine but you must see every side
' the parents of riley hughes urged parents to get their children vaccinated earlier this month
after their call , west australian authorities approved a plan for mums - to - be to receive free whooping cough vaccinations
around 2500 mums will be eligible to receive the jabs each month
