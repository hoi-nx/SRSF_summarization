police in charlottesville , virginia , will publicly discuss on monday the results of their investigation into an alleged gang rape of a uva student , which was initially reported last year in rolling stone magazine
the police findings could put to rest a complicated controversy about the alleged gang rape of a female student at a fraternity party
the accusation has been controversial because of the nature of such a crime and because the accusation itself has been clouded by subsequent questions about the rolling stone article
after the account was published last fall , rolling stone magazine later apologized for discrepancies in its article about the alleged gang rape after friends of the victim expressed doubts about the woman 's account and the accused fraternity chapter denied key details
cnn senior media correspondent stelter described rolling stone 's announcement as falling short of a full - scale retraction
it remains unclear what really happened to the female student , stelter said
" we are in the phase here where rolling stone is trying to figure that out , " stelter said in december
" they 've apologized , but not retracted
so they 're not saying the story is false
they 're just saying there are some questions they need to figure out the answers to still
" the charlottesville police department will hold its press conference at 2 p.m. et on monday
rolling stone editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly " orchestrated the attack on ' jackie ' ( the woman who was the subject of the article ) nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her , " a decision the magazine said it regretted
" in the face of new information , there now appear to be discrepancies in jackie 's account , and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced , " rolling stone said in december
rolling stone managing editor will dana later tweeted that " the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story
" uva pledges zero - tolerance in rape cases the article chronicled the school 's failure to respond to that alleged assault
it prompted an emergency meeting by the school 's governing board and the announcement of a zero - tolerance approach toward sexual assault cases
according to the magazine , jackie , who at the time had just started her freshman year at the charlottesville school , claimed she was raped by seven men at phi kappa psi fraternity , while two more gave encouragement , during a party
however , the uva 's phi kappa psi chapter did not have a party the night of september 28 , 2012 , the date when the alleged attack occurred , or at all that weekend , the chapter said
the chapter 's lawyer , warthen , told cnn that is proved by email and fraternity records
warthen said there were other discrepancies in the accuser 's account
for example , the accused orchestrator of the alleged rape did not belong to the fraternity , the fraternity house has no side staircase , and there were no pledges at that time of year
jackie told the magazine she hurried out a side staircase after the incident and said her attackers egged each other on , asking , " do n't you want to be a brother ? " cnn 's greg botelho , melissa gray and sara ganim contributed to this report .
