led zeppelin veteran mr page , 71 , has sounded the fears for his grade i listed house in holland park , london - a stone 's throw from the take that star mr williams ' Â£ 17.5million mansion
the pop star , who bought michael winner 's former 46 - room home in 2013 , first sparked mr page 's ire last month with plans for an extension including a lift and recording studio
not a whole lotta love : former take that singer williams wants to extend his london mansion ( left ) - which allegedly could harm the grade i lsited home ( right ) of his neighbour , led zeppelin veteran page take that , williams ! the singer ( left ) has received a fresh complaint from his neighbour page ( right ) then mr wiliams submitted plans for a two - storey basement with a swimming pool - prompting drastic action from mr page , who has been in his house for 43 years
the led zeppelin guitarist hired three firms - architects , structural engineers and town planners - to prepare three separate reports on why the development should be blocked
his biggest fear is that vibrations from the building works could harm his 1870s home , which he describes as a ' masterpiece '
over the years he has conserved the house as a ' custodian ' and claims his restorative works have been labelled ' exemplary ' by english heritage
described as one of the most important homes in the borough , the red - brick tower house was saved from demolition in the 1960s following a campaign led by john betjeman and evelyn waugh
in his latest objection to kensington and chelsea council , mr page wrote : ' similar schemes have been carried out on other properties in the area locally and each time the level of vibration cause during the works has caused concern about the effect on decorative finishes of [ my ] house
stairway to bedlam : williams 's latest plans include a basement complete with a swimming pool , right williams bought the house - which is the former home of michael winner - with his wife ayda field in 2013 ' the work now proposed is much nearer than other major excavations carried out so far and the consequences for the building fabric and decorative finishes ... may well be catastrophic if this project is allowed to proceed
' mr page 's concerns have been supported by a report carried out on his behalf by historical building consultants andrew townsend architects
mr townsend , who has been practising as an architect for nearly 30 years , described mr page 's house as ' one of the most important houses built in this country in the nineteenth century '
' excessive vibration from building works to the adjoining property could have disastrous effects on these decorative finishes ' , he wrote
his report added that it was possible the ' hand - made brickwork ' boundary wall between the two stars ' houses would collapse
surveyors from civil engineering firm clive hudson associates wrote that the home was ' designed by william burges , one of the greatest architects of the 19th century , as his home and contains original and irreplaceable interiors
' mr williams ' house 's main bedroom , pictured during the time the late michael winner lived at the property williams bought the house in 2013 , after the director 's death , and is now keen to renovate the property the west london mansion , pictured in 2011 when winner tried to sell it , includes a swimming pool room they added : ' these unparalleled interiors are of national significance and , we believe , are at serious risk if the applicant 's proposals ( as they currently stand ) are accepted
' and the led zeppelin guitarist included a lengthy report from town planners bell cornwell , which detailed how the plans allegedly fail to meet council recommendations
the 41 - year - old pop singer has said he is simply trying to turn his mansion into a modern family home
but his plans have also upset another wealthy neighbour , marks & spencer heir sieff
mr sieff wrote to kensington and chelsea council to complain about mr williams âs request to install air conditioning units at the bottom of his garden , which backs onto mr sieff âs property
plans on the local council 's website show the extent to which williams plans to re-tile his home 's roof the great - great grandson of mr marks is worried the machines â noise will detract from his quality of life
he wrote that the three units together will produce a constant sound of 43.5db , â which is nearly the same comparison as an adult speaking â
another complaint has come to the council despite being 10,000 miles away in melbourne , australia
despite the strongly - worded objections , one person sent a letter of support to the council
alan dargue , from yorkshire , wrote : ' as the custodian of several listed buildings and a scheduled ancient monument , it is my firm belief that heritage assets are best preserved by their continued use even if this means altering them significantly in order to meet their occupier 's needs
' the council is expected to make its decision on the initial plans by the end of this month
mr williams and mr page have previously declined to comment .
