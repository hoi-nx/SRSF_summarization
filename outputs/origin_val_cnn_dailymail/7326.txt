in his autobiography published late last year , cuomo described himself as the victim in his bitter divorce from kennedy - saying he learned about the break - up from a reporter who called him for comment
but a new biography of the new york governor says he had a larger part in the unraveling of the marriage , which briefly united two political dynasties
vanity fair 's michael shnayerson alleges in ' the contender ' that the couple started talking ' not if but when ' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter michaela in 1997
however , cuomo dragged out the break - up for years - possibly to use his wife 's political clout to fuel his failed 2002 gubernatorial run , the book alleges
doomed : a new biography of cuomo details the bitter divorce between the current new york governor and kennedy , daughter of robert f kennedy
the former couple pictured above on their wedding day in 1990 the new york daily news , which previewed the book , cited michael shnayerson 's sources who said the couple learned they were incompatible fairly early on in their relationship
michael shnayerson did not interview cuomo himself
michael shnayerson quotes a douglas - kennedy 's 46 - year - old younger brother - who says that while cuomo treasured the connection to the kennedy family , he loathed participating in reunions at the family 's estate in hyannis , massachusetts and eventually stopped going altogether
douglas said on one occasion , when the kennedys spent a night partying and singing , cuomo stood by ' looking disgusted '
douglas also described cuomo as a ' bully ' who thought many member 's of his wife 's family as weak or ' political '
not if , but when : author michael shnayerson says in ' the contender ' that cuomo and kennedy started talking not if ' but when ' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter michaela in 1997
the couple pictured above with twins cara ethel and mariah , with father cuomo holding baby michaela staying together for the campaign : kennedy allegedly decided to stay with her husband during his ultimately failed 2002 run for governor
according to the book , the couple agreed to break - up after the campaign , but cuomo kept putting it off the the contender , written by vanity fair writer michael shnayerson , is due out march 31 perhaps one of the most painful digs at the kennedy family was the manhattan party that acted as the informal launch for cuomo 's 2002 campaign for governor
at the party , the rolling stones song ' sympathy for the devil ' was played at high - volume - a song which deals with the assassinations of both president john f kennedy and kennedy father 's robert f kennedy
the kennedy 's who were in the room for the party were aghast , but it 's unclear if cuomo was behind the decision to play the song
disdain for the in - laws was n't the only issue between the political couple
kennedy and cuomo harbored ill - feelings about the little things too , the book claims
when she first started dating cuomo , kennedy allegedly ' rolled her eyes a bit ' when she saw the plastic covers he kept on his furniture
and a friend close to one side of the former couple told michael shnayerson that cuomo was n't dazzled by his wife 's cooking , cleaning or even the ' dowdy ' way she dressed
by the time cuomo started planning his 2002 run for governor , his wife agreed to stay with him through the campaign
but when the campaign failed , cuomo allegedly asked her to stay together for just a little longer
the breaking point for kennedy , according to michael shnayerson , came when cuomo confronted her for having an extra-marital affair with polo player bruce colley
a ' closer observer ' told michael shnayerson that kennedy told cuomo to mind his own business , break the news to the kids and move out of their home
' after 13 years of marriage , and truly stressful times , i knew the ties that bound us together had frayed , ' cuomo wrote in his autobiography all things possible , published late last year
' but i had hoped we could work through what i saw was a difficult time , not an end
obviously , i was in denial
' ' even though kennedy had told me she wanted a divorce i thought i could fix it , i could nât accept it â it only became real when a reporter called and said she filed the papers
