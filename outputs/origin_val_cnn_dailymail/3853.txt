mccall 's nearest and dearest knew what his reaction would be in the event of rangers calling
now 10 days into the job and confronted by his third and most difficult match , a barrage of advice from those friends and family has landed
two dismal draws against relegation candidates livingston and alloa , stretching the winless run to five matches , has damned the playing provision at ibrox now operating under their third manager of a sorry season that mccall was hired to rescue
he has not been short of suggestions aimed at helping him carry out that brief picked up from kenny
â i âve got family and a lot of friends who are rangers supporters and , if it was up to them , they would nât have a team out there because everyone would be dropped , â said mccall
â if you speak to supporters , they are so frustrated and disappointed
mccall has encountered a tricky start to his spell as rangers manager â you speak to one fan who would nât have him in , and another who would nât have him in , and so on
kenny tried all different permutations up front with our five strikers
it âs the same with the backline and the midfield
â people have said it to me : â i would nât have him , him or him in the team â
but that would leave us with about two players and i ca nât flood the team with youngsters
my job is to get the best formula â a winning formula
we âve got time to do it and it âs what i âm striving to do
â the emergency work on a squad ravaged by a confidence slump is required for many reasons and some can be traced back to the recruitment â on bumper contracts â of several top - flight players who have failed to live up to being rangers players even at a lower level
but mccall believes that a more recent explanation for the disarray in his inheritance , which includes four unfit newcastle loan men , is that their direct competitors for promotion â and today âs opponents hibernian â were able to be clever in january
rangers , meanwhile , were chaotic
hibernian have won their past seven games in all competitions since deadline day , reached the scottish cup semi-final and are now unbeaten in 15 matches â a streak of results that stuttering rangers have at no stage looked capable of stringing together
mccall joked that if his family and friends had their way that everybody would be dropped mccall noted : â the key thing for them was the january transfer window when they managed to keep their best young player , scott allan , while we had to sell lewis macleod , who was ours
on top of that , they were able to add five players
â i remember saying to alan at the time what a great piece of business it was to bring in fraser fyvie from dundee united because he âs a really solid premiership player
fraser fyvie , tomas cerny , franck dja djedje and martin boyle have really strengthened their squad
â while they were doing that , rangers brought in five players from newcastle and only one of them has been able to play a part
alan had a clean sweep of his playing staff last summer
it took them time to gel but right now they have energy and confidence and they are hungry as well
so this will be a big challenge for us
â mccall dug into the reserve reaches of the squad to promote the impressive 18 - year - old tom walsh
a dozen years his elder , dean completed a game for only the second time this season
as mccall seeks that winning formula , he has a frustrated and often frustrating figure offering to be an intriguing ingredient today on a return to easter road
â i spoke to dean before we picked him for the alloa game , â said mccall
â i don â t know why he âs only had four starts this season
obviously , there are reasons and dean will be a big part of that
but he did well the other night for a rare 90 minutes
â everyone is in the same boat â when you get an opportunity , you have to grab it
you âve got to show that you want to be out there , in training and games
new boss mccall takes charge of a rangers training session â i know there are players here who want to be in my team
it âs ok being willing and wanting to do it
but there âs a big difference between that and actually producing
â next season , rangers need young , hungry players
of course , you need to balance it with experience
but i âd like to have energy and vibrance in the team next season
â mcgregor , having met the appearance stipulations on his contract , will be back for another season
he can bid to be as energetic and vibrant as mccall wishes but it is defensive fortitude that the boyhood hibernian supporter will be determined to bring today to a rangers team that have lost their past three to the capital club
the 29 - year - old has filled in at right - back â rather than his favoured centre - half slot â too often this season but refuses to blame that adjustment for personal form that he admits has fallen below standard
â i âve been disappointed with how i âve played , â conceded mcgregor
â i need to take accountability as a defender
rangers have limped to unconvincing draws against livingston and alloa under mccall â we âve conceded too many goals
i âve played the majority of our games , so i need to say that i could have done better in certain aspects
â everyone knows that i âm not a natural right - back
but i âd rather play in that position than be in the stand
â to be fair to the previous manager and this manager , their hands have been forced a bit of the time because of injuries
â but i ca nât keep going over old ground
the nine games coming up are the most important of the season
i âm looking at this period as a sort of mini-league in itself
â it will be time for reflection , finger - pointing and talking about where it went wrong in the summer
but we have to be positive and think that , as long as we get up , in years to come that will be forgotten about
â i want my first season at rangers to be capped with promotion
i do nât want it to be a failure , which it currently is
â to come back next season as a premiership player would be special
we all know what the fans expect and the prestige of playing for this club
we âve fallen short of that this year but , if we can get up , it will put some light on an otherwise dark season
