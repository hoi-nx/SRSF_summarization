early humans are widely regarded as having been voracious hunters whose appetite for meat contributed to the extinction of many of the large mammals that once roamed the planet
however , new research by paleontologists has suggested that our human ancestors may have started out as scavengers rather than the efficient killing machines they are often portrayed as
the findings could help to explain how early humans made the significant shift in their diet to consume meat and became one of the top predators on the planet
she estimates that early humans like homo erectus could have obtained enough meat to provide an entire days worth of energy from the scraps left behind by prehistoric predators
she told mail online : ' early humans would have scavenged carcasses of animals that ranged in size from medium sized animals like wildebeest all the way up to huge extinct elephants , and animals that lived in a range of different habitats from more open grasslands to closed woodlands
' probably anything that was nât too rotten was fair game
' lions , like the two eating a zebra kill above , leave large amounts of their kills untouched , meaning there would have been plenty of meat for early humans to scavenge from carcasses left by prehistoric feline predators she added that early humans probably survived though a combination of both hunting and scavenging
she said : ' i think it was both â probably a combination of scavenging from larger animals and hunting smaller animals
' one major energetic advantage of scavenging is that you have a really high success rate in the sense that unless a carcass is absolutely picked clean , like what happens after vultures have gotten to it , you âre virtually guaranteed to get some meat and marrow from what âs left
' with hunting , you can expend a lot of energy and come up empty - handed
' dr pobiner found that modern predators leave large amounts of meat on their kills ( as shown above ) and believes that prehistoric carnivores could have left even more to be picked clean by early humans speaking in a video on the smithsonian website , she added : ' i 've found in some of the fossils i studied that early humans got to these carcasses first and were able to eat the best parts of the animals
' sometimes carnivores got their first and early humans probably only got scraps
it has really big implications for a lot of other major changes that happened in human evolutionary history
' the evolution in meat eating has been linked to an increase in brain size , its been linked to an increase in home range size and maybe the expansion out of africa
' competing with big carnivores you needed sophisticated interaction , communication and other social skills that are another hallmark of being human
' in research published in the journal of human evolution , dr pobiner examined the carcasses of carnivore kills on the modern africa savanna in kenya 's ol pejeta conservancy
she looked at how much meat was consumed by lions and leopards before measuring what was left for scavengers
she also watched how much meat other large meat eaters like hyenas and jackals left behind once they were finished with a carcass
dr pobiner ( above ) claims to have found evidence that humans butchered carcasses after large predators had eaten meat from the bones first speaking to popular archaeology she said : ' the site is a great analogue for the kinds of africa savanna environments where hominins are thought to have lived
' this may have been very much like past carnivore communities during the time our ancestors were starting to eat meat from larger animals , when we have evidence that felids â ancient lions , leopards , and three species of sabertoothed cats â lived alongside our ancestors and may have been the dominant kinds of carnivores at this time
' dr pobiner found that in modern africa even a ' defleshed ' wildebeest hindlimb killed by a lion could still yield around one kilogram of meat while a zebra hind limb could have two kilograms of flesh still left on it
she estimates that an entire wildebeest or zebra carcass could yield 5kg and 15 kg of meat respectively even after a predator had eaten
this means a wildebeest carcass could provide 2200 calories and a zebra carcass could provide 6080 calories - enough for a small family of homo erectus
dr pobiner said : ' this is enough for the entire daily caloric requirements of at least one homo erectus / ergaster male , estimated to require approximately 2090 - 2290 calories per day
' dr pobiner says there is also evidence within the fossil record that suggests predators had eaten carcasses before early humans arrived to butcher the animals
hyenas are the main scavengers of lion kills on the african savannah but there are few examples of them in the fossil record in areas where early humans have been discovered and they could have scavenged instead 55 million years ago - first primitive primates evolve 15 million years ago - hominidae ( great apes ) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon 8 million years ago - first gorillas evolve
later , chimp and human lineages diverge 5.5 million years ago - ardipithecus , early â proto - human â shares traits with chimps and gorillas 4 million years ago - australopithecines appeared
they had brains no larger than a chimpanzee 's 2.7 million years ago - paranthropus , lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 2.8 million years ago - the first species in the homo family appeared 2.3 million years ago - homo habalis first thought to have appeared in africa 1.9 million years ago - homo erectus begins to appear in fossil record 1.6 million years ago - hand axes become the first major technological innovation 800,000 years ago - early humans control fire and create hearths
brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across europe and asia 200,000 years ago - homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in africa 40,0000 years ago - modern humans reach europe she said that at around the time homo erectus were alive there were also few species of bone - crunching carnivores like hyenas in africa
it means that early humans could have instead filled this niche
she said : ' this lack of bone - crunching hyenids would have meant that as early homo individuals began incorporating more carcass foods into their diets they would have had more access to within - bone resources than is available in many present - day african savanna ecosystems
' she added that sabretooth cats that lived at the time would have been less efficient than modern predatory cats at removing flesh from a carcass
she said : ' the fossil record of modern lions and leopards goes back to about 2 million years , their dietary adaptations would probably have been similar to the living species today
' where the difference comes in is with the three species ( three genera , actually ) of sabertoothed cats that were around when hominins first started eating meat
' they would have likely left even more meat on carcasses , because their teeth are even more adapted to slicing flesh
' dr pobiner said her findings had helped to dispell the idea that early humans would have struggled to find enough meat to survive by scavenging the meat left by larger predators
she said : ' we tend to think of scavenging as second - rate to hunting , somehow a lesser form of acquiring resources from animal carcasses , that scavengers are lower on the hierarchy and only left with piddly scraps
' this stems from the earliest interpretations , dating back to 1925 , of ancient humans as carnivorous , predatory killers based on associated broken animal fossils construed as being used as weapons
â she believes , however , that more research is needed to understand whether scavenging provided a dietary stepping stone as our ancestors moved towards eating more meat
writing in the journal of human evolution , dr pobiner said : ' this study supports the hypothesis that passive scavenging from abandoned larger felid kills could have a been a high - yield , though potentially dangerous , strategy for early hominins even without considering within bone nutrients
