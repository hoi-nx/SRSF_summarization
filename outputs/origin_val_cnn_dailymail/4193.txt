a little boy born with a rare brain disease that prevented him from being able to cry or feed properly , has died at just eight weeks old

' hey little fighter soon things will be brighter ! my name is tate lindsay burley i represent true humility
i am a gift , i will change lives and i can be at peace , ' the family wrote on friday
' tate passed away with his family surrounding him at 6.25pm
' mummy , dad , zane and kye love you to the moon and back
' hundreds of messages of support and love from friends and strangers have since flooded the page titled the tiny tate journey
the syndrome affects most of tate 's major neural systems and his parents were told his brain will not develop past the three month stage
tate 's brain was abnormally smooth , without the grooves of a normal brain which receive senses
tragically , his death came just hours after his family celebrated him turning eight weeks old and only one day after he experienced his first seizure
hundreds of messages of support and love from friends and strangers have since flooded the page tragically , his death came just hours after his family celebrated him turning eight weeks old and only one day after he experienced his first seizure ' last night however we witnessed tate develop from a sleeping premie to a seizing newborn
. 15 hours of jolting , stiffness , staring , back bending , pale clamminess and at times hypo colour
a path we knew was coming but a corner i dreaded turning
off to specialist today for more clarification , ' mrs burley wrote on friday
' lesson : there is no pain greater than helplessly watching him suffer
yesterday was a good day â¦ today i just want to get through
' tate 's story first came to light when friends and family launched a mycause fundraising campaign to help pay for tate 's care and more research into the condition , with mrs burley telling the sunday telegraph : ' we just want him to cry '
the campaign raised over $ 15,000 for the brain foundation which the family planned to partially use on a respiratory sleep machine and correct bedding and feeding apparatus
' lesson : there is no pain greater than helplessly watching him suffer
yesterday was a good day â¦ today i just want to get through , ' mrs burley wrote of watching her son suffer through seizures for the first time on friday baby tate was born at just 1.7kg and told he was unlikely to live past his fifth birthday a milestone for the family was when tate managed to suck 6 - 10mls out of a bottle by himself during one feed
another was when they heard him ' squeak '
' tate has no ability to cry however we also witnessed a sound today when he got restless
. not a cry or scream but definitely a squeak ! , ' ms burley posted previously
the family 's first scare came after just four days at home when tate developed a cold and his parents rushed him back to emergency where he spent the next six days with his mother convinced he was dying
friends and family launched a mycause fundraising campaign to help pay for tate 's care and more research into the condition ' granny and i watched tate lie lifeless in the emergency ward on the table gasping for air , dropping saturations and an excessively weak heart rate , white with blue lips , eyes rolled in his head , body flopped , ' she said
' today my lesson as a mum is to use the fire inside me to deal with the things i can not change for my son and except reality as it challenges me , ' ms burley wrote on saturday
' no one can understand how a family with a terminally ill child is feeling or the choices they make ... stand up , be an advocate for your child , do n't feel pressure because people are more educated than you because i learnt today that i 'm educated in what a palliative care patient is
' there is no cure for the condition and babies rarely live out their childhood
