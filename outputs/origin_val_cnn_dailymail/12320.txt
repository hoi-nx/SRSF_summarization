douglas ' son dylan had a run - in with anti-semitism -- and the actor wants to do something about it
in an opinion column for the los angeles times , the producer and " wall street " oscar winner described an incident last summer in an unidentified country in " southern europe
" the older of his two children with actress catherine zeta-jones , 14 - year - old dylan , came to his father in tears
" a man at the pool had started hurling insults at him , " douglas writes
it was n't because of anything dylan did , he continued : " suddenly i had an awful realization of what might have caused the man 's outrage : dylan was wearing a star of david
" douglas went to talk to the man -- " it was not a pleasant discussion , " he writes -- and the incident has stayed in his mind
the 70 - year - old actor , who was raised by a jews father , kirk douglas , and a non-jewish mother , said he did n't identify as jews while growing up but noticed anti-semitic remarks others made
" with little knowledge of what it meant to be a jew , i found myself passionately defending the jews people
now , half a century later , i have to defend my son , " he writes
" anti-semitism , i 've seen , is like a disease that goes dormant , flaring up with the next political trigger
" douglas , who is also a united nations messenger of peace , observes that anti-semitism has been on the rise due to a number of factors , including income inequality , religious extremism and hatred of israel
" some find jews to be a convenient scapegoat rather than looking at the real source of their problems , " he says
he praises leaders such as pope francis , french prime minister manuel valls and cardinal timothy dolan of new york for their efforts at reconciliation and community - building
but it is n't enough , he adds
" all of us " must fight anti-semitism , he says
" if we confront anti-semitism whenever we see it , if we combat it individually and as a society , and use whatever platform we have to denounce it , we can stop the spread of this madness , " he writes
" my son is strong
he is fortunate to live in a country where anti-semitism is rare
but now he too has learned of the dangers that he as a jew must face
it 's a lesson that i wish i did n't have to teach him , a lesson i hope he will never have to teach his children
" douglas received the 2015 genesis prize for " exceptional people whose values and achievements will inspire the next generation of jews
