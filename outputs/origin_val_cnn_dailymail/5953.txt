wales coach mcbryde has warned fans that attractive and entertaining rugby is low on the agenda ahead of saturday 's rbs 6 nations test against ireland
recent comments from new zealand boss steve hansen about the game being ' geared towards defences that inhibit attack ' have sparked debate around the sport 's marketability , with mcbryde predicting another war of attrition at the millennium stadium
asked if he expects a feast of running rugby , the 44 - year - old said : ' i 'm not too sure about that
there is a lot at stake
ireland are on course for a grand slam and just to get away from cardiff with a win , that 's all they will be looking to do
wales coach mcbryde insists that winning rather than attractive rugby will be their main priority jamie roberts ( right ) in action for wales during the six nations match with france at the france new zealand 's steve hansen recently suggested that rugby is being geared towards a more defensive style ' with regards to playing any attractive rugby , that will come second
that 's the nature of the game at the moment and that 's how teams are wearing each other down and , unfortunately , the spectators have got to pay a price for that
' wales have beaten ireland just twice in cardiff over the last 32 years and mcbryde is expecting one of the toughest challenges to date against the championship favourites
' they are on a bit of a roll at the moment â 10 wins on the bounce , ' said mcbryde
' certainly from the outside it looks a very happy camp
this is quite a formidable ireland team and we are going to have to be at our best to come close to them
' all eyes will be on the battle of the skies as the hosts look to end the visitors ' grand slam push and keep alive their own championship hopes
they have been working overtime to nullify the aerial bombardment from sexton and conor murray , with scrum - half webb promising not to repeat the mistakes that england made in dublin two weeks ago
' i do n't know if england did much analysis on them , ' said webb
' they did n't seem to put much pressure on nine and 10 whatsoever
we need to be on the money and we know there is no margin for error
' france 's jocelino suta ( centre ) fends off the challenges as he surges forward against wales jonathan davies runs with the ball for wales as his side beat france 20 - 13 in their last game france 's sofiane guitoune ( left ) is tackled as he makes a break during les bleus ' defeat in their last game it promises to be an intense tactical battle between warren gatland and counterpart joe schmidt , with the former subjected to a bitter personal attack by retired ireland lock neil francis during the week
warren gatland was said to have ' the intellectual properties of a tub of flora ' , although ireland captain paul o'connell holds the kiwi in much higher regard
' for as long as i can remember we 've being trying to poach ideas from warren gatland , ' said paul o'connell
' we played wasps with munster in 2003 or 2004 and they were so far ahead in terms of how they were playing and how the players were prepared from an s&c ( strength and conditioning ) and nutritional point of view
it was a rude awakening
he makes complicated things very simple and he probably pioneered that way of thinking
' at the start of the championship , joe schmidt said the wales - england game was going to be the standard - bearer
two years ago ireland beat ( wales ) in the first game and they just built and built and built until they absolutely erupted in that final game against england
' they 'll feel the same thing is happening now
' wales boss warren gatland watches his players in training ahead of the showdown with ireland ireland coach joe schmidt talks with fly - half sexton during ahead of saturday 's game with wales a lot has changed since paul o'connell played the first of his 100 tests more than 13 years ago
professionalism has been the key to the former shelf - stacker 's longevity , although he has not always been surrounded by such healthy company
on the week of his debut in 2002 â against wales in dublin â the young and enthusiastic second - row had to share a room with former munster team - mate peter clohessy
' i was woken by the smell of cigarette smoke in my nostrils every morning , ' recalled a laughing paul o'connell
' the claw ' used to have a cigarette the moment he woke up
i was well aware this was not the way forward
' obviously it 's changed a lot since then
now in irish camp i take a lot of advice from ( strength and conditioning coach ) jason cowman
sexton is obviously ( another ) great guy to copy and follow
' as the ball emerges from the ruck , ireland 's conor murray kicks it upfield during the match with england scrum - half conor murray passes the ball down the line during ireland 's 19 - 9 victory over england last time out ireland 's iain henderson ( centre ) braves the challenges of billy vunipola ( right ) and richard wigglesworth conor murray brings the ball forward once more against england at the aviva stadium on march 1 kicking game in conor murray and sexton , ireland have the world 's in - form kicking half - back combination
their aerial game - plan was predictable against england yet stuart lancaster did not have the players at his disposable to stop it
wales , however , have one of the best defensive back - threes in the world and halfpenny is a master at limiting the space to kick into
how well ireland anticipate that â perhaps using sexton as a looping runner , if the wingers drop back â will be highly significant
set - piece at 6ft 9in and 6ft 11in , luke charteris of wales and devin toner of ireland are two of the tallest players in the competition
they are both extremely difficult to beat on their own line - out throw , while they can be equally disruptive towards their opponents '
their long limbs are used to try and steal ball , although that can leave the defending side open to attack from the driving maul , where both wales and ireland are particularly effective
picking the right moments to challenge will be pivotal ; a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of alun-wyn jones and paul o'connell
breakdown welsh defence coach shaun edwards claims his players are the best in the world at contesting the post-tackle area
however , they will face their toughest breakdown battle yet against ireland , who won 23 turnovers to nine against england in round three
warren gatland 's game - plan relies heavily on quick recycled ball and ireland will look to slow that down to limit the risk from the likes of jamie roberts and george north
getting on the right side of referee wayne barnes will be key , because halfpenny and sexton are two of the world 's leading goal - kickers .
