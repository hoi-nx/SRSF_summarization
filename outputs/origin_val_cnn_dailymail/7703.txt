parents of sixth graders at a pennsylvania school were forced to sign permissions slips so that their children could each eat a single double stuf oreos cookie
mrs porter , a science teacher at welsh valley middle school in lower merion , sent the note out while planning a lesson for friday about the earth 's tectonic plates , which she wanted to represent with double stuf oreos
the twitter account mainline housewife posted a picture of a form describing it as ' insanity '
parents of sixth graders at a school in eastern pennsylvania received a letter from teacher porter asking for a signature allowing their children to eat an double stuf oreos cookie ' the students may eat the double stuf oreos after the investigation if this is okay with you , ' the note , sent home on monday , reads
' the students do not have to eat the oreo if they do not wish to do so
' mrs porter 's form then explains that without expressed parental permission given by wednesday , the students would not be allowed to have the the cookie
' it 's one teacher who was really trying to do her due diligence , quite honestly , " lower merion school district spokesman young told the philadelphia inquirer
despite its intentions , the permissions slips were lambasted by internet users
some poor tree had to give its life for this idiocy , ' one commenters said on the parenting blog free-range kids
a spokesman for the lower merion school district said that the teacher was ' trying to do her due diligence ' but there was no requirement that permission slips be sent home a student in ms porter 's class has a food allergy , though there was no requirement for the forms to be sent home to every parent ' did the school ask permission to send this permission slip ? ' another asked
mainline housewife said that she did not blame the teacher 's zeal
' i fault our crazy culture , ' she said
a student in ms porter 's class has an allergy that requires notifications about food in the classroom , though there is no requirement that permission slips to all parents need to be sent
pennsylvania school boards association spokesman steve robinson said that schools should already have plans where they already know which foods students can eat
allergies are not mentioned in ms porter 's letter
mr young did not say how many students chose to eat double stuf oreos on friday , though the parents of a student who can not eat gluten sent gluten - free oreos to school
two double stuf oreos have 140 calories , 13 grams of sugar and seven grams of fat , according to snackworks.com
