rob biddulph 's picture book blown away has won waterstones children 's book prize it took him almost five years to find a publisher , but last night rob biddulph 's persistence paid off when his first children 's book won a major award
blown away , the magazine art director 's enchanting tale about a sky - faring penguin , won the Â£ 5,000 waterstones children 's book prize
it is only the second time a picture book has triumphed during the award 's 11 - year history
mr rob biddulph , who works for the observer , said last night : ' i 'm totally surprised at winning
it took me a while to get this book published
' melissa cox , chairman of the judging panel , said the author had ' a beautiful fresh style all his own '
she said : ' the test of a good picture book is not how good it is on first reading , but how enjoyable it is on its fiftieth
' it 's a beautiful fresh style that is all his own and his style of storytelling is very reminiscent of classic picture book writers like allan ahlberg
' it 's very unusual for a brand new illustrator to write their own text , which marked it out , and even more unusual is for them to do rhyming text
' mr rob biddulph began as an author by making up stories for his three children and illustrating them
blown away was named the overall winner beating two other titles which had triumphed in their categories â half bad by sally green , the best teenage book , and murder most unladylike by robin stevens , the best title for younger readers
waterstones children 's book prize managing director james daunt said : ' this year we have another wonderfully inspiring prize that is testament to the extraordinary vibrancy and creativity in children 's publishing
' penguins also captured the public imagination in the build - up to christmas last year when the computer - generated monty starred in the john lewis ad campaign , with spin - off cuddly toys selling out
