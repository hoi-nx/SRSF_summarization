alex salmond has taken to drinking ' pink champagne ' in the afternoon , it has been revealed a labour government propped up by the snp has been voted the worst possible outcome at the general election - but alex salmond has insisted he will support ed miliband 's bid for power come what may
six out of 10 voters said they would be ' dismayed ' by a labour - snp alliance
this compares with 54 per cent who said they did not want a labour - lib dem coalition and 52 per cent dreading another pact between david cameron and nick clegg , according to the pollsters yougov
despite the unpopularity of an snp - labour alliance , mr alex salmond - who has taken to drinking pink champagne in the afternoon - has revealed that the party will do whatever it can to make mr ed miliband prime minister in order to wring as many concessions out of him as possible
the revelation comes after david cameron said mr ed miliband had given up trying to win the election outright and was pinning all his hopes on the snp helping him over the line
the prime minister said mr alex salmond had taken the entire labour hostage and was using mr ed miliband as his poodle
the attack , at prime minister 's questions , comes amid dire polls for labour pointing to a landslide election victory for the snp
mr alex salmond had earlier told the spectator magazine that the snp will use its power in parliament after the election to block any attempt by the tories to form a minority government - even if it had failed to strike a deal with labour
the revelation makes the prospect of a tory minority government less likely - while increasing the prospect of mr ed miliband becoming prime minister
the snp has already promised to work with labour in return for sweeping spending increases and the end of uk 's trident nuclear weapons
labour has ruled out a formal labour - snp coalition but not the prospect of working on a vote - by - vote basis if it fails to win enough seats to govern alone
a labour government propped up by the snp is the worst possible outcome at the general election for most uk voters , a new poll has revealed speaking in the final prime minister 's questions session of the parliament , mr david cameron said the snp had ' taken the entire labour hostage '
to cheers from the tory benches mr david cameron added : ' and the ransom note is very clear
it says higher borrowing , uncontrolled immigration , unfettered welfare , higher taxes and weaker defence
' that 's what is being demanded and the uk people have only one way of saying no to this appalling hostage situation - and that is to vote tory on may 7
' mr david cameron 's attack comes amid growing alarm at the prospect of chaotic coalition negotiations in the result of hung parliament after the general election in may
according to today 's yougov poll , published in the the times , more people fear coalition government than either the tories or labour winning outright in may
david cameron said alex salmond had taken the entire labour hostage and was using ed miliband as his poodle just under half the public think a labour majority government is the worst possible outcome - compared to 45 per cent who said a tory majority was the worst result
a quarter said they would be ' delighted ' or would not mind a labour - snp alliance , compared with a third broadly positive about lab - lib dem coalition , 37 per cent positive about another tory - lib dem pact , 41 per cent backing a labour majority and 46 per cent a tory majority
scotland first minister nicola sturgeon has pledged to ' lock the tories out of government ' , with her predecessor alex salmond yesterday confirming the snp would side with labour to vote down a minority tory government 's queen 's speech
today 's yougov poll of 8,271 uk voters , including 633 in scotland , suggests the snp could be on course to take about half of former lib dem and labour voters in scotland , and even a fifth of former tory voters
the tories have released a campaign video showing alex salmond ' calling ed miliband 's tune ' half of 2010 lib dem voters said they will definitely or may possibly vote snp in may while 44 per cent of former labour voters and 20 per cent of former tory voters said the same

three out of four people in scotland said labour needs to change its policies to become fit for government again while more than half think the party has not yet faced up to ' the damage it wrought on the economy '
nearly half ( 45 per cent ) said the labour in scotland used to care about people like them but now does not , compared with 26 per cent who said they still do
about one in ten ( 11 per cent ) said labour have never cared about people like them and just 3 per cent said they now care about them after previously dismissing them in the past
a total of 69 per cent said labour ' has seriously lost touch with ordinary working people '
almost a third ( 29 per cent ) of people in scotland said they would be ' delighted ' with the snp supporting a minority labour government
two - thirds of people in scotland would be dismayed by another tory - lib dem coalition while 52 per cent would not like a lab - lib dem democrat coalition
