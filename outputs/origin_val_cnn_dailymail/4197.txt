it was a seminal moment of the paralympics , when the watching public realised paralympic are athletes first and foremost
joy cundy is aiming for gold at the rio 2016 olympics after his dramatic disappointment at london 2012 now cundy , a five - time paralympic champion swimmer and cyclist , is going for gold at the rio in 2016 , with the world championships , which begin on thursday , a key indicator
the 36 - year - old from wisbech , cambridgeshire said : ' i 've always got that missed gold in london that 's always playing on the back of my mind
' that helps me get up in the morning , continue training and make sure we put all the wrongs to right when we get to rio
' i seem to be still getting faster and in training i 'm in better form than i was prior to london
' i 'm not getting any younger , but i 'm good enough to keep going through to rio
' apeldoorn 's going to be the first checkpoint to see if i 'm on target
' race commissaries deemed rider failure to be the result of a start gate issue however cundy disagreed cundy , favourite for gold before his false start in the 1km time trial , shows his outrage after his exit cundy acknowledges tokyo 2020 , when he will be 41 , may be four years too far and rio may be his last chance

this is my eighth year on the team
' i 've nearly had as many years on the cycling team as i had on the swimming team
' it 's certainly getting harder with each year i do it
' yet cundy is still making improvements
despite being hospitalised to intensive care last november with a swollen epiglottis , cundy bounced back to post a sea - level personal best in his favoured kilo event at the newport international event in january
cundy aims to put his blow - up in the olympic velodrome behind him at the world championships , which begin in the netherlands on thursday the track in apeldoorn , holland which hosts this week 's competition is not known for being fast , though , so returning with the world champion 's rainbow jersey is the primary objective

' cundy , a london 2012 c4 athlete who is a below - knee amputee , races against riders with a lesser impairment than his own in paralympic competition
the times posted are factored , but cundy wants to be quicker than all of his london 2012 c4 and c5 rivals in rio
' on the factors they 've currently got it 's about a 0.6 or 0.8 ( of a second ) advantage i 've got , ' he added
' but i 'd rather win on time , be faster on time , that way there 's no doubts
' cundy is joined in the team by 11 - time paralympic champion dame sarah storey , who is defending two world titles
neil fachie and his pilot pete mitchell are also defending their one - kilometre time - trial tandem title , while commonwealth games winning pair sophie thornhill and helen scott are in partnership in the women 's tandem events
