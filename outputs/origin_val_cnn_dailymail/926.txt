scholes believes manchester united must spend big again this summer if louis van gaal 's tactics are to bring success to old trafford
manchester united were dumped out of the fa cup by arsenal on monday and face a battle to finish in the top four with a difficult run of fixtures over the next six weeks
and former manchester united midfielder scholes , who has two season tickets at his old club , is unconvinced that van gaal 's preferred style of play suits the players in his squad
louis van gaal gives instructions to ashley young during manchester united 's defeat by arsenal fellaini , michael carrick and wayne rooney ( l-r ) look dejected at old trafford arsene wenger was right ! i would have loved to have played with mesut ozil ... but only if he always performed like he did at old trafford writing in his column for the independent , scholes said : ' watching manchester united at old trafford on monday , i know what louis van gaal is trying to do with this team
i do like the concept
i just question whether he has the players to do it
' in recent weeks , van gaal has tried what i would describe as a more barcelona - style approach to games
his centre backs push wide , the full backs push on and the team pass the ball
it has worked against the weaker teams but it is against the stronger sides , starting with tottenham and the high - pressing game they play , that you have to wonder whether it will be found out
' to play this way , you really need to be exceptional
barcelona can do it because they have the players and they have been playing this way for years
manchester united have spent around Â£ 220m in the last three transfer windows and yet i would question whether they have the players to operate this system
' van gaal has been criticised for utilising fellaini 's height and physical presence at times this season former manchester united midfielder scholes believes the club must buy more new players this summer manchester united were known for their relentless attacking under sir alex ferguson and scholes , who was an integral part of the scot 's midfield , wants to see fluid football back at old trafford
' i understand what van gaal is trying to do , ' scholes wrote
' i like that he is playing with the wide players
i also know that as former players we can not harp on about the old days for ever
things change , although i believe that certain principles , of attacking , entertaining football , should always be protected
' like any other match - going fan â i have two season tickets for old trafford â i want to see the team play well and win
i just do nât think this system is the best for these players
' angel di maria has struggled to adapt since joining the club in a Â£ 60million deal from real madrid former chelsea midfielder juan mata has found himself out of favour under van gaal in recent months van gaal 's men are fourth in the premier league table ahead of sunday 's clash with tottenham but they could drop out of the champions league places if they suffer defeat and rivals liverpool win at swansea on monday night
despite the club 's precarious position , scholes is adamant that the dutchman has what it takes to turn things around - even if he must take action in the summer transfer window
he added : ' i still believe that van gaal is the right man for the job
i do nât think he will change his mind about the way he wants the team to play
he is a stubborn man and that is no bad thing in football
but i am afraid to say that if he wants to play this barcelona style then the club will have to go back into the transfer market this summer to get the players they need to do it
