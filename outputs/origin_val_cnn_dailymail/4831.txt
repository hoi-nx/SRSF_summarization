i think it was supposed to be funny , but seeing this status made me feel angry
' as someone who has struggled with and overcome disordered eating , i know what it âs like to " feel " fat
i have spent years of my life consumed with negative thoughts about my body , and far too many days starving myself in an effort to lose weight
but even worse than the skipped meals and the hours spent obsessing in front of the mirror was the fear of what others thought about me and my body
the ' feeling fat ' emoji that facebook users were able to use in their status updates ' when facebook users set their status to " feeling fat , " they are making fun of people who consider themselves to be overweight , which can include many people with eating disorders
join me in asking facebook to remove the " fat " emoji from their status options

one option we give people to express themselves is to add a feeling to their posts
