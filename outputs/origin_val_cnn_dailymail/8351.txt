just for a second , mowbray allowed himself to drift off into a brighter future before crashing back to the remorseless reality of sky blues âs present
â i look to the summer time and how we are going to build a team that is a sky blues team , â the new manager began
â but that âs for another day
the immediate concern is just to win some matches
â mowbray issues instructions from the touchline during his first game in charge of sky blues sky blues 's jim o'brien opens the scoring for the home side in just the fourth minute of the match for mowbray , who arrived at the club last week , sky blues is a club of heritage and romance
it is keith houchen âs diving header crashing into the wembley net in 1987 , it is hill leading the â sky blue revolution â , it is of a team that was a staple of the top division for 34 years
he has vowed to take them back there , to their â rightful place â
the reality is very different
today , hill âs bronze statue stands outside a superstore for the rugby club wasps , whose amber and black logo looms over the main entrance
they own the place ; sky blues are strangers in their own home , seeking to get out in the next few years
the ricoh arena is magnificent , ready for the top flight
but few thought that would mean premier league rugby union rather than premier league football
confidence has drained , crowds are down
when the club returned from their exile in northampton 35 miles away back in september , over 27,000 packed into the ground
on saturday , a mere 9,446 turned out
the potential for massive crowds is obvious but poor form has seen many return their scarves to the back of the wardrobe
the sky blues wide man wheels away in celebration after giving his side the perfect start it âs because sky blues are staring at the indignity of fourth - tier football for the first time since 1959 and , after this chastening reintroduction to management after 16 months away , mowbray is in no doubt as to how precarious their situation is
â if we âd sat here and we âd won , i âd be telling you how great it was but as a football manager it really hurts , â he reflected
â the highs are really good , the lows low but there âs not much in between
â it would have been nice to give the fans a victory
i do nât think the players let them down but we are where we are
â to be exact , still a sole point above the relegation zone after an afternoon that had started so positively for his team
the mere presence of the former hibernian , west brom , celtic and middlesbrough boss seemed to energise the place initially and sky blues led on four minutes through captain jim oâbrien
the former middlesbrough and celtic manager holds his arms aloft in appeal at the ricoh arena they were comfortable until two port vale goals just before the break turned the tables
tom pope and then the impressive mark marshall , released by mowbray âs predecessor steven pressley in the summer , exposed defensive flaws
but sky blues rallied and when sanmi odelusi came off the bench to level , they had all the momentum with 20 minutes to play
alas , six minutes later , michael oâconnor âs free - kick handed the three points to port vale , who are just two points off the play - offs
their manager , rob page , made 70 league appearances for sky blues as a defender
he certainly does nât want to see them slide into league two
â i think they have just brought in a fantastic manager , â he said
â i think he will keep them up and then build in the summer for next season
â for mowbray , though , it âs only the here and now that matters
