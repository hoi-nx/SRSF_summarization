' i started yelling and michelle wilkins yelled back , very faintly , and it was muffled â " help me ! help me ! " ' sawyer told ktla this weekend
he described finding her covered from head to toe in blood

dynel lane was arrested at longmont united hospital ( above ) after first telling hospital staff she had suffered a miscarriage but later admitted her atrocious deed the case has revived the highly charged debate over when a fetus can legally be considered a human being
even though the baby girl died , legal experts say the situation is complicated by the fact that colorado is one of 12 states that do not have laws making the violent death of an unborn child a homicide
state legislators in 2013 voted down such a measure over fears it would interfere with abortion rights , and voters overwhelmingly agreed when they rejected a similar ballot measure in 2014
advocates say the attack shows the need for a fetal homicide law
a preliminary hearing has been scheduled for may 5 and dynel lane remains held in jail on a $ 2million bond .
