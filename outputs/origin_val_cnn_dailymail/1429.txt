adams has been named by an influential america magazine as a former ira commander who personally passed â death sentences â on its enemies
adams , 64 , has long denied belonging to the terror group
but the new yorker magazine has published a damning 15,000 - word assessment of allegations against him
last year adams was arrested by police investigating mrs mcconville âs murder
he has always denied any involvement and was released without charge
the article names adams as having been a senior member of the ira and the military commander responsible for the belfast brigade
none of the claims is new but their collation by the magazine â in a devastating essay entitled â where the bodies are buried â with another headline saying adams â authorised murder â â is seen as a sign that the sinn fein president can no longer regard himself as the â acceptable face â of irish republicanism in america
the magazine claimed that adams , pictured , joined the ira in the 1960s and passed ' death sentences ' patrick radden keefe , the author of the new yorker essay , wrote : â it is believed that adams joined [ the ira ] as a teenager , in the mid-sixties
several former ira volunteers confirmed to me that adams was a member of the group
â he said adams had presided over a meeting of ira bombers in belfast to plot the 1973 bombing campaign in london
the article also said adams dispatched an ira member to new york to procure armalite assault rifles for use against the british army , having them smuggled back aboard the qeii ocean liner .
