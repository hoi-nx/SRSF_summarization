andy murray and ward headed off to california on monday , knowing that they may well have sacrificed the first masters level event of the year in the british cause
after sealing gb 's win over usa in the davis cup , they have a ridiculously quick turnaround before the atp tour tournament starts later this week in the desert setting of indian wells
ward is expected to play in the qualifying event on tuesday , while at least andy murray gets a few days ' grace before the main draw begins
andy murray described leading great britain to davis cup victory over the usa as ' very emotional ' british no 1 andy murray was pumped up by his home glasgow crowd as gb secured a 3 - 1 win over the usa andy murray celebrates during his straight sets win over john isner that clinched the brits a quarter - final place individual compared to team environment , altitude compared to sea level , the desert dry heat compared to glasgow 's cold , the seven hour time difference â it could hardly be more contrasting
andy murray , now back up to no 4 in the world , said : ' it 's going from playing on an indoor court with heavy tennis balls to playing in the desert with very fast balls in very quick conditions in terms of how the ball moves through the air there
' the british no 1 said it is far more realistic for him to do well in the miami open that follows later this month
' that would be a target for me to have a very good run , ' he admitted
the dates and structure of the davis cup continue to be a problem and those like andy murray and ward , who have chosen to play for their country , will be at a considerable disadvantage over the next 10 days
as andy murray reflected , this is one reason why the likes of roger federer and stan wawrinka sat out the first round of a competition which , as the weekend demonstrated , is a showcase for so much that is good about the sport
ward acknowledges the crowd after being forced off injured during day three of the ryder cup the british gb team celebrate the victory over the usa , with ward ( second left ) and andy murray ( second right ) andy murray , embracing gb team captain leon smith , praised the ' effort and attitude of everyone in the team ' andy murray will be reunited with coach amelie mauresmo for these two hard court events
he is also not far from appointing an assistant to her , who will be important in the weeks that she is unable to travel
referring to his search he commented : ' i 'd say it 's fairly close
over the next few days i 'll try to arrange someone to do a trial period in the next month or so
' amelie mauresmo is next not with me at the beginning of the clay - court stretch ( in april )
i get married the week after miami
i 'm not 100 per cent sure what i 'm going to do afer that
' as glasgow was the latest davis cup tie to show , there can be a real passion for tennis outside wimbledon in the british : ' it 's up to the lta to capitalise on it , that 's not my job , ' said andy murray
' i think it 's valuable
you see the enthusiasm and the passion that people clearly have for tennis right now
the 27 - year - old ( right ) wants to appoint an assistant coach to aid amelie mauresmo ' i 'm just happy that when we 've been able to play the big events of the last few years , the crowds have been absolutely fantastic every time
' again in the summer i 'm sure we can fill another big arena
but we need more than just putting these sort of events on
' he also revealed that lta chief executive downey has still not had a proper conversation with him about improving tennis in great britain after 14 months in the job
they had 15 minutes together in glasgow which , andy murray confirmed , was their longest meeting to date : ' i have n't given my opinion or thoughts on how that should be done
' i just listened to what he had to say , ' said the 27 - year - old scot , sounding distinctly non-plussed
' he sort of took me through a one - page plan , strategy , in terms of how they were going to get more people playing the game
getting more people playing is obviously important
' but it 's one thing saying it , putting it down on a piece of paper
it 's another thing doing it
' it is astonishing that downey , who is canadian , has not taken the trouble to thoroughly consult great britain 's finest player since fred perry
what a criminal waste of andy murray 's experience , sharp intelligence and obvious passion for british tennis .
