roman catholic cardinal edward egan , the former archbishop of new york who played a prominent role in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , has died at the age of 82
the archdiocese of new york says edward egan died on thursday afternoon at a new york hospital after suffering a heart attack
he was appointed as leader of the archdiocese by pope john paul ii in 2000 , succeeding the late cardinal john o'connor
within two years he was forced to dramatically cut spending and lay off staff to stabilize the accounts
as archbishop during the september 11 terror attacks , edward egan anointed the dead at a lower manhattan hospital and presided over many funerals for victims - sometimes three a day
he also took to ground zero to distribute rosaries to the many grieving families who were searching - often in vain - for their loved ones among the rubble
edward egan bristled at the suggestion that he was more a manager than shepherd
in a 2001 interview with the new york times , he said , ' i am about , first and foremost , serving 413 communities of faith , ' he said , referring to the archdiocese 's parishes
he was a scholar of church law and spoke latin fluently
john paul chose him to help with the massive job of reviewing a revised canon law code for the global church
a native of illinois , edward egan retired as new york archbishop in 2009
