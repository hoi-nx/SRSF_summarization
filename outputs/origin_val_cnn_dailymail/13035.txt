beijing native to a remote region of china , this tiny mammal , known as the ili pika , does n't know it 's a member of an endangered species -- and neither do most people
rarer -- and some would argue cuter -- than the panda , there are less than 1,000 of these teddy bear - like creatures living in the tianshan mountains mountain range in the xinjiang region of northwestern china , says conservationist li weidong
li weidong discovered the pika , formally known as ili pika , in 1983 and named it after his hometown , ili
last july , li weidong spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s
he estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70 % since its discovery
" i discovered the species , and i watched as it became endangered , " he told cnn
" if it becomes extinct in front of me , i 'll feel so guilty
" in 2008 , the animal was listed as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature but there 's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it , according to li weidong
the mammal , only 20 centimeters long , lives on sloping bare rock faces and feeds on grasses at high elevations
li weidong says the pika 's habitat has been affected by global warming
due to rising temperatures , glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the tianshan mountains mountains , forcing the pikas to gradually retreat to mountain tops , li weidong said
ili pikas were originally found at elevations between 3,200 to 3,400 meters , he said
now they have retreated to elevations of 4,100 meters
" they have nowhere else to retreat , " he added
it 's also a solitary animal and is not as vocal as other pika species , so if predators are near , ili pikas are not able to alert each other , li weidong said
disease may also be a factor in its decline
in 1983 , when li weidong first came across the mammal , nobody knew what it was
two years later , li weidong found another two and it was declared a new species
in the decade following , li weidong and his colleagues conducted a number of studies , including a census at 14 different sites
however , in 1992 , li weidong left ili to work with xinjiang academy of environmental protection in the regional capital urumqi
no studies were conducted on ili pika in the following decade
no one saw the pika , either
in 2002 and 2003 , li weidong , with a team of volunteers , conducted a fresh census
despite spending 37 days searching the mountains for the pikas on seven separate trips , they came up empty handed
however , by analyzing droppings and snow tracks , li weidong , along with arizona state university biologist andrew smith , was able to conclude that the ili pika population had seen a dramatic decline
together they calculated that there might be 2,000 mature animals , down from 2,900 in the early 1990s
the research , published in 2005 , recommended that the animal should be listed as endangered
in 2007 , li weidong retired early to throw himself into searching for the pika
last year , he organized a group of 20 volunteers to conduct another survey with infrared cameras
this time , on the second day of the field trip , they finally spotted a pika , who jumped and stepped over li weidong 's feet while he was trying to photograph it
the volunteers dubbed it a " magic rabbit
" they concluded that there were fewer than 1,000 ili pikas , said li weidong
" this tiny species could be extinct any time , " he said
" they do n't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore
" li weidong funds the research with himself , along with donations and occasional grants from organizations like the world wide fund for nature
he says he has spent more than $ 32,000 of his own money over the past three decades and he has to raise funds to pay for gas
but what upsets li weidong most is n't the lack of funding
it 's the lack of official recognition for the ili , and other pikas ' plight
the ili pika is n't included on china 's list of wildlife under special state protection -- part of the country 's 1988 wildlife protection law
the department for wildlife and forest plants protection , under the ministry of forestry , said it was in the process of updating the list but declined to give any further details
li weidong and his volunteers have been calling for the establishment of a nature reserve to help protect the animal
" i 'm almost 60 , and soon i wo n't be able to climb the tianshan mountains , " he said
" so i really hope that an organization will have people study and protect the ili pika
