katie ringer set up a fake account on an online fundraising page to ask kind - hearted members of the public to put money towards the fictional child 's funeral costs
the 19 - year - old , who carried out the fraud from her parents ' home in shoeburyness , essex , also abused a number of victims over the internet , sending them ' vile ' photos of dead relatives
katie ringer , who has no children , stole photos of other people 's children from facebook to support her ' web of lies ' , the court heard
she was jailed for three years at basildon crown court today
judge samantha leigh said : ' you preyed on the generosity of the british public
' we all know how generous the public can be and how vast amounts of money can be raised - you only have to look at children in need and last friday 's comic relief for examples
' what you did only has one word and that is wicked
you spun a web of lies to draw these people in and played on their emotions to extort money they could ill - afford to donate
' the teenager constructed a ' web of lies ' , the court heard , that included claims she needed money for her child 's funeral and to feed her young children who had specialist dietary requirements
juliet donovan , prosecuting , said : ' a fundraising page set up by miss ringer on youcaring.com makes reference to the death of a child and requests donations for funeral arrangements
' five successful donations were made
all the pleas made for donations were found to be completely unfounded
' the total value of the fraud was Â£ 3,000 including a number of unknown victims who donated
' katie ringer also sent victims vile abuse over the internet and blackberry mobile messaging
one victim was sent a picture of her own grandmother 's gravestone with a caption : ' burn in hell b * * * h. i hope you 're raped by devils
' another received an image of her dead daughter with the caption : ' daddy raped me '
katie ringer left another victim terrified for their safety after threatening to firebomb their home
mike warren , mitigating , admitted his clients actions had been ' evil ' and could not be justified
he said : ' this case has attracted quite a lot of attention
these were all evil offences committed from her own bedroom
' cowardly offences that she does accept caused much distress to individuals and their families
' the court heard how unemployed katie ringer used an iphone , ipad and laptop to create fake fundraising claims and spew vile abuse between august 2012 and january 2014
katie ringer admitted 14 charges of fraudulently collecting money , eight charges of harassment and one of threatening to blow up a victim 's house at a previous hearing
she was jailed for three years and was made the subject of a restraining order banning her from contacting any of her victims
the troll was forced to flee her home to norwich , norfolk , after angry victims mobbed her house
speaking outside court today , victim leah , 24 , from southend , essex , described the anguish she suffered after receiving pictures of her dead baby with sick captions from katie ringer
the mother - of - four said : ' my daughter passed away in 2009 due to cot death and it was very hard to cope with
sentenced : the ' wicked ' 19 - year - old was jailed for three years at basildon crown court , pictured , today ' i started receiving pictures of my child saying " my daddy raped me " and other sick captions
' no one can imagine how hard it is to receive that when you are still coming to terms with a death
' i 'm relieved this is all over with now but i feel she should have got a longer sentence
three years does not reflect just how many lives she has ruined
' leah 's partner ray dadds , 27 , a mechanic from southend , added : ' seeing it made me so angry but i knew i could n't take it out on the girl as i would never hit a woman
' i would n't wish what we went through on my worst enemy - not even katie ringer
she will get out of prison in 18 months but we will not have recovered from this by then
' after the trial , senior district crown prosecutor for the cps in the east of england , punam malhan said : ' katie ringer fraudulently made more than Â£ 2,000 from people who believed her tragic stories about ill children , which were all untrue
' she took advantage of their kind and generous nature , and gained financially by telling stories , for example of needing money for a dead daughter 's funeral , among many other creative tales
' katie ringer also set up fake profiles on facebook , using other people 's pictures of their children in her scams and uploaded pictures with racist messages and comments
' in one communication she also threatened to blow up one of her victims ' homes
in this instance , these victims took these threats extremely seriously and feared for their lives
' katie ringer had no regard for the damage she caused and the untold effects her criminality has had on her victims - not just the financial loss but on their general well - being
' she continually abused people via the wholly inappropriate use of social media outlets for her own gain
' we hope the sentence handed down today shows how committed the cps is to prosecuting cases of this nature and sends a message that malicious communications will not be tolerated
