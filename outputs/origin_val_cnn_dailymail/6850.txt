claudia martins , 33 , gave birth alone in the bath at her sister 's flat in knowle , bristol , having allegedly kept the pregnancy a secret
she is on trial at bristol crown court ( pictured ) accused of murdering the baby girl paramedics were called to the property after friends and family members found ' a lot of blood ' in the bath and martins was taken to hospital
the court heard martins repeatedly told hospital staff she had not given birth or been pregnant
during her hospital stay , martins ' sister noticed a smell coming from the suitcase and called police after she opened it and saw blood
police found the body of a newborn baby inside a small black suitcase
martins , who was described as having an extremely low iq , was arrested and admitted that she had given birth , but said the baby was stillborn
a post-mortem examination found a wad of toilet paper inside the baby 's mouth , which experts claim was ' deliberately inserted '
martins , who denies a single charge of murder on september 12 last year , wept during the opening of her trial at bristol crown court today
adam vaitilingam qc , prosecuting , said two police officers were called to the flat martins shared with her sister on september 15 last year
' they were shown to the bathroom of the flat , where they saw and opened a suitcase , ' he said
' inside , wrapped in towels and in a black plastic bag , they found the body of a newborn baby girl
martins was rushed to bristol royal infirmary ( pictured ) but repeatedly told hospital staff she had not given birth or been pregnant - she was later arrested after her sister discovered the baby 's body in a suitcase ' the baby had been born three days earlier to the defendant , claudia martins
' it is the prosecution 's case that she killed the baby as soon as it was born and that she hid the body in the suitcase
' it is the defence case that she never knew she was pregnant and when she gave birth it was stillborn and that she hid it in the suitcase out of a mixture of shock and panic
' the jury heard martins is originally from mozambique but moved to portugal before settling in bristol in 2011
she lived in a two - bedroom flat with her sister , marshall , ms marshall 's partner , and five children , which was ' difficult and pressurised ' , mr vaitilingam said
in late 2013 martins became pregnant and the father of the baby was later identified by dna analysis as polish man jacob kucmus
' the baby was full term when born on september 12 2014 , ' mr vaitilingam said
' we do n't know when she first realised , because she never told anyone that she was pregnant nor - as far as we are able to say - consulted with a doctor
' friends and family suspected that martins was pregnant but she denied this and refused to go to a doctor , it is alleged
martins ' sister , vilma , was pregnant with a baby girl at the same time and gave birth a week before martins did
a naming ceremony was held at the flat on september 12 but martins went upstairs to the bathroom at 7pm complaining of a bad back
friends at the party later went to check on martins and found her bleeding , with ' a lot of blood ' in the bath , mr vaitilingam said
they called an ambulance and paramedics arrived at 8.54 to find martins in a sarong , with a ' heavily bloodstained towel ' between her legs
the paramedics persuaded martins to leave with them at 10.40pm and headed to the bristol royal infirmary
' before she left , claudia martins went to a suitcase that was in the far corner of the room and rummaged around in it , ' mr vaitilingam told the court
' it looked to the paramedics as though she was rearranging items within the suitcase , and she then shut it and placed items on top of it before leaving with them for the hospital
' dr russell delaney carried out a post-mortem examination and found the baby was normally formed , with no evidence of disease to account for death
due to the level of decomposition , medical experts are unable to determine whether the baby was born dead or alive
but dr delaney found a wad of five pieces of wet tissue paper - the same as on a toilet roll in the bathroom
mr vaitilingam tol the court the paper had been ' deliberately inserted ' into the baby 's mouth
' the prosecution 's case is that claudia martins put this wad of tissue paper into the child 's mouth after it had been born , intending to cause its death and achieving exactly that , ' mr vaitilingam said
' she denies that , but has never offered any explanation as to how that object came to be placed in the baby 's mouth
