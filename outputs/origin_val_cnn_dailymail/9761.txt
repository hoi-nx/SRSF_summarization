the city had been celebrating their new team all weekend ahead of the match ; a festival atmosphere enveloping the place the day before and starting again with barbecues outside the citrus bowl stadium well before the game
football is a team game , but this was very much about one man : kaka
two teams were making their mls debuts in front of a sold out 63,000 - strong crowd , but the brazilian , considered the greatest player on the planet in 2007 , was playing the lead role
he did not let down his adoring fans
his mere presence on the pitch whipped the striking purple crowd into a frenzy , from the moment he led the side out ahead of kick off for the very first time , introducing city to their new team
it took only two minutes for him to make his mark
just placing a ball for a free kick drew pandemonium around the citrus bowl , but he delivered a ball into the box which seb hines , on loan from middlesbrough , headed inches wide of the left post
the home side dominated , and kaka was the catalyst for everything
he nudged the ball with his thigh , 12 minutes in , travelling outside the area with its momentum and hitting a left - foot shot just wide
former ac milan and real madrid star kaka dominated the game on his american bow orlando city fans swathed in purple cheers on their team during the first half at the citrus bowl stadium kaka holds off new york city fc 's andrew jacobson ( right ) as orlando city dominate early proceedings brazilian star kaka high - fives supporters as he leaves the field at the final whistle former stoke player shea ( top ) who now plays for orlando city is tackled during the game an orlando city fan cheers amid frenzied scenes in the best chance of the half passes exchanged between kaka , lewis neal and kevin molino and ended with the ball laying off for the main man to shoot first time , his powerful effort saved
his $ 7,167,500 salary is mammoth , but so is the responsibility on his shoulders to carry the team
he showed yet another example of what he will bring for that in the 23rd minute , picking the ball up 10 yards outside the area and turning quickly to change the direction of play to pass to shea free on the left , who shot narrowly over
two minutes later , the crowd were raising from their seats , straining to get a better look , as he drove forward with the ball on the left , tried to get in between two defenders then eventually got a shot away
when shea , formerly of stoke , barnsley and birmingham , produced a 360 spin to beat an opponent , there was clearly a touch of samba to his thinking
this was not to forget that former barcelona forward david villa , another of the league âs newest stars , was making his debut for new york city where he will be teaming up with frank lampard when the manchester city midfielder joins in the summer
but while kaka took to the league straight away , villa had a frustrating evening

for all orlando city âs domination , their opponents broke from inside their own half and worked the ball quickly to villa who passed into substitute khiry shelton
he shot hard a low across goal but just wide
but they did go in front , in the 76th minute
villa was involved again , passing to mix diskerud who took a touch and before curling an effort into the right of goal
when aurelin collin was sent off late on for a two - footed lunge on villa , it looked like for all kaka âs efforts he would end his first game in america goalless and in defeat
but , like all great players , he produced when it mattered most .
