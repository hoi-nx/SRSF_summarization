michael o'neill ( left ) believes his side are one win away from turning their euro 2016 dream into a reality lafferty of northern ireland blows a kiss to the home support after their euro 2016 qualifying win anghel iordanescu 's side come to windsor park on june 13 and michael o'neill believes success then would go a long way to ensuring a first major tournament in 30 years
' the message is simple
we have given ourselves a fantastic chance , and we have to make sure we take our chance again in june , ' he said , after lafferty 's brilliant brace in belfast
' the romania game becomes massive now
if you can win that game , then it would be hard to think we wo n't get to the euros
it takes on extra significance
do we feel 18 points will be enough ? possibly
' if we can get to 15 points with four games to go , that has to be our target at this moment in time
we will have the chance to go top of the group against romania
' the game comes at an awkward time , with the english and scottish seasons having broken up for the summer , but michael o'neill hopes that does not have a major impact
lafferty scores with a header to make the score 2 - 0 during their win over finland in group f northern ireland are currently second in group f , behind romania , and have 12 points from five games he is relying on dedication from his players and two friendlies - one against qatar on may 31 and another against wales - to get his side in shape
the wales game has yet to be confirmed by the two associations , but michael o'neill is already treating it as a done deal
we have two good warm - up games before that so preparation will be excellent , ' he said
' our preparation in june will be vital , and the warm - up games against qatar and wales will be crucial
but players finish their seasons in may , and there is an onus on certain players to maintain their own fitness
' if fit aaron is sure to become his country 's most capped outfield player in that run of fixtures , with his current tally of 95 leaving him level with david healy
he had to make do with bench duty against finland , with michael o'neill making the tough choice to pair jonny and gareth mcauley in the middle while favouring conor mclaughlin at right - back
michael o'neill believes a win on june 13 would go a long way to ensuring a first major tournament in 30 years they are second in group f , four points clear of hungary and just a point shy of table - topping romania ' leaving out aaron was maybe the most difficult decision i have had to make in my three years , in terms of team selection , ' the manager confessed
' everyone knows what aaron is about and what his qualities are as a player and individual
i sat with aaron a few nights ago and talked about his situation at brighton
' he has n't played much club football in recent tines , and he fully understood where i was coming from
and aaron being aaron , he took it in his professional style
he is still a huge part of this squad , but now we have competition for places which is good
' jonny ( evans ) showed what a top class player he is , and he showed it at hampden against scotland the other night
' but it is only a matter of time before aaron gets his 96th cap and goes on to win 100
