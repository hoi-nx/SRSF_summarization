it 's becoming as regular as clockwork at arsenal : a walcott contract saga
just over two years after signing a Â£ 90,000 - per - week deal , the winger 's future is again in the spotlight
as wenger so jovially put it last week , contact has been made with ' the embassy ' ( walcott 's representatives ) about a contract extension
arsenal forward walcott comes on from the bench against monaco , is now not a guaranteed starter but just like two years ago , there are no guarantees walcott will commit
perhaps , even more so this time
ever since recovering from a serious knee injury that kept him out for the majority of last year , walcott has been on the peripheries
walcott was flying before injuring his anterior cruciate ligament against tottenham last january
he 'd established himself as an integral member of wenger 's first - team plans
walcott sprints away in celebration having scored against leicester during the 2 - 1 victory last month walcott wants a significant pay rise if he is to sign a new arsenal contract since then , though , the landscape at arsenal has changed
alexis sanchez has arrived , so to has welbeck
walcott is no longer indispensable
in addition to alexis sanchez and welbeck , there is santi cazorla and alex oxlade-chamberlain to contend with
walcott no longer walks into this team
so , with that in mind , does he warrant a pay - rise ? that 's the question arsenal 's moneymen will be asking themselves over the coming weeks
because that 's what he wants ; a hefty hike on his current Â£ 4.6million - per - year deal
can you justify paying someone in excess of Â£ 100,000 - per - week who is n't a first - choice option for the manager ? the england international gestures at tottenham fans after injuring his anterior cruciate ligament last year the arsenal hierarchy are likely to argue not
and all that points to one thing : another walcott contract row
you can understand where walcott 's representatives are coming from
at the age of 26 , this could be his last big contract
his advisors have a duty to secure the best possible deal for their client
there will certainly be takers for walcott if he leaves this summer
liverpool and manchester city are both monitoring the situation closely
the fact he has pace and is english ( helping homegrown quotas ) means he will be a valuable commodity if he 's made available for transfer
walcott has faced increased competition for a starting place in the arsenal attack this season as for arsenal , they have four options
the first is to meet his demands , the second is to try to reach a compromise
the third is to let him enter the final year of his contract , which opens the door to walcott leaving for nothing next year
fourth is to sell him this summer
it 's a game of poker
we 're waiting to see who 'll blink first
walcott will be hoping to earn a similar amount to gunners star man alexis sanchez on Â£ 140,000 - per - week walcott looked certain to leave the emirates stadium in 2012 after rejecting a new contract
wenger managed to persuade the speedster to stay and his subsequent performances led to the gunners improving their offer , which was signed in january 2013
there will be a similar incentive for walcott this time , too
but will he spend enough time on the pitch to make a similar impression ? things change
maybe it 's time for walcott to make a change , too .
