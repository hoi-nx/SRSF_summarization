aston villa sherwood spoke exclusively to sportsmail 's chief sports writer martin samuel this week , covering all topics from touchline antics to his spell with tottenham
here are the top 10 quotes from that brilliant interview
aston villa spoke to sportsmail 's chief sports writer martin samuel in an exclusive interview this week sherwood on his leadership qualities â i think i can be a leader of men , but you âre not born with that attitude
in the maternity ward , it âs not girls , boys and natural leaders
you have to become that
â sherwood on his touchline antics and emotional nature ' i could try acting
i could sit down and make little notes and everyone would say i âve matured
but i know that âs impossible
i ca nât imagine being any different 500 games in
people thought i would calm down as a player , but i did nât
the day i retired i was the same lunatic that made his debut for watford in 1987
i ca nât believe the other managers are not as emotionally involved as i am , either
i think they âre all like me inside
sherwood says he ca n't believe other managers are not as emotionally involved as he is sherwood on his aston villa side â we âre like everton
i do nât think we âve got a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle
we ca nât be the crystal palace of last year , or the west brom of this year
digging in , blood and thunder , lump the ball in , protecting a lead , that âs not us
our squad is better on the ball , they âre more suited to pushing for a place in the europa league
sherwood on his players stepping up â the players have a duty , a responsibility to fix this mess
i do nât want to hear crap about how difficult it is to play at home
playing for a big club comes with pressure
anyone can do it for a lesser team â but you have to have b * * * * * * s to play for aston villa
this is a big club
' aston villa are like everton ... they 're not a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle ' sherwood on not listening to criticism â when i was at blackburn there were times when it was difficult
my name would be read out and there were a few groans
i âd sometimes tell david batty , â i âll give it away more times than you âll get it this afternoon
â sherwood on bentaleb â i âd watched him in training
every day was like his last on earth
he would cry if he lost a five - a - side
he played and never looked back
sherwood says he loved the way bentaleb ' played and never looked back ' last season at tottenham sherwood on telling redknapp to take bale off in the san siro â harry âs going mad
â get f * * * * * * gareth off ? â he says
â he âs the only f * * * * * * chance we âve got
â he keeps him on , he scores a hat - trick , gets us back to 4 - 3 and if it goes another 10 minutes , we win
the kid âs career springboards from that performance
sherwood on playing with passion â the coaches used to call me tackler tim , or some rubbish
one day , i put one in and he said to graham taylor , â why âs he keep doing that ? â i âve never forgotten his answer
â brian , you know that shirt you wear on saturday ? â he said
â that âs the shirt he wants
â he was right , too
take a player like jack
i âve had lots of chats with jack
he knows what i think
i tell him : â i will take desire over ability every day â
obviously , the ability ca nât be too low
but if you have the ability â and he has â you âll make it if you have desire
sherwood says you must have the desire and talent to make it at the top these days the young manager was appointed last month to attempt to save aston villa 's season sherwood on managing players â so i did nât come in here all guns blazing or wanting to be their headmaster
you ca nât get personal these days , get your hair cut , and all that nonsense
you âve got to move with the times
i left the stick at home , and the tickling brush
now i feel i know them a bit better
some get a whack , others a tickle
sherwood on tottenham â i do nât want to be scrapping around ; i want to take them forward
i think i did that at tottenham
i did nât leave a crumbling house â mauricio pochettino has done a good job , but he had it laid out for him , with players like kane and bentaleb
