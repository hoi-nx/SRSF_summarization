new delhi police in india 's farthest northeastern state of nagaland have arrested 43 people in connection with the killing of a jail inmate accused of rape
the suspects are being questioned over a range of offenses , including arson , rioting , attempted murder and murder , said doungal , the police chief of nagaland , where the attack occurred thursday evening
they 're alleged to be among a crowd of thousands of people who stormed a jail in the dimapur district , and dragged out the suspected rapist before beating him to death in the street
the 35 - year - old victim had been accused of raping a local woman last month
" there were thousands of them
many of them were students in uniform , " doungal said when news of the attack first emerged
the dead man was initially identified as an undocumented bangladeshi settler , but now police say they still are determining his nationality
" i am not ruling out that he 's not a bangladeshi
i am also not denying that he is not an india
we are verifying his nationality , " said sema , an additional director - general of nagaland 's police , when asked about local reports suggesting the attacked man was an india citizen
dimapur town remains under a curfew , sema said , amid growing tensions between native nagas and bangladeshi migrants in the district
thousands of protesters demanding the cancellation of trade permits for bengali - speaking settlers tore into the prison complex thursday and pulled out the suspect , doungal said
police initially used teargas and bamboo canes to rescue the man , but it did n't work , he said
" there were students in uniform
so , we had to use minimum force , " doungal added
later , police opened fire , but it was too late to save the suspect
protesters had planned a public hanging , but the suspect died from injuries in the attack , according to authorities
" we retrieved his body before it could be hung , " doungal said
with english as its official language , nagaland is located in the extreme northeastern end of india , along the border with myanmar
home to about two million people , the state is spread over 16,500 square kilometers , with a relatively high literacy rate of 67 % , compared with other densely populated parts of india
ethnic tensions are rife in nagaland and other provinces of the impoverished northeast region
some local groups want greater autonomy , and there 's general discontent over the alleged neglect of the region by successive central governments
