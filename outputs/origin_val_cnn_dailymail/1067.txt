former footballer leon mckenzie has been training at the east dulwich gym owned by his father , clinton mckenzie has exclusively spoken to sportsmail ahead of the biggest fight of his life so far on march 14 mckenzie faces ivan stupalo for the super-middleweight international masters title ' i 've got five beautiful children to try and support the best i can
working and fighting i 'm no better than no other man that 's doing the same as me , ' mckenzie tells sportsmail
' just because i 've played premier league football it does not mean that i 'm too good to work
' i work for dpd
i 'm delivering 60 - odd , 70 parcels a day
you 're lifting boxes , you 're in and out of the van
that 's probably a little bit of training in itself
' i sometimes jog in between because we 're on a timer
it 's kind of like a rocky thing going on
' the best moment of mckenzie 's football career came in april 2005 , scoring in a 2 - 0 win against a manchester united team boasting cristiano ronaldo and wayne rooney
almost 10 years on he is looking for a new accomplishment , and beating ivan stupalo in the 10 - round fight would make him the mandatory for the southern area title
mckenzie is preparing for his title bout and the 36 - year - old wants to win on march 14 for his father mckenzie discusses juggling work as a deliveryman , looking after five children and training every day that is the main objective on saturday , and delivering parcels does not compare to how his father has been working him in the gym
' in training dad pushes me to my max , ' mckenzie continues
' i 'm used to dying in training and coming back
it will be the same principle in fights
when it gets hard i have to grit my teeth
' i know where i 've been before so it will be the same principle
i can die and i come back , i can die and i come back
we 're going to win the fight , and i want to win it for my dad as well
' after training i 'll just have a little time by myself
dad says that 's normal when you just go within yourself , and have little flashbacks of life and everything else
' mckenzie ( right ) pictured during his super-middleweight win against john mason in june 2013 ' this means everything to me because since a child i always knew i was going to be something
obviously football took off and we always had another little dream in the background
i always used to love watching dad fight
' i 've started very carefully
for this to be happening , i 'm 37 this year , it is a really big deal
all the years that we 've been training , day in , day out
i 've always been an athlete so this to me is massive
it opens up a lot of doors as well , boxing wise , to go on to bigger and better things , which is another thing
' winning this puts me in mandatory position for a southern area shot at some point , which is another big deal
' i have to work
i 've got five beautiful children to try and support the best i can
working and fighting i 'm no better than no other man that 's doing the same as me
' just because i 've played premier league football it does not mean that i 'm too good enough to work
' i work for dpd , i 'm delivering parcels
i 'm delivering 60 - odd , 70 parcels a day
you 're lifting boxes , you 're in and out of the van , that 's probably a little bit of training in itself
' i sometimes jog in between because we 're on a timer
you 're having to jog in between and you might run behind , but i just look at that as part of the training
it 's kind of like a rocky thing going on
' in training dad pushes me to my max. i 'm used to dying in training and coming back
it will be the same principle in fights
when it gets hard i have to grit my teeth
i know where i 've been before so it will be the same principle
i can die and i come back , i can die and i come back
' we 're going to win the fight , and i want to win it for my dad as well
after training i 'll just have a little time by myself
