nigerians go to the polls saturday to determine who will lead south africa 's most populous nation
the stakes are high in this election as the nation faces intensified attacks by extremist group boko haram
with security catapulting into a key issue , which candidate will voters trust to keep them safe ? as nigerians decides , here 's what you need to know : nigerians is home to about 173 million people and is considered a powerhouse in the region
its stability is crucial to combating the growing risk of islamist terrorists , who thrive on instability
as boko haram seeks to extend its tentacles with its recent pledge of allegiance to isis , nigerians has teamed up with neighboring chad and cameroon in a counteroffensive against the terror group
and it appears to be working , with its military saying it has recaptured several key cities from the militants
the next leader will have to ensure the gains stay on track
as we have learned with isis in iraq and syria , any unaddressed local insurgency has the potential to spiral into an international problem
and let 's face it , the world does not need another failing state , especially one with such a massive population
nigerians is also one of south africa 's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the u.s.
it hosts many international oil companies and workers
the key issues are power , security and the economy
but with the rise of boko haram , security has taken center stage
just this year alone , the extremists have killed at least 1,000 civilians , human rights watch says
one of the militants ' most brutal acts was the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls last april , a majority of whom are still missing
boko haram has become increasingly brazen , seizing towns in bloody attacks and declaring them islamic caliphates
militants have bombed schools , churches and mosques ; kidnapped women and children ; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike
although the current government is " having successes here and there " in its fight against boko haram , it 's not winning the war against the terror group , says johnson , a documentary filmmaker and analyst on african affairs
and despite recapturing some key towns from militants , he says , the government 's big picture on security is still hazy
" this elections will come down to who can protect nigerians , " johnson says
" who can make nigerians feel safe
" nigerians overtook south africa as the region 's largest economy last year
the government has made tremendous gains on the economy , johnson says , but those gains have been buried under the constant threat of boko haram
but many complain that the country 's vast wealth from oil exports does not trickle down to the average citizen
as many as 70 % of nigerians live below the poverty line and survive on less than a dollar a day , according to the cia world factbook
nigerians is under economic pressure because of falling crude oil prices worldwide and a weakened currency
corruption has been a hindrance to building a stable economy despite years of democracy , analysts say
there are 14 candidates on the ballot , but the race is more of a rematch between the current president and a former military ruler
the two faced off in the last election in 2011
president jonathan : jonathan rode a wave of popularity in 2011
at the time , he portrayed himself as a man of the people
during campaigns , he talked about growing up without shoes , a message that resonated with average nigerians
but in recent years , his popularity has plummeted , with nigerians saying he has not delivered on his promises for change
key officials have defected from his ruling people 's democratic party to the newly formed all progressives congress
buhari : the retired general has unsuccessfully run for election three times
buhari ruled nigerians in the 1980s following a military coup and was known for his tough regime , which some say was marked by human rights abuses
but he has pledged to make fighting graft and insecurity a priority if he wins , which might appeal to those who 've run out of patience with the current government
his military rule background could be a plus or a minus
" many nigerians will not forget he was a military leader , during a dictatorship , " johnson says
" or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism
" the election was originally scheduled for february 14 , but was delayed for six weeks
in addition to the presidential elections , nigerians will elect governors in 36 states
like their u.s. counterparts , the nation 's governors have a lot of clout
not only do they set priorities for federal funds , they are also responsible for security in their states and are thus the first line of defense against extremists , especially in the north , where militants have free rein
in populated cities such as lagos , governors manage economies larger than those of some african countries
to avoid a runoff , a candidate must get more than 50 % of the vote and at least a quarter in two - thirds of the states
if no candidate wins , a runoff election will be held seven days later
