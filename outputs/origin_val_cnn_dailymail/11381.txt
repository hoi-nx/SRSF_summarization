strained my lower left leg / ankle area practicing y / day and played with heavy strapping on it in the pro am and this morning

' the week here at @ valerotxopen had everything i wanted
great people and great course
' mcdowell , who won the us open in 2010 , was five over at the valero texas open when he withdrew , having started on the back nine
mcdowell has now turned his focus to being in the best condition possible for the masters on april 9 after completing only the back nine , he said : ' with the masters upcoming i decided getting fit is imperative ' american kuchar ground out a level - par 72 that he described as ' amazing ' to share the early first - round lead in san antonio , where the players struggled in gusting winds on thursday
world no , a seven - times winner on the pga tour , needed ' a lot of luck ' as he mixed four birdies with four bogeys on the challenging layout at the tpc san antonio to end the round level with compatriot cameron percy
former world no 2 jim furyk battled to a 76 while us open champion martin kaymer of germany ballooned to an 82 in sustained winds of 30 miles per hour ( 48 km per hour ) that gusted up to 40mph
' i was giving it all i could on the last hole , ' kuchar , 36 , told golf channel after bogeying his final hole , the par - four ninth
' i was one under with one to go and hoping that i could bring it in under par. kuchar battled swirling winds to grind out a level - par 72 for the lead early in the first round kuchar said he needed ' a lot of luck ' as he mixed four birdies with four bogeys on day one ' but even par is still an amazing day
this was about as challenging of conditions as i can remember facing
this course is hard without wind and you 've really got to drive it well
then you throw in 30mph winds and what can happen
' it took a lot of luck for me
i had a number of things kind of go my way
i was able to hit some great shots and make a few birdies out there as well
' long - hitting american johnson , the world no 9 , carded a 78 that included five bogeys and a double
' whether it 's into the wind or down - wind , it was playing very difficult , ' said johnson
' i did n't hit it very good , i did n't drive it very well so that made it even tougher
my score is terrible but i 'm still not out of the mix , i guess
' world no 6 jordan spieth and fellow american zach johnson , a twice former winner of the valero texas open , were among the day 's late starters .
