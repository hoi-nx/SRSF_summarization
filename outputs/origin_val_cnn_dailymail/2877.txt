resigned : amin was exposed after plotting with far - right extremists to stir up racial hatred the tory election candidate exposed for plotting with far - right extremists to stir up racial hatred is a former member of a fanatical islamic sect that believes the nazis were misunderstood and that jews control the world
amin , who resigned after the mail on sunday published undercover recordings of him meeting the edl , joined the birmingham wing of the murabitun , a fundamentalist cult which questioned the holocaust and praised hitler
in 1992 when amin was 18 , he left the group , founded by scottish hippy ian dallas , after becoming disillusioned
two years later , a book crediting him as author raja afzal raza amin al-quraishy , was published in which he criticised the murabitun and called for jihadi warriors to establish a muslims state in europe
amin says his words were doctored to include the extremist views , which he yesterday described as â disgusting â
in the pamphlet amin â described last week by a colleague as a â walter mitty character â â demeans women and calls for restaurants that serve alcohol to be burned
the book , which is entitled ian dallas : the shaykh who has no clothes , criticised the group for not being radical enough
it states : â my troubles with the birmingham community began when i realised that we were all illiterate , in sharâiah terms , ignorant , and nobody had a plan to take the city in which we lived
â my pushing for study of the sharâiah and a militant islam resulted in my expulsion to slough
â those of us in the cities of europe need to free ourselves economically from kafir [ unbeliever ] institutions , state and private , by creating our own arenas of trade , with islamic coinage â¦ and the building of independent villages for muslims , from where the mujahidun [ jihad warriors ] can burst out and conquer lands establishing islam [ a muslims region ]
â recounting the tale of another muslims , a passage in the book says that he â as any man would , refused to be taught the â methodology of jihad â by a female
you see nobody can be strengthened by somebody that is weaker
â discussing indian restaurants which sell alcohol , he says : â my complaint is primarily with the hypocrisy of a group of people who claim to be the â cutting edge â of islam , yet instead of burning the alcohol - selling restaurants are accepting â¦ â last week , former student abu abdullah , who said he met amin while studying at the school of african and oriental studies in london , claims amin proudly gave him a copy of the pamphlet in 1998
amin resigned after the mail on sunday published undercover recordings of him
pictured : the mail on sunday 's front page last week he said : â we were shocked when we saw what he had written and asked him to move out
â amin said yesterday : â this work is not a book , it is merely stapled photocopied pages
it has been the subject of legal action and any suggestion that i share these views is defamatory
my rights were infringed by the author
â when i was 19 years old i was asked by a former member of the group to send him my account of the few months i spent with them
â he has inserted phrases throughout which are not my words and the last few paragraphs are a complete fabrication
i have been actively opposing such extreme and rejectionist views my whole life
â amin , 40 , was exposed for hatching a plot with the edl to announce a demonstration in his dudley north constituency which would then be cancelled , allowing him to claim credit for brokering peace
a muslims campaigner claims amin asked him to publicly attack his military career to make him more appealing to working - class white voters
asghar bukhari , founding member of the muslim public affairs committee uk , said : â he thought it would help distance him from muslims and get white people to support him
â amin responded : â if i have met him i do not recall doing so
â and ... he hinted at westminster deal for lobbyist amin wanted cash in exchange for helping clients once elected , it is claimed
financial services lobbyist gentry said amin told him he would â take care of his clients â and be â a friend in the house â
mr gentry added : â he worded it in a way that sounded financially beneficial to him
â amin said : â no such discussion took place
â and ... he ' was always abroad ' amin preferred going abroad to canvassing , according to millward , of dudley north tory association
she said : â he was often disappearing on trips to dubai and somalia
â amin said : â performance issues should be referred to the party
â so why did the tories let him stand for a seat ? serious questions were raised last night over the vetting process which put amin on tory central office âs â approved list â of candidates
calls for a review came from the leader of his local constituency association , who said dudley north had been saddled with a â complete maverick â
influence : amin afzal with former tory election chairman baroness warsi millward said : â on paper , amin was a very good candidate when he was selected in 2013 , but i think the whole process needs to be thoroughly looked at after this election
â if someone is on the list , you would have thought that they âd have been thoroughly vetted by central office and they âd be there on merit , but you then find you âve got a complete maverick who does nât want to do what he âs told or toe the party line
â of mr amin âs explanation about the fake edl march idea â comparing it to â negotiations with the taliban â â mrs millward added : â this is not kandahar
â meanwhile , goodman , editor of the conservative home website for grassroots members , said a long and highly critical comment about amin âs military career â describing him as â a fantasist with questionable integrity â â was posted at the end of an article amin wrote 16 weeks ago , but was not followed up
â i âm sure plenty of senior people in the party would have seen it , â said former mp mr goodman
â you might have thought it would ring alarm bells
