â i have to be more disciplined and you do nât see me in the box so much , â he added
â i am more positional , always behind the ball , always finding solutions for the other players and controlling the tempo
â if you asked me 12 months ago whether i would work with jose mourinho i would have said â no â , but you can never say never
â working with jose mourinho , it has been really good so far , but i expected that
i knew he was a great personality and i knew coming to chelsea , a big club with a big manager , that i would work a lot
i have enjoyed this the most in my career

fabregas played in the 2006 champions league final , alongside gilberto silva when arsenal were beaten by barcelona after extra time in the stade de france
he was in the centre of midfield that night , putting in an arduous shift in the boiler room because arsenal were down to 10 after the dismissal of goalkeeper jens lehmann
a year later he faced chelsea in the league cup final , unlucky to lose after a battle royal with some players of pedigree in jose mourinho âs side
â as a kid he played against our midfield in the league cup final in 2007 and we had ( michael ) essien , ( claude ) makelele , ( frank ) lampard and ( michael ) ballack , and he was playing fantastic football , â said jose mourinho
â i never felt he could work with me because when i was at chelsea he was at arsenal and when i was at real madrid he was at barcelona
so it was quite unexpected for me that he wanted to come to chelsea
â now that he is here , they would nât be without him
