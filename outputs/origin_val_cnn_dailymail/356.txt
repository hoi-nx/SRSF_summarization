sitting in the afternoon sun , amanda calmly writes in her journal while her fiancÃ© , colin sutherland , watches over her
the couple â who have known each other since their schooldays â look like any other young lovers enjoying a spring afternoon at home in seattle.however , knox , 27 , is now just hours away from learning if she will become a convicted murderer for the second time when a court in rome , some 5,000 miles away , delivers its verdict tomorrow
wearing a casual vest and jeans and with her short hair tied back in a knot , the creative writing graduate must have a number of things going through her mind to jot down as the new judgement over the bloody murder of british exchange student meredith kercher in 2007 eases closer
knox served four years in prison after she was originally convicted of the crime alongside ex-boyfriend raffaele and meredith kercher , but a second ruling in 2011 declared her innocent and she returned to her native us
amanda âs seemingly relaxed demeanour was a far cry from the telling body language of her mother , edda mellas , on tuesday , the day before the new verdict had originally been due to be given
' he said amanda was ' worried , very worried ' amanda 's mother , edda mellas , has tried to distract herself with the family shopping but she can barely hide her inner turmoil on behalf of her daughter , who once again faces the prospect of a life sentence behind bars for her alleged role in the death of british exchange student kercher
edda mellas had risen at around 05.30 am wednesday morning at her home in seattle and around an hour later was joined by ex-husband knox , 54 , who lives nearby
no doubt they were waiting for the final verdict in the case , which has dragged on for eight years and already seen knox and her co-accused , former boyfriend raffaele , 30 , acquitted once
after the 2011 acquittal knox , 28 , returned to her hometown of seattle , washington , after having served four years in an italy prison
she is currently believed to be staying at her mother 's house
however , the ruling was overturned in 2013 , and knox was handed a sentence of 28 and a half years in prison
her current case is an appeal against that sentence which could either be upheld â and see her once again declared guilty â acquit her entirely , or the case could be sent back for another round of appeals
physical and forensic evidence in the brutal murder of kercher â who was stabbed and had her throat cut â has been hotly contested throughout the trials , as has both knox and raffaele 's version of events that night
knox and her family now face another agonizing day before a new verdict is given
speaking at court in rome on wednesday , knox 's lawyer , carlo dalla vedova said her ' conviction is not justice â but a distortion of the facts '
in his closing statement he asked the court to overturn the guilty verdict , and added : ' we are confronted with a very grave judicial error that must be set right
' amanda is just hours away from learning her fate raffaelle sollecito changed his story earlier this week claiming he now does not remember whether knox was with him at the time of meredith kercher 's murder asked about how his client had been in the last few days , he said : ' worried , very worried
' raffaele remains in italy â where his passport has been confiscated to stop him fleeing - and was present for the hearing in court
if knox is convicted italy courts will have to ask for her extradition , which will lead to another round of legalities in the us to determine whether or not she will finally be sent to prison again , and where
that decision would ultimately be left in the hands of secretary of state john kerry
on tuesday afternoon edda mellas , 52 , a mathematics teacher in the highline area of seattle , had shopped for groceries at a local supermarket before heading to the seattle area of the city where she lives with husband chris , 40 , and daughters ashley , 20 , and delaney , 15
they appeared to have a number of visitors , who were no doubt wishing them luck with the scheduled verdict
however , after it was delayed , the curtains in the house remained closed all day wednesday
since her return to seattle , knox has tried to get on with a normal life and had resumed studies at the university of washington and even took on freelance work at a local newspaper , the west seattle herald
knox 's new guy : amanda was pictured out with fiance colin sutherland in new york
he is an aspiring rock musician amanda 's mom will have to wait until tomorrow to learn the italy court 's decision she even found love , first with classical music student james terrano and then with new york - based musician colin sutherland , whom she announced her engagement to in february of this year
knox has become increasingly distanced from raffaele , who changed his story earlier this week , claiming he now does not remember whether knox was with him at the time of meredith kercher 's murder
he claimed in documents presented to court on tuesday he ca n't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night kercher was murdered
markus wiget , an italy criminal trial lawyer claimed raffaele was making the claims in a last ditch attempt to save his own skin
he said : ' you could say he is throwing her to the wolves
it is bad for amanda ' s defense but it might not be good for raffaele 's defense either
the lawyers are probably trying this approach as a very last resort
' one person , meredith kercher , has already been convicted of murder , but the italy courts have ruled he did not act alone .
