a plainclothes police officer has been caught on camera screaming at an uber driver while pounding on his car
after pulling the man , humayun , over for an alleged traffic violation , the cop yells at one point ; ' i do n't know where you 're coming from , where you think you 're appropriate in doing that ; that 's not the way it works
how long have you been in this country ? ' it came after the driver reportedly beeped at the cop and went around him when he failed to signal that he was backing into a parking spot
' moments later the cop returns with a ticket , this after he has pounded on the car and , according to one of the passengers , thrown things in the vehicle
as the driver agrees with everything the cop says , he manages to cut off the man , which sends him into another tirade as he screams ; ' i do n't know what fu * * ing planet you 're on right now ! ' the officer also mocks the driver 's accent throughout and his pronunciation of certain words
an nypd spokesperson has revealed they have seen the video and are investigating the incident according to the new york daily news , the nypd has seen the video and said in a statement ; ' we are aware of the incident and video and it is under review with the department âs internal affairs bureau
' the video was taken in the west village over the weekend , in the city 's 6th precinct , though the identity of the officer is still not known
' our uber driver , humayun , was abused by a police officer today in nyc , ' sanjay seth , who took the video , wrote on his facebook page monday
' the unending rage , door slamming , throwing items into the car , threatening arrest without cause was bad enough - but the officer 's remarks at the end really took it to another level
' uber said in a statement ; ' the behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the nypd investigating the incident
we are in touch with our driver - partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs
