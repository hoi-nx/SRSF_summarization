a little - known southern pizza chain is edging in on big name brands to take a big slice of the market
hunt brothers pizza provides gas stations and convenience stores with ingredients and start up equipment but does n't charge franchise fees
as a result it now boasts more u.s. sites than either domino 's or pizza hut , with 7,300 locations in 28 states
as well as the convenience factor , customers apparently love the taste
' it 's just got more flavor
it seems like , with the others , you 're getting cardboard
' while hunt brothers pizza may be unknown in many households , it runs television ads during nascar races and cable outdoors shows
for several years , it has sponsored kevin harvick , who won the 2014 nascar sprint cup
on a recent morning at 10:40am , bruce , who owns rightway foodmart in andersonville , tennessee , started sliding hunt brothers pizza pizzas for the lunch rush into a conveyor - belt oven
easy - to - make : each pie starts out frozen , a crust with sauce and a layer of cheese build your own : employees can add fresh pepperoni , extra cheese and other toppings tasty treat : the result after about five minutes in the 525 - degree oven is a bubbling - hot pizza with browned toppings that tastes comparable to the big delivery chains ' pizzas each pie starts out frozen , a crust with sauce and a layer of cheese
employees can add fresh pepperoni , extra cheese and other toppings
the result after about five minutes in the 525 - degree oven is a bubbling - hot pizza with browned toppings that tastes comparable to the big delivery chains ' pizzas
in about an hour , bruce sold that first pizza and another one in two - slice $ 2.99 ' hunks ' from a countertop warming display near his cash register
pizza customers included a ups delivery driver , a woman on her way to lunch with her daughter and a guy in camouflage who confessed he was just coming from the liquor store
in a typical hunt brothers pizza arrangement , bruce said he paid about $ 10,000 for his oven , freezer , display case and other equipment and now just pays the nashville , tennessee - based company for the pizza ingredients
hunt brothers pizza , which is privately owned , fine - tuned this approach starting in the early 1990s when four brothers who 'd worked separately in the restaurant industry joined forces to sell pizzas to convenience stores
hunt brothers pizza had 750 locations by 1994 , said solsvig , its vice president for marketing
' convenience stores in rural areas were the hub , ' solsvig said in a phone interview
' a lot of people coming and going
and a lot of these smaller towns , they did n't really have a lot of other restaurants or other places to eat
' alabama , georgia , tennessee and texas each have more than 700 locations , solsvig said
not all locations are isolated , with hunt brothers pizza also found at busy highway interchanges
and it 's moved into some urban areas , such as memphis
the convenience store model is different from a free - standing restaurant , and a hunt brothers pizza outlet is likely to bring in far less than the more than $ 700,000 an average domino 's makes a year , said tristano , a restaurant industry analyst with technomic
speedy delivery : maria witkowski hands a hunt brothers pizza from the drive - thru window to a customer at the rightway foodmart in andersonville pit stop : in a typical hunt brothers pizza arrangement , outlets pay about $ 10,000 for an oven , freezer , display case and other equipment - they then just pay the nashville , tennessee - based company for the pizza ingredients tristano noted that 7-eleven offers pizza in some of its 7,800 u.s. locations and that little caesars has also had success in rural areas
while hunt brothers pizza declined to discuss company finances , bruce says he sells about 500 pizzas a month , much of it by the hunk
combined with drinks and other convenience items , he estimates pizza customers spend more than $ 10,000 each month in his store
tristano says the simplicity of the setup has helped the company grow
' in a convenience store , you 're doing the register , you 're doing gas
you 're doing so many different things , ' bruce said
' it 's hard to be able to do pizza from the ground up , making the dough and the whole thing
' fred england , a food vendor at a furniture factory about 30 miles east of andersonville , added a hunt brothers pizza to his lunch counter about a year ago to keep his customers from looking elsewhere for their pizza fix
' the problem i had was all these other places were delivering pizza , so i had to come up with something , ' he said while stopping at rightway to chat with bruce

the 35 - year - old andersonville resident said she buys hunt brothers pizza about twice a week
' i love it , ' she said
' i usually do n't get other pizza
