barnes did get a second chance as a manager in british football
what he did nât get was a third
having tried and failed at an elite club , celtic â he left after the infamous loss to inverness caledonian thistle â barnes managed jamaica and then tranmere rovers
on october 9 , 2012 , when he was sacked after a run of two wins in 11 matches , tranmere rovers were 22nd in league one
barnes , at the oxford union , tried and failed at celtic before spells at jamaica and tranmere rovers barnes , pictured in charge of celtic , left the club after their infamous loss to inverness caledonian thistle barnes believes black managers do nât get the second chances afforded their white counterparts , but where could he have gone from there ? nothing in his record suggested he would thrive in the lower leagues , his experience at celtic will have damaged his appeal to bigger clubs
barnes was stymied by circumstances , not the colour of his skin
jason mcateer , his assistant , has not worked since , either â and neither have three of the four managers subsequently employed and ditched by tranmere rovers
chris hughton , formerly of tottenham hotspur , newcastle united , birmingham city , norwich city , and now boss at brighton and hove albion the experience of chris hughton ( tottenham hotspur , newcastle united , birmingham city , norwich city , brighton and hove albion ) , paul ince ( macclesfield town , milton keynes dons , blackburn rovers , notts county , blackpool ) or keith curle ( mansfield town , chester city , torquay united , crystal palace , notts county , carlisle united ) supports the theory of the managerial merry-go-round , but suggests that once a black coach is on board , his opportunity is no different from that of a white one
the problem is getting the elusive first job , not where to go if it does nât work out at tranmere rovers
we know what happens then , black or white .
