hong kong taipei is fast becoming the go - to asian city for some of hollywood 's biggest hitters
martin scorsese is filming his latest opus " silence " there , and french director luc besson chose taipei over seven other asian cities for his sci - fi thriller " lucy , " starring scarlett johansson
and this may " the walking dead " star andrew lincoln will begin filming in the city for a movie project
tasked with attracting international film makers , jao , head of the taipei film commission , said that 92 foreign film crews shot in the city last year , up from 56 in 2013
" we hope the whole island can be like a big studio , " she told cnn while in hong kong thursday
it was n't always this way
for years , taiwan , while home to acclaimed filmmakers like edward yang and hou hsiao-hsien , was overlooked in favor of its ritzier neighbors hong kong , shanghai and tokyo
and even when hollywood came knocking , the city did n't always have its act together
the producers of " mission impossible iii , " released in 2006 , had wanted to film at taipei , at that time the world 's tallest skyscraper
but faced with red tape and reluctance , they ended up choosing the 53 - story shanghai bank of china tower for tom cruise 's memorable bungee jump
" we lost an opportunity for the world to get to know taipei , " says jao
jao 's commission was set up in 2008 to court international film makers but it was n't until director lee , who was born in taiwan , filmed the oscar - winning hit " life of pi " on the island that it began to earn a reputation as an accommodating and affordable place to shoot
lee filmed the memorable and technically difficult scenes of a shipwrecked boy and a tiger at a purpose - built facility at abandoned airport in the taiwan city of taichung
with its relatively unknown cityscape , taiwan can also function as a generic asian backdrop
the island , which was a japan colony , is already being used as a stand - in for japan
japan director takashi miike used taiwan 's high - speed rail system in a bullet - strewn action sequence for crime drama " shield of straw , " which competed at the cannes international film festival
japan rail authorities turned him away
and martin scorsese 's " silence , " due to release in 2016 , is a historic drama about two jesuit priests who travel to japan
taiwan is also a popular alternative to china , where there are many restrictions on filmmakers -- authorities can censor scripts considered politically sensitive or obscene
hong kong director woo used both taiwan and china as locations in " the crossing
" dubbed china 's " titanic , " it focuses on a ship that sank when the nationalist government fled china for taiwan in 1949 as the communists took over -- a sensitive period in china history
taiwan and china are still governed separately
china authorities asked woo to tone down the heroics of a nationalist soldier , according to the south china morning post -- not something that taiwan would ever require , says jao
the commission offers incentives for international film crews
up to $ 2 million is available per movie -- half of that as a cash subsidy
but just as important is the island 's versatility as a location , says jao
while many of the film crews are from neighboring asian countries , the city has hosted crews from latvia and germany , while the bbc shot some of its newly released drama " x + y " in the city
" it 's a small island
within half an hour , you can go from the streets to the mountains to the sea
