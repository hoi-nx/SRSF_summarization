a creepy video shows how a burglar manages to break into a man 's house before helping himself to a number of electronic and personal items
the footage was captured by a new zealand man who installed security cameras around his home after being broken into four times in two and a half years
david hooper , 56 , was at work at a local cinema in whanganui on the country 's north island and was monitoring the live cctv footage from his mobile phone when he noticed the signs of a break in
mr david hooper reviewed the video , which shows the thief knock on his front door before walking around the side of the house to climb through a window he smashed open with a brick
he then smashes mr david hooper 's flat screen tv in an effort to yank it away from the wall
the thief then makes his way into a second room to search through more drawers , before walking through the kitchen armed with mr david hooper 's guitar
the man walks out the front door with the guitar slung over his shoulder , carrying the basket of items
he pulls the sleeves of his hoodie over his hands to close the front door without leaving fingerprints
the break in occurred between 6.55pm and 7.20pm last tuesday , but mr david hooper did not notice his trashed home until 9pm
as he was the only person manning the cinema he could not leave until after 10.30pm
he installed security cameras into his home after being broken into four times in two and a half years the burglar can be seen rifling through the draws and filling up a washing basket with electronics and games ' when i saw it at nine o'clock i was pretty upset , it was not very pleasant at all , ' mr david hooper told daily mail australia
' especially when i saw him breaking the tv - there was no need for that
' the man had stolen his playstation , seven games , a digital camera , a guitar , an e-cigarette and even meat from his freezer
mr david hooper said there could be more items he does n't yet know about
he estimates $ 15,000 worth of stuff has been stolen over the five break - ins
the security video was shared on his work 's facebook page and was viewed more than 27,000 times
the security video was shared on his work 's facebook page and was viewed more than 27,000 times a woman who had purchased the items from the thief saw the video , recognised him and alerted police
they arrested him after finding his fingerprints at the scene
mr david hooper said break - ins occurred all over whanganui , and he believes he has been targeted so often because he lives by himself
' i just live alone and when my car 's not home , i 'm not home , ' he said
' all i wanted was a nice quiet life and to live in peace â¦ i 'm a bit too scared to go home now
' mr david hooper said he would love to sell his house but property prices in the area have recently taken a dive , and he would not consider renting it out after bad experiences in the past
' when i did have it rented they absolutely trashed the house so it 's put me off getting tenants , ' he said
' i 'm sort of stuck
