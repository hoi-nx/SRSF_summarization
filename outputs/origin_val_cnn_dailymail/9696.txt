the pathetic excuses from friends and colleagues defending gerrard have been a joke
unfortunately for arguably liverpool âs greatest - ever player , he proved on sunday that brendan rodgers has made the correct decision to cut him loose from anfield at the end of this season
i âd be surprised if gerrard makes the liverpool starting line - up again , and any substitute appearances will surely only be to give the fans a wave goodbye
why should brendan rodgers trust gerrard again this season ? gerrard looks dejected after seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on for liverpool at anfield gerrard stamped on herrera 's right leg shortly after coming on at the start of the second half herrera gestures and points at gerrard as the liverpool midfielder reacts following the challenge this is an experienced professional , a captain , a legend and there is nothing anyone can say that should mask the truth that he absolutely let everyone at liverpool down
he also failed to apologise to herrera in his brief post-match interview , which showed a lack of class
some said gerrard was frustrated because he was nât in the starting line - up
that might be true , but it does nât excuse a violent stamp on an opponent âs ankle
others have said he was desperate to get involved and show his passion
after all his years in the game , with all his knowledge of this fixture , he must surely know there is only one way to show passion and commitment on such a huge occasion â and that âs to make good , clean tackles , play well and get the job done
this was liverpool âs biggest game of the season , against fierce rivals , it âs a game they âre losing when he comes on the pitch and it âs a game they need to win
liverpool captain gerrard looks baffled after seeing referee martin atkinson brandish a red card gerrard walks off the anfield pitch in what was his last appearance against united in a liverpool shirt if wayne rooney had done it , the reaction would be far worse
there would be calls to strip him of the england captaincy
if it had been joey barton , the reaction would have hit fever pitch
had it been a chelsea player â well , the internet and the fa would have been in meltdown
there would have been talk of points deductions probably
but because it was gerrard , the appropriate outrage has been tempered because apparently , according to the apologists , brendan rodgers made a mistake by failing to put him in the starting line - up
gerrard ( centre ) walks past brendan rodgers ( left ) as emre can ( right ) listens to instructions from his boss queens park rangers midfielder joey barton would have been ridiculed if he had made such a challenge last season âs slip against chelsea was accidental , the stamp on sunday was calculated : at best it was gerrard being a careless hot - head desperate to make a mark
at worst , it looked like a reckless player who is now past caring about the fortunes of his club
gerrard was the main man responsible for one of liverpool âs most glorious nights back in 2005 in istanbul
nobody can ever take that away from him
ten years on , there âs a good chance that gerrard âs last significant act for his club could be a red card that proves to be a major factor in handing united a passage back into the champions league â at liverpool âs expense
gerrard âs legacy is shattered
it âs a sad and sorry way to go , but he only has himself to blame
the liverpool captain has been mocked for slipping against chelsea during the clash back in april 2014 gerrard will want to be remembered for leading liverpool to champions league glory in may 2005
