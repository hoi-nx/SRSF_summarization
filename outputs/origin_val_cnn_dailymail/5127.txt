playing with thierry henry turned bradley wright-phillips into the mls 's top goal scorer last season
the duo had chemistry and the result was one of those seasons that will be hard to beat , with the englishman scoring 27 goals in 32 games and winning the league 's golden boot
doing it again might be a lot tougher
thierry henry , the french international who brought immense talent and recognition to the league , has retired and bradley wright-phillips is going to have to go through an adjustment period
bradley wright-phillips ( left ) did n't have a shot in the new york red bulls ' season opener against sporting kansas city thierry henry retired at the end of the season meaning bradley wright-phillips has a new strike partner the new york red bulls have revamped their roster and thierry henry is n't the only one gone
australian international tim cahill has departed along with fellow midfielder eric alexander
in the season opening tie against sporting kansas city , bradley wright-phillips did n't have a shot
' i do n't have to readjust my game , ' the 30 - year - old englishman said after the new york red bulls practiced for their home opener against d.c. united on sunday
' i am always going to play the same way i always have
the players that have come in , i 'm trying to learn like i did with thierry henry
i learned how he played and i learned to play off him
i 'll try to do the same with the new guys
' the additions this season are midfielders sacha kljestan and felipe martins and striker mike grella
but in the 1 - 1 season - opening draw , the chemistry was lacking up front
' on the day of the game i put a lot of it down to me , ' bradley wright-phillips said
' i was a bit too eager to get behind
i could have done a little bit better with my runs
it 's the first game , i do n't really lose my mind after a first game of the season
' if there is a difference this season it 's the style of the new york red bulls ' play under new coach jesse marsch
there is an emphasis on moving the ball quickly with everybody contributing
a lot went through thierry henry in past seasons
the new york red bulls drew 1 - 1 with sporting kansas city in their first mls game of the season ' for us , it was almost a little unrealistic having a guy like thierry henry on the team , ' new york red bulls captain and midfielder mccarty said
' he was a little of a wild card , a joker
if you are losing or in a bad situation , you could just play him the ball and hope that something magical happened , which more often than not did
i think this is a team that can hurt you in numerous ways and that 's going to be a big shift this season
mccarty said the team could have helped bradley wright-phillips more in the opening game
' we did n't create enough chances for bradley wright-phillips , ' mccarty said
' i think he will admit he can do a better job making better runs and we have a do a better job of looking for him and finding him when he does make those good runs
that is the thing that is going to make us successful this season
bradley wright-phillips is n't heading into the season thinking : how does he top last year ? he has set a goal target that he is not disclosing
if he meets it , he 'll set another one
whatever he does , bradley wright-phillips is n't interested in heading back to englishman , where he played for manchester city , southampton , plymouth argyle , charlton athletic and brentford before coming to the new york red bulls in july 2013
' i do n't want to go back to europe
i 've said that several times , ' bradley wright-phillips said
' there were one or two whispers that i heard about but it does n't interest me
i 'm playing for the new york red bulls and i love living in new jersey
' bradley wright-phillips says he has no desire of coming back to englishman and is enjoying life in the usa
