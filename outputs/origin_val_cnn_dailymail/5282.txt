a ' quiet pint ' at the local pub turned into a 7,000 - mile trip to thailand for two british men â armed with just a tesco carrier bag containing some clothes
company director boyle , 33 , had decided to go for a beer at the southern cross pub in middlesbrough with friends for a relaxing friday night
but one turned to two and then three and more - and at 1am mr boyle , along with friend blyth , 33 , decided to go home
however , their decision soon led them halfway around the world
boyle , 33 , ( far left ) and friend blyth , 33 , ( second left ) pictured with friends they met in thailand after leaving the pub they stopped off for some more beers from the petrol station along the way
it was back at mr boyle 's house where the two , in their drunken stupor , decided to book a taxi to manchester in the morning and fly to thailand
mr boyle said : ' after lots of jokes , at around 11am the next day with a hangover , blyth asks if i had my passport handy and came up with the idea of us going to thailand straight away
the pair flew from manchester to pattaya , thailand with a stopover in abu dhabi ' quiet drink ' : mr boyle had decided to go for a beer at the southern cross pub ( pictured ) in middlesbrough with friends for a relaxing friday night ' i thought he was joking at first and then he pointed out how there are quite a few lads from middlesbrough over there we had n't seen for a while
travelling light : mr boyle admitted he only took a tesco bag with a few pairs of boxers and t - shirts ' then we got into a taxi he 'd phoned and - apart from the short delay of picking up blyth 's passport - we were off to manchester
when we got in the taxi we did n't even have flights
' it 's a last minute bad idea - but one of those bad ideas that turns into a good idea
' mr boyle revealed that while battling a hangover , he managed to pack a tesco carrier bag with some boxer shorts and a few t - shirts
the journey to the airport saw mr boyle come close to cancelling as the alcohol started to wear off , but once they arrived at manchester , the pair managed to book flights to the far east
the key protagonist may have been rigger mr blyth , who was recognised by the taxi driver as having splashed out on these last - minute trips numerous times in the past
it was then that the taxi driver revealed that it was n't the first time mr blyth had done a similar flit - having used him several times before to make similar last - minute trips
mr boyle said : â the taxi driver told me how blyth had done this same last minute thing four times now , with him being the same driver to take him to manchester in each case
i thought that was hilarious and then said â ok , i 'm in â
â flights from manchester to pattaya were secured
with a stopover in abu dhabi it amounted to two seven - hour trips
' some of the lads have serious girlfriends and kids and it 's been pretty intense for some of them , ' added mr boyle
a few quiet beers in middlesbrough ended up with a trip to thailand ( above ) for mr boyle and his friend ' i would n't like to be facing the grief that some of them will be inevitably going home to
' but no - one 's misbehaved to be fair
i think it 's a place where younger lads would perhaps go crazy
i 'm single right now - so no consequences to face for me
' the pair are making their way back to middlesbrough today
mr boyle added : ' i 'd never fancied thailand before - so going last minute for a few days is perfect
' today we 're by the pool and out to complete our version of the hangover
