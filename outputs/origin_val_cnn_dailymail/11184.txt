tennessee prosecutors have made sterilization of women part of plea negotiations so many times in the past five years that the district attorney has banned his staff from offering that as an option
prosecutors in nashville have used the invasive surgery as a bargaining chip at least four times in the past five years
davidson county district attorney glenn funk , a former defense attorney who took over the office in september , has ordered lawyers in his office not to seek sterilization by defendants
he said : ' i have let my office know that that is not an appropriate condition of a plea
' it is now policy that sterilization will never be a condition of deal - making in the district attorney 's office
' the bottom line is the government ca n't be ordering a forced sterilization
' funk said people could be ordered to stay away from children and the state would n't have to resort to such invasive measures
in the most recent case , a woman with a 20 - year history of mental illness had been charged with neglect after her five - day - old baby mysteriously died
her defense attorney said the prosecutor assigned to the case would n't go forward with a plea deal to keep the woman out of prison unless she had the surgery
defense attorneys say there have been at least three similar cases in the past five years
that figure suggests the practice may not be as rare as people think and may happen more often outside the public view and without the blessing of a court
however , such deals do happen
224,000 adults experienced serious mental illness in 2012 - 13
47,000 children ages 12 to 17 had one major depressive episode in 2012 - 13

and last year , a virginia man who fathered children with several women agreed to undergo a vasectomy in exchange for less prison time in a child endangerment case
forced sterilization came up in a different way in california last year , when governor jerry brown signed a bill that banned state prisons from forcing female inmates to be sterilized
the law was pushed through after the center for investigative reporting found that nearly 150 female prisoners had been sterilized between 2006 and 2010
an audit found that the state failed to make sure the inmate 's consent was lawfully obtained in every case
the most recent nashville case involved jasmine randers , 36 , who had been under court supervision for mental illness when she left her home state of minnesota
she gave birth in west memphis , arkansas , then fled a homeless shelter to come to nashville , said her attorney , assistant public defender harcombe
court records show jasmine randers reported awakening in a motel , where she 'd slept in a bed with the baby , only to find the child unresponsive
she reportedly called a taxi two hours later and took the child to a local hospital , where the infant was pronounced dead
there was no sign of injury , and the cause of death was undetermined
police later learned that in 2004 , jasmine randers stabbed herself in the stomach while pregnant , though the fetus was not harmed
she told investigators that it happened when she fell down the stairs while cutting fruit
the assistant district attorney who worked the case , holmgren , was once a senior attorney with the national center for prosecution of child abuse and serves on the international advisory board of the national center for shaken baby syndrome
he has been both praised and fiercely criticized for his aggressive courtroom tactics on behalf of children
when holmgren insisted randers undergo sterilization to avoid prison , harcombe complained
the district attorney took over the case , and jasmine randers was not sterilized
the prosecutor agreed jasmine randers was mentally ill and she was institutionalized after being found not guilty by reason of insanity
harcombe said : ' any time a woman is given a choice between prison and this surgery , that is inherently coercive , even in cases where there is no mental illness
' jasmine randers , who has a history of mental illness , was charged with neglect after her five - day - old baby died
her defense attorney said the prosecutor would n't go forward with a plea deal unless she was sterilized harcombe said holmgren previously asked that another client agree to be sterilized in order to get a plea deal
she refused and it did n't become part of the plea deal reached in that case
nashville defense attorney searcy said holmgren asked that two of her clients who gave birth to children who tested positive for drugs undergo sterilization
neither did , searcy said , because both women had already undergone the procedure
assistant public defender joan lawson said she also had been involved in cases in which a prosecutor had put sterilization on the table
she said she refused the idea and resolved her cases without sterilization
the attorney said : ' it 's always been more of ' if your client is willing to do this , then i might be inclined to talk about probation
' lawson said it was typically not an explicit demand , was not an everyday occurrence and was made off the record
sterilization coerced by the legal system evokes a dark time in america , when minorities , the poor and those deemed mentally unfit or ' deficient ' were forced to undergo medical procedures that prevented them from having children
paul lombardo , a law professor and historian who teaches at georgia state university , said : ' the history of sterilization in this country is that it is applied to the most despised people - criminals and the people we 're most afraid of , the mentally ill - and the one thing that that these two groups usually share is that they are the most poor
' that is what we 've done in the past , and that 's a good reason not to do it now
