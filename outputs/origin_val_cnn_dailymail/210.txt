marr has branded paxman as a â genuinely tortured , angry individual â
the bbc presenter said mr paxman , 64 , was barely able to hide his disdain for those he interviews â and that it had been a mistake to allow him to grill cameron and miliband last thursday
speaking at the london school of economics , mr marr argued the former newsnight host âs aggressive interviews were â not a good replacement â for debate between the prime minister and the labour leader
â the thing about paxman is that he is a genuinely tortured , angry individual â and you get the real paxman , â mr marr said
â he looks disdainful and contemptuous and furious with his guests because he by and large is
you ca nât fake these things on television
â however , mr marr , 55 , suggested mr paxman had forgotten why the leader interviews were being televised and had allowed his own ego to get in the way
â no disrespect to paxman , but it would have been a lot more interesting had it been head to head , â he said
â replacing that with a good â paxmaning â for both of them , while entertaining , was not a good replacement
â there is a danger for all of us , as it were , in the interviewer âs chair to forget that we are not the ones standing for election
â and i thought miliband did score [ in the interview ] when he said , â paxman , you âre important , but you âre not that important â
â mr marr , a former colleague of mr paxman , said it had been a mistake to allow the former newsnight presenter to grill prime minister cameron and labour leader miliband last thursday for the election debate a number of television critics said mr paxman dominated the show so strongly that viewers might have finished wanting to vote for him rather than either of the party leaders
however , mr marr âs comments went down badly with viewers , who accused the bbc political editor of being â supine â , â sycophantic â and having an â inflated sense of his own importance â
others speculated mr marr âs remarks were driven by jealousy
the two men spent nearly 15 years as colleagues at the bbc , until mr paxman quit last year
but they have had relatively little to do with each other
mr paxman hosted a series of documentaries and fronted bbc2 âs flagship current affairs programme , newsnight
mr marr , who started out as a newspaper journalist , has spent the past decade at the helm of bbc1 âs sunday current affairs programme , the andrew marr show
he also fronts bbc radio 4 âs start the week each monday
speaking at the london school of economics , mr marr said paxman âs aggressive interviews were â not a good replacement â for a debate between the two political leaders a bbc source said executives were â very surprised â by mr marr âs outburst , as the two men never really â trod on each other âs toes â even when they worked together
but mr marr made it clear he prefers a friendlier approach than the aggressive line of attack for which mr paxman is renowned
â i have never believed that the right approach to a political interview is to say to the interviewee , in effect , â you âre a scoundrel , you âre a liar , and i âm going to treat you like that â , â he said on friday
â the best i can do is to ask intelligent questions , keep eye contact â intelligent , sensible questions that the alert viewer would want to be asked
â and if they âre not answered , ask them again
and if they âre not answered then , just make it clear to everybody that x or y has not answered the question and move on
viewers have accused mr marr , who has hosted bbc1 's sunday - morning current affairs programme for the past decade , of being â supine â , â sycophantic â and having an â inflated sense of his own importance â â we do nât have to be this kind of really , really aggressive opposition all of the time
â mr paxman is known for doggedly pursuing a line of attack , once asking then home secretary michael howard the same question 12 times in a row
that aggression was clear last thursday when he took mr cameron and mr miliband to task , in two separate interviews
the prime minister was asked to defend soaring immigration , whether he could live on a zero - hours contract , and made to squirm over his close ties with former top gear host jeremy clarkson
mr miliband âs grilling was so severe the presenter asked him at the end : â are you ok , miliband ? are you all right ? â however , when mr paxman told the labour leader his party would never get a majority , mr miliband said the broadcaster does not get to decide who wins .
