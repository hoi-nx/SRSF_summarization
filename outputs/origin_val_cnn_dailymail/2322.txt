out - of - control : authorities are investigating a riot at a juvenile rehabilitation camp in northern nevada where two buildings were set on fire , four staff members hurt and 10 youths briefly escaped before they were recaptured over the weekend destruction : the riot at the rite of passage in rural nevada at the weekend is the fourth uprising in four months at the school for at - risk teens

one building housing the laundry and another with a maintenance shop suffered an undetermined amount of fire damage
mcneil said he 's increasingly concerned about the safety of the community and is pressing officials at the school to make changes so it does n't happen again
' i 've had public safety concerns over the years because there is no fencing to keep them on the property , ' mcneil told ap.
' they break into my citizens ' homes and steal keys and steal cars
my community is at its wit 's end right now
' ' this is rural nevada , and every home has a gun
my biggest concern is one of these kids will go into a house at 2 a.m. , and there will be a farmer or a rancher there â and we 'll have a fatal shooting
in nevada , that would be a justifiable homicide , but nobody wants to see that
' we 're all supportive of the program and want to see it succeed
but we need to find a way to do it better
