mickey mouse and donald duck are facing an uphill battle in the orlando popularity stakes this weekend
walt disney world resort is a real life magic kingdom for millions yet not even the grandest of shows or white knuckle rides will match the atmosphere in the creaking , cavernous citrus bowl on sunday afternoon
a sell - out crowd of 62,000 will make their way downtown to witness orlando city , led out by brazilian legend kaka , in their inaugural mls match against another fellow newcomer in the shape of new york city fc
david villa is expected to make his mls debut against orlando city fc on sunday for new york city brazilian star kaka will also play in the match on sunday , for the new mls franchise orlando city the match will take place at florida 's citrus bowl , which was a venue at the 1994 usa world cup it âs an opening day fixture to get the marketing men salivating
yet while the newfangled new york city franchise have literally started from scratch , this match , shown live on sky sports in the uk , marks the culmination of four years of hard work and realised dreams
heath , the former england under 21 and everton midfielder , has been in charge all of that time , thanks in no small part to a chance meeting in a newcastle - under - lyme pub with a bloke called rawlins
rawlins , a director at stoke city who founded a highly successful it sales and marketing consulting company in texas , has lived in the us for 17 years and was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes
former everton midfielder heath has guided orlando city to mls after four years of hard work heath 's appointment came after a chance meeting with rawlins ( right ) , who was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes out of work after not having a caretaker stint at coventry city turn into a permanent role , the 54 year - old had already witnessed what effect the beautiful game was having in the us during a pre-season tour which took him to the fanatical footballing hotbed of portland
initially the pair , introduced to each other by agent gary mellor , went to texas where rawlins founded the austin aztecs
at this point , leaving the usl pro , the third tier of the south american soccer scene , and joining mls was more than a pipedream
so rawlins upped sticks and relocated everyone to florida
orlando city tweeted this about how lampard wo n't be at the game and wrote : ' sorry , frank - we 're sold out ' a first championship was secured in their inaugural season and , impressively , a fan base in a state which has enjoyed its fair share of disappointments following the folding of mls side fusion in 2002 ( fusion were based in fort lauderdale , a good 200 miles away ) , the orlando natives got straight behind the lions
another regular season title and a second championship followed
that has ensured that heath has achieved a rare feat â taking a team up through the levels in a country where promotion and relegation are dirty words
unlike new york city , there is a strong feeling of continuity allied with a natural connection to the city
eight players remain the squad from their final usl pro season
new york city fc manager jason kreis will lead his team out for their first ever mls match on sunday new york city fc will begin in front of a 62,000 sell - out crowd against orlando city at citrus bowl in florida yet not everything came easily
behind the scenes , rawlins was working tirelessly
he desperately wanted to take the club on to the highest level
that , however , needs more than sweat and toil on the pitch
with top level franchise costs rocketing from $ 7.5 to $ 100 million , big bucks are needed to take a seat at the top table
they were snubbed by mls in 2012
enter brazilian millionaire flavio augusto da silva in february 2013
having made his money in setting up english language schools back home , his arrival has been key
he provides the conduit between south american and the us , a partnership which satisfies many people on myriad levels
naturally , his wealth and business expertise have ensured orlando city âs dream has become a striking reality
his links into the south american market , where so much talent bubbles under the surface , have been crucial â columbia , el salvador and brazilian are all represented in heath âs squad
honduran striker bryan rochez , 19 , is the youngest designated player in the premier league
seb hines ( top right ) has arrived on loan from middlesbrough and will play for orlando in their opening game sean st ledger , formerly of preston and leicester , is also set to make his mls bow on sunday former birmingham city midfielder lewis neal , the loan arrivals of seb hines from middlesbrough and republic of ireland international and free agent sean st ledger give their english boss a reminder of home and some experience to boot
most importantly though , orlando is the no 1 holiday destination for brazilian âs middle classes
so where better to start an anglo-american - brazilian franchise ? an impressive 20,000 were at a championship match against charlotte
mls could n't deny them again
their place as the 21st franchise was confirmed nine months after da silva 's arrival
the prospect of even more tourist dollars flowing into the city has got the club firmly on - side with the local authorities and businesses
new york city have made their mark off the pitch with stellar signings to impress their fanbase flavio augusto da silva ( left ) has been key to the progress of orlando city since his arrival in february 2013 unlike in miami when it comes to david beckham , they are right behind his plans , so much so that , after agreeing a public and private partnership plan , a brand spanking new 19,500 stadium could be ready for the start of next season
walt disney world resort are one of the founding sponsors
oh , and he is friends with kaka
when da silva came calling , the 32 year - old former world footballer of the year did nât have to think twice
the $ 7.2 million salary - making him the best paid player in the premier league - certainly helped
his fanfare arrival piqued interest like never before
kaka is the man heath is building his team and vision around
injuries over the years may have taken their toll yet he still managed 56 games last term for ac milan and sao paulo
the kind of touch and awareness which saw him join real madrid for an eye watering Â£ 57 million in 2009 will be there for all to see
da silva and rawlins â business plan has been ticking all the boxes so it will be fascinating to see how heath adapts to mls and the injection of quality he will encounter week in , week out
only two expansion teams have reached the end of season playoffs in their debut campaign , so history is not on orlando âs side
the chairman has already stated that his men have to make sure they âre the third
the pressure is on without a ball being kicked
yet with such brilliant support in the stands , the city and the boardroom , you get the feeling heath âs men are onto a winner , whatever happens
kaka - orlando city the brazilian won the ballon dâor back in 2007 , so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new mls franchise orlando city
he may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass
lampard â new york city fc one of two high - profile signings made by new york city on their introduction to the league
lampard won more than 100 caps for england and 11 major trophies with chelsea in 13 years
he is due in new york city in the summer once he has finished playing with manchester city
gerrard â galaxy the liverpool midfielder will become the second former england captain to join galaxy following the successful period of david beckham
like lampard , gerrard will not join galaxy until the summer once the premier league has finished
he will link up with former reds team - mate robbie keane
david villa - new york city fc villa became new york city âs first marquee signing when he joined after helping atletico madrid win la liga last season
he has spent time on loan at melbourne city in the australian a league and he will be expected to score the bulk of new york city âs goals in their debut season
bradley wright-phillips - red bulls overshadowed by brother shaun in england but since moving to mls he has been the star man for the red bulls
he won the golden boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games
with the departure of thierry henry and tim cahill he could struggle to score as many this term .
