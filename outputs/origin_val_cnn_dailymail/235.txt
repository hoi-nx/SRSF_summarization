just before a new $ 6million sports center bearing her name was opened last fall , beach volleyball star may-treanor said she was excited to be involved in the club and give back to her local southern california community
but six months later , the three - time olympic gold medalist 's office at the mmtsc is empty after a mysterious fallout with her longtime trainer rangel , who founded the irvine facility
now parents are threatening to stop paying their seasonal dues of $ 4,300 because their children are n't getting the benefit of may - may-treanor 's tutelage , as they feel they were promised
parents pay $ 4,300 to let their children play at the facility for a seven - month season boycotts : some parents at the facility have threatened to stop paying their dues because may - may-treanor has not been involved at the facility recently in a new report by the oc register , rangel said he and may-treanor split over the simple issue of sponsorship
rangel agreed to let asics sponsor the club , while 37 - year - old may - may-treanor remains a spokesman for competitor nike
' i can respect the fact that she does nât want to be photographed with 500 girls that are wearing asics gear , ' rangel said
however , rumors abound in the club about a deeper - seeded issue that caused may - may-treanor 's distance , and the scrubbing of all her photos from the club 's website
lambeth , a longtime youth basketball organizer who helped in the early planning stages of the mmtsc believes the break is ' because their visions were not the same '
' i do not think may-treanor was doing it for may-treanor
i think may-treanor was doing it because she wanted to give back , ' lambeth said
daily mail online reached out to may - may-treanor 's agent for comment on tuesday , but did not immediately get a reply
calls to rangel were also not returned
may - may-treanor 's apparent rift with rangel is surprising considering their previously close relationship
in her 2010 autobiography , she described her relationship with rangel as ' one of the most important partnerships ' in her volleyball career
rangel helped train may - may-treanor between 2002 and 2012 , during which she won three gold medals in the olympics for beach volleyball with partner kerri walsh jennings
the split was also swift
may - may-treanor attended coaches meetings for the new facility in august , and even gave excited interviews about the club in october
but since then it 's been radio silence
checked out : may - may-treanor has n't been seen at the mmtsc since october
the sports legend pictured on the left with a laguna hills high school senior at the facility on october 2 legend : it 's still unclear what caused the rift between may - may-treanor and her longtime trainer rangel
rangel trained may - may-treanor for 12 years , during which she won three olympic gold medals in beach volleyball with partner kerri walsh jennings
may - may-treanor pictured above compting in the 2012 london olympics erased : the club 's website now shows now sign of may-treanor 's name or image on the homepage in october , may - may-treanor told the oc register that the building of the sports center was close to her heart , since she grew up in the area and knew there were n't many places for local kids to play
' growing up as a volleyball player around here , i know how gym space had become more and more limited , ' may - may-treanor said
' this is not going to be just a volleyball place but a place for basketball and other sports , too
with the amount of sports and teams we have here , it âs important to have a facility like this
' brand minded ? rangel says the split with may - may-treanor stems from a sponsorship issue
asics is sponsoring the club , while may - may-treanor remains a spokesman for nike
may - may-treanor and jennings pictured above celebrating their gold medal win at the london games she also appeared to be interested in interacting with the youth teams that trained at the center
' i love the coaching and teaching aspect of what we âll be doing , ' may - may-treanor said
' that âs the big part for me , the sharing of information with younger players
and the beauty of this is that i do nât have to be dedicated to one team
' may - may-treanor has n't been seen at the gym since october , a month before it 's official opening and since then parents have been getting angrier and angrier walking past her perennially empty office
last month , about 60 parents with kids at the gym met in a nearby park to discuss action
and in a meeting with rangel , volleyball mom peters threatened to stop paying , saying she felt her 15 - year - old daughter was n't getting the advertised program ( parents at the facility pay $ 4,300 for a seven - month season )
' what are nât you getting ? ' rangel asked during the meeting
' well , we âre not getting may-treanor , ' peters responded
rangel says most of the malcontent parents came from a club in mission viejo and were not happy when their former club director , who moved to work at the mmtsc , resigned over clashes with him
the 155,000 - square - foot facility was pitched to may-treanor by rangel ahead of the 2012 london olympics
rangel wanted to built a state - of - the - art sports facility , while may - may-treanor wanted to coach so it made the perfect project for the pair
the finished facility has 22 volleyball courts , 21 basketball courts - all with their own electric scoreboards
the facility also includes an air - conditioned 350 - seat restaurant with 10 large hdtvs as an area to watch the games and practices .
