it all began with a joke but resulted in an incredible cash windfall for a 23 - year - old , who has used the opportunity to treat his mother who raised him single - handedly
in january sydney - based carpenter , then 22 , made global headlines with his kooky business idea to help people get revenge by shipping envelopes filled with glitter to their enemies
he was astonished when the website , shipyourenemiesglitter.com went viral , attracting so much attention that just ten days after its inception he sold the website for an incredible six - figure sum
' i was blown away by the success of the website , ' mr carpenter told daily mail australia
' i was completely unaware of how successful the idea was going to become
' i started off with no glitter & no envelopes which sort of shows you how much i did n't believe in what i thought was a stupid idea
although he joked it was the equivalent of ' $ 11 in australia ' , incredibly carpenter pocketed over $ aud 100 000 rather than indulging himself with a lavish lifestyle , the first thing mr carpenter wanted to do was take the chance to thank his mother
mr carpenter bought his mother her first ever new car for her birthday to say thank you for her sacrifices for her children
' buying a car for mum was a no brainer , ' mr carpenter told daily mail australia
' her old car was ( rubbish ) that only liked to work when it could be bothered which is basically a lazier version of me
' when you 're growing up with a single parent & see them working three or four jobs at a time just to put a roof over your head it 's extremely rewarding to give back
' the brains behind the business left his mum speechless after she was blindfolded and driven 40 minutes to the car yard for the amazing surprise
the 23 - year - old 's mum had been relying on family and friends to drive her to and from work after her car broke down three months ago and she could n't afford to get it fixed
