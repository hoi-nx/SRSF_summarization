sepp blatter celebrated his 79th birthday on tuesday as one of his rivals for the fifa presidency obtained some high - level support for his bid to be the most powerful person in world football
prince ali bin al hussein of jordan has secured statements of support from the king of bahrain and prince sufri bolkiah , a senior member of the brunei royal family
although neither of the royals will have a vote at the election on may 29 there is a history , particularly in arab countries , of the ruling family influencing football policy
fifa vice president ali bin al hussein is in the running to become the next president of fifa the prince sits alongside uefa president michel platini during a conmebol congress on march 4 that could be important to prince ali bin al hussein who has struggled to win support in his own asia ( asia ) - only one asia country , his home country jordan , nominated him to stand
it is by no means certain however that the fa will back prince ali bin al hussein despite the king of bahrain offering his support
asia president sheikh salman bin ebrahim al khalifa is also from bahrain and has already given his backing to sepp blatter
furthermore , the leading powerbroker in olympic sport sheikh ahmad from kuwait is also supporting sepp blatter
ali bin al hussein has received backing from high profile supporters , including the king of bahrain ( above ) , sheikh ahmad wields significant influence , especially in asia as head of the olympic council of asia , and is himself standing for the fifa executive committee at the end of april
prince ali bin al hussein is understood to be buoyed by the royal backing , and also to have taken heart from last week 's congress of the south american confederation conmebol , where no formal vote to back sepp blatter was taken
a report from jordan 's government new agency stated : ' his majesty king hamad bin isa al khalif of bahrain , on monday , received hrh ali bin al hussein accompanied by interior minister hussein majali , and stressed bahrain 's support to prince ali bin al hussein 's bid for fifa presidency
' sepp blatter has three challengers for the presidency : prince ali bin al hussein , dutch fa president michael van praag and former portugal international luis figo
despite being heavily criticised during his reign , sepp blatter wants the presidency for a fourth term luis figo ( left ) and michael van praag are the two remaining candidates in the presidential race last week van michael van praag said there would be a better chance of victory if there was only one candidate from europe
he also claimed luis figo 's plans for funding national associations would ' bankrupt fifa '
meanwhile , germany 's outgoing fifa member zwanziger has reiterated his belief that the 2022 world cup should be removed from qatar if the garcia report into bidding for the tournament flags up rule breaches
zwanziger told bayern 2 radio station : ' the best solution would be not to play in qatar and to rectify this wrong decision
but that can only happen if the report provides sufficient clues that the awarding broke fifa ethics rules
