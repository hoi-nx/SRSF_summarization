england 's plans for the calcutta cup showdown with scotland have been undermined by yet another midfield injury â as barritt limped out of sarries â win at wasps on sunday
in the 58th minute of the aviva premiership encounter , the 28 - year - old was contesting a high kick but landed awkwardly and his right leg bent backwards as home fly - half andy goode landed on it
he was treated on the field before being helped off
initial indications were that barritt had suffered a medial ligament strain in his knee , but that early prognosis soon changed
barritt , hopeful of an england return against scotland , limped out of sarries â win at wasps on sunday barritt 's injury after andy goode landed on his leg initially seemed to be to his knee , but was to his ankle after his side âs 26 - 17 comeback win , sarries â director of rugby , mark mccall , said : â it seems to be his ankle
the knee seems to be okay
we âre all hopeful it wo nât be too serious
' it did nât look very good and barritt has been unlucky this season
i âm sure he âll be close to selection for england next weekend , so fingers crossed it âs not as bad as it looked
â barritt was due to join up with the rest of the england squad at their surrey hq on sunday night and he will face urgent medical assessments on monday , as the coaches wait to discover if he will be available for saturday âs rbs six nations clash with the scots at twickenham
with luther burrell of northampton unable to train last week due to a calf strain , barritt was seemingly destined for a recall at inside centre , but now his hopes hang in the balance
sarries â director of rugby mark mccall is hoping barritt 's injury is n't as bad as it looked barritt ( obscured by andy goode ) was penalised for this challenge on andy goode in the air that caused the injury barritt was due for a recall to the england side as northampton 's luther burrell struggles with a calf strain the saracen was an heroic mainstay of england âs autumn victory over australia in his last test appearance , but a calf injury in that game kept him out for a month , then he damaged knee ligaments in his clubs â european champions cup tie against clermont auvergne in france
that untimely setback meant barritt was unable to retain the national no 12 shirt , as he surely would have done if he had come through that pre-championship weekend unscathed
stuart lancaster , england âs head coach , will hope that if barritt is nât cleared for a return against scotland , luther burrell does recover in time
the alternative option would be to pick billy twelvetrees at inside centre , but the gloucester captain âs form has been alarmingly inconsistent this season
if barritt is fit to play , he is set to rejoin the back line along with harlequins full - back mike brown â despite alex goode âs superb efforts at no 10 for saracens yesterday
up front , northampton lock courtney lawes is expected to come into the second row in place of george kruis
england coach stuart lancaster 's plans for saturday 's calcutta cup clash may have to be rethought barritt , here tackling wasps ' nathan hughes , will undergo urgent medical examinations on monday unlucky barritt has recently recovered from calf and knee ligament injuries before the most recent blow
