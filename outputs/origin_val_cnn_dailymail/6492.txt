the courier firm city link broke the law when it went bust over christmas day â but it can only be fined a maximum of Â£ 5,000
mps investigating the collapse say today it â is clearly in the financial interest of a company to break the law â
a report also said firms were incentivised to â ignore the statutory redundancy consultation period , if the fine for doing so is less than the cost of continuing to trade , especially since this fine will anyway be paid by the taxpayer â

the report published today by parliament âs scottish affairs and business , innovation and skills committees probed the failure of city link
some 2,586 workers lost their jobs , with many hearing about the impending collapse on christmas day
when a company intends to make more than 100 staff redundant there is a statutory period for consultation of 45 days
this did not happen in the case of city link , owned by better capital and run by private equity tycoon jon moulton
davidson mp , chairman of the joint committee , said ignoring the consultation period had a high human cost that appears not to have featured in the decision making process at city link
davidson mp ( pictured ) said ignoring the consultation period had a high human cost â employees were denied a reasonable notice period in which to seek alternative employment â , he said
â the system provides perverse incentives to withhold information or to skip proper consultation processes in contravention of the law and at a high cost to workers struggling to cope with the loss of their livelihoods
â moulton , who bought the troubled firm for Â£ 1 in 2013 , insisted he had tried to save the company but failed
city link faced fierce competition from bigger rivals dhl and fedex and the business he inherited was in a bad state
he said he personally lost Â£ 2m and his firm Â£ 20m
the committee recommended the government review the requirements for consultation on redundancies so that employees understand what they can expect and company directors have a clear understanding of their responsibility to employees
it said : â the processes for company insolvency do not offer sufficient protection to workers , suppliers and contractors and the balance should be shifted â
the politicians called for workers should be given better rights under the insolvency act 1986 regardless of whether or not they are directly employed
davidson said : â we are dismayed that , although it was clear for some time that there were serious questions over the ability of city link to continue trading after december 2014 , small businesses and self - employed drivers
. were encouraged to take on additional costs
â contractors feel they were deliberately deceived as to the true state of the business
city link and better capital are morally , if not legally , responsible for the difficulties that many of these individuals and small business now find themselves in
â the workers can take the firm to an employment tribunal which if successful can make a â protective award â of up to 90 days pay for each employee that was not consulted
when a company intends to make more than 100 staff redundant , there is a statutory period for consultation of 45 days
file photo but since the businesses is no longer trading , davidson says this either comes out of whatever funds are left , or from the taxpayer
moulton said better capital only continued to trade so that parcels could be delivered in time for christmas day and that the firm had no financial benefit from continuing to trade
â better capital does not accept that it , as a secured creditor , should have done any more than it did , â he said
â better capital could have recovered much more of its investment by precipitating an earlier insolvency , but we did not do so to allow every possible solution to be considered
