her daughter chantel has since told of how she wished her mother had never had the operation at all
' i âll never be able to forget the horror of how mum died
she thought the gastric bypass would be the start of a new life when she âd finally have the slim figure she always dreamed of , ' she said
' yet by the end she was so thin , just a living skeleton confined to a wheelchair
' she just faded away in front of my eyes
i wo nât ever get over it
' ' i speak on behalf of the whole family when i say people often mistakenly think these operations are the answer to being obese
' but the truth is we believe my mum would still be alive if she had nât had this done
' mrs angela jones , a former carer , struggled with her weight after being unable to exercise for much of her life , her daughter added

the women begged their mother not to undergo the surgery but had their fears dismissed when she believed doctors ' advice , they said mrs angela jones struggled with her weight for most of her life after being born with hip problems which made it difficult for her to exercise ' mum had always been overweight
she was born with a hip problems and developed arthritis that made exercise difficult
' despite ' adoring ' chinese takeaways the mother of two made several attempts to lose weight
' she tried every diet going but she just simply could n't maintain her weight loss and whenever she lost a stone she â d put it all back on again and more
aged 37 , her weight peaked at 26 stone
at just 4ft 9in , this gave mrs angela jones a bmi of 79 , 49 points above the official classification for someone who is obese
the 42 - year - old was in and out of hospital for three after having the operation
above , she is at a healthy weight despite complications after having treatment for a range of weight - related problems , doctors urged the woman to consider more drastic action
' the doctors were blunt
in hindsight they frightened her into wanting the surgery , ' said chantel , 19
' they said she would die without an operation
at the same time ( my sister ) melissa and i were growing up and she longed to be slim and buy normal clothes
' she was fed up of ordering outsize stuff and dreamed of accompanying us on clothes shopping trips
' chantel and her sister begged their mother to avoid the surgery but say they were dismissed because she trusted doctors advice
after dropping two stone naturally , mrs angela jones underwent the procedure in hospital in 2010
despite being unable to keep food down afterwards , doctors insisted she would recover , and sent her home
yet despite being prescribed anti nausea drugs , the sickness continued
' all her food had to be liquidised because she could n't swallow any lumps at all
it was heartbreaking to see her having to drink her meals
even then , often she still could nât keep anything down
' within three months her weight had dropped to 18 stone
' mum was delighted about the weight loss but doctors were worried she was losing too much weight too fast
' over the next six months mrs angela jones became gradually thinner , encountering a range of ailments including pancreatitis along the way
in march 2011 , a year after the operation , she was rushed to hospital weighing just four stone - an astonishing 20 stone less than the previous year
there a feeding tube was directly inserted through her side into her stomach while doctors urgently tried to reverse some of the gastric bypass to allow angela jones to eat more
' she was in hospital for two months and when she came home it was terrible as not only could she still only eat liquidised food , she had to go through the indignity of being fed via a tube into her stomach every day , ' said chantel
' being fed through her stomach took ten hours of being hooked up to a machine â it was no life at all
' the stress of her health problems put pressure on her marriage to chantel 's father , bryan , and he later left the family home
' i would sit there begging mum to eat
in desperation i âd even try spoon - feeding her like a baby
' but by now because every time she ate , she âd be sick , she âd developed a fear of food
she âd cry and in tears say she just could nât manage it
the 42 - year - old became too frail to eat her own food and eventually contracted pneumonia
she is pictured at her daughter 's wedding ( top left ) and in her home ( right ) in some of the last photographs taken of her ' it broke our hearts
' in november that year , after being rushed to hospital having collapsed , mrs angela jones was told her organs were shutting down
she returned home two weeks later but was in and out of hospital over the next two years
in march 2014 chantel woke up to find her mother had passed out on the sofa
she was rushed to hospital where doctors managed to revive her
over 6,500 weight loss procedures are currently performed in the uk every year with gastric bypass one of the most common operations
this number is set to increase with the national institute for health and care excellent ( nice ) recommending the nhs should offer even more weight loss surgery to thousands more people to tackle the growing obesity epidemic
it works by inserting a small pouch at the top of the stomach
this is then connected to a section of the small intestine , bypassing the rest of the stomach and bowel
this means that it will take less food to make you feel full
gastric bypass surgery is often favoured over gastric band surgery by doctors
this is because unlike a band â which temporarily makes the stomach smaller and can be removed - it is permanent
the patient and gives better weight loss results for the very obese
but devastatingly , three days later she died
a post mortem found angela jones âs problems began when she had the bypass
' a lack of food led to her losing too much weight and her body not being fed vital nutrients , ' said chantel
' she was so frail she could n't fight off any infection and finally died from pneumonia she 'd picked up during a hospital stay
' the gastric bypass starved her to death
she was skin and bone when she went
' the young mother , who welcomed baby ruby-mae seven months ago , said doctors did not properly warn her mother of the risks involved
' doctors presented this operation to mum as the answer to all her problems
if mum had been told all of the risks she never would have agreed to go ahead
' we do nât feel the risk of severe side effects , which can be fatal , were ever properly explained to mum
' we bitterly regret my mum ever allowed doctors to persuade her having weight loss surgery was the answer to her obesity problem
' ' i only hope telling mum âs tragic story makes anyone else think twice before having gastric surgery
' if it stops just one person going through the same nightmare , it will be worth it
