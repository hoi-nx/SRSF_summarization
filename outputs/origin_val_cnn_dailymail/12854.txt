airstrikes started wednesday in tikrit , where iraqi and coalition forces are battling to wrest control from isil
" these strikes are intended to destroy isil strongholds with precision , thereby saving innocent iraqi lives while minimizing collateral damage to infrastructure , " said lt. gen. james l. terry , commanding general of the international coalition , led by the u.s.
" this will further enable iraqi forces under iraqi command to maneuver and defeat isil in the vicinity of tikrit , " he said , using an alternative acronym for isil
at the request of prime minister al-abadi , the coalition is providing " airstrikes , airborne intelligence capabilities , and advise and assist support to iraqi security force headquarters elements , " it said
according to a u.s. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity , the first wave of airstrikes was intended to hit about a dozen preplanned targets
tikrit , best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , fell in june to isil , which has captured large areas of iraqi and syria for what it says is its islamic caliphate
on march 1 , al-abadi ordered iraqi forces to retake tikrit and salaheddin province
there have been several failed attempts to recapture tikrit since the second half of 2014
if iraqi regains control of the city , it could mean that retaking mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible
