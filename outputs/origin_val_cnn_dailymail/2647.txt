and each , like the others who have been or soon will be coming , are taking great pains to avoid stating the obvious and triggering the headaches that come with being a full - blown candidate
but there are plenty of slips along the way , such as when walker disclosed saturday that his 19 - and 20 - year - old sons plan to ditch college this fall
' they twisted our arms to figure out a way to maybe take part of a semester off next year , next fall , to come to new hampshire , to come around the country and talk to young people like themselves , ' walker said

' the gop governor also reportedly said at the event that he was wearing a $ 1 kohl 's sweater and also described a teenage job at mcdonald 's
walker , the journal sentinel reported , ' earned an enthusiastic response from the crowd in concord
