under - fire bbc chief fairhead personally blocked the release of redacted information about a long - delayed investigation into savile , prompting fresh cover - up accusations
the controversial bbc trust chairman approved a decision to keep secret details from a cache of potentially damaging letters between leading figures at the corporation and the team carrying out a review of savile âs activities
her decision last night deepened concerns about the savile review being carried out by judge dame janet smith , which has cost at least Â£ 5 million and taken more than two years so far
bbc trust chairman , fairhead , pictured , personally approved a decision to keep savile letters secret , preventing their release to a team conducting a review into the prolific paedophile 's activities the elements of correspondence mrs fairhead has kept hidden were thought to shed light on whether corporation executives were trying to delay publication of the savile report for fear that it would further damage the bbc âs reputation
the bbc insists no such pressure was applied to delay the report
last night critics said the censorship row showed mrs fairhead was not properly representing the licence fee - payer , as her Â£ 110,000 part - time role as chairman of the bbc trust requires
the businesswoman , 53 , has already come under fire from mps over her Â£ 10,000 - a - day second job at hsbc
allegations of her possible role in covering up evidence involving savile â the biggest scandal in bbc history â will put further pressure on her to quit
tory mp andrew bridgen , who has written to the bbc about the sexual abuse review , said : â the delay and the non-publication of the correspondence is not good for the licence fee - payer but it is probably good for the bbc in the run - up to its charter review
it âs all very convenient
â i think that fairhead is compromised
as far as protecting licence fee - payers , she has gone native
she ca nât hold the bbc to account and what she said about the review only confirms my suspicion
â mrs fairhead âs decision came at the end of a five - month battle by a transparency campaigner who used freedom of information act requests to try to find out if bbc bosses had put pressure on dame janet to delay her report
tory mp andrew bridgen , left , said ms fairhead , right , is ' compromised ' and has ' gone native ' as chairman of the bbc governing body , mrs fairhead acts as the â qualified person â to decide whether or not foi requests should be refused on public interest grounds
in a three - page letter dated last december , she ruled that sensitive messages over delays to the savile review should not be released
it is the only time so far she has acted in this capacity
she wrote : â in my view , the public interest in demonstrating that the review is acting independently of the bbc and that the bbc is not putting unwarranted pressure on the review to delay delivery of the report has largely been served by the information already made available to the requestor
â the bbc has refused to answer questions about the review âs ongoing costs
the most recent statement on the review website states it is â not expected to be finalised until early 2015 â
a bbc spokesman said : â we can confirm the correspondence shows no bbc member of staff has exerted any pressure on members of the review team to delay publication of the report
