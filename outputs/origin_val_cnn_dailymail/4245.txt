what more does wayne have to do when louis van gaal said he needed a 20 - goal - a - season striker , i almost laughed
manchester united have spent huge money and now he is saying wayne rooney , robin van persie or radamel falcao ca nât score 20 goals ? do me a favour
wayne rooney issued the perfect response on saturday
i still do nât know why van gaal insists on playing him in midfield
in his career wayne rooney averages 18.8 goals a season
at manchester united that figure is 20.6 goals
still not good enough , louis ? even if he only meant league goals , wayne rooney still ranks highly
thierry henry , one of the deadliest strikers in premier league history and my sky colleague at wembley on sunday , only scored 20 league goals in a season five times
wayne rooney has done it twice
his premier league average is 14.1 a season but alan shearer , the league âs leading goalscorer , averaged 18.6
using van gaal âs maths , even alan shearer could nât get into this manchester united team â¦ louis van gaal 's suggestion that he needs a 20 - goal - a - season striker is laughable - he has wayne rooney wayne rooney scores for manchester united against sunderland in their 2 - 0 win at old trafford on saturday the back four love to score it was not a vintage final , but chelsea âs back four held the key to victory at wembley
last time they played tottenham they conceded five
on sunday they did nât give them a sniff
not only that but they were a threat at every set piece â spurs looked fragile whenever john terry and co. went up
the chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and typify jose mourinho âs style : win at all costs
the chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and were excellent at wembley hammers must avoid flat finish it was a surprise to see a sam allardyce team concede three set - piece goals
they are normally well organised , but i wonder if sam allardyce âs contract situation is affecting the players
it âs the chairmen âs prerogative not to talk deals until the summer , but if the players are nât sure the manager will be there , they might wonder why they should keep playing for him
alex song in particular was poor on saturday and after a fine season for the club , it would be a pity if it tailed off
sam allardyce needs to turn west ham 's form around to avoid a depressing end to the season peter crouch has now scored 46 premier league headers , equalling alan shearer âs record in the competition
peter perfect when i played alongside peter crouch at southampton , i was laughed at for saying he was good enough for england
peter crouch has spent his career fighting people âs perceptions , but there is no doubt he has made the absolute most of his abilities
he scored a fantastic header against hull city but , even at 6ft 7in , heading may not even be the best part of his game
he âs got a great touch , scored some fantastic goals â scissor kicks against galatasaray , hat - tricks against arsenal , volleys against manchester city â and has enjoyed some memorable moments
peter crouch celebrates after scoring against hull city during their premier league clash brendan 's new year 's resolution after that brilliant win over manchester city , liverpool are bang in the race for the top four
and here is a stat to prove it
in his three years in charge , brendan rodgers has lost just four league games after january 1
liverpool obviously tailor their training to perfection in the new year and make sure they are in form at just the right time
it helped their title challenge last season and it could be key to champions league qualification this time round
they were excellent against manchester city , with two world class goals , and they proved there is life after steven gerrard
with no europa league football to distract them now , there âs no doubt liverpool have what it takes to hunt down and catch manchester united and arsenal
liverpool 's players celebrate during their 2 - 1 win against manchester city at anfield on sunday murray 's moment glenn murray was key in crystal palace âs promotion to the premier league but will have been gutted to miss most of 2013 - 14 with injury
he spent the first half of this season on loan but at upton park he looked every inch a top - flight striker
his movement was good , he held the ball up well and though he was lucky with his first goal , his second was top class
yes , he tainted his day with a silly red card , but he looked like he was loving every minute
glenn murray rises above the west ham defence to score during crystal palace 's win at upton park swans flying under monk when swansea city sold wilfried bony i feared for them , but garry monk âs team have continued as if nothing has happened
their win at burnley was scrappy but it was another three points and the club is in its best ever position after 27 games
brendan rodgers and michael laudrup might be more â glamorous â names but , as our table shows , garry monk is outperforming both
i like the way his team plays , i admire his honesty and if swansea city keep it up , he will be more than justified in asking for extra investment in the summer
swansea city manager garry monk has coped exceptionally well with the departure of wilfried bony villa are in desperate need of some victories in the last 10 seasons , the average number of points needed to stay up has been 36
this season it could be even lower
either way , aston villa face an uphill struggle
sherwood âs side are 14 points shy of that average with 11 games left
they âll need at least three or four wins but when they have won just five all season , and with away games at manchester united , tottenham , manchester city and southampton to come , that âs easier said than done
i think they will survive but sherwood has to make the numbers add up
p.s. it was great to see jonas gutierrez back at newcastle after his battles with testicular cancer and he got a fantastic reception
it âs exactly what he deserved
jonas gutierrez was back on the bench for newcastle after recovering from testicular cancer
