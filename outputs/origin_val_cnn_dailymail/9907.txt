captain eoin morgan insisted that he would leave the world cup with ' no regrets ' despite england 's failure to qualify out of their group
england won just two of their six games at the tournament and only avoided their worst - ever world cup with a rain - affected nine - wicket success over afghanistan in sydney on friday
' there are no regrets , ' eoin morgan said
eoin morgan speaks to the press following england 's victory against afghanistan in sydney on friday ' absolutely not
we 've given it everything and certainly i have
' ecb managing director paul downton has already confirmed a ' major review ' will be launched into the failings at the tournament
that had led to speculation some senior players could have played their last one - day international , but eoin morgan does not think there should be a clear - out as preparations begin for the 2019 world cup , which will be held in england
' no absolutely not , ' he added
' we have n't got guys coming towards the end of their careers
i do n't see a reason to
' i think we have the right calibre of squad , guys on the outside need to be banging down the door
' it 's an easy thing to sit here while we are not doing well and say somebody outside the squad is better

i still believe we had the right group of players here
' coach peter moores ' position has come under increasing scrutiny after england were blown away by the bigger nations before their tournament was ended by ninth - ranked bangladesh in adelaide on monday
their only successes came against associate nations scotland and afghanistan , with the latter playing at their first - ever world cup
eoin morgan nonetheless wants to remain as captain , although admitted that decision is now out of his hands with the ecb to rake over the performances
' i think there is going to be a review over the next couple of weeks , ' he said
' i ca n't determine whether i 'll still be captain
the hunger is still there to do it
' i 've learned a lot throughout this tournament particularly when things have n't gone so well
you learn a lot about yourself and about the team
ian bell acknowledges the crowd after reaching his half - century in england 's final world cup match ' things like that moving forward are crucial
' england will fly home next week where the recriminations have already begun and eoin morgan feels any finger pointing should be directed at the players rather than the coach
' i certainly think it 's not fair ( to blame peter moores ) , ' he said
' all the responsibility should fall on the players
it 's our responsibility to perform , particularly when we 've performed so badly
' if there were little things where we could n't get over the line and games where we competed and little parts of our game were n't right you could look elsewhere
' it 's important that we realise where the responsibility lies
' australia and new zealand most significantly exposed the gulf in class between them and england 's squad , which contained nine world cup debutants , and eoin morgan conceded his team 's inability to fight back in adversity was an area of concern
captain eoin morgan speaks to sky sports after england sealed a comfortable win at the scg ' when we 've performed well we 've done reasonably well and when we 've been poor we 've been really poor , ' he said
' when you have a bad day you have to find some way of scrapping or fighting in order to stay in the game but when we 've had bad games we 've been out of the game
' to build on that we need to get our basics right - things like building an innings , creating partnerships and building pressure with the ball
' when we 've been poor we have n't done both of those things
' while england 's players might be bracing themselves for their reception back home , afghanistan coach moles expects his team to receive a ' warm welcome ' to their war - torn country
eoin morgan ( second left ) walks off the field with ian bell ( third left ) as rain delays play on friday a maiden world cup win over scotland stood out as an obvious highlight and they almost pulled of a shock against sri lanka
they were just 22 minutes away from sharing the points with england at the scg , after play resumed following a long rain break just in time to allow the reply to a duckworth-lewis revised target of 101 in 25 overs
ian bell 's half - century ensured the chase was reeled in without too much alarm , but afghanistan will head home to their cricket - loving fans knowing they came close to finishing the tournament level on points with england
' i 'm sure that they 'll be received with huge warmth , ' moles , a former warwickshire opener , said
england coach peter moores is pictured walking off the field after friday 's match in sydney ' we all saw the celebrations that happened all around afghanistan with the win against scotland
but i think the captain would be the first to admit , as well , we 'd liked to have done a little bit better with some of the other games , but that 's something we 'll work on
' one thing i can say is that the afghanistan players are a very proud bunch of young men that want to do well , not for themselves but for the unification and the message it sends around the world from afghanistan
' so i know , i 'm sure that when they do get home in two , three days ' time that they will be warmly received , and i 'm sure they 'll enjoy it
