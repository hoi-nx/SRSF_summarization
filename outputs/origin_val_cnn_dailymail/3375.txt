airport parking in the uk is officially the most expensive in the world
five of the airports servicing london - london city , gatwick , heathrow , luton and stansted - and also edinburgh and manchester airports feature in the top ten most expensive airports for parking across the globe , with london city topping the leaderboard at Â£ 315 per week
in many cases that may be more than the total price of the holiday booked
london city 's proximity in the heart of london means the site urges travellers to use public transport if possible - it 's worth considering when parking can be as much as Â£ 315 per week how the airports around the world ranked where it came to car parking even when booked in advance , a week 's parking at london city is twice the price of new york 's jfk - and nearly three times the cost of parking at tokyo international airport , research by justpark.com has discovered
parking rip - offs are not only suffered by holidaymakers leaving their cars at the airport while travelling abroad
those collecting friends and family from airports are also charged extortionate amounts for short - term parking , paying Â£ 15 for 1 - 2 hours at london city and Â£ 12 at heathrow
following london city int he rankings is heathrow , where it costs an average of Â£ 167 a week to park
the uk dominance is broken as sydney enters in third spot - parking there for seven days costs around Â£ 138
parking at heathrow was found to be the second most expensive in the world at Â£ 167 per week anthony eskinazi , founder of justpark , said : ' we 've long known that airport parking is overpriced across the country , but all the same these new revelations are remarkable
' finding that seven of the world 's ten most expensive airports are here in the uk shows the extent of the problem we are facing

he added : ' when people are paying more for their airport parking than their flights , something needs to change
we want to redress this balance and make airport parking more affordable
' the high cost of airport parking in the uk has led holiday - makers to seek alternative , more affordable options
over 600,000 drivers use the app and website justpark to find and book parking spaces on local residential driveways , rather than paying airport prices
more than 200 heathrow homeowners are renting out their driveways for as little as Â£ 21.50 per week through justpark , giving holidaymakers an 85 per cent saving on official airport parking and putting money back into local people 's pockets
a spokesperson for london city ( london city ) told mailonline travel : ' london city is unique in its close proximity to central london and limited space for parking
' we encourage passengers to travel via public transport , using the airport 's own dlr station , and 70 per cent do so
' for those who do choose to drive , we offer free drop - off and parking savings of up to 40 per cent by booking online in advance
' a spokesperson for london city has urged passengers to use public transport to the site and sean hagger , commercial director at holiday extras , told mailonline travel how it is important for holidaymakers to book their car parking as early as possible
' the figures given are rather misleading , he said
here are car parking facilities available outside of the airport , that may be more attractive in price ... heathrow : https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/heathrow/heathrow-airport / london city : https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/london/london-city-airport / gatwick : https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/redhill/gatwick-airport / stansted : https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/stansted/stansted-airport / ' if you turn up on the day to park your car for a week or two at an airport designed for business travellers , as london city is , then you will be charged for the privilege
' the reality is that very few holiday travellers do this ; i 'm pleased to say that brits tend to have more foresight
' it pays to book ahead â even just a couple of days
looking on our website i can see that booking a week 's meet & greet parking at london city , starting this sunday , would cost Â£ 105 per week
' likewise , parking at heathrow for a week from march 6 at terminal 2 's official long - stay car park would cost Â£ 75.80
this price drops as low as Â£ 52.95 if you use other long - term parking options
' if you 're just a tiny bit organised , you can save hundreds of pounds
