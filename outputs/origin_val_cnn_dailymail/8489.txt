manage your time tom exton says : ' strike the balance between achieving your goals and living a healthy balanced life
preparation james says : ' plan your week in advance , that 's both your diet and training
with the correct preparation it really does n't need to be intrusive or laborious
be realistic tom exton says : ' be realistic from the outset
set goals which are achievable and not idealistic
this will keep motivation high and reduce the risk of becoming despondent and losing interest
track your progress james says : ' try to use photos , and do n't get caught up on scale weight
the scales do n't tell the full picture and in many cases lead to undue criticism , you will be amazed when you look back through your photo log
