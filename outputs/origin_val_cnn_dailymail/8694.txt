only time will tell whether the operation will be successful
' today is anni 's birthday and that fills the minds and hearts of all the family
' mr hindocha 's wife nilam , 64 , who is in remission from stomach cancer , was with him in sweden at the time of the accident and had gone shopping when he was hurt
the horrific accident comes after a harrowing court case attended by mr hindocha in which details of his daughter 's murder were recounted in detail
anni was killed on november 13 2010 while riding in a cab with her new husband , shrien , 35 , through the impoverished township of gugulethu , cape town
the cab was hijacked by two gunmen who threw shrien out before driving away
the vehicle was discovered the next day with anni 's body in the back seat
she had been shot in the neck
shortly afterwards taxi driver zola tongo , 35 , was arrested
he confessed to his part in the death , naming xolile mngeni and mziwamadoda qwabe as the men who carried out the fatal attack
mr hindocha ( centre ) told family members he saw his severed limb one storey above him after falling
surgeons reattached the limb , but it will be 18 months before they know whether he will get movement back the tragedy came after mr hindocha saw shrien , the husband of his murdered daughter anni , acquitted of ordering her killing ( pictured , shrien and anni together before they wed ) however , he also said shrien had ordered him to carry out a hit on his new bride , claiming he wanted out of the marriage
after years of delays and legal wrangling during which shrien claimed to be suffering from depression , he was finally extradited to south africa to stand trial last year
during the short case , the judge heard that shrien had been bisexual and had visited gay porn websites and chat rooms exploring his homosexual fantasies
the trial also heard testimony from several key witnesses , though one of the men serving time in jail for killing anni , xolile mngeni , died of a brain tumour before he could give evidence
eventually the judge threw the case out , telling prosecutors their argument was riddled with contradictions
anni 's family said they had been failed by the justice system and condemned the acquittal
