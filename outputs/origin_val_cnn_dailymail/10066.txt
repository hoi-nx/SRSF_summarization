people have posted on twitter , could i go to coventry and do it ? ' ' people have asked to contribute to the sandwiches but i 've got enough money to do this
i want to see them go out themselves and do it
' the do - gooder , who is single and originally from water orton , warwickshire , added : ' i 've had to the classic thing of buying a sandwich usually from tesco in normal clothes and then go up an alley and change into my spider-man outfit
when i go home , i have to look in the mirror and say " i 'm not spider-man "

he said : ' i noticed we would get a lot of people coming up after we had run out of food
' i thought why do n't we go out a lot later at night because people are still out and asking for spare change - they obviously do n't have anywhere to go
' ' at the start of 2014 , i used to see people who had almost passed out from the cold and people walking straight past them
