this is the picture that nearly cost a teenager his life when he plunged 2,500ft down a mountain after stepping back to fit a bit more scenery in his shot
jack fox , 14 , from southport , fell on the last run of the last day of a school skiing trip in the alps during half - term
he suffered ice burns to his arms but miraculously survived the ordeal relatively unhurt
the costly picture : jack fox took this snap the moment before he fell on the last day of a school skiing trip in the alps jack fox 's injuries : despite bouncing off rocks and ice during the fall he only needed treatment for ice burns on his arms after his jacket was pushed up to his elbows during the plunge jack fox 's iphone , containing the last picture he took , also survived the fall
he said : ' the battery goes quite quickly now , but there is not a crack on it
after i had stopped falling i just saw it there and tried to turn it on but it would n't
then , when i got to the hospital and it had dried out , it turned on
' amanda , 41 , said jack fox was disappointed the phone still worked
jack fox had hoped the accident would land him a phone upgrade but his old mobile survived she said : ' jack fox has been after an iphone 6 for ages and when it would n't turn on , he thought he was going to get a new one
but we are glad it came on because that was when he first spoke to me
' my husband had been told that he had been airlifted off , but we did n't know about any injuries
his phone coming back on was like it was meant to be
' jack fox said : ' i was facing forwards taking pictures of the scenery , and i was about to put my phone away when i started to slip and lose my footing
i was shouting for help as i was falling â but then i could n't because i had snow in my mouth
' most of jack fox 's horrified friends feared the worst as he tumbled down the mountain
amanda added : ' jack fox said when he got to the bottom of the mountain he knew he had n't broken anything as everything moved
' at the top of the mountain , jack fox said a lot of people had taken their helmets off to take photos
his mum amanda said : ' luckily he had n't , because his helmet was all smashed
kids think helmets are not cool but jack fox has now realised that they are
' ' it was cracked and bits had fallen off it , ' said jack fox , ' as i was going down i was trying to stop myself by digging my boots in , but it flipped me over and hit my head â it was a scary experience and was the first time i 've ever thought i was going to die
' he added : ' you do need a helmet
it has saved my life

he said : ' as i fell , my jacket pushed up to my elbows and i got to one point when i started to slow down and i moved over on to one arm because the other one was hurting
that is when the left arm went bad
' amanda said jack fox 's left arm was ' quite a mess '
she added : ' he is lucky to be here
it could have been a totally different story
' he is here and can tell the tale , which is the important thing
' jack fox feared the snap had cost him his life and said for the first time ever he thought he was going to die during the experience
