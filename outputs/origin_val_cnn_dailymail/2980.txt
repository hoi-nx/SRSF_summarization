michael scudamore has also revealed a shot at the celebration chase at sandown on april 25 is one of the options for grand annual chase winner next sensation
monbeg dude , the gelding part owned by former england rugby union captain mike tindall and fellow international james simpson-daniel , was a never - dangerous 14th in the ultima business solutions handicap chase under paul carberry
trainer michael scudamore has given monbeg dude the green light to race at the grand national michael scudamore has run a series of tests on the 10 - year - old , who was seventh in last year âs grand national
with the results coming up negative , michael scudamore believes the most likely reason for monbeg dude âs below par effort was his resentment of a tongue tie being fitted for the first time
the trainer said : â we were disappointed with his cheltenham festival run but he has come back fine
there is no reason not to run at aintree and the tongue tie will be left off
â we think maybe he did not enjoy running in it even though he has plenty of experience of it being fitted at home
â tom scudamore celebrates winning the a.p. mccoy grand annual handicap chase with new sensation michael scudamore is not thinking of aintree for next sensation and the gelding has options at both ayr and punchestown festival but the trainer is tempted by the celebration chase
michael scudamore added : â we are looking at ayr and punchestown festival , although my only worry about ireland , given he is a nervy character , is the travelling
the celebration chase is in the back of my mind
they are talking of taking ( 2014 winner ) sire de grugy there but there are usually only five or six runners
