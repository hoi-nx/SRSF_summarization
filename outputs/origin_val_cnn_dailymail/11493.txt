antarctica 's icy edge is disappearing in warming ocean waters , with the last decade seeing the rate of ice loss increase dramatically
this is according to a new study that has combined 18 - years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites
the researchers claim that some ice shelves in antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years
circles represent percentage of thickness lost ( red ) or gained ( blue ) in 18 years
the central circle shows the area not surveyed by the satellites satellite data from 1994 to 2012 clearly shows the accelerating decline which could hasten the rise in global sea levels , scientists say
the findings , published today in the journal science , come amid concern among many scientists about the effects of global climate change on earth 's vast , remote polar regions
during the study period 's first half , to about 2003 , the overall volume decline around antarctica was small , with antarctica losses almost balanced out by gains in east antarctica
after that , western losses accelerated and gains in the east ended
' there has been more and more ice being lost from antarctica 's floating ice shelves , ' said glaciologist fricker of the scripps at the university of california , san diego
ice is added to the ice shelf by glaciers flowing off the continent and by snowfall
ice is lost when icebergs break off the ice front , and by melting in some regions as warm water flows into the ocean cavity under the ice shelf
under some ice shelves , cold and fresh meltwater rises to a point where it refreezes onto the ice shelf the crosson ice shelf in the amundsen and the venable ice shelf in the bellingshausen , both in antarctica , each shrank about 18 percent during the study period
climate change could make the food we eat taste worse , according to recent research
a major report on the impact of global warming on food has predicted that the quality of many meats and vegetables is due to decline at temperatures increase
the researchers predict that as heatwaves become more common , meat like chicken and beef will become stringier and tougher
carrots are likely to lose their flavour and develop a less pleasant texture
beetroots and onions will become smaller while milk will contain less protein needed to make cheese
a separate study by marine biologists has also shown that shellfish will take on a sour flavour as our oceans acidify
they warn that as the planet 's oceans grow more acidic , due to rising carbon dioxide levels , many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising
shrimp raised in water with a lower ph were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting , while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest
' if the loss rates that we observed during the past two decades are sustained , some ice shelves in the amundsen and bellingshausen seas could disappear within this century , ' added scripps geophysics doctoral candidate fernando paolo
the melting of these ice shelves does not directly affect sea levels because they are already floating
' this is just like your glass of gin and tonic
when the ice cubes melt , the level of liquid in the glass does not rise , ' fernando paolo said
but the floating ice shelves provide a restraining force for land - based ice , and their reduction would increase the flow of the ice from the land into the ocean , which would increase sea levels
' while it is fair to say that we 're seeing the ice shelves responding to climate change , we do n't believe there is enough evidence to directly relate recent ice shelf losses specifically to changes in global temperature , ' fricker said
oceanographer and co-author padman of earth & space research in corvallis , oregon said for a few west antarctic ice shelves , ice loss can be related fairly directly to warming air temperatures
much of the increased melting elsewhere is probably due to more warm water getting under the ice shelves because of increasing winds near antarctica , padman added
fricker said future studies will concentrate on the causes behind changes in ice shelf volume , including the effects of the atmosphere and ocean
' we 're looking into connections between el niã±o events in the tropical pacific and changes in the west antarctic ice sheet , ' said scripps graduate student fernando paolo
' it 's very far apart but we know that these teleconnections exist
that may ultimately allow us to improve our models for predicting future ice loss
