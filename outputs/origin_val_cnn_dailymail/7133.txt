a real estate investment trust that 's considering getting out of the snow business could end up making the largest single ski resort transaction in the sport 's history
cnl lifestyle properties owns more than a dozen ski resorts from maine to california that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars
if cnl lifestyle properties sells all of its 16 properties to one buyer , industry officials say it would be the biggest real estate transaction in the history of skiing
reits bring in revenue through rent paid by ski resort operators like michigan - based boyne resorts , which holds long - term leases for sunday river , sugarloaf and loon mountain
a boyne official said skiers need n't worry about the potential sale of their beloved ski mountains
steve kircher , president of eastern operations for boyne , said : ' for the skier , it 's a nonevent
' cnl lifestyle properties managing director rice said the trust will make decisions ' in the near future ' boyne will remain the lease holder , regardless of ski resort ownership , for several more decades
bob rogowsky , who skies 70 to 80 days a year at sunday rive and recently bought a retirement home in the area , said most skiers are pleased with the investments that have been made since cnl lifestyle properties bought the resort and boyne began running it in 2007
he said : ' i would n't have made that kind of financial commitment and lifetime commitment if i did n't believe there was stability and a good future
' ski resorts , which are at the mercy of weather and the economy , can be good investments as long the owners have a long investment horizon , said michael krongel from mirus resort capital
the trust will evaluate options for its remaining properties ' in the near future ' , according to cnl lifestyle properties senior managing director rice
besides selling its ski resorts , theme parks and marinas , alternatives include a private buyout or listing on a publicly traded exchange
ideally , the remaining properties would be sold and cnl lifestyle properties enlisted investment bank jefferies llc to help evaluate options
rice said : ' we 're taking a studied and careful approach
' if the resorts do sell , skiers might not even notice because the operators ' long - term leases will remain in place reits are an investment vehicle for a variety of properties including hotels , office buildings and malls , but they are new to the ski industry in the last 15 or so years
there 's only one other reit that 's a big player in the ski industry besides cnl lifestyle properties
cnl lifestyle properties was valued at as much as $ 3billion in 2012 with ownership of more than 100 water parks , ski resorts , marinas and senior housing developments
the trust 's value dropped in the aftermath of a real estate downturn
the reit is nearing the end of its projected lifespan and anticipates having an ' exit strategy ' in place by dec. 31
in june , cnl lifestyle properties agreed to sell 48 golf properties for $ 320million
then it announced an agreement to sell its senior housing for $ 790million in december
besides selling the resorts , alternatives include a private buyout or listing on a publicly traded exchange
