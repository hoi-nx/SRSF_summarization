some apps for android smartphones are tracking people 's movements every three minutes
this is according to a us study that found apps can collect a device 's gps coordinates on average of 6,200 times over two weeks
the study also revealed that most smartphone users have no idea how closely they are being tracked , and many were surprised by the results
scientists asked 23 users of android 's version 4.3 to install software that logged app requests
they found that even when an app provided a location based service , some attempted to collect more data than was needed
groupon , for instance , requested one participant 's coordinates 1,062 times in two weeks scientists at carnegie mellon university asked 23 users of android 's version 4.3 to install software that logged app requests , according to a report by elizabeth dwoskin in the wall street journal
they found that even when an app provided a location based service , some attempted to collect more data than was needed
groupon , for instance , requested one participant 's coordinates 1,062 times in two weeks
meanwhile , the weather channel 's app requested device location an average 2,000 times , or every 10 minutes
the main focus of the study , however , was on how users reacted to how often their data was being shared
they received a daily message , or ' privacy nudge , ' telling them how many times information such as location , contact lists or phone call logs had been shared
one notable example : ' your location has been shared 5,398 times with facebook , groupon , go launcher ex and seven other apps in the last 14 days
' when the participants were given access to appops , they collectively reviewed their app permissions 51 times and restricted 272 permissions on 76 distinct apps ' 4,182 ( times ) â are you kidding me ? ' one participant asked
' it felt like i 'm being followed by my own phone
that number is too high
' another participant said : ' the number ( 356 times ) was huge , unexpected
' ' the vast majority of people have no clue about what 's going on , ' said sadeh , a professor in the school of computer science 's institute for software research
' most smartphone users , in fact , have no way of obtaining this data about app behaviour
but the study shows that when they do , they tend to act rapidly to change their privacy settings
' millions of people are being spied on by free apps they have installed on their mobile phones , security experts have warned
many flashlight apps which allow a device to be used as a torch also secretly record the most sensitive personal information
this may include the location of the phone , details of its owner and their contacts , and even the content of text messages
the data is then transmitted to market research companies and advertising agencies to track user âs shopping habits , experts claim
but it is also suspected that criminal gangs , hackers and identity thieves have developed torch apps of their own to obtain personal data about consumers which could give them access to their bank accounts
the most popular flashlight apps for android smartphones have been downloaded tens of millions of times
they include the super-bright led flashlight , the brightest flashlight free and the tiny flashlight + led
but few customers realise that many programs have capabilities far beyond switching on the phone âs light , according to us cyber-security firm snoopwall , whose founder gary miliefsky has advised the us government
the study used a permission manager for android 4.3 called appops
during the first week of the study , app behaviour data was collected for 23 people as they used their own android mobile devices
in the second week , they were given access to appops , and in the third and final phase they received the daily privacy nudges detailing the frequency at which their sensitive information was accessed by their apps
the researchers found that app permission managers were helpful
when the participants were given access to appops , they collectively reviewed their app permissions 51 times and restricted 272 permissions on 76 distinct apps
only one participant failed to review permissions
but once the participants had set their preferences over the first few days , they stopped making changes
when they began getting the privacy nudges , however , they went back to their privacy settings and further restricted many of them
during this phase , which spanned eight days , users collectively reviewed permissions 69 times , blocking 122 additional permissions on 47 apps
' app permission managers are better than nothing , but by themselves they are n't sufficient , ' sadeh said
' the fact that users respond to privacy nudges indicate that they really care about privacy , but were just unaware of how much information was being collected about them
' the appops software was discontinued on later versions of android
while iphones do have a privacy manager , it does not tell users how often their information is used or for what purpose .
