after barca beat real madrid 2 - 1 in an entertaining el clasico on sunday night , rik sharma reveals five things he learned from the nou camp
and it 's not pretty reading for one gareth bale ... luis suarez has settled perfectly at barca this was the evening that luis suarez forged his own place in the hearts of barca supporters
he 'd been chipping away at it before , with that fantastic scissors kick goal against levante , with his slew of assists for lionel messi and neymar
but to score the winner in a el clasico and with as much class as he did here , has written him into the history books
having made his barca debut in a disappointing defeat by real madrid , sinking his teeth into real madrid here was the perfect revenge for the uruguayan
barca 's attack , with lionel messi and luis suarez in their prime and neymar growing into his , will be the one to beat for the years to come , unless real madrid shuffle theirs again in the summer
luis suarez will have forged a place in the hearts of barca supporters after his winner in el clasico gareth bale continues to regress at real madrid it would be unfair to suggest that gareth bale disappears in the big games
after all , he scored a brilliant copa del rey final winner against barca last season , and capped it with the goal which won real madrid the champions league against rivals atletico madrid
and it was hard not to feel sorry for him at nou camp , when his first - half strike was ruled out thanks to cristiano ronaldo being offside in the build up
however , the welshman does n't fit the profile of real madrid , when it comes to football
he is a great player , but one whose pace and power outstrips his technique and tactical acumen
jordi alba got the better of him and pressure continues to build on the welshman
he was on the fringes of this clash and the thunderous challenge by gerard pique to end a gareth bale breakaway was his game in a microcosm
gareth bale does n't fir the profile of real madrid - his pace and power outstrips his technique gareth bale looks dejected as the barca players celebrate following their 2 - 1 victory on sunday night gerard pique has turned things around spectacularly the lowest point of gerard pique 's season was probably when he was in hot water with barca 's police force and argued with them outside a casino in the early hours of the morning
maybe it was at the santiago bernabeu , in the first el clasico , which barca lost , when he was run ragged
there were other low moments
despite this , in recent weeks he 's build up his form and hit a high level
and on sunday night he pushed that even higher , turning in a display of the highest quality
he is barca 's rock , once again
gerard pique has turned things round at barca and was impressive at the nou camp this could be carlo ancelotti and xavi 's final el clasico a front cover of barca newspaper sport earlier this week claimed that carlo ancelotti could be sacked if real madrid suffered a painful defeat in the el clasico
he 'll probably survive after this , but it 's unlikely he 'll be at the santiago bernabeu next season , if he does n't turn things around in la liga
that will be hard , given barca now have a four - point lead on his real madrid side
the champions league offers another avenue to a trophy , but blocking the way are atletico madrid , a side real madrid have failed to beat six times this season , losing four times and drawing twice
the walls are closing in on carlo ancelotti
a tip of the hat to luis enrique , meanwhile
while he 's proved to be a gruff customer in press conferences , he showed his sentimental side by throwing xavi on for a few minutes in what may be the midfielder 's last el clasico , before a lucrative move to the usa or qatar
it was n't just for old time 's sake though , as the veteran midfielder helped to stifle real madrid attacks by slowing the pace
carlo ancelotti could be let go at the end of the season if he does n't turn things around in la liga cristiano ronaldo wins the battle but lionel messi wins the war the tussle between these two footballing titans rages on
cristiano ronaldo scored , which means he 'll be going home happy despite the defeat
that 's his ninth goal in eight games at nou camp
real madrid and cristiano ronaldo 's overall form is still shaky , but this performance from both team and star player , were improvements on some previous outings
lionel messi meanwhile , while not his team 's individually most impressive performer on this occasion , kept everything ticking over nicely
his early nutmeg on toni kroos was cheeky , his assist for jeremy mathieu 's goal delightful
he dipped out of the game for a while but returned with a vengeance , creating several chances which the likes of neymar should have taken
personal glory for cristiano ronaldo is all well and good , but lionel messi 's contribution to the team helped made the difference
cristiano ronaldo equalised for real madrid against barca and played well on a personal level but lionel messi made his team tick on sunday night and was a star once again for barca
