labour grandee lord mandelson today insisted broadcasters could not empty chair cameron if he refused to take part in tv debates
the former cabinet minister said the bbc , itv , sky and channel four were not entitled to â impose what they want on the political parties â and the prime minister was within his rights to ignore them
the former bbc chair michael grade accused the broadcasters of using ' bullying ' tactics to force the prime minister into the debates and said they were in danger of breaching strict rules on impartiality
labour grandee lord mandelson today insisted broadcasters could not empty chair cameron if he refused to take part in tv debates lord mandelson , speaking at a business conference organised by the trade magazine retail week , suggested that the broadcasters were acting as if they had more power than they did
but he said labour leader miliband was also perfectly entitled to score political points over mr cameron âs refusal to take part in the debates
the labour peer asked if he would advise mr cameron not to show up for the tv debates
he said : â i would nât tell him to do that
i would say that there âs an expectation that you will debate properly with others
voters feel they are entitled to have that sort of debate and comparison directly in front of them
' however , lord mandelson added : â i think cameron is entitled not to do that debate in the particular way that the broadcasters have described and the labour is entitled to make him look and appear completely frit and chicken and force him to take a hit for not doing the debates
â what i do nât think is that the broadcasters are entitled to impose what they want on the political parties and empty chair party leaders
â i do nât think the broadcasters have that entitlement
they are at the end of the day broadcasters â they are not the house of commons
who elected them ? â tory peer michael grade accused the broadcasters of using ' bullying ' tactics to force the prime minister into the debates and said they were in danger of breaching strict rules on impartiality the labour peer 's remarks come after lord grade , who served as chairman of the bbc board of governors between 2004 and 2006 , defended mr cameron for refusing to take part in any debates during the election campaign
mr cameron has agreed to take part in one debate with six other party leaders â but has insisted it takes place before the official start of the election campaign on march 30
the broadcasters however have insisted the debates must take place in april â just weeks before the election â and insisted they would go ahead with or without mr cameron
but the threat to empty chair the prime minister in the proposed head - to - head against mr miliband on 30 april â a week before polling day â was attacked by lord grade
the tory peer told radio 4 's today programme it was right that the broadcasters should organise debates â but insisted it was up to political leaders if they wanted to take part
he said : ' the idea that broadcasters can threaten politicians with empty chairs , real or imaginary , is completely unacceptable and against the statutory requirement for impartiality
' it is not for the broadcasters to threaten the prime minister and risk breaching their duty of impartiality
' the bbc should stand up today and say that they are not going to empty - chair anybody or to threaten anybody
' these debates are fun to have , maybe nice to have
the benefits or the dis - benefits you can argue it either way
but there is no requirement that they should be done
and there is a requirement on the broadcasters for impartiality
' the conservatives believe mr cameron 's election chances suffered by his decision to take part in tv election debates lord grade , who left the bbc to become executive chairman of itv , was scathing about the broadcasters ' handling of the debate negotiations
he said : ' i do n't think the broadcasters have covered themselves in glory in the way that they have campaigned for these debates , the way they have gone public early on , the way they have messed it up by missing out various parties
the thing is a shambles
it is embarrassing , frankly
' in an article in the times , lord grade accused the broadcasters of trying to bully the prime minister by threatening to signal his absence from the debates with an empty chair
he wrote : ' it is bullying , a case of the broadcast media getting way ahead of itself
' lord grade added : ' who do the broadcasters think they are ? their behaviour over the election debates leads me to believe they suddenly have grossly inflated and misguided ideas of their own importance
