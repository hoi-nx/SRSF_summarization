terry stayed behind after training to watch on the sideline as the teenagers showed chelsea âs first team how to progress in europe ahead of their champions league last - 16 second leg match at home to psg on wednesday
viveash âs team could now face an intriguing all - english last four encounter with manchester city at uefa âs headquarters in nyon , switzerland , if patrick vieira âs young charges win away to roma next week

they then mounted a jose mourinho-esque rearguard action to keep their opponents at bay through the second period before dominic solanke struck on the counter-attack to settle it two minutes from time
atletico had eliminated arsenal in the previous round and arrived in sunny surrey seeking to pile the misery on another english opponent
viveash was taking no chances , fielding a full - strength team containing brown and dominic solanke , both tipped by mourinho for bright futures , the talented frenchman boga and england under - 19 star colkett
colkett ( left ) finds himself shielding the ball from saeid ezatolahi afagh after a quiet start in which both teams tested one another out , chelsea had the first chance on 25 minutes when boga sent a free - kick spiralling over carlos marin âs crossbar
just when it appeared the opening 45 would end without score , brown broke free down the left channel and outpaced the atletico defence
colkett found him with the ideal through ball and brown directed it past the goalkeeper
with christensen charging in to make sure , the under - pressure fran manzanara got an unfortunate final touch to help it in
brown will certainly want to claim the goal , his third goal of this season âs european campaign
atletico were much improved after the break , dictating the tempo and starting the create opening
amath diedhiou , who scored the last 16 winner against arsenal , fired in a near post effort that bradley collins diverted around the post
victor mendiondo ( left ) wins a header for the spanish side , while dominic solanke rose highest ( right ) shortly afterwards , matija spoljaric sent a bouncing shot narrowly wide as chelsea âs goal came under threat
but their defence refused to be breached and , in classic chelsea style , they grabbed a second on the break in the dying moments
christensen , playing in midfield rather than his normal defensive position , showed his creative instincts with a fine pass to dominic solanke and the england under 18 international applied the finish
remarkably , it is his ninth goal in the uefa this season
chelsea are the first to book their place in the semi-finals , which take place across the road from uefa âs headquarters in nyon on april 10
the final will be staged at the same venue three days later
