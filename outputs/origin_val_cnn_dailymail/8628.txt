pochettino is nât the selfie type
so when the tottenham manager slipped his camera phone out at loftus road on saturday , you could nât help but notice
â my family was in the stands , my two sons ( maurizio , 13 , and sebastiano , 20 ) and my older brother ( javier )
they were sitting just behind the goal in the top tier
â my brother is over from argentina , he came over for the capital one cup final
they have the chance to go to the executive box or be in a better area but they prefer to sing the songs with the fans
so i took the photo as a souvenir
it was a fantastic moment for me and them
it was the first time i âve done it in my career
â pochettino took a photo the tottenham fans at loftus road as his family were among them harry heads past robert green to give tottenham the lead over qpr at loftus road tottenham striker harry celebrates as his goals keep tottenham in the hunt for a top four finish javier still works on the farm where 43 - year - old pochettino grew up in argentina âs murphy province
their career paths have taken different directions but that does nât stop javier providing his younger , more high - profile brother with an honest assessment
â he is very honest â sometimes too much ! he âs six years older than me
he works on the farm and watches every game live , all the games are on in argentina
â whether javier , maurizio and sebastiano joined in with the harry â he âs one of our own â chant is not known
they certainly had the chances to do so as two more goals took harry âs tally to 26 for the season
he is certain to be in the england squad when roy , who was at loftus road , picks his players for the clashes against lithuania and italy later this month
but another â one of their own â , ryan mason , would also have impressed roy
â is ryan mason close to a call - up ? the question is not for me , but roy , â said pochettino , whose side face manchester united next week
ryan mason ( left ) has been linked with an england call - up after his impressive form for tottenham ramsey refused to get carried away with a points target after qpr lost to tottenham â this is ryan mason âs first full season , even though he is 23 , but he has potential to improve and , like harry , he is progressing in a very good way
â for qpr , however , defeat left ramsey âs side in the drop zone and preparing for a relegation battle
â i do nât think it âs worth setting points targets
you can only control what you can control and the points target now is three points in the next game , â said ramsey .
