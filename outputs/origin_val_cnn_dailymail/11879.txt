the printed keys are your hieroglyphic guide ' emoji were originally popular in japan , and widely used online
however , in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere
originally meaning pictograph , the word emoji literally means ' picture ' ( e ) + ' letter ' ( moji )
icons are standardised and include some specific to japanese culture , such as a bowing ( apologising ) businessman , a face wearing a face mask , a white flower used to denote ' brilliant homework ' or a group of emoji representing popular foods : ramen noodles , dango , onigiri , japanese curry , and sushi
some emoji character sets have been incorporated into unicode , allowing them to be used elsewhere including websites and apps such as facebook and twitter
the keyboard is the latest in a long line of apps and services related to emoji
last year a pair of london - based developers created the emojli app that only let users communicate using the popular miniature images
even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons
and with the release of ios 8 mac allowed app developers to create emoji - based keyboards for iphones , ipads and iphones
a study in april last year found that the top trending word , at that time , was emoji
there are now apps dedicated to the small images
emojli , for example , ( pictured ) only lets users communicate using the popular pictures , and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons
