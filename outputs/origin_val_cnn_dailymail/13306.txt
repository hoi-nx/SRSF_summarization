a court in turkey this week sentenced two cartoonists to 11 months and 20 days in prison for insulting turkey president recep tayyip erdogan
soon after , the court changed the jail sentence to a fine of 7,000 turkey lira or about $ 2,700 each
cartoonists bahadir baruter and ozer aydogan draw for the weekly satirical magazine penguen
founded in 2002 with a weekly average of 65,000 readers , the irreverent comic book -- similar in many ways to the french magazine charlie hebdo -- regularly skewers turkey politicians
a defamation suit was filed against an august cover of penguen in which a cartoon figure of recep tayyip erdogan is welcomed to the presidential palace by a public servant
recep tayyip erdogan tells him , " but this is so dry
we could have at least slaughtered a journalist
" in a statement to the press , the penguen team explained that a citizen who described himself as an recep tayyip erdogan supporter " sent an email to the prime ministry information center
... according to the notice , the employee ( in the cartoon ) ' made the gay signal with his fingers
' " turkey 's public prosecutor eventually launched an investigation , claiming that both the speech bubbles and the " hand drawing " insulted recep tayyip erdogan
while the court ruled wednesday in favor of recep tayyip erdogan , a full - length explanation of the verdict will be released in a week to 10 days
it is so far unclear whether the judge ruled that the speech bubbles or the " gay hand gesture " or both were an insult
the ruling comes amid an increase in criminal cases lodged against journalists , students and public figures for " defamation against a public officer
" in 2014 , turkey was ranked one of the world 's worst jailers of journalists by the media watchdog group reporters without borders and its press status " not free " by freedom house
the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , nils muiå¾nieks , expressed his concern about the ruling against penguen as well as the surge in criminal cases against people accused of insulting recep tayyip erdogan
" this sentence is misguided and , along with a pattern of criminal prosecutions , sends a chilling message to media professionals and all those who want to exercise their right to free expression , " muiå¾nieks said
ann harrison of freedom of press advocacy group pen international told cnn , " we have long called for decriminalization of defamation , particularly of state officials , as to criminalize criticism of authorities severely stifles reporting and public debate
" harrison noted that special mandates from the united nations , organization for security and co-operation in europe and organization of american states have called for the abolishment of criminal defamation laws
penguen announced it will appeal the decision
the magazine also defiantly released a new cartoon mocking the case
" we will continue drawing our cartoons , " penguen announced in a statement
" we hope this case will be the last example of the intimidation effort on free thought
