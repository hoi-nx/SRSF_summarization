burglars have broken into the office of one of schumacher 's top doctors , raising fears they have stolen medical data that reveals the true extent of his condition
a laptop was among the items stolen in the break - in at the surgery of dr johannes peil , 60 , who has been one of the f1 star 's physicians for many years
mr johannes peil is also part of the 15 - strong team of medics currently caring for schumacher , 46 , at his home on lake geneva following his catastrophic ski accident in the swiss alps in 2013
dr johannes peil 's other prominent patients include nico rosberg and tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama
money , some perfume and prescription forms were also stolen
last year , a helicopter rescue worker who treated schumacher hanged himself in a zurich jail cell after being arrested for stealing details of his condition which he tried to sell to news organisations
schumacher spent months in a coma following the accident before being transferred to a rehab clinic in lausanne , switzerland
he was then moved to a medical suite built into his mansion in september
road to recovery : schumacher ( pictured with wife corinna in 2004 ) was holidaying with family and friends in meribel , france when the accident happened in december 2013 since then , a news blackout has fallen over his condition , but insiders report he remains mute and unable to move
last month , it was revealed that schumacher had sold his norwegian mountain holiday home for Â£ 2million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries
the sale of the retreat , in trysil , north of oslo , comes after it emerged last year that his family was planning to build a Â£ 10million ' hospital ' room for the star at their home in switzerland
schumacher , a very competent skier , was holidaying with family and friends in meribel , france , where he owns a chalet when the accident happened in december 2013
he was skiing with his 14 - year - old son on a red piste , which is classed for intermediate skiers
but shortly after 11am , he left the piste and skied on to an off - piste area located in between the red run and a blue run , for beginners to intermediates
liquidating his assets : schumacher 's family has sold his norwegian mountain holiday home ( pictured ) for Â£ 2million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries it was here that he struck a partially - covered rock
he was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock
he smashed his head on the bolder
the force of the collision shattered his helmet
the footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged
the film , which included audio , captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident
two months later , on february 17 , the head of the inquiry , prosecutor patrick quincy , closed the case
he announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out
he cleared the ski resort , stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that schumacher ' deliberately ' left the ski run
at the end of january it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma
since september last year he has been looked after by medical experts at his home in gland , switzerland .
