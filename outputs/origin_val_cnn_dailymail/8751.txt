silverman is coming under fire for a list of ten ' rape prevention tips ' that she shared on twitter , because they offer tongue - in - cheek advice to men
the post , which has been retweeted nearly 5,000 times , includes points such as ' do n't put drugs in women 's drinks ' and ' when you see a woman walking by herself , leave her alone '
she posted a graphic of the tips , writing : ' these are great - send to all the men in ur life
' but dozens of angry men on twitter seized on her joke , tweeting in to call her ' sexist ' and saying it was ' offensive ' to imply that all men are looking for ways to rape women
a tongue - in - cheek list of rape prevention tips that are aimed at the attacker have gone viral on twitter silverman tweeted the list with a post advising people to ' send it to all the men in ur life ' although the ten rape prevention tips have been shared and favourited thousands of times , the comedian faced a backlash on social media , with men calling them ' degrading ' and ' sexist '
the sarcastic set of rules , which focus on the perpetrator of the crime rather than the victim , also include ' if you are in an elevator and a woman gets in , do n't rape her ' , as well as ' when you encounter a woman who is asleep , the safest course of action is not to rape her '
number nine on the list is ' carry a rape whistle
if you find you are about to rape someone , blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you '
and the final one reads : ' do n't forget , honesty is the best policy
when asking a woman out on a date , do n't pretend that you are interested in her as a person ; tell her straight up that you expect to be raping her later
if you do n't communicate your intentions , the woman may take it as a sign that you do not plan to rape her
