this big tummy does n't seem to budge , ' she said on the latest edition of channel 5 documentary benefits britain : life on the dole
vicky benson , pictured on channel 5 documentary benefits britain , says she would like to work but employers wo n't give a chance because she 's ' well and truly overweight ' ' i have tried to lose weight , i have tried everything
it 's hard to diet , what 's right for you , what not to eat , what to have in place of the rubbish
the temptation of just saying , " i 'm just going for a kebab "
' she said she has tried to find work but has n't been successful and is angry that , as a result , her handouts have been sanctioned
she used to get Â£ 270 a week benefits but this was cut to Â£ 200 a week when she failed to apply for enough jobs
' it 's terrible living on benefits , it 's not what i want
i have looked at a lot of cleaning jobs , coffee shops , shoe shops , everything but i never hear anything back , ' she said
' if there are two people standing for the same job and one is big and one is slim , they will take the slim one
' as a single mother to twins lexi and levi , five , and daughter chloe , 13 , as well as looking after a dog , vicky benson says she 's no stranger to hard work
the single mother has been on the dole for eight years and is angry her benefits have been cut recently because she has n't applied for enough jobs ' it 's a full - time job looking after three kids , in fact it 's probably harder , ' she pointed out
she has been living off handouts for eight years after quitting a job she had as a cleaner
she said : ' i last worked in 2007
i had a job cleaning in sheltered accommodation
i did it for eight weeks
it did n't work out so i just gave it in
maybe i should have stuck at it and tried harder
' after her twins started at school , vicky benson was warned her benefits would be sanctioned if she did n't demonstrate she was actively seeking work
but she said she struggled to find a job because of her size , lack of qualifications and the fact she would have to fit it in around childcare
vicky benson , pictured applying for jobs with her daughter , said she is trying to find work she said it 's not fair her benefits have been cut as a result of her not applying for enough jobs
' i applied for four jobs as they were the only ones suitable for me to do
as a result , my benefits have been sanctioned as they said it was n't enough , ' she explained
' i 'm really angry at the fact they can put the sanction on me when i have kids
there are others who do n't have kids and lie through their teeth and still get their money , ' she said
vicky benson 's sister , paula , said she did n't believe the job centre have done enough to help dyslexic vicky benson find work
she said : ' it 's wrong she was sanctioned for something she had done , but not done enough of
it 's not like she had n't done anything
vicky benson 's three children and her dog , pictured , keep her busy and she hated having to visit a food bank recently in order to feed them thanks to her benefits being sanctioned ' she 's a nice person , she 's honest
i definitely think she could work given the chance
' vicky benson added that she attended a course in order to keep her benefits but it was n't helpful
' the course was rubbish , it was on how to set up your own business - that 's never going to happen to me
i could n't wait to get home , it was a waste of time , ' she said
as a result of her benefits cut , the single mother had to go to a food bank in order to feed her children , something she said made her feel like a ' scrounger ' and that she does n't want to do again
she said she intends to join a local slimming group so she can get the support she needs to lose weight and she hopes once she 's slimmer , she will get be given the opportunity to work
