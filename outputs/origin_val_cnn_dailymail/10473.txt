jailed : nicole richess , 20 , of bournemouth , dorset , had sex with the two servicemen after a night out a young woman was today jailed for more than two years after falsely accusing two soldiers of trying to rape her because she was ashamed about a drunken cocaine - fuelled threesome
nicole richess , 20 , of bournemouth , dorset , had sex with the two servicemen at a friend âs house and then her own home after a night out
the following day her boyfriend heard rumours that she had been unfaithful and confronted her
richess â panicked â and made up the false claim that the two innocent men , aged 23 and 24 , had forced themselves on her - because she was too ashamed to tell her boyfriend of three years , ganter , she had cheated on him
mr ganter made her go to the police to report the â attack â , and nicole richess even gave a â tearful â account of the apparent crime to officers and â illicitly gained their empathy â
her â deceitful web of lies â saw the two soldiers arrested , leaving them â distraught and petrified â
however , officers began to realise nicole richess was lying when they gathered the accounts of the soldiers and her friends - and she was charged with perverting the course of justice
nicole richess was today jailed for two and a half years by a judge who said that her lies had an â insidious and corrosive â effect on public confidence and the justice system
judge jonathan fuller qc said : â you made a determined and prolonged attempt to weave a picture of deceit to further your ends and you were prepared to make wholly false allegations of attempted rape against these innocent young men
victims : nicole richess made up the false claim that the two innocent men ( above , left and right ) had forced themselves on her - because she was too ashamed to tell her boyfriend she had cheated on him â you told a web of lies and even cried to evoke sympathy
the impact on these victims can not be understated and false allegations of rape and attempted rape can have dreadful consequences
â every occasion of a proved false allegation has an insidious effect on public confidence , sometimes allowing doubts to creep into when one should nât exist
your offence has a corrosive effect on criminal justice
