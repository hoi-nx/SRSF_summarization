all - action lindsey gowland , 57 , played basketball to a national level as a teenager and then took to the water after turning 40
she won a european gold and world silver medal at masters level but was forced to give up competing when two of her local pools were shut down in 2009
super-gran ! sports - mad lindsey gowland shows off her muscles with this deadlift the lecturer won three weightlifting golds at the british championships in stafford last month lindsey gowland , from kingswinford , west midlands , discovered weights when her swimming pool closed the mum - of - four - who works as a sports lecturer and lives in kingswinford , west midlands - was then introduced to dumbbells by her colleague martin at the end of 2013
lindsey gowland initially lifted the weights to keep fit but soon realised she was good enough to enter the midlands championships in worcester in october last year
after qualifying with ease she then went on to win three gold medals in her first ever british championships in stafford in february
lindsey gowland took home first place in the deadlift , squat and bench press categories when she competed in the 63kg weight class and 55 to 59 age grouping
incredibly , she set a world record of 121kg in the deadlift as well as a european best in the 60kg squat and a new british record with 43kg in the bench press
lindsey gowland , who lives with her pe teacher husband ian , 58 , admitted she does n't look like a typical weightlifter
mum - of - four and grandmother - of - three lindsey gowland weighs 9st 9lb and was introduced to weights by a colleague lindsey gowland during her qualifying event for the british championships in worcester in october 2014 lindsey gowland with her colleague and personal trainer martin , who first introduced her to dumbbells in 2013 the 5ft 7in grandmother - of - three , who weighs 9st 9lb , said : ' i used to swim three or four times a week with a club but they closed down the one pool and a couple of years later they closed down the pool we moved to because of council cuts
' martin got me into weights
he has had a go at it in the past and he looked at what i was lifting for swimming training and said i had a good chance of competing
' he asked if i fancied giving it a go and i just thought , " why not ? " ' when i first started training i was doing sessions at dudley college , where the gym is mostly used by students
' lots of them used to look at me and think ' i bet you 're not going to lift much ' and i think they were quite surprised to see i could pull the weights i can pull
' i never thought of myself as someone who would be able to lift heavy weights
it has really been so unexpected
' i am reasonably tall but i am not a big person
i certainly do n't look like the stereotypical weightlifter
lindsey gowland , centre , won gold at her last swimming championship in 2009 but gave up when two local pools closed ' but had it not been for the pool closing i think swimming would still be my main sport
' lindsey gowland has now got her sights set on beating her global competitors when she enters the world single lift championships in telford , shrops. , in june this year
the sports lecturer - who has four grown - up children ian , 34 , emma , 33 , amy , 26 , and kelly , 25 - is also targeting the world record for the squat which stands at 65kg
lindsey gowland often cycles as part of her fitness routine she added : ' i had lifted weights in the past but only for conditioning to support swimming
' i virtually had to re-learn my technique because when you weight train for fun you can get away with slightly less technique but when you compete it 's very strict
' i could n't believe it when i broke the world record , i think there was a russian woman who held it before me
i have lifted 125kg in qualifying but i just could n't quite hang on to it in the finals
' i want to work towards the squat world record
i need to get another 5kg on to the 60kg ( european record ) which i think i can achieve by june
' i wo n't know who is turning up until the day of the world championships but there could be people from all over the world in my age group so it will be a challenge
' lindsey gowland grew up in lancashire before moving to the west midlands in 1976 , where she met her husband , ian
all four of her children have caught the fitness bug and her only son ian is the captain of the swedish national rugby union team after he emigrated there with his wife
the fitness fanatic only weight trains once a week but also plays netball and swims an average of 3,000m every week
and lindsey gowland hopes her success will show other people that they can keep active and strong as they get older
she added : ' when you look at others lifting big weights who are older than myself it shows that you do not have to get weaker with age , ' she said
' just because someone gets older it does not mean they ca n't do lots and lots of different things
' it is all about high impact stuff , they have done studies that prove if you do high impact sports where your feet are coming off the ground then muscles , bones and joints stay stronger for longer
' you lose strength and fitness with age but you do n't have to lose it as quickly
' i would like to think i feel younger and could give the college students a good run for their money in a lot of sports
