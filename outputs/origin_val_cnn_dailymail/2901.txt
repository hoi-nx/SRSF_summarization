a lifesaving vaccine against meningitis has not yet been introduced because the nhs has failed to agree a price a lifesaving vaccine against meningitis b could be given to babies for just Â£ 20 a dose â but it has yet to be introduced because the nhs has failed to agree a price after nine months of negotiations
bexsero , the first jab to protect against the leading cause of life - threatening bacterial meningitis , was recommended for all infants as part of a national immunisation programme in march 2014
the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation said approval was subject to a cost - effective price being agreed between the manufacturer and the department of health , with talks beginning in july 2014
the maximum price being considered under negotiations is around Â£ 20 â a significant saving compared with glaxosmithkline 's ' list price ' of Â£ 75
children need three doses in the first year of life , making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in england and wales Â£ 42million
gps are also paid a Â£ 7.50 fee for each dose administered
campaigners have warned the lack of urgency from health officials is costing lives
meningitis b can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms
since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases , of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities
chris head , chief executive of the meningitis research foundation , said : ' these price negotiations have been ongoing since july 2014
' meanwhile babies and children continue to die or suffer devastating injury , with lifelong costs to the government of someone seriously disabled from the disease ranging from Â£ 3million to Â£ 4.5million
' earlier this week health secretary jeremy hunt said he wanted to introduce the vaccine on the nhs as soon as possible but his hands will be tied by general election ' purdah ' after the middle of next week
a department of health spokesman said : ' we are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease â but only at a price that represents good value for money for the nhs
' bexsero is the first jab to protect against the leading cause of life - threatening bacterial meningitis
