in may of this year the lhc will be turned on at full power after a wait of more than two years , as scientists prepare to probe the secrets of the universe closer than ever before
and if one scientists gets his way , one of these searches could involve looking for dark matter - one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the cosmos
he proposes that the higgs boson boson itself - which gives particles their mass - could disintegrate into dark matter , and he âs hoping the team at cern can prove his theory
according to dr christoffer petersson âs model the higgs boson particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter dr christoffer petersson from chalmers university of technology in sweden and two colleagues came up with the new particle model to predict the existence of dark matter
the current â standard model â of particle physics is quite good at describing physics on a subatomic level , but it ca nât account for dark matter in the universe
dr christoffer petersson âs model , though , contains more â elementary particles â - the smallest known to exist - than the standard model
this includes dark matter particles
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe
and his model also gives the higgs boson particle different properties , suggesting that it can disintegrate into a photon ( a particle of light ) and particles of dark matter
to prove his theory , though , he needs a particle accelerator - and it seems that cern is willing to conduct such an experiment
two independent experimental stations - atlas and cms - at the lhc are looking for the very properties of the higgs boson particle his model predicts
if the properties are there , it is a clear indication that the model fits
â it 's a dream for a theorist in particle physics , â said dr christoffer petersson
â [ the ] lhc is the only place where the model can be tested
it 's even nicer that two independent experiments are going to do it
' the current â standard model â of particle physics is quite good at describing physics on a subatomic level , but it ca nât account for dark matter in the universe ( illustrated )
dr christoffer petersson âs model , though , contains more â elementary particles â than the standard model - and crucially it includes dark matter particles in may of this year the lhc will be turned on at full power after a wait of more than two years , as scientists prepare to probe the secrets of the universe closer than ever before
pictured is the atlas experiment at the lhc , one of two instruments trying to prove - or disprove - dr christoffer petersson 's model in the first studies the volume of data was unfortunately too small for it to be possible to either confirm or reject christoffer petersson 's model
â but we are already in full swing with new analyses in which we are testing his model in other ways and with more data , â said dr zeynap demiragli at the cms experiment at cern
â we congratulate christoffer petersson for having done an important job
â after being closed down for a time for an upgrade , lhc will start up again in the spring of 2015
with higher energies in the accelerator , the experiments will finally gather sufficient data to evaluate dr christoffer petersson 's model properly
â if the model is found to fit , it would completely change our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of nature , ' he said
' if not , just the fact that they are willing to test my model at cern is great
