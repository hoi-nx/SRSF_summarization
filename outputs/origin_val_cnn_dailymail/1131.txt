mercedes engine : mercedes 44 lewis hamilton age : 29 grand prix : 166 wins : 8 lewis hamilton has got the confidence , but we do know that he can be fragile â his gaffe during qualifying for the gbr grand prix last year is a good example
nico rosberg has a lot to prove , but he will undoubtedly learn from his mistakes
he will come back stronger
nico rosberg drives the new mercedes car during testing at the circuit de catalunya in spain on march 1 red bull engine : renault 3 daniel ricciardo ( aus ) age : 25 grand prix : 69 wins : 3 26 daniil kvyat ( rus ) age : 20 grand prix : 19 wins : 0 new red bull driver daniil kvyat takes the 2015 car round the track in barcelona during a filming day williams engine : mercedes 19 felipe massa ( bra ) age : 33 grand prix : 212 wins : 11 77 bottas age : 25 grand prix : 38 wins : 0 the flair and experience of felipe massa is balanced by the steely determination of bottas , who i expect to lead the charge to mercedes on a consistent basis
felipe massa is a great character and i hope he gets some good results , such as his pole position in austria last year
felipe massa takes the williams for a spin during testing in barcelona at the end of february ferrari engine : ferrari 5 sebastian vettel ( ger ) age : 27 grand prix : 139 wins : 39 7 kimi ( fin ) age : 35 grand prix : 213 wins : 20 there is less pressure on sebastian vettel because it is a fresh challenge
it is the first time he has flown the nest and i expect to see him develop
kimi was fantastic at races in 2013 but at the same events last year he was nowhere
the car will be better and i hope it gives him what he needs
sebastian vettel has moved from red bull to ferrari for the 2015 season mclaren engine : honda 14 alonso ( spa ) age : 33 grand prix 's 236 wins : 32 22 jenson button ( gbr ) age : 35 grand prix 's 268 wins : 15 all team bosses nominated alonso as the driver they would want , but he clearly has problems
keeping jenson button was right , too , but the car is not where it needs to be
they finished fifth in 2014 with the best engine but have changed to honda , so my gut says they will not improve
great britain 's jenson button drives the new honda powered mclaren at testing this month force india engine : mercedes 27 hulkenberg ( ger ) age : 27 grand prix : 77 wins : 0 11 sergio perez ( mex ) age : 25 grand prix : 77 wins : 0 hulkenberg is one of the stars but he has not been in the environment to win races , and i do nât know if he âll achieve that at force india
last year sergio perez outshone him
hulkenberg needs to be dominant if he wants to join a big team like sergio perez did at mclaren
force india 's sergio perez puts the car through its paces at the circuit de catalunya toro rosso engine : renault 55 jnr ( spa ) age : 20 grand prix : 0 wins : 0 33 max verstappen ( hol ) age : 17 grand prix : 0 wins : 0 it is the youngest driver pairing in f1 history , but i like it
with greater experience , jnr is who you would expect to lead the team , but i think we are going to get a big surprise from max. he hardly made a mistake in testing , does nât miss apexes or lock brakes and looks in control
toro rosso 's 17 - year - old rookie max verstappen tests the new car earlier this month lotus engine : mercedes 8 grosjean ( fra ) age : 28 grand prix : 64 wins : 0 13 pastor maldonado ( ven ) age : 29 grand prix : 77 wins : 1 i âm a big grosjean fan , but the car was not very good last year and he struggled
if the team can deliver on performance â they have changed from renault to mercedes engines â we will see him up there
pastor can deliver but he also crashes
he must reduce those incidents
pastor maldonado tests the new lotus car at the circuit on the outskirts of barcelona sauber engine : ferrari 9 marcus ericsson ( swe ) age : 24 grand prix : 16 wins : 0 12 felipe nasr ( bra ) age : 22 grand prix : 0 wins : 0 a new driver line - up , with adrian sutil and esteban gutierrez leaving
marcus ericsson failed to set the world alight at caterham in 2014 , while brazilian rookie felipe nasr battled for last year âs gp2 championship
each brings Â£ 12m in sponsorship to the cash - strapped outfit
felipe nasr , who will be making his f1 debut , tests the new sauber manor engine : ferrari - stevens ( gbr ) age : 23 grand prix : 1 wins : 0 will stevens has got his chance but the big story here is that the team are on the grid and that really makes me smile
i am very pleased for all the guys there because they are racers with real passion
why not give paul di resta a chance alongside the former caterham driver ? he would be exactly the type of character that manor needs
the f1 season kicks off with the australian gp on sunday , march 15
