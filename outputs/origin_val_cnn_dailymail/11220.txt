it 's a revival of a period drama classic , so the seven million viewers who tune in to bbc1 âs new hit ross would be forgiven for thinking they had seen some of the characters before
but , as these pictures show , it âs not just the 1970s original that the new cast bear uncanny similarities to ... ross 's first love elizabeth , as played by heida reed , shares the cool beauty and brunette tresses of dancing on ice host christine bleakley , the fiancee of footballer frank lampard
the one show , which christine bleakley used to present , just became the two show ... doubles : helda reed , left , who plays ross 's first love elizabeth , has stunning similarities to christine bleakley ( right ) handsome leading man aidan turner oozes the same rugged , brooding sex appeal of tragic inxs frontman michael hutchence in his portrayal of captain ross
ross - a - likes : he 's been turning heads as the new poldark and it 's easy to see why when he looks like tragic inxs frontman michael hutchence the australian rocker may have sung never tear us apart â¦ but in this case never tell us apart might be more accurate
he might not be known for having the voice of an angel , but actor kyle soller , who plays francis poldark , still resembles choirboy - turned - broadcaster aled jones
choirboy faces : kyle soller , who plays francis poldark ( right ) is the double of aled jones just do nât try to imagine him singing walking in the air in a dubious cornish accent ... ross âs drunken servant jud paynter and his buxom wife prudie have a couple of comedy doppelgangers
what a couple : podark 's servant and his wife look similar to a couple of other familiar characters ( below ) albert steptoe , played by wilfrid brambell and edney , aka dawn french , could be mistaken for poldark characters jud and prudie paynter ( above ) phil davis âs scoundrel resembles sitcom rag - and - bone man albert steptoe ( wilfrid brambell ) , and edney looks like vicar of dibley star dawn french as she appeared in lark rise to candleford
edney is actually the daughter of another acting icon â sylvia sims
as volatile captain blamey , richard harrington is a million miles from laid - back charmer des
but put them both in a waistcoat and cravat â as des wore on stage in the wizard of oz â and the similarities are more obvious
performers : not alike in character but captain blamey ot richard harrington and des o'connor are not too different in a waistcoat and cravat fiery , flame - haired and prone to scandalising polite society , poldark temptress demelza , eleanor tomlinson , bears more than a physical similarity to christine keeler , the showgirl at the centre of the 1963 profumo affair
red - haired beauties : poldark temptress demelza , eleanor tomlinson ( right ) looks much like christine keeler , the showgirl at the centre of the 1963 profumo affair it looks like farthings are actually two - a - penny , as jack farthing - who plays george warleggan , channels the spirit of hugh grant in the 1995 film version of jane austen 's sense and sensibility
handsome hat - wearers hugh grant in the 1995 film version of jane austen 's sense and sensibility looks like jack farthing , who plays george warleggan in the drama in his last screen role , late acting heavyweight warren clarke is positively churchillian as the imposing patriarch charles poldark ... though sadly it 's the animated insurance - selling dog he resembles rather than british 's greatest prime minister
oh , no ? oh , yes ... oh yes : late actor warren clarke has a barking similarity to the churchill the cartoon dog
