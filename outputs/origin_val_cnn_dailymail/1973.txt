frank valentic , buyer 's advocate on the block , said that most bathroom renovations would cost between $ 20,000 and $ 40,000 ' if you are looking to renovate with the view of adding value , and re-selling , you need to do it smartly , ' frank valentic told daily mail australia
the founder and managing director of melbourne firm of advantage property consulting , said that he always approaches renovations from the perspective of a potential buyer
' you need to have the future buyer in mind , who may want to resell themselves and will want to get the best price and wo n't want to have to spend wads of cash to get there , ' he said
valentic estimates that a bathroom renovation should cost between $ 20,000 and $ 40,000 depending on the property , and emphasized the importance of investing in the ' wet areas ' of a property - the bathroom and kitchen
' one of the key things to keep in mind would be to always try and include a separate bath , as almost all demographics prefer that , ' frank valentic said
' families with young kids will want a bath , and women often say that it 's important as they like to relax with a soak , ' he said
' incorporating a separate bath and shower , especially with good quality and high level finishes , would be something that investors in melbourne 's inner suburbs would expect
' valentic recommends having a separate bath and shower to add value to your bathroom , as seen above in josh and charlotte 's winning bathroom block contestants josh and charlotte won the bathroom reveal this week with their design tim and anastasia also chose to incorporate a separate bath and shower , along with plenty of storage the buyer 's advocate said that he would also recommend investing in a separate toilet if the floorplan allows for it , as it is both practical and convenient
' if someone is having a shower , having a separate toilet is just practical , ' he said
' i would also recommend thinking about storage
on this week 's bathroom reveal [ the block contestants ] josh and charlotte missed out on storage behind the mirrors and wooden vanity
' frank valentic said that areas for storage were crucial in a bathroom , in order to create a space that could be kept clean with minimal effort
' buyers will want somewhere to store away their belongings , especially under a benchtop
you need somewhere for the buyer to put their makeup or rest their hairdryer , to have that space to be able to have your items out while you 're preparing yourself , ' he said
the veteran bidder said that good light , both natural and installed , was extremely important in a bathroom : ' if you ca n't see what you 're doing it 's not going to be advantageous '
' good natural light , as well as good lighting is really important for doing hair and make - up , ' he said
' the apartments on this season of the block all have really positive natural light
' for small splashes of luxury , frank valentic said that tiling all the way up to the ceiling shows that the renovations have n't been ' skimped on '
' with jess and ayden 's bathroom ( above ) , some of the buyers said the geometric tiling was too much , and some said " what a good feature " , so they have already polarised buyers , ' said frank valentic the the block contestants daz and dea ( above ) used a neutral colour palate for their bathroom design daz and dea made the most of the natural light and offered plenty of storage for potential buyers ' it 's an extra thing that you would expect in a high end apartment , and an element i would definitely recommend , ' he said
' having really good quality tiles on the floor and ceiling is also one really important thing to get right , and the rest should work around that , ' ' it 's also important that the quality throughout is the same level
all the elements of the bathroom need to blend be consistent , so you do n't want to have nice european taps on a cheap vanity
' valentic also highlighted the importance of finding a balance between classic styling and being edgy with the design and aesthetics of the bathroom
' you do n't want it to be too one sided and only have a few people interested
if you keep the end buyer in mind , if they do n't like the bathroom and need to renovate , that 's an expensive exercise , ' he said
' neutral colours like grey , black , and white seem to more popular across the board
you need to ask yourself - will it date ? you have to look ahead and consider that what is trendy now may not be in ten years time , ' ' if you consider jess and ayden 's bathroom , some of the buyers said the geometric tiling was too much , and some said " what a good feature " , so they have already polarised buyers , and so did daz dea ' looking beyond the bathroom , frank valentic said that investing in renovating the kitchen will always add value to a property and should be the proper starting place for any renovation
valentic estimates that a bathroom renovation should cost between $ 20,000 and $ 40,000 frank valentic said that the quality should be the same level , so that all the elements of the bathroom blend well valentic was a veteran bidder on season seven on the block before becoming a judge on the show ' the kitchen has evolved into the entertaining hub and engine of most properties , because of open plan meal , dining and living areas , ' he said
' any spare cash at all should be thrown into the kitchen and bathroom
' frank valentic said that figures show that 80 % of property decisions are made by women , and he said that a nice kitchen is one of the biggest drawing cards for that reason
' i would just highlight that it 's important not to overinvest in these areas , and property experts say that renovators should only spend up to 10 % of the property 's value in total on renovations
having a good outdoor entertaining area is also a bonus , as many buyers will entertain at home and look for outdoors to be an extension of the living area
it is also crucial to research the demographic of the area before planning renovations , in order to ascertain what renovations are being done to other properties in the area
' you need to give due diligence to your renovations
what are renovated properties selling for in the area ? are you making your property what the end users will want ? , ' he said
' if you are putting in a laminex benchtop and the demographic demands stone benchtops it wo n't be the right result and you 'll have to re-do it
' frank valentic also said that if renovators are considering re-selling then getting an agent involved is an extremely helpful way to make the process easier .
