the sack and pillage of the mosul museum by the so - called islamic and syria displayed a violence rarely seen since the destruction of the buddhas of bamyian
the bulldozing of the archaeological site of nimrud marked a new step in the cultural cleansing underway in iraq
these acts are a deliberate attack against civilians , minorities , heritage sites and traditions
in the minds of terrorists , murder and destruction of culture are inherently linked
it is appalling to see the ravages of this violent extremism in a region that is a cradle of civilization , whose temples , palaces and frescoes have born witness to the glory of iraq and mesopotamian for the last 3,000 years
it is important we understand the true nature of this conflict
this war against culture is a war against people
it is part of a strategy to crush free thinking and to ensure domination through oppression
this is why extremists attack schools , media , or other places of culture
through modern methods of communication and information , they use warped learning and distorted academic texts to hijack young minds
they forbid girls to go to school , kill journalists and vandalize museums : all symbols that embody freedom of thought and respect for cultural diversity
there can be no justification whatsoever for the systematic destruction of the heritage of humanity , and i wholeheartedly support the many religious leaders who have taken such a firm position denouncing these destructions and the perverted use of religion
when culture is under attack , we must respond with more knowledge , and with ever greater effort to work to explain the importance of humanity 's shared heritage
this is why we appeal to all cultural institutions , museums , journalists , professors , and scientists to share knowledge widely about the mesopotamian civilization
we need to remind â all of the history of this land which led the islamic golden age
and we also call on all people everywhere -- and especially youth , in iraq and elsewhere -- to claim this heritage as their own
pre-islamic heritage in iraq belongs to all iraq , just as the pyramids are written into the identity of all egyptians
what is happening goes far beyond the domain of archaeologists and discourse on the " irreparable loss of treasures of humanity
" what is happening is a security issue
the deliberate destruction of cultural heritage is a war crime
we see how terrorists are using such destruction to destabilize populations , spread terror , and encourage violence
we see also how extremists use heavy military vehicles to transport artifacts from looted â sites , and how illicit trafficking is directly funding terrorism
with this in mind , we have joined forces with all partners and neighboring countries to halt these crimes
the acceleration of such violence must be met with an acceleration of global solidarity and action
faced with such crimes , we hope we can better understand the values we all share , and stand united in respect of humanity .
