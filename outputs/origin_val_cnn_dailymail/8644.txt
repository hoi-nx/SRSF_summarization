biden made yet another of his trademark gaffes today as he met northern ireland 's prime minister to mark st patrick 's day - then suggested one side of its sectarian divide was unwelcome in washington
sporting a green tie and noticing that everyone else was also wearing one , or clad in green , he suddenly blurted : ' anyone wearing orange is not welcome in here
' the purported joke was a reference to irish 's religious and political divide which was at the heart of the troubles , the violence which killed 3,000 from the late 1960s until the start of the millennium
orange is the color associated with the protestant majority in northern ireland , and overcoming sectarian tensions has been a major part of the effort to bring peace to the once - deeply troubled province
enda kenny , the irish prime minister â whose official title is taoiseach â and his wife enda kenny , the guests of honour , both laughed nervously
they said nothing , but continued to smile for the cameras
the vice president made a joke about sectarianism and got her name wrong i 'm with ... : vice president biden points at shamrock worn in his breast pocket to mark st patrick 's day after a brief pause , mr biden declared : ' only joking
' he then welcomed the kennys , catholic ambassador anne anderson and the irish entourage into the naval observatory in washington , his official residence
the vice pesident made no further reference to his blurted - out bad joke , but at one point in his breakfast remarks appeared to refer to the taoiseach 's wife as ' fiona ' , although he subsequently corrected it to fionnuala
northern irish protestants traditionally wear orange during their annual summer parades , while green is used as a symbol by mostly catholic nationalists and is a theme of st patrick 's day celebrations around the world
in northern ireland , there was an immediate demand from a senior unionist for an apology
' whether they were intended as a joke or not , the comments are a slur on those who would be known as ' orange ' i.e. protestant , ' said the rev william mccrea , a member of the united kingdom parliament for the democratic unionist party
' when northern ireland is making such an effort to make st patrick 's day an inclusive celebration , biden 's comments were disgraceful and careless , ' he added
asked about the request for an apology , an official in biden 's office said the vice president had made clear that he was joking
biden 's mother , finnegan , was of irish origin
her ancestors had moved to northern ireland in the wake of the potato famine
the vice president made another minor blunder later when he read a quote from a yeats poem he described as ' easter sunday ' , when the word sunday is not in the title
the poem was about the easter rising , when irish rebels began a violent attempt to force irish to become independent from the united kingdom , which succeeded five years later
it actually broke out the next day , easter sunday monday , april 24 of that year
the use of easter sunday would materially affect the subject of the poem , best known for its phrase ' a terrible beauty is born '
he described yeats as ' a protestant hero in a predominantly catholic country
' he then told the taoiseach : ' you 've become a close friend and i admire you a great deal
' laughing : despite the gaffe , irish prime minister enda kenny laughed with mr biden mr biden also revealed that he had a stammer as a child
' my uncle , ed , a bachelor , used to sleep in the same room as my brother and i. i used to stutter very badly when i was a kid
but at night ed used to recite the poetry of yeats
and i would get up and recite in front of a mirror , and try to learn not to contort my face when i spoke and stuttered
' mr biden has a long list of previous gaffes â he once asked a wheelchair - bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge the crowd 's applause , and after being chosen as vice president he even suggested that hillary clinton would have been a better choice
most recently he was widely ridiculed for putting his hands on the shoulders of stephanie carter , wife of defense secretary ash carter , and whispering in her ear as her husband was sworn in
he also told the father of a teenage girl â utah republican senator hatch 's grandaughter emily â that he hoped he had a ' big fence ' as hatch was sworn in
five years ago , biden incorrectly suggested at a st patrick 's day reception that the mother of then irish prime minister brian cowen was dead , saying ' god rest her soul ' , before correcting himself to say ' god bless her soul '
at today 's washington event the taoiseach presented the vice president with a book of yeats ' poetry , but told him he should not open it for at least another 25 years , ' when you are old and grey and nodding by the fire
' he then invited mr biden to play a round of golf in northern ireland - the fifth time he has done so , with no success so far
mr enda kenny joked : ' the golf courses are still there
and they are in better condition than they have been for many years
so welcome home , finnegan
' mr biden replied that last year the taoiseach had tried to intercede for him with the president , telling him , ' you got ta let him go
you got ta let biden go
