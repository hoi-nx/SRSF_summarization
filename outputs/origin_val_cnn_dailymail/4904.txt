sturm , a senior economist at rand , said the much - hailed los angeles fast - food ban did little to reshape the retail food landscape in the targeted area the south los angeles fast - food ban did not decrease obesity in poor neighborhoods because residents found unhealthy food at restaurants in strip malls and convenience stores instead , a new study has found
in 2008 , a dietary ordinance targeted a 32 - square - mile area south of interstate 10 that struggles with high obesity rates and other health problems
the ban went into effect in south los angeles and restricted the opening or expansion of standalone fast - food restaurants
however , the law , believed to be the first effort of its kind by a major city to improve public health , did not ban new fast food restaurants in strip malls
this made it possible for unhealthy food to continue making its way into the low - income neighborhoods
sturm , a senior economist at rand and lead author of the study , said findings should not come as a surprise , as most food outlets in the area are small food stores or restaurants that have limited seating and were not affected by the policy
in the study , which was published in the social science and medicine journal , sturm found that in the targeted area , free - standing restaurants were rare to begin with and no new ones have opened since the ordinance took effect
these standalone fast - food restaurants are outnumbered by restaurants in strip malls and small food stores , such as convenience stores , which were not restricted by the ban , according to npr
rand researchers reviewed permits issued by the los angeles county department of public health , which inspects food outlets
larger fast - food chains opened 17 new outlets in strip shopping centers and food courts in south los angeles from 2008 to 2012
almost half of the new food permits were for convenience stores that sell soda and junk food
obesity rates in south los angeles grew by 12 per cent despite a much - hailed three - year ban on stand - alone fast - food restaurants , a new study has found findings showed that before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008 , 63 per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 per cent in other parts of the county
but three years on , instead of the law curbing weight gain , the opposite trend took force as obesity rates grew by 12 per cent in south los angeles
' the south los angeles fast food ban may have symbolic value , but it has had no measurable impact in improving diets or reducing obesity , ' said sturm
the study also revealed that obesity rates following the ban have been significantly larger in south los angeles compared to other parts of the city
in 2011 , 75 per cent of south los angeles residents reported being overweight or obese , while rates elsewhere only increased by one per cent
however , a positive development was a drop in soft drink consumption since 2007 , which also occurred across the city
' the one bright spot we found is that soft drink consumption dropped , but the decrease was similar in all areas across los angeles , ' said co-author of the study , aiko hattori of the university of north carolina , chapel hill
' unfortunately , the rates of overweight and obesity increased and they increased fastest in the area subject to the fast - food ban
' before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008 , 63 per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 per cent in other parts of the county standing outside a mcdonald 's in the leimert park neighborhood on wednesday , cox lamented the lack of sidewalk cafes - he was not a fan of the fast food ban barry popkin , a professor from university of north carolina , chapel hill said he was not surprised by sturm 's observation and that the ban was ' too trivial '
however , kelly brownell , a professor from duke university said the ban was not a trivial measure , and that setting limits could help prevent problems
he also said he was not surprised the ordinance was not effective
health experts said a single intervention would not reverse the obesity problem
people also have to exercise and make lifestyle changes , they said
' it 's not just about limiting unhealthy food , but increasing access to healthy food , ' alex ortega , a professor of public health at the university of california , los angeles , who had no role in the study
researchers compared obesity rates in south los angeles and other parts of the county using surveys that asked residents to report their weight and eating habits
supporters said the ordinance worked because it prevented chains from opening new restaurants at major intersections with their own drive - thru windows and parking lots
they acknowledged it will take some time to see health gains but noted that the area has seen farmers markets and community gardens in recent years
' we never said this ordinance was the silver bullet ' to solving the obesity problem , said gwen flynn of the community health councils
' as long as we can make sure people have more options , that 's the important thing
' thrower , who runs a burger joint sandwiched between fast - food chains , said he offers healthier fare such as vegetarian and turkey burgers sturm has said changing aspects of food environment can impact diets and obesity , particularly when considering food prices
after analyzing data from the u.s. and south africa , sturm learned in both cases that when healthier foods such as fruits and vegetables were cheaper , people at them more often as compared with unhealthy foods
city councilman bernard parks , who supported the zoning law , said he was hopeful that the area can attract more markets selling fresh food
the ordinance was opposed by the california restaurant association
spokeswoman janna haynes said the group had no comment on the rand study
standing outside a mcdonald 's in the leimert park neighborhood on wednesday , cox lamented the lack of sidewalk cafes
' i want to sit down and eat , but there 's no place to sit down and eat , ' said the retiree , who usually drives to another neighborhood to dine out
cox said he 's hopeful that a planned light rail line will attract a variety of new eateries
thrower , who runs a burger joint sandwiched between fast - food chains , said he offers healthier fare such as vegetarian and turkey burgers
' once people stop to eat here , they come back , ' said thrower , who opened simply delicious burgers last year .
