sao paulo , brazil demonstrators took to the streets across brazil on sunday , protesting corruption and demanding the impeachment of president dilma rousseff
her administration is struggling amid a weak economy and a massive corruption scandal involving the country 's state - run oil company
and i am tired of corruption
we are tired of corruption
it does n't matter which political party you are from , we are tired of being robbed , " a protester told cnn in sao paulo , where people packed the main paulista avenue
in rio de janeiro , they gathered along copacabana beach , while in the capital , brasilia , protesters marched on government headquarters
many demonstrators wore the country 's colors -- green , blue and yellow -- waved flags , and chanted : " out dilma rousseff
" amid complaints about the economy , protesters say they are incensed because brazil investigators are unraveling a huge money - laundering and bribery case centered around petrobras , the country 's national oil company
dozens of politicians , some in dilma rousseff 's party , are accused of accepting millions in payments
the president has not been implicated in the investigation , but she was the energy minister and chairwoman of petrobras during much of the time that the alleged corruption took place
why are protesters furious with brazil 's president ? sunday night dilma rousseff sent two of her ministers to address the nation at a televised press conference
the justice minister and the general secretary said that the government was listening and would announce changes in several days designed to combat corruption
the announcement did little to quiet the protests in some cities
many protesters banged pots and pans and honked car horns

he said , " brazil are tired of such corruption , lies and [ the ] bad economy
" before becoming the country 's first female president in 2011 , dilma rousseff , from the workers ' party , was chief of staff to former president lula da silva
she won re-election in october , in one of the tightest races in recent years , but has since seen her approval rate plummet along with the economy
brazil is headed into recession again this year , inflation is up and the currency is at a 12 - year low
dilma rousseff 's approval rating down to 23 % from 42 % at the end of 2014 , according to datafolha
the economy is expected to contract this year and the real has plummeted 23 % against the dollar
