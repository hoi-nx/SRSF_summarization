on sunday manchester united will travel to liverpool for their biggest match of their season
it will be a rip - roaring , full - bloodied battle which may well be settled by one moment of magic - an occasion made for those who shine on the biggest stages
and yet last year 's champions league man - of - the - match , a man who also played at the world cup in brazil , may well struggle to make louis van gaal 's starting line - up
angel di maria has had a difficult start to life in a manchester united shirt since arriving from madrid di maria ( second right ) has suffered a fernando torres - eque loss of form that nobody saw coming based on ability , angel di maria should be a shoo - in
his explosive pace and unnerving eye for a killer pass would seem to be the perfect fit for a 90 minutes in which manchester united may well spend long periods on the back foot , looking to counter
but the skills that made ed woodward write madrid a cheque for the best part of Â£ 60m have rarely been displayed after di maria suffered a fernando torres-esque loss of form that nobody saw coming
the promise of an explosive partnership down the left with fellow new boy luke shaw had manchester united fans drooling
louis van gaal has stuck by his man so far , but he has a big decision to make ahead of sunday 's match manchester united travel to liverpool , and di maria may not be in the starting line - up at anfield di maria , however , did not want to leave madrid and that is where the problems began
mancunian winters , as roy keane pointed out , can be hard to endure for those used to sunnier climes
six hours of grey light a day and continual rain can hammer at the mindset of those not used to it
di maria also struggled to adapt to louis van gaal 's tactical switches
he is not alone in that , and has rarely been given licence to roam up and down the left wing
the problems for di maria began when he left madrid - he was happy there and did not want to leave di maria was sent off in manchester united 's fa cup clash with arsenal earlier in march van gaal pointed out that most players do not find their feet until their second season - but try telling that to chelsea fans who have seen diego costa fit seemlessly into jose mourinho 's premier league leaders
as if the above were enough to contend with , then came the break - in
sat at home in a foreign country watching tv with your wife and young daughter when suddenly a quiet night in is interrupted by the terrifying sound of raiders armed with scaffolding poles trying to smash their way into your isolated house
juan mata started for manchester united in di maria 's absence against tottenham and impressed throughout van gaal now has to decide whether to stick or twist - juan mata ( centre ) or di maria ( right ) on sunday ? yes , the thugs were disturbed by the alarm system and made their getaway
but the trauma of that experience must remain
there may have been , and may still be , recurring nightmares
in a state of panic , the di marias fled to a city centre hotel with a security team
the family now live high above the ground at a separate city centre apartment
it is safe and it is luxurious but it may well feel like a prison and is not the ideal environment in which to raise a young child
van gaal , a family man , knows this
he has given di maria compassionate leave and stood by his man after the latest low , a red card for grabbing referee michael oliver 's shirt in the fa cup defeat to arsenal
di maria has shown flashes of his potential , scoring four goals in manchester united colours since his arrival in august di maria ( right ) was all smiles on international duty in september , but his form has been poor for manchester united in the subsequent victory over tottenham , for which di maria was suspended , manchester united delivered their best 45 minutes of the season
replacement juan mata linked well with ander herrera as van gaal 's side displayed a synchronicity rarely seen this season
the dutchman now has to decide whether to stick or twist
juan mata , for all his qualities , lacks pace
di maria is a better player but can he finally deliver when manchester united need him most ? with Â£ 60m already spent it is a gamble worth taking .
