guidetti has seemingly distanced himself from a longer stay at celtic by telling dutch media he wants to return to feyenoord ' perhaps as soon as possible '
the swede scored 20 goals when on loan in rotterdam in the 2011 - 12 season and remains hugely popular with feyenoord fans

guidetti has since scored twice in his last four appearances - raising his tally to 13 overall - but it remains to be seen whether celtic will put forward a lucrative contract offer to try to persuade him to stay
french giants marseille and southampton have also been linked with interest in the striker

the parkhead boss has already spoken with chief executive peter about the possibility of a new contract for the keeper , who signed a two - year deal when he joined the club last summer

' he 's a great goalkeeper and a man we want to keep at the club , ' insisted the norwegian
' we will do everything to keep him here
i understand why other clubs are looking at him because he 's had a fantastic season
myself and peter have already talked about this
it 's also about what gordon wants and hopefully he wants to stay here and be with celtic
' gordon 's acquisition on a free transfer was one of the best bargains of recent time in scottish football
asked what value he would now place on the ex-hearts and sunderland man , deila replied : ' i ca n't sell him
i do n't want to
i want him here for the rest of his career
' celtic boss deila wants gordon ( above ) to remain at parkhead for the remainder of his career on the prospect of gordon signing up for life on the chelsea bench after coming through two years of injury anguish and rekindling his career at celtic , deila said : ' it would be a shame but i do n't think he wants to do that â he wants to play football until the end of his career
' it 's a rumour and we will see what 's in it
there will be clubs interested if he wants to go , but we want to keep him
' he 's performed great and without him we would n't have gone through the group stage ( in the europa league )
