jessica could n't even stand up when she put on her roller skates for the first time
but just three months after her first skating lesson , the determined 24 - year - old from mackay in queensland was performing high - intensity tricks in cirque shows across the world with her real - life partner
the former dancer met her mexico boyfriend jeronimo , 40 , when they were both working as entertainment staff on a norwegian cruise ship in 2010
' we basically started to see each other and after that one thing led to another , but we had that lovely big ocean between us , ' jessica told daily mail australia
while they were luckily based on the same cruise ship several times together , they repeatedly had to go their separate ways with different contracts
' he was in the cirque show and i was working for nickelodeon - they were two completely different things
the 24 - year - old from mackay in queensland met her mexico boyfriend when they were both working as entertainment staff on a norwegian cruise ship in 2010 jessica had never even skated before when the couple decided to start their new routine - and three months later they were performing high intensity tricks on stage ' it started to become a lot trickier
i went to mexico to see him because i had n't seen him in six months and we decided we did n't like being apart
' the couple were thinking of unique routines they could perform as a duo so they could tour together when jeronimo suggested roller skating
' i 'd never skated before - he bought me knee pads , a helmet , wrist guards
he took me to the park and taught me
he knew how to stand on skates but i did n't , ' she said
' the first step was me trying to move on the skates , but then we progressed to spinning and aerials
the couple were thinking of unique routines they could perform as a duo so they could tour together when jeronimo suggested roller skating the couple , who met on the cruise ship , decided to create an act together when the strain of not seeing each other for six months at a time became too much it took three months for jessica , 24 , and jeronimo , 40 , to create a routine they could perform together and learnt new tricks by watching youtube videos ' when we were putting it together it was trial and error
we did n't have a trainer so we basically learnt from youtube
' jessica and jeronimo put their act together within three months and landed their first performance contract soon after
the couple , who have been together for five years , now travel the world together performing as a roller duo and they are currently touring australia with le noir - a circque show with a dark twist
' it 's been amazing getting to travel the world
we started over in germany on the cruise ship , then we went to ( places like ) london
we 've been to the us and china - this is our second tour in australia
' the couple , who have been together for five years , now travel the world performing the aerial roller skating act they have a strict cardio and endurance training regime they stick to - only having one day off a week to do nothing and eat what they like while the couple spend their time travelling across the world , they do have a house together in mexico where they spend most of their downtime the couple have an intense and strict exercise regime to stay in shape for their aerial skating routine
' this particular act is extreme cardio ... i spend most time in the air , ' jessica said
' we do a lot of cardio and endurance training to keep in shape
we give ourselves one day off to do nothing and eat what we want
' before shows we will practice the tricks or maybe work on a new trick
' le noir - the dark side of cirque is currently touring across australia until april 18
jessica and jeronimo , who mostly spend their free time at their house in mexico , practice their high intensity tricks everyday before a show the couple have now been together for almost five years after first meeting on the cruise ship in 2010
