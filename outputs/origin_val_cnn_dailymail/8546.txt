i want to campaign for the people , ' she said at a news conference in the fells point neighborhood of baltimore

in a 2014 interview , mikulski said her approach as chair of the senate panel was ' to focus with civility and courtesy
do n't do surprises or stunts and negotiate directly and not through the press
' in her state , she has been fiercely protective of the environment , especially chesapeake bay issues
mitch mcconnell leader mitch mcconnell described mikulski at the time as forceful and results - oriented
' i think she 's terrific , ' he said
mikulski had been seen as more engaging and approachable than her predecessors as appropriations chairman , the late sens. robert c. byrd of west virginia and daniel inouye , hawaii , both democratic
she had spent decades honing relationships with members of both parties , learning their needs and end goals
after a short tenure as chairman , she now is the top democrat on the panel after republicans captured control of the senate in last november 's elections

mikulski has also been an active advocate of equal pay for women
the maryland senator sponsored legislation last year aimed at tightening a 1963 law that made it illegal to pay women less than men for comparable jobs because of their gender
but senate republicans blocked the bill in an april 2014 floor showdown
' when i hear all these phony reasons , some are mean and some are meaningless , i do get emotional , ' mikulski said of arguments against the legislation
