it âs one of the most famous scenes from any movie , let alone jurassic park : two raptors enter the kitchen , stalking two children - their human prey
but as the raptors make their screeches and calls , you might be surprised to know these sounds actually come from tortoises having sex
it turns out that many of the dinosaur sounds in the hit 1993 film were made by recording modern animals - including , bizarrely , tortoises mating
other dinosaur sounds were ' voiced ' by a variety of animals
these include horses , donkeys , cattle and a dog for the tyrannosaurus rex in an interview for sf gate , sound designer for the movie rydstrom confirmed the odd choice of sound effect
in august last year , researchers trained four red - footed tortoises to use a touchscreen in return for strawberries and other treats
the animals were able to identify between red triangles and blue dots on the display , and even learnt which side of the screen to press
the animals also were able to transfer this knowledge to a real - life , offline experiment
professor anna wilkinson from the university of lincoln led the study , alongside researchers from the university of vienna
â yes , it âs a mating tortoise , â when asked about the sounds they make
specifically , he says the â bark â when one velociraptor first comes in the kitchen was created by recording a tortoise successfully mate with another at marine world
â it âs riding on the back of the female tortoise
so it âs climbing up her shell basically , and then it falls off
it âs a little sexual , â he said
this confirms what was reported by vulture back in 2013 , that tortoise sounds were behind the noise of the raptors
but this was nât the only bizarre animal noise used in the movie ; it turns out horses , donkeys and even cattle were used for some of the other dinosaur calls
â the brachiosaur âs singing is one of my favourite sounds in the movie because it âs beautiful , but like all good sound design it 's made from a non-beautiful source , which is donkeys , â mr rydstrom told vulture
in an interview for sf gate , sound designer for the movie rydstrom confirmed the odd choice of sound effect
â yes , it âs a mating tortoise , â when asked about the sounds they make
shown is a stock image of seychelles giant tortoises ( dipsochelys hololissa ) mating and even the tyrannosaurus rex got the animal treatment , with mr rydstrom âs own pet jack russell terrier being used to voice the huge dinosaur
the fourth jurrassic park film - called jurassic world and starring chris pratt - is scheduled to be released on 12 june 2015
and a trailer confirmed velociraptors would be making a return in the film - but whether they will similarly be voiced by mating tortoises you âll have to wait and see whether similar sound effects have been used
