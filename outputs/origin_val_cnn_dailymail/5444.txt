a million - dollar , five bedroom mansion has been successfully transplanted 14 miles from fargo to horace in north dakota moving the 4,500 - square - foot , 218 - tonne home required four moving companies , a 23 - axel truck , a slew of permits and help from dozens of people including police officers and electricians ' it 's quite the project to just get it moved , ' new owner scott adelman told kvly
he said the most challenging part of the process has been securing all the permits required , especially because he wanted to take the property across the interstate bridge
that required the department of transportation as well as the city of fargo , stanley township , and horace
he also had to coordinate with other contractors including sign companies , street light companies and power companies
it took two days to move the house as it crawled along the interstate at speeds of about 5 mph
now that it has reached its destination , scott adelman has a crew of 15 people ready to rebuild the property so he can have it back on the market in just five weeks
' we will have to put the foundation underneath it and piece it back together , ' said scott adelman
' it 's a project , but the majority of the house obviously , stays intact
' he estimates that it will take a week for the concrete to set and then the house will be set on top
then the plumbing and electric will next to set up before a new family can move in
scott adelman , who owns a company that specializes in relocating and ' recycling ' homes , intends to list the property at around $ 700,000
