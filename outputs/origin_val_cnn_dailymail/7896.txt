homeowners with properties worth up to Â£ 1million will be able to pass them on to their children tax - free under plans drawn up by osborne , it was claimed last night
the chancellor âs proposal is expected to become a key part of the tory manifesto , but will not be included in tomorrow âs budget after it was blocked by the lib dems
plans to raise the inheritance threshold to Â£ 1million were included in the party âs manifesto at the last election , but were vetoed as part of the coalition deal in 2010
a file photo of a road in wandsworth , south - west london , is pictured according to treasury papers leaked to the guardian , the proposed measures would also reduce the inheritance tax bill on properties worth up to Â£ 2million by Â£ 140,000
the tax break , which would mean just over 20,000 fewer estates would annually have any inheritance liability , is expected to cost nearly Â£ 1billion
in the papers , the officials note that the move â will generally be very popular with the public and in the media
it will allow you to say you are exempting those with modest homes from inheritance tax ( with up to Â£ 1million of assets ) exempted in certain circumstances
â the document , prepared for treasury financial secretary david gauke , added : â you have indicated a desire to reduce the burden of inheritance tax
â having considered the cost of a substantial increase in the existing nil rate band , you and the chancellor have indicated you would like instead to introduce a more targeted measure to allow the family home to be passed onto the children of deceased without it leading to an inheritance tax liability
â this reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house particularly in london and the south east paying inheritance tax
â chancellor : osborne âs proposal is expected to become a key part of the tory manifesto , but will not be included in tomorrow âs budget after it was blocked by the lib dems ( file picture of mr osborne in 2014 ) a senior tory source blamed the leak of â old advice â on the lib dems , adding : â they are desperate
there is nothing in the budget on inheritance tax , which we have said repeatedly is an election issue
â another senior conservative added : â usually at this time we get leaks of what âs in the budget
this is a leak of what âs not in the budget
â it is thought that the lib dems leaked the papers ahead of the budget in a bid to paint to tories as the party of the rich
the number of people who own a home worth more than Â£ 1million has risen dramatically , up 50 per cent since before the financial crash
a survey by property website zoopla last year predicted that there would be 500,000 people owning a seven - figure property by 2015
while most are in london , there have been big rises in the south east and the south west , with smaller increases in wales and yorkshire .
