it was always going to take an extraordinary performance from a very talented swimmer to beat michael phelps at his favorite event in an olympic final
for more than a decade , the great american had vanquished all comers in the 200 meters butterfly on both the world and olympic stage , but then along came chad le clos
when the south african chased down phelps in the final 50 meters of the race to snatch a dramatic fingertip victory by 0.05 seconds he created one of the defining moments of the london olympics
as a 12 - year - old , le clos had gazed into his television set at home in durban watching in awe as phelps , widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all - time , won six olympic gold medals at athens in 2004
so perhaps it 's not surprising that lining up alongside his hero in an olympic final eight years later took on a slightly surreal air
" my dream was always to swim like michael phelps so when i raced against him in the final it was actually a crazy feeling , " le chad le clos tells cnn 's human to hero series
" when i touched at 150 ( meters ) i think i was 1.5 meters behind him
when i turned i actually looked at him underwater and i thought i was him -- i know it sounds absolutely crazy , but i saw myself as him going past someone else
" " i remembered how he used to come off the last turn and , you know , smoke everyone ... i thought , he 's done this for so many years and i remembered that when i was swimming
i do n't know what it was but it was magical
" the mind - altering moment quickly morphed into a life - changing experience for the then 20 - year - old who edged out phelps in the final stroke
" it was such a huge moment for south african
obviously , to represent your country is a huge honor but to beat michael phelps at the london olympics was amazing , " he says
" as a young kid everyone wants to be like their heroes but you do n't actually think one day that you 're going to beat them
" the remarkable victory was memorable not just for le le clos ' reactions -- which went from joy to disbelief immediately after the race -- but for those of his father bert , whose elated response and subsequent tv interview have become an enduring part of the swimmer 's story
the excitable tribute to his " down - to - earth , beautiful boy , " which included repeated mentions of the word " unbelievable , " touched the hearts of viewers and turned le clos senior into something of a household name himself
" i never knew my father was such a celebrity until like five , six days after the commonwealth games -- i was so wrapped up in ( my own ) bubble , " le chad le clos explains
" we were walking down the street and everyone was taking photos of me , but i could n't find my dad , and i saw him and there were a line of people taking photos of him and i was like : ' dad ! you are stealing my thunder here
c'mon ! ' it was incredible
" everywhere he goes he 's that famous dad and that 's amazing because he really is
nothing was put on for the cameras -- that 's how he is back home
to my other brothers and sister he 's a great dad
" success in the pool has been rich reward for bert , who steered the chad towards swimming when a football career looked more likely
" my parents were hugely influential in helping me make decisions throughout my life , especially my sporting career , " he says
" when i was young i played football until i was about 13 or 14 years old -- i played for the state team ( natal )
i had to make a decision and my dad realized that i was a better swimmer , even though my family had a football background
" ninety - nine percent of fathers would have told their son to play football ... i still thank him every day for helping me make that decision
" there is now another le le clos in the pool -- teenager jordan is hoping to follow in his brother 's large footsteps , having already competed at south african 's national championships
" you know , 2020 is very important to me , " says chad
" hopefully my brother can make the london olympics then and swim in the same relay team
" originally a breaststroker , le clos switched to butterfly after he tore both his abductor muscles ( in the groin ) in 2008 when he was 16 years old
" butterfly movement is really different
it 's unlike freestyle or other strokes where it 's very , very technical
i compare it to dancing -- i 'm a terrible dancer ! -- it 's about getting your hips right , your kick is very important
i just really enjoy it
it 's a fast stroke , so i guess the injury was a blessing in disguise for me
" while swimming 's toughest stroke remains his favored discipline , le clos has also struck gold in the individual 200m freestyle -- at the short - course world championships in doha last year -- and the 400m medley ( butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke and freestyle ) at the 2010 commonwealth games in delhi
but it is butterfly where he has dominated in recent years
after pipping phelps in the 200m in london , le clos had to settle for silver behind the american in the 100m , but he has n't missed a stroke since
a 100m and 200m double at the 2013 world championships in barcelona was followed by gold at the commonwealth games in glasgow , scotland last august
he capped a brilliant 2014 in december with three more titles ( 50m , 100m and 200m ) at the short - course worlds in doha before being crowned fina world male swimmer of the year -- an award he is incredibly proud of
" the olympic gold will always be there and it will be the most outstanding moment of my life , but to win the 2014 swimmer of the year award was up there
not many people have won the ballon d'or of swimming , so it was a very special moment for me
" for le chad le clos , who turns 23 in april , the best is almost certainly yet to come with another london olympics fast approaching
he concedes that it will be " very , very difficult " to get anywhere near phelps ' record haul of 18 olympic gold medals ( and 22 overall ) , but he may get the chance to race him one more time
phelps , who announced his retirement following the 2012 london games , made a shock return to the pool last year although things have n't exactly gone to plan -- the " baltimore bullet " is serving a six - month ban imposed by usa swimming after he was arrested for drink - driving last september
the ban has put his planned appearance at this year 's fina world championships in doubt , but phelps is still hopeful of qualifying for his fifth london olympics in 2016
" i really , really hope that he and his team decide to swim in rio , i really believe it will be great , " le chad le clos told reuters last year
" it 's added motivation for me ... with michael phelps back , it 's really sparked my fire , so to speak
i do n't think he will be worse in rio , i think he 'll be back where he wants to be
he 's a champion in all respects but i believe i can beat him again
" if he can , then le le clos will have taken a giant step towards his ultimate aim of swimming and sporting immortality
" i want to cement myself in the sport as one of the greats
in swimming terms , i want people to remember chad le clos -- the guy that not only beat michael phelps , but who is the best fast swimmer of all time , " he says
" in south african we have a rich history of great champions -- rugby players , cricket players , a lot of great golfers -- so i 'm among really tough competition , but i believe that after 2016 and 2020 i can hopefully be the greatest
