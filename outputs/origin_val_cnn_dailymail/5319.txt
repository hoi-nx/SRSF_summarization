there is evidence to prove that isis is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon in its battle against peshmerga forces in iraqi , kurdish authorities have claimed
it says peshmerga forces discovered ' 20 gas canisters ' loaded on the back of a truck involved in a suicide bomb attack in iraqi on january 23
the kurdistan region security council says the chemical attack took place on a road between iraqi 's second largest city of mosul and the syrian border
it was here that peshmerga fighters were desperately trying to seize the vital supply line used by the militants when they found the alleged weapons
biological warfare : kurdish authorities claim the 20 gas canisters found on board a truck involved in a suicide bomb attack in iraqi ( pictured ) is further proof of isis using chlorine as a chemical weapon revelation : the canisters ( pictured ) were found on board the truck which exploded into a cloud of yellow gas after peshmerga forces opened fire on it explosion : the resulting gas cloud ( pictured ) left nearby troops feeling nauseous and many had to be treated for vomiting , dizziness and general weakness video provided by the council revealed a truck storming down the road with white smoke pouring out of it as peshmerga soldiers opened shot at it
the footage later showed a white , billowing cloud emerging from the truck as it exploded and its remnants scattered across the area
a kurdish official said dozens of peshmerga fighters were treated for ' dizziness , nausea , vomiting and general weakness ' after the attack
traces of chlorine were discovered after samples of clothing and soil from the site were analysed , the kurdish claim
there have been several previous allegations that islamic state terrorists have already used weaponised chlorine
in october , iraqi officials claimed isis could have used chlorine - filled cylinders during clashes in the towns of balad and duluiya
and reports from the syrian border - town of kobani suggested the extremist group added chlorine to an arsenal that already included heavy weapons and tanks looted from captured military bases
the government said in a statement : ' the fact isis relies on such tactics demonstrates it has lost the initiative and is resorting to desperate measure
evidence : analysis of clothing and soil samples from the scene revealed traces of chlorine , kurdish authorities claim dangerous : chlorine is hazardous chemical that chokes victims and can long exposure to it can result in death chlorine was first used as a chemical weapon at ypres , belgium during the first world war to disastrous effect at a time when gas masks were not widely available
jennifer cole , senior research fellow at defence think - tank royal united services institute , told mailonline that although chlorine can be lethal , it does appear that it 's being used to spread fear by isis
she said : ' chlorine is easily available from a number of industrial sources and is very hazardous â causing breathing difficulties in particular and in extreme cases prolonged exposure can kill
' used in roadside bombs such as this , in the open air , it disperses reasonably quickly and so appears to be intended to cause panic rather than serious harm
' although it has many public and industrial uses , it chokes victims to death when used as a weapon
during the syrian civil war , a chlorine gas attack on the outskirts of damascus in 2013 killed hundreds and nearly inspired the us to launch airstrikes against the government the us and the west accused president bashar al-assad 's regime for the attack , while damascus blamed the rebels
even al-qaeda in iraqi - the militant group that eventually became isis - used chlorine gas in a suicide attack in may 2007
insurgents drove tankers into three cities in anbar province , killing two police officers and forcing over 300 iraqi civilians and six us troops to seek treatment for gas exposure .
