kitesurfers are attached to a harness to balance their weight against the kite - but this is not attached to the board
kite surfing rigs have a ' chicken loop ' safety system with a quick release handle
this can be pulled by the user to de-power their sail if they get into difficulties but does not completely detach them
a secondary system allows the kite and its rigging to be detached completely from the user 's harness
