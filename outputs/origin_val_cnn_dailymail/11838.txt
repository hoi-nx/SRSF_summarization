louis van gaal has insisted the main priority for united this season must be to qualify for the champions league despite monday night 's fa cup quarter - final against arsenal offering their best chance of a trophy this season
van gaal is under strict orders from his bosses to restore united to european football 's elite after last season 's seventh - place finish under david moyes saw them miss out
united have n't won the fa cup since 2004 and landed any silverware since sir alex ferugson left but the dutchman says the competition must still be treated as a welcome bonus rather than the primary objective of the campaign
louis van gaal feels it is more important that manchester uited get back into europe than win the fa cup van gaal agrees with arsenal manager arsene wenger that a top four finish is akin to winning a trophy ashley young scored a late winner as united beat newcastle in the premier league on wednesday ' i always want to get the goals what we have set
and the goals we have set is the top four , ' said louis van gaal
' a title is fantastic
when you win the fa cup you are not in the champions league which is important for the club , but you have won a title
so for the players it is fantastic , for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the champions league
' arsenal manager arsene wenger has said that finishing in the top four was effectively winning a trophy and van gaal agrees
' yes , i think that he is right
i think that arsene wenger is saying always the right things
i think that for a club the champions league is the highest level and that 's why he is saying that
' to finish in the first four is a fantastic result , i think
and for us , united , more i think
' van gaal is still expected to put a strong team out against arsenal

the united boss , who has had to endure heavy criticism for the team 's style of play despite a run of only two defeats in 22 matches , believes the result of the cup tie could also have a pyschological effect on the run - in for the all - important top four
' every match you play has an influence in the next match
so we are in a ' rat race ' in the premier league and the club who wins the fa cup match has a very good feeling for the next matches , ' he said
' it could be damaging for the team that loses , but you can also react
' van gaal has been tetchy mood in the build - up to monday night 's game , feeling he has been misrepresented over claims that he has the best team in the premier league , lacks a 20 - goal - a - season striker and has a bad relationship with assistant ryan giggs , who sat stony - faced when united scored their last - minute winner at newcastle on wednesday night
van gaal ( right ) adamantly rejected talk of a rift with his assistant ryan giggs after the newcastle game angel di maria has been substituted early in united 's last two games due to poor performances midfielder carrick ( left ) could be set to start his first game for united since january 23 among the problems louis van gaal has to face is the poor form of Â£ 60million record signing angel di maria who has been substituted early in united 's last two games and the lack of goals from falcao whose loan spell is unlikely to be renewed at the end of the season without a dramatic change in fortunes
the crowd reaction to the united manager on monday will be interesting to see
so far , he has received little warmth from the fans whose cries of ' attack , attack , attack ' are a sign of frustration against louis van gaal 's possession - based game
one piece of good news is that carrick may be able to start his first game since january 23 following a muscle rapture
united 's best results this season have come when carrick has played .
