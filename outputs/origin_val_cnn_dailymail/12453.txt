a teenage australian jihadist suspected of having carried out an isis suicide attack developed a hatred for the west over the afghanistan and iraq wars , before settling on radical islam as a vehicle for " violent global revolution , " according to his purported blog
bilardi , an 18 - year - old student from melbourne , appears to have documented his path to radicalization and his experiences in isis - held territory in a blog , titled " from the eyes of a mujahir : an australian mujahir in the land of the khilafah
" the blog has been deleted , but a cached version remains available online
cnn could not independently verify the blog 's authenticity , but the biographical details detailed on the blog match bilardi 's
one of the final posts on the blog , which is credited to " abu abdullah al-australi , " purports to have been posted on january 13 , as the author was " preparing to sacrifice my life for islam in ramadi
" the australian government said wednesday it was working to confirm reports that bilardi had carried out a suicide attack on behalf of isis , after the terror group claimed an " abu abdullah al-australi " had been killed in a car bombing during an offensive in the city of ramadi
the claims were made along with a picture that appeared to be of bilardi , referred to as " abu abdullah al-australi , " apparently prior to carrying out the mission
the blogger describes having a " very comfortable " upbringing as the youngest of six in the melbourne suburbs , where he was raised an atheist , excelled in his studies and " dreamed of becoming a political journalist
" he describes how his older siblings educated him on various subjects , and how his brother 's instruction on international politics held a special resonance for him , particularly after the september 11 attacks
" being just five years old at the time of the attacks ... my knowledge of the operation was basically non-existent
despite this , i was immediately drawn to the topics of al qaeda and ' islamic terrorism ' , " he wrote
" it was from here that my research into al qaeda ... and groups with similar ideologies worldwide began
i spent every day researching online and reading the books i had begun collecting
" the blogger writes that it was his reading on the wars in afghanistan and iraq , and abuses committed by occupying forces , " that gave birth to my disdain for the united states and its allies , including australian
it was also the start of my respect for the mujahideen that would only grow to develop into a love of islam and ultimately bring me here to the islamic state
" eventually , he wrote , he came to view democracy as " nothing but a system of lies and deception , " one which " focuses heavily on providing the people with so - called freedom " but " throws celebrities and false reality into the spotlight to distract the people from what is really going on in the world
" the wars " signaled the beginning of my complete hatred and opposition to the entire system australian and the majority of the world was based upon , " he wrote
" it was also the moment i realised that violent global revolution was necessary to eliminate this system of governance and that ... i would likely be killed in this struggle
" while the blogger said he had come to the conclusion that democracy was " something that can only and must be destroyed by violent revolution , " he wrote , he " was never quite sure " what should replace it
" socialism ? communism ? ? nazism ? ? ? " he wrote
eventually , as his interest in jihadist groups deepened at about the time of the arab spring , he settled on islam
" it was islam that for me stood out as easy to understand and was shockingly consistent with established historical and scientific facts , " he wrote
following a stretch in which he turned his back on his growing extremist beliefs , which he described as " one of the most shameful periods of my life , " the blogger wrote that he began to try to find a contact to help him join jabhat al-nusra or ahrar al-sham , two islamist groups fighting in syrian
while he had initially rejected isis after " falling for the many lies being spread against them , " he wrote that he began speaking to their members online , and , after witnessing their military successes , developed a desire to join the group
eventually , he managed to find a contact who promised to get him into isis territory
worried that his plot to leave australian might be foiled by authorities , the blogger wrote that he developed his " plan b , " collecting materials for what he envisaged as a " string of bombings across melbourne , targeting foreign consulates and political / military targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centers and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the kuffar
" victoria police confirmed wednesday that chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device had been found in a search of his family 's home in the melbourne suburb of craigieburn
the blogger wrote that he abandoned his plans for an attack in melbourne after realizing that buying bomb - making chemicals could draw the attention of authorities and ruin his bid to join isis
he did not reveal how he had been able to enter isis territory , but said that on entering the isis - held syrian city of jarablus , he " felt a joy i had never experienced before
" in another blog post , entitled " being white in the islamic state : the abolition of racism " he wrote approvingly that the " islamic state has been successful in eliminating racism and in building the world 's only true multi-ethnic state
" he said he signed up for a " martyrdom operation , " or suicide attack , in baiji , iraq , which failed , before registering to undertake another in ramadi , where he was " waiting for my turn to stand before allah
" jones , an expert on radicalization at the australian national university , said that bilardi " blew away the profile of what most people think of when they think of people who are going to support the islamic state
" white and middle class , reportedly bullied at school and vulnerable following the loss of his mother to cancer , he more easily fit the profile of a school shooter than an islam terrorist , he said
" what it does show us is that there are a whole range of profiles , " he said
bilardi 's aunt has linked the teen 's troubles to the loss of his mother , while a former classmate at melbourne 's craigieburn secondary college described him as shy
jones said bilardi 's case was also notable in that he did not appear to have been " groomed " by terror recruiters -- indeed , he wrote of initially struggling to make contacts among islam extremists -- and had radicalized himself through his own readings
" the pm here said bilardi was brainwashed -- i do n't think he was brainwashed
he was very calculated in what he did and documented it quite clearly , " said jones
in one of the blog posts , the blogger says that the warm welcome he and other foreign fighters had received in the islamic state disproved " the australian government 's laughable claim that we are used as ' cannon fodder '
" but jones said his bilardi 's ultimate fate in a suicide mission was typical for foreign fighters in his position
he believed that in knowingly signing up for this fate , on two separate occasions , bilardi had been seeking the kind of recognition and achievement that , as a vulnerable teen , he had been denied at home
" he wanted that ' religious prize ' , " he said
