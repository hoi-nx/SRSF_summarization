wales head coach gatland says that prop samson lee 's world cup prospects are ' 50 - 50 ' after he was injured during last saturday 's six nations victory over ireland
gatland has confirmed that samson lee , who was carried off just 14 minutes into the ireland game , suffered a full rupture of his achilles
ospreys prop aaron jarvis will replace him for next saturday 's six nations appointment with italy in rome , with loosehead rob evans taking over from gethin jenkins , who has a hamstring problem
gatland said : ' we were hoping he ( samson lee ) was going to have surgery on monday , but there was too much swelling , and it has been put back a week
wales will be missing props gethin jenkins and samson lee when they take on italy in rome on saturday ' he is a 50 - 50 chance for the world cup , but we are confident he has enough time to get back and be available for the world cup
' if things go well , he will not be far away
' rob evans and aaron jarvis will line up against italy , while there are call - ups on the bench for hooker ken owens , props rhys gill and scott andrews and scrum - half gareth davies , with phillips missing out
owens features among the substitutes instead of gloucester hooker richard hibbard , who had been following return - to - play protocols after taking a blow to his head during the ireland game
saracens forward gill , meanwhile , gains a match - day place after only joining the squad for training on monday , while gareth davies - a livewire operator and consistent try - scorer for the scarlets - gets his chance instead of the hugely - experienced phillips
wales dash ireland 's grand slam hopes - highlights rob evans of scarlets ( right ) replaces gethin jenkins in the squad that travels to the stadio olimpico on saturday in terms of the starting line - up , it will be rob evans ' full wales debut after he went on as a replacement for gethin jenkins at half - time last saturday , with aaron jarvis continuing instead of samson lee
wales will head to the stadio olimpico lying third in the six nations table behind england and ireland on points difference
a comprehensive victory over italy , though , would turn up the heat on their title rivals , with ireland tackling scotland at murrayfield next saturday , followed by england hosting france at twickenham
ospreys prop aaron jarvis has also been called up as a replacement as wales look to win the six nations gatland added : ' it was great to get the result we wanted in front of our home supporters last weekend and to give us a chance going into the last round of action
' obviously , it 's disappointing for gethin jenkins and samson lee , but rob evans and aaron jarvis stepped up well last weekend and we expect the same on saturday
' the challenge to us is to go to italy and win , and try to win by a significant margin , but we know that 's an extremely tough ask and the first job will be to simply get the result
gethin jenkins ( right ) joins wales team - mate aaron jarvis in tackling ireland 's jamie heaslip on saturday ' italy build their confidence around the scrum and lineout drive , and that is an area we are going to have to compete strongly in at the start of the match
' wales have won five of their previous seven six nations visits to rome , highlighted by a 38 - 8 victory in 2005
and they are going to need something similar - if not better - if they are to realistically have a chance of securing their third six nations title in four years .
