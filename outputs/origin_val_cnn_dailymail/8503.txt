starbucks is selling a limited edition coffee blend that is so rare it will only be available in stores for one week
the nicaragua laurina ' reserve ' is currently available in just 20 select starbucks stores in the united states , all of which have been flooded with requests from coffee lovers eager to get hold of the rare bean - which is being sold for $ 16 per half pound , more than double the amount of many of starbucks ' other more traditional offerings
despite the coffee 's hefty price tag , many of the stores in which the nicaragua blend was being sold have already run out of stock , less than 24 hours after the beans became available to the public

according to starbucks - focused blogger starbucks melody , the popular coffee company was only able to obtain 17 bags of the unique coffee bean from the farmer , which totals just 750lbs after the beans have been roasted
' it âs considered a â micro lot â which is a smaller yield of coffee than a â small lot â coffee , usually found at starbucks reserve locations , ' melody explains on her website
the coffee - loving blogger also offered up her thoughts on the flavor of the unique bean , noting : ' the nicaragua laurina is a beautiful medium body coffee with lots almond - y sweetness and some sweet lemon notes
' hand - scooped : according to coffee - based blog starbucks melody , starbucks was only able to obtain 17 bags of the rare coffee bean sweet treat : starbucks blogger melody added that the coffee has lots of ' almond - y sweetness ' to it she added : ' the nicaragua laurina comes from a coffee tree with a smaller shrub and leaves , which produces a bean that is small , slender , and looks a bit like grains of rice
' according to melody 's website , the coffee , which was roasted at the starbucks reserve roastery on march 10 , was sent out to each of the 20 starbucks stores that were chosen to stock it on their shelves either via fed-ex , for those locations outside of seattle , or hand - delivered by car to those venues based in starbucks ' hometown
it is not the first time that starbucks has offered such a rare - and expensive - coffee variety to its most dedicated fans
in november 2012 , the coffee company sold a limited supply of costa rica finca palmilera beans , which retailed at an impressive $ 40 for just half a pound of beans .
