two swimmers who had gotten caught in the riptide at a california beach while their small children watched from shore found aid arriving in the form of a helpful bernese mountain dog
it was late thursday afternoon at a beach in ventura when three - year - old nico raced into the water after a woman who had become trapped by the current began calling for help
the dog 's owner , clarke , himself a former lifeguard , told ktla about watching as nico paddled out to the struggling woman
' i just said , " grab him anywhere you can
" ' the woman grabbed onto nico 's chest and held her boogie board with the other hand , allowing nico to guide her to shore
the woman 's husband had tried to swim the 100 yards out to his wife , but he had also become taken by the current and could n't reach her
' i know how treacherous it is out here and what a false sense of security it is , ' said clarke 's wife vivian
' to be not that far off shore and just get caught out and nobody around to help you
' it was only a few months ago the clarkes had adopted nico , who was now paying it forward by rescuing the couple caught in the water
grateful : the couple joined their children back on the beach , grateful to nico for coming to their rescue while in the water amazed : clarke , nico 's owner and a former lifeguard , said he had never seen his newly adopted dog perform a feat like the one he saw on the beach warning : signs warn swimmers at the ventura beach not to swim into the water , as the riptide can pull beachgoers out to see ' the woman and the gentleman they were just exhausted , ' said clarke about the unidentified couple
' they just looked and said " is that like a trained life - saving dog ? " ' ' that 's the first time i 've seen him doing something like that , ' clarke says he told them .
