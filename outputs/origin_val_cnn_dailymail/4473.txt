with a flooded river running beneath the road , it becomes clear to the driver that the surface is rapidly disintegrating , so he decides to abandon the vehicle before it is too late
seconds later that decision is vindicated as a massive sinkhole opens up directly beneath the bus , causing it to tumble into the furious waters below
the sheer power of the flooded river is immediately evident as the massive vehicle is washed away by the current , bucking and bronking in the water , which has taken on a yellow colour due to the amount of mud and silt it has washed away from the surrounding area
