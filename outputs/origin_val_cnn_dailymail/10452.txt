' berman 's murder is the charge which durst was arrested over last week in new orleans in a dramatic swoop by local officers
they were acting on a warrant issued in california after the hbo series came up with new evidence , including how a letter durst sent to berman and an anonymous one telling police they could expect to find a ' cadaver ' at her house contained the same mis - spelling of beverly hills as beverly hills
durst was also captured on tape saying to himself , after filming had ended : ' there it is
' his lawyer is challenging the ' confession ' , describing it as ' one of 100 possible things ' , including a shakespearean ' soliloquy '
he could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime
durst was transferred to a prison wing for the mentally ill in new orleans last week - while he awaits extradition to la to face the first - degree murder charge - because he is considered a suicide risk
in 2003 he was acquitted of the murder of morris black , a neighbor in galveston , texas , who he admitted killing in self - defense
he also admitted dismembering the dead man 's body .
