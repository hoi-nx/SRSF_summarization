during an interview with barclays premier league world to be shown this week , barkley announces that his best position is striker
' i can have my greatest impact there , ' he claims
' i 'm free to roam around , take players on , have shots and create chances
' this season , the year when people were convinced barkley would come of age in the colours of everton , he has scored twice and created just two more
little wonder he accepts he has had a dip in form
barkley ( right ) gets away from italy 's roberto soriano during england 's 1 - 1 draw in turin the everton midfielder loses the ball after a challenge from italy defender giorgio chiellini barkley replaced theo walcott in the second half and looked bright as the england earned a draw the problem with barkley , who showed flashes of his talent after coming on as a 55th - minute substitute during england 's 1 - 1 draw with italy in turin , is that nobody is quite sure what his best position is
ask everybody involved with him at everton or with england and they will come up with a different answer
this season alone he has played in five different roles ( six if his appearances as a substitute are included ) for everton : 10 in his favoured role off the main forward , six starts on the left , once in front of the back four , once in the centre of midfield and one start at right wing
at 21 there has to be an element of confusion , struggling to work out why his manager roberto martinez is playing him in so many different positions at goodison
barkley came off the bench as england beat lithuania on friday to stay on course for euro 2016 the 21 - year - old replaced midfielder jordan henderson for the last 20 minutes at wembley for some players this would be an education , an opportunity to experience the game from different areas of the pitch as they continue their development
with barkley , it feels very different
he has had such a billing since he first broke in to the everton them , with comparisons to the late , great alan ball , to the mercurial talents of gascoigne over recent times , that his name creates mild hysteria whenever it is mentioned
it seems particularly unfair to compare him with alan ball , a man who controlled the tempo of matches when he was playing for everton , arsenal and england
he was also , notably , a world cup winner
it should also be remembered that gascoigne , who had a far better goalscoring record at newcastle , had to wait until he was 21 to make his england debut , against denmark in 1988
barkley has serious potential , something roy hodgson and his coaching staff recognise with his regular appearances in the england squad
they , too , are baffled by barkley 's failure to hold down a regular , fixed position with his club because he is attentive and willing to learn during england 's training sessions
barkley has been compared with alan ball - pictured on the left celebrating england 's 1966 world cup win paul gacoigne - an england hero at the 1990 world cup - is another former star barkley has been likened to 2011 - 12 appearances 9 goals 0 2012 - 13 appearances 0 goals 0 sheff wed ( loan ) appearances 13 goals 4 leeds ( loan ) appearances 4 goals 0 2013 - 14 appearances 38 goals 7 2014 - 15 appearances 28 goals 2 barkley made his england debut in 2013 - he has 12 caps and no goals
there is a theory that barkley , who began his career as central defender , would be better making those surging runs from deeper position
the problem is convincing barkley to commit to the idea
in miami last summer , after england had drawn a tune - up game 2 - 2 with ecuador , he was encouraged by roy hodgson to keep the ball , to be more intuitive and use it more wisely
there is a similar issue with everton 's central defender john stones : he has outstanding attributes , but he is caught in possession , in dangerous areas of the pitch , too often
this is an area england 's coaching staff have addressed with barkley , showing him the hotspots when a careless ball or misplaced pass at the highest level can end in the back of joe hart 's net
against scotland last november , when roy hodgson placed enormous pressure on himself to secure a result at parkhead against an old rival , he was caught screaming expletives at barkley after he came on as a substitute
there is certainly an element of frustration building up around this young player because has yet to convert his obvious talent into the complete , all round , match - winning performance
barkley featured against scotland last year but was on the receiving end of a roy hodgson blast at parkhead like barkley , everton 's john stones ( left ) can also get caught in possession in dangerous areas of the pitch there is certainly a demand for more goals , something he aspired to with those two shots that hit the woodwork during everton 's damaging 5 - 2 defeat by dynamo kiev in the europa league
last summer , when barkley was in miami preparing for the world cup with england , roberto martinez told sportsmail that his young midfielder needed room to breathe
' we have to allow him to develop and let 's not put too much pressure on him
at the moment he is perfectly suited to playing in the no 10 role , but in time he will develop into the complete midfielder
' at the moment he is a substitute for england , watching the games from the bench and listening to the advice of captain rooney after the game with lithuania on friday
rooney has taken a pastoral role in barkley 's welfare , offering him advice when he was named among england 's substitutes for the 4 - 0 victory over lithuania at wembley last friday
barkley accepts that his form has dipped , well aware that he has yet to mature in to a role that suits club and country
when he settles on a preferred position , barkley will be the biggest beneficiary
barkley , keeping an eye on manchester city playmaker david silva , was expected to shine this season the midfielder , pictured trying his luck against leicester , has just two goals this season one of his goals came in the 3 - 0 win over newcastle at goodison in the middle of march
