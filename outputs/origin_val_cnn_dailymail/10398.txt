' it was n't time
i knew i could lose the babies
' pinheiro da silva gave birth to premature alexandre , who was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit , as doctors were able to keep ronaldo antunes growing inside of his mother 's womb during the unique technique

pinheiro da silva has spoken out about the technique doctors resorted to in the hope they could save one twin when the first was born at only 24 weeks after she went into premature labor in february she gave birth to premature alexandre , who was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit , as doctors kept ronaldo antunes growing inside of his mother 's womb during the unique technique miraculously , both twins managed to survive and , despite one being nearly a month older than the other , are doing well when potassium sulfate injections failed to stop pinheiro da silva 's labor , doctors decided to go forward with a rare technique in which one baby is kept in the womb after its twin is born
' when you have a situation where one baby is born and labor stops , you are given this window of opportunity , ' dr. steven ralston , director of maternal-fetal medicine at beth israel deaconess medical center , told the globe
' but it 's a rare window
most times , labor does not stop
' thankfully , after alexandre was born at just 1 pound , 10 ounces , it did happen
doctors stopped pinheiro da silva 's labor and left the delivered child 's umbilical cord and placenta inside her womb
pinheiro da silva 's first twin alexandre was born at just 24 weeks and weighed only 1 pound 10 ounces as alexandre fought for his life , his brother ronaldo antunes lived on in their mother 's womb growing stronger
ronaldo antunes was born 24 days after his brother and weighed 3 pounds 3 ounces ' on the second day after alexandre was born , his umbilical cord came out , ' pinheiro da silva told abc
her husband ronaldo antunes ' saw it hanging
' ' but they just cleaned it and put it back inside , ' she said
pinheiro da silva was given antibiotics to combat infection , which can be common after the procedure
however , unlike many mothers , da silva was fortunate not to require her cervix to be stitched up to keep the baby from coming
for the following three weeks , she remained in the hospital , where she was able to visit alexandre in the neonatal unit
then , 24 days after his brother was born , ronaldo antunes came at a much more robust 3 pounds , 3 ounces
' they 're my miracle babies , ' said pinheiro da silva
' ronaldo antunes because he stayed inside , and alexandre because he 's a survivor
