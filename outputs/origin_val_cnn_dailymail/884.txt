they like manchester band the courteeners at old trafford
upon winning their 20th premier league title fans had the words of their song ' not nineteen forever ' made into a banner that takes pride of place at the old trafford
but in the case of forgotten man herrera and his triumphant return to the side , the middleton four - piece 's earlier hit ' what took you so long ? ' would be more appropriate
herrera ( centre ) is starting to make an impact for louis van gaal 's manchester united side herrera has forged a strong bond with fellow spaniard mata , who scored twice against liverpool what took you so long louis van gaal ? why was herrera , suddenly a key player in manchester united 's new - found swagger , out of the picture for long chunks of the season ? there is more than one answer
firstly , if anyone is a ' club signing ' it is herrera
long before the coronation of king louis , manchester united originally vowed to ensure he would be their man following his mesmerising role in bilbao victory over sir alex ferguson 's side
the admiration from within spread to the stands
they have never been shy of praising opponents at old trafford â this was where , in 2003 , ronaldo famously secured a standing ovation after a beautiful champions league hat - trick for real madrid
the 25 - year - old was signed from bilbao in a Â£ 28.8million move following van gaal 's arrival herrera made a bright start to his manchester united career , but injury saw the spaniard sidelined for several weeks in that frantic and ultimately fruitless first summer david moyes famously made one attempt to capture herrera 's services which ended in confusion after the complex hurdles within the player 's contract could not be overcome
but they would not give up
when van gaal arrived talks were at an advanced stage with herrera 's representatives and he was happy to give the Â£ 28.8m move the green light with the new season approaching
manchester united have paid more for only four others , but as we have heard more than once , under van gaal 's philosophy the fee counts for nothing
former manchester united boss david moyes made an attempt to capture herrera 's services , but failed the spanish midfielder is having to prove his worth to van gaal during his first season at old trafford herrera celebrates scoring during manchester united 's fa cup fifth round victory against preston in february not being the dutchman 's player , herrera may have had to prove himself more than most
in a stuttering start to the season , he was not seen for a month after being substituted at half - time against west bromwich albion
as late as february he had completed 90 minutes just once since the 5 - 3 humbling at leicester city in september
with their team struggling for rhythm manchester united fans who remembered herrera conducting the tune for bilbao , scratched their heads at his continued absence
when he made a rare start in the 3 - 1 fa cup win at deepdale on february 16 many put it down to van gaal 's squad rotation
herrera 's partnership with daley blind ( right ) has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield but herrera has started every game since , the kickstarting of his old trafford career coinciding with manchester united finally clicking into gear
his partnership with daley blind has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield
suddenly manchester united appear as sharp as their 1980s shirt sponsors
herrera 's through ball for mata to open the scoring against liverpool came in a dominant half of football manchester united fans wondered if they would ever see again only weeks ago
but there is more to it than herrera simply not being the boss 's signing
in a wide - ranging interview with el pais , he offered more clues
herrera and mata chase down philippe coutinho during manchester united 's 2 - 1 victory against liverpool on sunday mata puts the ball past simon mignolet for his firs goal following a brilliant throughball from herrera ' van gaal loves possession and does n't like to risk [ losing ] the ball , ' he said
' he wants long possessions and to keep the ball because he believes you create spaces staying in the right place , because the team have the quality to find you
' at the beginning he used to tell me off because i always looked for the ball , i wanted to have it , and i must wait for it
' van gaal is on the record stating his belief that his players must not play off the cuff â that they should know their jobs and if they do them his side will win
michael carrick ( left ) congratulates herrera on the part he played in mata 's opening goal it is a pragmatic cross-sports philosophy used in the nfl by new england patriots head coach bill belichick , whose team this year won their fourth super bowl this century
while it does not sound like the famous united way , it certainly looked like it at anfield
herrera , superb on merseyside , believes that if it had not been for football he would have tried a career in sports journalism
by the looks of things , he has plenty of new chapters to write at old trafford first .
