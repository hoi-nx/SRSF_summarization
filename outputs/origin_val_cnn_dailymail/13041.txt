is philae still alive ? the answer to this particular cosmic cliff - hanger was left unresolved towards the end of last year
the tiny space probe bounced across the surface of comet 67p before touching down away from its intended landing zone
it returned plenty of data from the surface but ended up in a shady spot where there was n't enough sunlight to keep it powered -- so then it went to sleep and nothing has been heard since november
in the months since , mission scientists have not been able to pinpoint its exact resting place
but now the comet - chasing mother ship rosetta -- in orbit around 67p -- is to begin listening for signs that the lander has survived the cold and dark
scientists at the esa ( esa ) , which is leading a consortium that includes nasa to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun , believe that if enough sunlight falls on philae 's solar panels it could revive
as the comet gets closer to the sun and more light illuminates the lander , the chances improve
lander system engineer o'rourke told cnn interactive that philae needs 5.5 watts of power to reboot itself , nine watts to switch on the receiver to accept communications and 19 watts to activate its transmitter and allow two - way communication with the orbiter
modern energy - saving domestic light bulbs consume 20 watts or lower so it does n't need much to re-establish contact
on tuesday , @ esa_rosetta tweeted : " excited ! i have some opportunities to listen for @ philae2014 to find out if he 's awake ! " rosetta and philae 's love affair on twitter on the rosetta mission blog , lander project manager stephan ulamec says : " it will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up , but it is worth trying
the prospects will improve with each passing day
" the mission website adds that philae could already have woken up but does not yet have sufficient power to communicate with rosetta
it says rosetta will transmit to philae between march 12 and march 20 , listening for a response
problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor philae to the surface failed
the gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet , the probe bounced across the comet
however , the mishap could prove to be a happy accident
o'rourke explained that as the comet nears the sun , philae 's original landing spot would have exposed it to temperatures that would have burned out its electronics
in that position it most likely would have died by now
from lander pictures , mission controllers think philae , which is about the size of a washing machine , is tucked up underneath a cliff face , affording it some shade
beginning thursday , mission controllers will send what o'rourke described as " blind commands " to philae in the hope that the lander has enough power to receive instructions even if it ca n't respond
philae will be told to save power for the transmitter
o'rourke admits that it 's a " long shot " but the team will try again in april if this attempt fails
if philae revives it could be witness to an amazing show as the comet makes its closest approach to the sun in august
" i think we are going to see some amazing images at that point , " said o'rourke
even if philae never wakes up , all is not lost
the mission has detected organic chemicals on the comet surface , though full details of that discovery have yet to be revealed
and the rosetta mission is already changing perceptions of comets
o'rourke says instead of a comet being a dirty snowball he now thinks of it as being " an icy dirtball
" he described discoveries of dust and large " boulders " circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits , and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football pitch that has been lifted and then deposited next to the hole
" the rosetta mission is not just about the lander
it 's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again , finding the secrets held by comets
every day is a new discovery , " he said
scientists have already applauded the mission 's success to date
" the rosetta radar experiment will reveal for the first time how a comet is put together , " cosmochemist denton s. ebel told cnn interactive in november
