colleagues : pm david cameron ( left ) hailed mrs may ( right ) as a ' brilliant ' home secretary who had cut crime lib dems leader nick clegg accused the tories of dancing a ' hokey cokey where one day they want to leave , the next day they do n't want to leave '

many trips : foreign secretary philip hammond has visited almost every european capital in a bid to build support for his call for eu reform ' we are not like the conservative , half of whom are straining at the leash to leave
we think that would be a terrible thing for the british economy

' large parts of the conservative and ukip appear to want british to cut itself off from what is the world 's largest marketplace with hundreds of millions of customers for british goods and services
' for me it 's stating the flaming obvious that we need to secure british 's presence at the heart of the eu in the same way it 's flaming obvious that we should secure the british economic recovery by finishing the job of balancing the books but doing it in a fair and sensible way - not taking an ideological approach to cuts , which is the conservative approach , nor taking such an irresponsible approach to borrowing , which is labour 's approach
