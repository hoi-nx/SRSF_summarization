uconn men 's basketball coach ollie is refusing to travel to the final four this week , the university announced
ollie , who led his team to the ncaa men 's basketball championship last year , is abiding by a travel ban ordered by connecticut 's governor because of indiana 's new religious - objections law
governor dannel p. malloy and other critics contend the law would allow businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians based on religious beliefs
malloy left the decision to travel to the final four up to ollie and the university , which had already paid for much of his trip
' that 's a decision for them and uconn to make , um , what i 'm saying is , let 's not be silly here , ' he was filmed telling reporters
