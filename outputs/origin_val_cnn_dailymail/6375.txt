england 's hopes of landing their first grand slam of stuart lancaster âs reign have been dashed again as ireland deservedly earned a victory that leaves them red - hot favourites to retain their six nations title
lancaster âs men rarely threatened reproduce the form that saw them open the championship with wins over wales and azzurri as robbie henshaw âs second - half try , allied to 14 points from the boot of jonny sexton , inflicted a demoralising defeat on the visitors
england travelled across the irish sea with high hopes of making it three wins from three but were persistently penalised at the breakdown by referee joubert as they struggled to gain a foothold in the match

there were some fine individual performances from england , with billy vunipola outstanding at no8 , but collectively the visitors were no match for joe schmidt âs unbeaten irish
england , desperate for some silverware three years into stuart lancaster âs tenure , must now regroup to face scotland and france at twickenham but they will do in the knowledge their grand slam hopes have been shattered again
they retain a small chance of winning the championship , but that will prove of little comfort in the light of this comprehensive defeat
dublin was lashed by wind , rain and sleet in the hours before kick off but mercifully the weather relented to leave the aviva stadium pitch slippery but not treacherous
england had made two changes to their starting line - up from the side that beat azzurri a fortnight ago with jack nowell preferred to jonny may on the left wing and goode replacing mike brown after the harlequins full back failed to recover from concussion he suffered against the azzurri
jonny sexton was clinical with his kicking and the points he scored provided the backbone for ireland 's victory richard wrigglesworth ( left ) , kruis and chris robhaw react to england 's defeat against ireland murray ( centre ) passes the ball out from the ruck in ireland 's game against england on sunday ben youngs ( centre ) of england is tackled by jonny sexton ( second left ) and best ( right ) of ireland luther burrell ( centre ) of england is hauled down by ireland 's jonny sexton in the clash at the aviva stadium ireland : kearney , bowe , payne , robbie henshaw , simon zebo , jonny sexton , murray , mcgrath , best , ross , devin toner , o'connell , o'mahony , o'brien , jordi murphy

penalties : ford ( 2 ) drop goals : ford referee : joubert attendance : 51,500 jordi murphy was ireland âs only change as he started at no8 in place of jamie heaslip , who is recovering from the broken vertebra in his back , caused by an intentional knee from france lock pascal pape which led to a 10 - week ban
ireland went into the game on the back of a nine - match winning run , including autumn victories over australia and south africa , while england were buoyed by a four - game unbeaten run against today âs hosts
england were desperate to avoid another slow start after going behind in both their first two games of the championship but , following a lengthy pre-match build up which left the players on the field for several minutes prior to kick off , they were sluggish out of the blocks again
ford turned over the ball on the half - way line seconds after kick off and james haskell infringed at the breakdown after ireland whipped the ball wide down the left
jonny sexton kicked the penalty from 40 metres , with barely two minutes on the clock , before england conceded another penalty from the kick off and ireland roared back into their opponents half
with the capacity crowd behind ireland , jonny sexton hoisted an awkward cross kick which jack nowell was unable to gather and the irish forwards thundered at england with wave after wave of attacks
another penalty was conceded under the posts , which jonny sexton converted , as england found themselves 6 - 0 down having barely drawn breath
the visitors finally gained some sustained possession and ford was influential in stretching the irish defence as luther burrell and ben youngs both made telling incursions before the england fly half slotted a neat drop goal on 12 minutes to get his side on the scoreboard
ford missed a long - range penalty attempt and england blew another excellent chance after fine build - up play saw ford kick a penalty to touch only for dylan hartley to throw straight to devin toner and allow ireland to clear

the flanker did not return
jonny sexton kicked his third penalty as ireland went 9 - 3 in front with 30 minutes gone but the fly half could not stretch ireland âs lead further when he missed a difficult penalty attempt after anthony watson was penalised for off - side
ireland took a six - point lead in at half time as england clung on after 40 minutes that saw that repeatedly penalised by south african referee joubert
ireland were fastest out of the blocks in the second half and a sharp break by murray saw robbie henshaw hack through only for goode to save the day for england with some brilliant defensive work behind the posts
joubert again penalised england at the breakdown on 47 minutes and jonny sexton extended his side âs lead to nine points with his fourth penalty and ireland struck the killer blow when murray chiped deep into england âs dead - ball area and robbie henshaw out - jumped goode to touch down
robbie henshaw ( left ) receives treatment during the game against england but was fit enough to continue and score a try for ireland both sides new that victory would give them the upper hand in the race to win the six nations england 's players line up for the national anthem prior to the start of their game against ireland at the aviva stadium jonny sexton âs conversion made it 19 - 3 after 53 minutes and it was impossible to see a way back for england
ford added his first penalty to chip away at ireland âs lead after a bulldozing run by billy vunipola and gave his side hope after 67 minutes with another three points it proved a false hope as ireland held on
even jack nowell âs late try attempt was chalked off when joubert spotted a forward pass
it summed up england âs day .
