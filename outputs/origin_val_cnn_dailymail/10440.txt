in ancient civilizations it was the number of labours undertaken by hercules , the amount of gods who lived on mount olympus and the total signs of the zodiac
but now the number 12 has cropped up in another mystifying setting - on a baby 's forehead
hanru van niekerk was born in johannesburg , south africa on november 11 , 2014 , with a strange birthmark on his face in the shape of digits ' 1 ' and ' 2 '
great grandmother catherine jooste told the northcliff melville times that they have embraced the peculiar birthmark , which was a ' beautiful surprise '
she said : ' my youngest daughter was the first one to see it and she said there is a 1 and a 2 on his forehead
' we did not worry about it , his doctor said it will fade as he gets older
' according to nhs choices , birthmarks come in two main categories , vascular or pigmented
vascular birthmarks tend to occur in the head or neck area , being caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin , which can fade after a few months
in comparison , pigmented birthmarks are tan or brown - coloured , caused by a cluster of pigment cells
most birthmarks are harmless and do n't need to be treated .
