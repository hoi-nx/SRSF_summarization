leighton baines has admitted everton 's players are fighting for their futures after a season in which he says they have let themselves down
everton âs dreams of winning the europa league evaporated spectacularly on thursday when they were beaten 5 - 2 by dynamo kiev and now they have nothing to play for other than trying to salvage some respectability in the barclays premier league
it is a far cry from what leighton baines and his team - mates anticipated at the beginning of the campaign but the performance in kiev was indicative of how wretched everton 's form has been
he accepts they have not been good enough and owe their supporters a response
leighton baines challenges with with dynamo kiev 's danilo silva during the 5 - 2 europa league defeat everton 's james mccarthy , tim howard , phil jagielka and leighton baines stand dejected after conceding england left back leighton baines admits that everton players are fighting for their future after difficult season they now have nine games left to move away from the fringes of the relegation battle , starting tomorrow at queens park rangers , and leighton baines has accepted if the situation does not improve , there is likely to be a summer of change at goodison
â you have got your own personal standards , â said leighton baines
â in the last few seasons , we have been striving for something towards the end
this is now a bit different
we have got some important games coming up and we are in a position we do nât want to be in
â the sooner we get a couple of wins on the board , the better
but it is about your own personal standards
the boys have got to keep their standards up , you know ? with the way things have been going , you are playing for your future in some respects
that is a useful way of looking at it
â a disconsolate everton attempt to come to terms with the glut of goals they conceded tim howard can only reflect on what might have been after conceding five goals on a dreadful evening everton âs capitulation summed up a miserable week for english clubs in europe but , more than anything , reminded martinez âs squad of the opportunity they had missed
there had been a feeling within the group that they could go all the way to warsaw and it is crucial they now respond
â we have let ourselves down , â said leighton baines
â they were the better team
we knew they would be better ( than they were at goodison ) this time around but we didn â t approach the game and think â we âve got to sit back â
â we were all thinking that we would push on
we had all the confidence in the world and i do nât think anyone would have foreseen the way things have gone this season
we had been upbeat and positive and it just has nât been a good season
