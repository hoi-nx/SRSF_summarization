italy 's controversial debutant eder saved his adopted country from a major embarrassment with a fantastic late strike to lift spirits ahead of their friendly against england on tuesday
criticism aimed at italy coach conte for picking the brazilian - born eder â named by his football - loving parents after the 1982 brazil world cup star of the same name â was forgotten as the sampdoria striker produced a brilliant finish after 84 minutes to preserve italy 's unbeaten record in euro 2016 qualifying group h. italy striker eder ( left ) celebrates scoring late equaliser with coach conte eder 's late strike extended italy 's unbeaten run in euro qualifying to 45 matches bulgaria ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : mihailov , manolev , bodurov , aleksandar aleksandrov , yordan minev , gadzhev , dyakov , georgi milanov ( ventsislav vasilev 88 ) , ivelin popov ( slavchev 85 ) , mihail aleksandrov , mitsanski ( bojinov 73 )

eder , to give him his full title , turned brilliantly on the edge of the penalty area and hammered a right - foot curler that gave goalkeeper mihaylov no chance
ex-manchester city manager roberto mancini , now in charge of inter milan , was among those who opposed his selection and said the italy should only pick italian - born players
eder did n't move to italy until he was 16
his late equaliser saved italy from a major humiliation in rain - soaked sofia
despite being gifted an early lead with an own goal , conte 's team then capitulated to trail 2 - 1 after 17 minutes against opponents who had only managed to beat azerbaijan in their other four group games
even so , the italian manager now faces an uncertain reception in turin against roy hodgson 's england with juventus fans also blaming him for a knee injury to midfielder marchisio sustained in italy training on friday
italian football federation president carlo tavecchio claimed on saturday that death threats issued over the internet against conte had left the manager â shaken â and angry
conte left juventus to replace cesare prandelli after last summer 's world cup and he rounded on his critics after saturday night 's draw by saying : ' i am ok â but i do n't forget
you can draw your own conclusions
ivelin popov equalised for bulgaria with an 11th - minute strike on saturday night kuban krasnodar midfielder ivelin popov celebrates his goal against italy in sofia ciro immobile of italy challenges aleksandar aleksandrov and goalkeeper mihaylov ' in terms of the performance and the chances created , we deserved the victory
it âs a shame , as we achieved the bare minimum with the utmost effort in an arena that is traditionally difficult
' i liked the lads , we dominated the game and they were restricted purely to counter-attacks
' bulgaria are a far cry from hristo stoichkov 's side that reached the world cup semi-finals in 1994
and the match seemed to be going according to the formbook after four minutes when goalkeeper mihaylov pushed a cross into the path of defender yordan minev who could n't help it crossing the line for an own goal
without legendary goalkeeper buffon who was taken ill with flu shortly before the match , italy 's traditionally - strong rearguard was left all at sea
italy struck early when goalkeeper mihaylov pushed a cross into the path of defender yordan minev bulgaria hit back when georgi milanov 's pinpoint cross to the far post was headed home by ilian micanski bulgaria 's ivelin popov , right , and italy 's leonardo bonucci battle for control in torrential rain bulgaria 's ivelin popov , 2nd left , takes free - kick at the vassil levski stadium in sofia paris st germain no1 salvatore sirigu did n't look a bad replacement but he had no chance with bulgaria 's equaliser after 11 minutes when ivelin popov took advantage of a back - pedalling defence to arrow in a low shot from 18 yards
incredibly , bulgaria then quickly went ahead
italian striker zaza carelessly lost the ball by the halfway line going for a mazy dribble and the home side counter-attacked at speed
georgi milanov 's pinpoint cross to the far post was aimed for ilian micanski and he got ahead of sluggish defender andrea barzagli to expertly headed in beyond sirigu
it was beyond the dreams of the bulgarian fans , most of whom were getting thoroughly soaked by a torrential downpour
in fact , the national stadium was only half - full because of low expectation among home fans but those who turned up were rewarded
conte sent on eder for zaza as a desperate measure to salvage a point â and it worked
italy , second in their group , are now firm favourites to qualify for euro 2016 alongside leaders croatia who they face in zagreb in june
conte will definitely be without marchisio for england 's visit even though initial reports the midfielder suffered ligament damage look unfounded with medical tests showing nothing more serious than a sprain while buffon will do his best to return from his illness
the only premier league player on show , saints striker graziano pelle , was an unused substitute for italy but could face england and his saints team - mate nathaniel clyne this week .
