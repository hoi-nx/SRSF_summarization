a muslim college student has said he was beaten by a gang of vigilante thugs for posing with five female hindu classmates
riyaz , 20 , was reportedly in the corner of a photo taken in india 's conservative city of mangalore which spread on whatsapp and came to the attention of so - called ' moral police '
speaking from his hospital bed , he said a gang kidnapped him and beat him mercilessly , demanding to know the location of his friend who had lain across the girls ' laps
offending image : riyaz , 20 , was reportedly the student on the left - hand side of this photo taken in mangalore , india , which spread on whatsapp and came to the attention of so - called ' moral police ' it is believed the photograph was first circulated on february 22 after being taken at a college in the suburb of surathkal where mr riyaz studied computer science
it quickly caused ripples in the morally conservative part of india , causing ' emotional outbursts ' among other students , the college claimed
events came to a head when mr riyaz received a phone call from friends after a vigilante group had persuaded fellow college students to identify him
he said he went to a friend 's house where a gang of men appeared and dragged him into a car , driving him to the edge of the city
while they beat him - including with wooden sticks - they demanded to know where his friend was and why he , a muslim , had taken a photo with hindu girls , he said
his ordeal lasted several hours , after which he was abandoned three miles from home and left to find his way to getting medical help
according to the news minute , the student said : ' we were outside near the gate , when a maruti 800 car came and they asked me something
then suddenly , they just hold of me and dragged me into the car
' all of us have been very close since the first year
if we were not close , would the girls permit it ? ' see the photo
if it was forced , then would the girls be smiling ? ' assistant commissioner of police ravi kumar told the indian express : ' after the photograph was circulated on social media sites , a vigilante group got other students from the college to identify the deviant youth and on learning that he was probably a muslim , decided to attack him
' officers say mr riyaz 's friend has gone into hiding rather than seek police protection , afraid that he will receive the same treatment from the mob
despite the student 's ordeal , the response from his college was initially unsympathetic
the five girls and one of the boys were suspended four days after the incident , and one teacher told an india news channel she was ' ashamed ' of the way they had behaved by posing for the photo
however , the teacher added that she felt ' really sorry ' for the students in the photo , who may yet be pardoned by their school
the city is in a part of india with several right - wing conservative hindu groups , the most extreme of which are dubbed ' moral police '
last month hindu pressure groups said would confront unmarried couples in the street on valentine 's day and demand they wed on the spot .
