ukip supporters have been labelled ' fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ' and one fan of nigel farage is doing little to dispel the idea
jill , 59 , a former nurse from poole in dorset , has told a channel 5 documentary that she believes in angels and thinks the eu plans to kill people with guillotines
she believes ukip leader nigel farage , 50 , is our only hope
' god says when an enemy comes against you like a massive flood , i 'll send someone to give you some protection
' i think nigel farage is sent to protect us against the eu , he wants to bring england back to the england people and stop this foreign invasion of our borders
' offering her thoughts on why the eu is such a threat , jill said : ' what nigel farage will do by getting us out of the eu is to stop their plans to microchip our people
jill told a channel 5 documentary that she thinks the eu have ' death vans ' and they will cut people 's heads off with guillotines if they refuse to have microchips fitted ' the eu already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in china , equipped with guillotines
' they will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed
so off with your head and that 's when things start getting unpleasant
' jill - who says she once saw an angel in tesco express - does n't just think nigel farage will save the nation with his foreign policies
she also believes ukip is helping brits become more liberated in the bedroom
she 's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many ukip supporters who share her fondness for s&m
the former nurse is a fan of bondage and says many ukip supporters share her passion for s&m jill is pictured demonstrating her hobby and is grateful brits can now be more open about their sex lives she said : ' i would love a cabinet position as head of bondage
it 's my hobby and i do enjoy it , it 's all role - play and froth , it 's a natural england phenomenon to like it
' sometimes i like to be submissive and other times dominant
i have met a lot of ukip supporters who are into bdsm
they do seem to have a natural bent towards bondage
' i do think that nigel farage has bought a new era and openess to england where we can be more open about our needs to have our bottoms spanked
' the bondage enthusiast also believes ukip can enhance the nhs by giving free cosmetic surgery to women who want it , like herself
' i have been a nurse most of my life , i have my views about the nhs
i think people who need big breasts , who need their nose done , should receive help from the state , ' jill said
' i think nigel farage should look into this
i have seen my surgeon and i am going to have implants
' i think i should get them on the nhs
nigel farage could get a higher women 's vote by bringing that into play
