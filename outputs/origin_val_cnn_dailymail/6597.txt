chris coleman will name vokes in a wales squad for the first time in a year on wednesday - and believes that allows gareth bale to spell more danger for his country
vokes has not featured for wales since scoring in a 3 - 1 victory over iceland last march as he ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament three weeks after that cardiff friendly
but striker vokes has been a regular off the burnley bench since christmas and started his first barclays premier league game on saturday when the burnley shocked manchester city to win 1 - 0 at turf moor
burnley striker vokes has earned a call up to the wales squad after impressing for the burnley vokes ( right ) scored on his second appearance back from injury during his side 's 1 - 1 draw with tottenham that has convinced chris coleman he is ready to play some part in the crunch european championship qualifier against israel on march 28 and free gareth bale again to cause maximum damage in haifa
' he obviously missed the start of the season after his injury but he 's had some games and minutes under his belt now , ' said chris coleman
' it 's good for us because vokes gives us something different
' he 's not just a big target man , he 's got a bit more to him than that and it will be good to have the big man back ' maybe he can come on for half an hour or play for an hour if he starts because defenders do n't like playing against that very strong and brave forward who can get a goal
' vokes ' return also spells good news for chris coleman as far as the deployment of gareth bale is concerned , especially as his main man ended his nine - game scoring drought on sunday by scoring both goals in real 's 2 - 0 league victory over levante
gareth bale has often had to plough a lone furrow in vokes ' absence rather than causing mayhem when cutting in from either flank
gareth bale , pictured after scoring against andorra , has led wales ' forward line in the absence of vokes the real superstar scored twice in wales ' opening 2 - 1 euro 2016 win in andorra in september to make it 11 goals in his last 16 international appearances but he has not found the net in the three qualifiers since
' maybe we can now release gareth bale somewhere else , ' chris coleman said
' gareth bale 's been up there by himself because in the last camp simon church was also injured and he 's had a job to do for us
' but we can look at it with another angle with big vokes coming back
' chris coleman 's side head to haifa with themselves and israel the surprise early front - runners in group b and fancied pair belgium and bosnia having ground to make up in the section
group leaders israel have won their opening three games while unbeaten wales lie in second place after beating andorra and cyprus and picking up points against belgium and bosnia
wales boss chris coleman is hoping vokes ' return will allow gareth bale to return to his natural role chris coleman has hit on a settled side and he hopes he will be able to call on hull defender james , who has been out of action since dislocating a shoulder in january
chester has been a revelation since joining the set - up last year and has developed a formidable centre - back pairing alongside captain ashley williams , with wales conceding only twice in four qualification games so far
' it will be touch - and - go for james and he 's done brilliant for us , ' chris coleman said
' but we 're lucky we 've got someone of james collins ' experience to come in
' he 's got the type of mentality to go to a place like israel where it will be heated and front it up and lead
' it 's going to be tough because they 're top on merit but if we 're serious about qualifying we 've got to go there and get something
