psychotherapist dr. hankin writes a scathing review of dennis hof , claiming he ' encourages them to be jealous and yearn for his attention ' while laughing at ' how they bicker , bitch and fight with each other over him '
' dennis uses the women he " loves " for his own desires , loyal companionship and sex , ' writes hankin
' like any pimp , he exploits them
this is sadistic behavior , and it is both unrecognized and denied
' she calls him a narcissist , with ' no empathy ' , who 's ' clueless about his lover âs hurts and fears or his part in creating them ' .
