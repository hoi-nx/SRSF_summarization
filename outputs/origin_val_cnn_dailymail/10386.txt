ivanka has shared another picture - perfect snap from her family vacation in aspen , this time of herself and her seven - year - old niece kai madison
just hours after posting an image of her adorable three - year - old daughter arabella building her first snowman , the 33 - year - old heiress took to instagram again to express her pride at kai madison 's impressive skiing skills
' i 'm so proud of my niece kai madison for carving up the mountain today ! # littleshredder ' she commented alongside an image of the duo posing atop an aspen mountain in their full ski gear
the two siblings are currently enjoying a spring break getaway together with both of their families , including ivanka 's children - arabella , three , and joseph , one - and donald trump jr 's five children - kai madison , donald john iii , six , tristan , three , spencer , two , and chloe , who is just nine - months - old

' chloe 's first gondola ride with @ mrsvanessatrump # aspen ski bum in the making , ' he commented alongside the image of himself , wife vanessa and chloe
the 37 - year - old businessman added : ' aprÃ¨s ski ai n't what it used to be ! ' over the weekend , ivanka took a break from the slopes in order to help her daughter build her very first snowman yesterday during their family vacation in aspen â and , unsurprisingly , arabella chose to name her snowy creation after a character from frozen
the 33 - year - old businesswoman shared an image of her precious daughter decorating her masterpiece with pine cones while she kept warm in a bright fuchsia snow suit and a knit hat topped with a pom pom , while commenting that the process of creating the snowman was n't as easy as she thought it would be
magical moment : ivanka , 33 , snapped this photo of her three - year - old daughter arabella making her first snowman on sunday , which she named after the frozen character olaf disney inspired : last summer , arabella had a frozen - themed birthday party where she dressed as elsa ' making a snowman was much harder than i expected ! alas ... meet olaf ( big surprise on the name selected )
arabella 's very first snowman ! ' she captioned the instagram photo yesterday
nearly 10,000 people commented on the snapshot of arabella 's smiling face , with one fan writing : ' family and cousin bonding in aspen ... ca n't get any better than that
love the pine cone placement
' another person praised ivanka 's parenting style , saying : ' she is just so pretty
i admire the hands - on mom that you are
' this is nât the first time that arabella âs fondness for the hit disney movie frozen has been documented on her mother âs instagram account ; last summer , the mother - of - two threw her daughter a frozen - themed birthday party , posting a picture of the youngster posing in front of a frozen - themed cake , while wearing a princess elsa costume
last week , the dedicated mother - of - two skipped a session at the gym in favor of indulging in a unique ' spin ' session with her two children at home
ivanka shared two images of herself spinning arabella and her one - year - old son joseph around in an office chair , commenting on the instagram snap that the trio 's playtime session was serving as her morning workout
work those arms ! ivanka spent last thursday morning playing around with her two children , rather than opting for a session at the gym throwback : ivanka shared this childhood image of herself enjoying a skiing session with her mother ivana ' nothing like a morning spin session to get my day started right ! ' she wrote , before adding : ' their adorable squealing was the best part ! ' the adorable photos , which were uploaded as one collage , have already received numerous comments from ivanka 's followers , with many praising the busy mom for her ability to balance her work life with having fun at home
' my new role model lol
bad a * * hot business woman like me ( sic ) , ' one person wrote
another added : ' you are a great role model for so many young women ! thank you ! ' and it seems that the fun picture may have made ivanka feel a bit nostalgic ; just a few hours after sharing the image with her 500,000 followers , the former model posted one of her own childhood snaps , apparently taken on one of the trump family 's skiing vacations
' this picture makes me smile - some of my favorite childhood memories took place on the slopes , ' she commented on the throwback picture , which shows her as a young girl enjoying a session on the slopes alongside her mother ivana
happy families : ivanka has been married to real estate investor jared kushner ( pictured with their children ) for four years she then added : ' in honor of next week 's family vacation to # aspen , this # tbt features my first ( and favorite ! ) ski instructor
# thanksmom # familyvacation ' no doubt the family 's holiday will continue to provide plenty of material for ivanka 's instagram account , which regularly features candid snaps of her two children - and their father , ivanka 's husband of four years , jared kushner
earlier this month , ivanka spoke with vogue magazine about how her decision to convert to judaism has actually helped her to spend more quality time with her two children
' i really find that with judaism , it creates an amazing blueprint for family connectivity , ' she told the magazine
' we observe the sabbath
from friday to saturday we do nât do anything but hang out with one another
we do nât make phone calls
' ivanka added that turning her phone off for 25 hours is something her children have really learned to appreciate as well
' for arabella to know that she has me , undivided , one day a week ? we do nât do anything except play with each other , hang out with one another [ and ] go on walks together
pure family , ' she said .
