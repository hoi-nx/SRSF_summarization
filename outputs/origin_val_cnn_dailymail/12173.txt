nigeria are scheduled to head to the polls this saturday in what will be the most closely watched elections in africa this year
the poll will test the strength of an electoral process that has been marred by violence and flawed results throughout the country 's short democratic history
the stakes are high , and there is a very real danger of prolonged violence across the country if the electorate questions the legitimacy of the outcome
the conduct of the elections will have long lasting repercussions on both nigeria and the u.s. - nigeria relationship
against the backdrop of these elections is the ongoing threat and destabilization caused by boko haram , a group that has killed more than 10,000 people in northeastern nigeria during its five - year campaign of terror , and kidnapped hundreds more , including young girls
these actions have shocked and horrified u.s.
what many u.s. may not recognize is how important the relationship with nigeria is for the u.s.
we have economic and security interests that are at stake in this election , especially as nigeria has been one of our strongest allies in the region since military rule there ended
in the last decade , the u.s. has trained and equipped thousands of nigeria soldiers who have participated in peacekeeping missions in mali , cote d'ivoire and liberia , helping bring a measure of peace and stability to nations in the africa region
but now we need nigeria to be a front - line ally against terrorism , particularly as boko haram pledges fidelity to the islamic state of iraq and syria
meanwhile , nigeria also has the largest economy in africa and has the continent 's largest population
indeed , it has been identified as one in the next set of prominent emerging economies , making it a tantalizing target for u.s. private investment
it is also africa 's no. 1 oil producer , although an increasingly diversified economy -- for example in the agriculture sector -- provides a myriad of opportunities for more robust trade with the u.s.
ultimately , a stable nigeria will mean real economic opportunities for u.s. -- a win - win proposition
yet despite this potential , the uncertain electoral environment and other serious challenges stand in the way of a deeper bond
the reality is that endemic corruption remains an obstacle to more cooperation , especially when you consider the nigeria military 's poor performance fighting boko haram , despite security spending reportedly being around $ 6 billion last year -- clearly , much of the money meant for the military is not being spent on salaries , equipment or materiel
similarly , weak governance remains an impediment to nigeria 's progress and enhanced ties with the u.s.
nearly 70 % of those in areas in the north live in absolute poverty , according to recent data , as compared to about 50 % in southern areas of the country
such failure on the part of the government to address poverty and inequality facilitates boko haram 's recruitment effort and foments internal instability
the nigeria people clearly believe that these issues must be addressed
according to an afrobarometer survey released in january , 74 % of nigeria citizens said that their country is going " in the wrong direction
" half of nigeria surveyed expressed significant concern about political intimidation or violence in the current election environment
if the nigeria leadership rises to the challenge of tackling these difficult issues , there is nothing standing in the way of even closer ties between our two countries
but it is not just about the leadership -- this election offers the chance for all nigeria to choose their future , and decide which policies will shape the next four years
their example , for better or worse , will be watched -- and perhaps even replicated by other african states
the decisions made in the coming days and weeks will shape u.s. - nigeria relations for years to come
but more importantly , they will determine the future for nigeria 's people
the world is watching nigeria 's historic choice with great expectation and even greater hope .
