footage showing murderer jodi arias pleading for her life in a secret testimony has been released , in which she says she regrets stabbing her boyfriend to death , and calls her attempts to cover it up ' revolting '
arias spoke before jurors in phoenix , arizona , last year - but only after demanding that journalists and film crews be barred from the court
she escaped the death penalty after jurors failed to reach a verdict in a sentencing retrial last week - because one member of the jury held out against executing her as punishment for killing jodi arias in 2008
at one point she said that seeing alexander 's family speak of their grief in court made her ' wish so badly that i could just take that away from them , and that i could reverse what i did
arias , shown above on different days of the testimony , spoke on condition of media not being allowed to film - but a legal challenge forced the court to hand over records the footage , recorded in october and november of last year , was only released after media organizations challenged the decision to allow the secret testimony , and asked for full records
authorities at the maricopa county superior court have now released video footage of arias , in which she is questioned by defense attorneys
abc news ran portions of the film on friday
the questioning began with arias openly admitting the murder - but saying she did not admit her guilt to anybody until 2010 because she was so shocked at herself
when asked why she did not confess immediately , she said : ' because what i did was so horrific that i could n't have - i could never have imagined myself doing that to another human being
' alexander , 30 , was found dead in a shower in his phoenix - area home in 2008
he had been stabbed more than 20 times , his throat was cut almost from ear to ear , and he had been shot in the face
together : the secret testimony included questions about arias ' time with alexander , whom she repeatedly stabbed , then shot she was then asked for her reaction to hearing of the grief of alexander 's family - and said that it made her wish she could undo the killing , which she claims was an act of self - defense
she said : ' i wish so badly that i could just take that away from them , and that i could reverse what i did , and that i could take away what all these people are feeling that i have hurt , including travis
she also admitted lying to a detective , whom she called of her own volition , about the murder
when confronted with footage of interviews she gave , arias branded herself ' revolting '
she said : ' it was something that i was years from being able to even come around to admitting to myself that i did something that horrible
' [ lying to police about the murder ] is revolting
i look at that [ footage ] , i just think about how stupid i was
' i was lost - i think of what just those lies put so many people through , and i just wish i could - there are a lot of things i wish i could do over again , but that is just one of them
' when asked to recall photographs of alexander 's mutilated body , she said : ' i caused that pain , and those were his last moments ; and it makes me sick and i wish so badly that i could just so that whole day over again '
' i caused that pain ' : arias reacted to gruesome pictures of alexander 's body , which had some 30 stab wounds
the above image of the shower where his corpse was found is among the publishable ones most of the rest of the testimony focuses on arias 's childhood and her past relationships , and also the time she first met alexander , at a convention in las vegas
she described having sex with him for the first time , and how he started suggesting that she join the mormon church
the line of questioning was never completed , because arias refused to continue her testimony after the promise of secrecy was removed
the jury , eight men and four women , ultimately failed to reach a verdict after one of the women voted against the death penalty
after the trial , fellow jurors said the holdout juror was biased
many said arias did not genuinely feel remorse , and was trying to manipulate them
the judge in the retrial will decide on april 13 whether arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or if she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years
since going back to prison , she has been punished for breaking jailhouse rules - and will not be able to buy items such as candy , has had 10 visitors banned , and will not be able to make phone calls unless they are to do with her legal case .
