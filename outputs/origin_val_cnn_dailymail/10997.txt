photographs of yosemite 's iconic half dome peak have revealed the astonishing extent of california 's historic drought
the images , which show the peak in the third week of march each year between 2011 and 2015 , reveal how swiftly snowfall has depleted year to year
the snow is typically at its deepest in the area in late march and , as seen in the 2011 photograph , it previously covered peaks including the half dome
but this year , the fourth consecutive year of drought in california , the 9,000 - foot peak does n't bear a single flake of snow
earlier this month , officials reported that the nevada snowpack , which gives an indication of upcoming water supply , is just five per cent of its normal depth - and barely above the record low set in 1991
the lack of water comes after the winter of 2014 was the hottest on record for california
farmers have said they expected to leave as much as a million acres unplanted , nearly twice the amount of last year , the times reported
' it looks like we are on our way to the worst snowpack in history , ' state climatologists michael anderson told the times
' unless we end up with some particularly good snows here in march , we are going to end up with a new lowest rank here
' but the half dome peak is likely to stay clear of snow because there are no major snowstorms forecast for the rest of the month
earlier this month , the united states department of agriculture noted that as well as california , droughts are ravaging nevada and utah and also parts of arizona , new mexico , colorado , washington and oregon
the photographs were taken by the yosemite webcam provided by yosemite conservancy , which is funded by donations
while all years show the peak on march 19 , the 2014 image shows it on march 17 as a march 19 photograph was not available
warming temperatures : but by march 2013 , the peak is drastically different - with far less snow as temperatures stay higher depleting : the following year , 2014 , also shows far less snow than in previous years as drought ravages states on the west coast dry : by march this year , the fourth consecutive year of drought in california , the peak barely shows a flake of snow
