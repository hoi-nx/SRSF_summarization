a decision over whether to open britain âs first â new â grammar school in 50 years has been shelved until after the election , it emerged last night
the proposal for an â annexe â to an existing grammar school in sevenoaks , kent , is currently being considered by the education secretary nicky morgan
she is awaiting legal advice and was expected to rule on the matter before the election
but last night a downing street source said : â i do not think there âs going to be a decision on it this side of the election
â last month , the prime minister said he strongly supported the right of ' good ' schools â including grammars â to grow and if labour is elected in may then the scheme would almost certainly fail to get the go - ahead
the tories would probably need an overall majority rather than a coalition to give the plan a chance of being rubber - stamped
the delay will cause dismay among tories backbenchers and last night threatened to overshadow an announcement the prime minister is due to make today about the government âs flagship free schools programme
mr cameron will announce that the tories will continue opening free schools â which are independent of local authority control
they hope to set up 500 new free schools over the next parliament and 270,000 new school places if re-elected
mr cameron will go on to say that 49 free schools will open in september , adding : â if you vote conservative , you will see the continuation of the free schools programme at the rate you âve seen in the last three years
â the proposal for a grammar school annexe comes from weald of kent grammar school in tonbridge which wants to open a campus nine miles away in sevenoaks
in 2013 the plans were rejected by the department for education on legal grounds
new grammar schools are banned , but there is backing in the cabinet for expanding existing schools
and last month mr cameron spoke of his enthusiasm for allowing good grammar schools â to expand â , in what was seen as an indication that he backed the new plan
however the issue is seen as hugely divisive , so it is believed that election chiefs want to avoid it coming up during the campaign
the education secretary nicky morgan was preparing to give the go ahead to the new school for girls in sevenoaks , kent the party was previously convulsed by a row over grammars in 2007
at the time , mr cameron called them an â albatross â , insisting there was a â hopelessness â about calling for new grammars
the party âs europe spokesman brady ended up resigning over the row
last night mr brady said : â this annexe is clearly wanted by local parents and by kent county council
' the bid has been with the department for months and there is no reason why it can not be dealt with immediately
â free schools raise standards at poorly performing local schools , research has shown
according to think - tank policy exchange , the increased competition improves results across communities

labour treasury spokesman chris leslie said : â george osborne raised vat and cut tax credits for working people , while giving millionaires a huge tax cut
