mayweather has refused to agree to a $ 5million fine should either he or pacquiao fail a drug test , according to the filipino star 's adviser
both fighters are subject to random , olympic - style testing by usada in the build up to their $ 300m ( Â£ 200m ) mega-fight in las vegas on may 2
should either fail a test , they would likely be banned for four years but pacquiao also wanted a financial penalty
pacquiao had his first blood and urine test last saturday ahead of his fight against mayweather pacquiao and mayweather must both undergo random testing which is overseen by usada ' today we were informed that mayweather turned down the request , ' michael koncz told epsn
' pacquiao had requested that there would be a reciprocal fine of $ 5 million for a failed drug test
' the details of the testing were not written into the fight contract but were instead included in a separate agreement
and mayweather 's adviser leonard ellerbe said that was pacquiao 's mistake
' michael koncz is an idiot , and pacquiao should be ashamed to have him as his representative , in my opinion , ' he told espn
' it 's obvious he did n't read the contract
why would he have his fighter sign something he was not happy with ? mayweather and pacquiao failed to agree a $ 5million penalty should either man fail a drug test mayweather has long demanded his opponents submit to random , olympic - style drug testing ' the deal was negotiated up and down by his promoter on behalf of pacquiao with mayweather and mayweather promotions , and it 's been well documented in the media for quite some time
' if this moron did n't convey his fighter 's wishes when the negotiation was going on , that 's their problem
this is a lame - ass attempt to generate publicity
' drug testing was the central reason for a collapse in negotiations five years ago when pacquiao refused to agree to the same strict conditions
pacquiao was tested for the first time last saturday when he was visited in los angeles .
