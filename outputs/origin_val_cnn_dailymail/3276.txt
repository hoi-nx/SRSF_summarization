as the jury in the jodi arias trial reached an impasse last week , prosecutors and fellow jurors attempted to remove a holdout on the panel who was the only obstacle in the way of securing a death sentence against the convicted murderer
a court document released tuesday by the judge in the case reveals the behind - the - scenes wrangling in the jury room as arias ' fate hung in the balance
jurors had questioned the holdout 's objectivity because she had previously watched a lifetime movie about the arias case , and prosecutors were upset at the juror 's social media activity as she went on facebook and liked several local tv stations and nancy grace of the hln network
the juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend jodi arias nearly seven years ago
' my opinion is n't being heard , ' the judge quoted the holdout as saying
the holdout 's identity was leaked through a twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about alexander , while a pro-arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence arias to death for the 2008 killing
' juror safety and the protection of jurors ' personal and confidential information are topics the maricopa county superior court takes very seriously , ' the maricopa county superior court said in a statement released tuesday
dwane cates , a criminal defense attorney in phoenix who is n't involved in the arias case , said the leaks wo n't change the outcome of the case , noting that mistrial decisions ca n't be appealed
arias was convicted of murder in alexander 's death at a 2013 trial that became a global sensation with its revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated
a new jury was picked to decide her punishment after the first jury deadlocked on that question
arias was charged with killing her ex-boyfriend jodi arias the one juror who voted against the death penalty admitted to seeing the lifetime film about the case ( above ) a mistrial was declared thursday after five days of deliberations , removing the death penalty as a possible punishment for arias
the judge is scheduled to decide on april 13 whether arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years
most of the jurors said last week that they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty
judge stephens had individually questioned some of the jurors , including the holdout , who said she was n't socializing at lunch with other jurors in an effort to be impartial
stephens said the holdout had disclosed , before being picked as a juror , that she had seen the lifetime movie about the arias case , but never watched it all the way through
the judge said the holdout juror did n't commit misconduct because she clearly disclosed that she had seen the movie
the judge also refused a request by prosecutors to remove the holdout from the jury because she had liked on her facebook page another film that arias found influential
and the case 's chief investigator said the holdout , who had claimed she had recently been keeping away from facebook , had liked several local tv stations and nancy grace of the hln network
the judge noted that it would take two weeks to get records from facebook to determine whether the holdout had clicked on news feeds on her page .
