militant union boss mccluskey has warned that his activists will break the law if the tories curb the right to strike after the election
in an extraordinary move , which was condemned by ministers , the unite general - secretary said he was seeking to change the giant union âs constitution to authorise illegal action
mr mccluskey , whose union has given ed miliband more than Â£ 14 million , said union members could not be expected to obey â oppressive â laws that restrict the right to strike
unite general - secretary mccluskey said he was seeking to change the giant union âs constitution to authorise illegal action the conservatives have said they will change the law to require unions to get the support of at least 40 per cent of their members before calling a strike
the initiative is designed to prevent union bosses ordering strikes on the basis of ballots in which only a tiny number of members have voted
mr mccluskey said the right to strike was already â hanging by a thread â as a result of union reforms carried out by the coalition
in a move that suggests he has little confidence in a labour party victory , mr mccluskey said unite members would now be asked to vote to remove the words â so far as may be lawful â from the rules governing the union 's actions
in a speech to lawyers , mr cluskey said : â these words will go not because we are anarchists , not because we are suddenly planning a bank robbery - but because we have to ask ourselves the question , can we any longer make that commitment to , under any and all circumstances , stick within the law as it stands ? mr mccluskey , whose union has given ed miliband more than Â£ 14 million â it is no exaggeration to say that the right to strike in this - the first country of free trade unionism - was and is hanging by a thread
â but should there be a tory majority in may , there will be a new attack on trade union rights and democracy
â the bar for a strike ballot will be raised to a level which hardly any mps would get over in their own constituencies , by a government which has refused our requests to use modern , more effective balloting methods
â when the law is misguided , when it oppresses the people and removes their freedoms , can we respect it ? i am not really posing the question
i 'm giving you the answer
it ai n't going to happen
â cabinet office minister maude condemned the move â and said it would raise further concerns unite âs planned â merger â with the pcs union
mr maude said : â labour party 's biggest donor and ed miliband 's puppet master is now advocating that their membership break the law
ed miliband needs to immediately condemn this outrageous proposal and refuse to take a penny more from unite until these plans are cancelled
â tory mp raab said it was â shocking â for a union leader to call for illegal action â and called on mr ed miliband to disown the move
mr raab , who has campaigned for the introduction of minimum strike thresholds , said : â red len has never managed to persuade even a quarter of unite members to back even one of his reckless public sector strikes since 2010 , but it 's still shocking to hear him preparing to break the law
ed miliband has taken millions from this union bully since becoming labour party leader , so if he now fails to condemn this threat of illegal strikes , it will just show the public what a weak leader he is
â unite activists will decide on the change of wording to the union 's rules at a conference later in the year
the labour party declined to comment .
