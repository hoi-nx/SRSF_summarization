when miller appeared at a press conference in thailand on wednesday , the us fugitive did n't appear to take the hearing about her extradition very seriously - resting her head on her hands in boredom and casually applying lip - gloss through the proceedings
authorities say the 36 - year - old has been on the run for six years after fleeing the us to avoid a five - year prison sentence for killing truck driver goodwin , 57 , in a 2004 drunk - driving accident
she managed to evade detection , and even give birth recently , by constantly moving around a set of thailand islands
on thursday , goodwin 's younger sister dees spoke out to the daily mail online , saying she was n't at all surprised by miller 's nonchalant behavior in thailand based on how she reacted to her brother 's death and interacted with the family at trial nearly a decade ago

she did n't even know she had hit him , ' dees said
when the witness asked miller if she knew goodwin , she ' did n't even know who he was talking about '

when dees was finally able to confront miller at her sentencing hearing in 2007 , she and the rest of the goodwin family were met with ' attitude ' from the convict
' when we were allowed to get up and make a comment to the judge ... there were times she had facial expressions like " i ca nât believe what you âre saying
" she just had an impression like she just did nât understand what the big deal was , ' dees recalled
dees says she and the rest of the family first found out about miller 's arrest wednesday afternoon , when a reporter contacted her elderly mother , 87
' she was pretty upset about it
she lives alone and she âs was nât feeling particularly well and she got the news just out of the blue ... she was really too upset to talk. , ' dees said
she says before his death , goodwin purchased a 7 - acre property across the street from his mother 's house and had taken time off to care for her when she underwent a quadruple bi-pass surgery
another life : miller said the father of her child is an us national living in thailand legally , who did not know she was a fugitive ' he was counting down the days to when he could retire , ' dees said
' he was going to retire at 62 and he was just trying to work on his little piece of land
' goodwin left behind a son now in his 30s , also named goodwin , and was divorced
goodwin 's younger brother larry also spoke with the daily mail online , and said his brother 's passing was ' real tough ' on the son
when asked what she would tell miller , if she had the opportunity , dees said : ' i would just let her know that the whole family is elated that she has finally been caught
we did nât think she ever would be , but justice is going to prevail for her
' ' i hope she has additional time added onto the original sentence and i hope it âs as much as they can possibly give her
i do nât know what they can do
i hope she does nât get off any time for good behavior or anything like that
â [ goodwin 's ] life did matter to his family and to people that cared about him
it may not have mattered to her , ' dees said
