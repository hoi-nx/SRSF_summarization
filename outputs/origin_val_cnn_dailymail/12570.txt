students en route to yangon , myanmar , to protest an education bill were met with violence from police tuesday , according to multiple media reports and international watch groups
" we all watched while a young man was beaten extremely hard and repeatedly by about three or four policemen in heavy riot gear , " zarni , a spokesman for the cooperative committee for trade unions , told cnn
students are seeking changes to an education bill that they say limits academic freedom and have been in negotiations with authorities , but these have been curbed because of the crackdown
the violence tuesday occurred in letpadan , a town of about 145 kilometers ( 90 miles ) north of yangon , the nation 's largest city
the students ' march began in mandalay , about 640 kilometers ( 400 miles ) north of yangon
zarni said the students had been " given the red light " on proceeding to yangon
" they had decided they would drive into the city , meet with other students there for 15 minutes of talks and then disperse , " zarni said
" but within about an hour of being given this information , they were told that was n't the case
" " some students decided they would try , thinking the police would just take them away , but the police were so brutal
" police arrested about 40 to 50 people , according to zarni
" they broke a reporter 's camera and cheered about it
they hit monks who were also there
they went into the monastery and detained everyone who had run to hide in there , " zarni said
human rights issues have been at the forefront in myanmar , also known as myanmar , as the country emerges from decades of authoritarian military rule , with elections planned for late this year
" the public and we are losing confidence in the democratic transitions , " zarni said
lay , director of the triangle women support group , agreed
" students , human rights , women 's rights -- we 're all extremely angry about the way we have been treated over the years , " said lay
" but we 've been waiting for the 2015 elections with patience because we believe in the democracy movement , and we 're hoping that we have the opportunity to exercise our right to vote
so they should show us some respect , too
