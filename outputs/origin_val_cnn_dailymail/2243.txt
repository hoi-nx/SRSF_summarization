' sometimes i get the feeling that it seems we ca n't play together , ' iniesta told marca
iniesta and xavi ( right ) have had a long , successful career together in barcelona 's first team despite their incredible careers , iniesta ( left ) says that he sometimes struggles to play alongside xavi ' but it is always a privilege to be by his side because not only does he make your job easier , but he also makes the team work better
' sometimes , as with all players , things do n't work out
we have been together for a long time now and the feelings are always very good , though
' at 30 and 35 respectively , iniesta and xavi have had long and illustrious careers at the nou camp , collecting trophy after trophy under a number of different managers
since iniesta made his debut in 2002 , the pair have been regulars in the first team at barcelona iniesta , at the age of 30 , impressed in the midfield on sunday in the barcelona midfield against rayo vallecano but together they have remained , and when barcelona took to the field to face rayo vallecano on sunday , there they were in the midfield once more
