janice sage became the owner of a picturesque maine inn 22 years ago , after entering a writing contest
now the 68 - year - old innkeeper is ready to retire and plans to hand off the keys to the center lovell inn to a new owner with a new contest
ms janice sage announced the contest late last year , and expects to receive 7,500 entries from prospective new owners by the may 7 deadline
on monday , the daily mail online spoke with ms janice sage about her decision to finally step away from the inn she 's toiled at and invested $ 500,000 into for renovations
all this could be yours : the owner of the center lovell inn in maine is holding a contest , with the winner getting to take over ownership of the historic inn built in 1805 ' i 've been in the business 38 years so it 's time to retire , ' ms janice sage said , adding that she 's looking forward to doing nothing in her retirement after years of 17 - hour workdays
ms janice sage says she ca n't reveal the essay that won her the inn in 1993 , but she believes her 16 years running a restaurant in maryland helped
' one of the judges told me they chose me because they saw that i could carry on the inn and make it a viable business , ' ms janice sage said
while ms janice sage has the right to sell the business , as the outright owner , she has decided to give it away with a new essay contest out of goodwill
' i just want to pass it on to somebody else who is looking for an inn , who possibly ca n't own it on their own outright and i think this is a good way to pay it forward , ' she said
ms janice sage hopes to read all of the applications by may 17 , and says she 'll be impressed by grammatically correct entries that show a passion for work
current owner : janice sage ( pictured above ) has owned the center lovell inn since 1993 , when she won a similar contest deadline approaching : prospective owners can apply to take over the inn by submitting a 200 - word essay and $ 125 by the deadline of may 7 the prompt for the essay is simple : ' why i would like to own and operate a country inn
' prospective new owners must answer the question in a pithy 200 words , and pay $ 125 to enter the contest
ms janice sage will be keeping the money from the application , which could exceed the inn 's estimated value of $ 900,000
ms janice sage wo n't choose the winner , though
instead , she 'll whittle down the list to the top 20 candidates and then let a two - person team who have no stake in the inn select the winner by may 21
the inn will then transfer to the new owner within 30 days , along with $ 20,000 to jumpstart the business
however , the new owners must agree to keep the inn , which dates back to 1805 , painted white with green or black trim
they must also run the property as an inn for at least one year after the handover
busy , busy : the inn , located three hours north of boston , is open year round and its seven rooms are routinely booked up seven days a week in the high season while the new owners can revel in self - employment , the job of keeping up the inn is no easy work , ms janice sage warns
the inn , located three hours north of boston , is open year round and its seven rooms are routinely booked up seven days a week in the high season
everyday , ms sage and about 10 employees work to cook breakfast , clean rooms , take reservations , check out guests and serve dinner
' unless you raise 14 kids , you âre not going to be used to this , ' ms janice sage told the boston globe
' look , this is something you start when you âre young
it takes a lot of stamina
' ms janice sage was 46 when she took over the inn , having never visited maine before in her life
when she learned she was the lucky winner , she brought along her parents to help with the new place ( her father has since passed and mother is now in a nursing home )
ms janice sage grew to love maine and plans to remain in the area for the time being .
