having a father who is leader of the lib dem might be embarrassing enough
but clegg 's children also have to suffer the humiliation of seeing him dad - dancing in the kitchen of their Â£ 1.5million townhouse to meghan trainor 's hit ' all about that bass '
becoming the latest political leader to lift the lid on his family life , mr clegg spoke about the ' very strong ' bond with his wife miriam and their three sons , and baulked at the idea of betting his family home on his re-election in may
but mr clegg suggested he uses his kitchen for dancing rather than cooking
speaking to itv 's good morning britain , the lib dem leader said : ' we are very lucky to have a very strong [ family ]
' we both come from very strong , warm families and both of our families are large , boisterous , loud , warm families
' we do sort of dance together a bit , we were all dancing in the kitchen to all about the bass the other day and i do n't think my kids were very impressed by my dancing but i enjoyed it
' he also revealed how his eldest son , antonio , is almost too old for a fatherly kiss when he does the school run twice a week
' he 's 13 â¦ i still just get a little kiss in if i can , ' mr clegg said
mr clegg revealed how his children have to suffer the humiliation of seeing him dad - dancing with wife miriam in the kitchen of their Â£ 1.5million townhouse to meghan trainor 's hit ' all about that bass ' polls suggest the lib dem are heading for an electoral bloodbath on may 7 , with mr clegg facing a battle to hang on to his seat in sheffield hallam

he told itv 's kate garraway : ' i 'd put a very healthy bet on it
would i bet my house ? that 's slightly unfair on miriam and the boys if it goes pear shaped â¦ ' do i think it is essential to have lib dem around the cabinet table ? unsurprisingly i really , really do
' politics is not for the faint hearted and what goes up , goes down , what goes down , goes up
you ca n't just give up

he said : ' i think some of it , i 'm sure not all of it , but i think some of it is probably inevitable

' asked if he likes david cameron , mr clegg replied : ' um , it 's not like or dislike really
we 've worked out how to work together i suppose , it 's quite a business - like partnership
