they are common to all whales , helping them to propel themselves forward through the water
but this week , a cetacean with no flukes was spotted diving off the coast of southern california
the migrating gray whale , whose tail was likely amputated after it became entangled in fishing gear , was seen adapting a new style of swimming to allow it to negotiate its way to warmer waters
diving sharply into the ocean , it corkscrewed its body so that it could use the side of its peduncle - the area between its main body and where its flukes would be - to generate sufficient thrust
although experts believe the style of swimming could cause the whale to develop back problems , it is probably the only way it could make the migration
the flukeless creature , dubbed the ' whale without a tail ' by some whale watchers , was first spotted swimming alone off the coast of point loma in san diego on saturday , according to grind tv
a day later , it was seen diving into the ocean beyond dana point in southern california by stunned passengers aboard the dana pride , who recognized it only when it blew a plume of mist into the air
and on monday , the determined young cetacean was caught on camera swimming in waters off point vicente in los angeles , accompanying two other gray whales on the northbound migration
speaking to the tv station , captain tom white of the dana pride , which runs from dana wharf whale watching , said the rare sighting of the whale proves how intelligent the creatures are
' it just goes to show how smart these mammals are , to be able to adapt so well without a limb , ' he said
' it was migrating along fine , although a little slower than what we usually see

a day later , it was seen diving into the ocean beyond dana point ( pictured ) in southern california ' and during its deeper dives it would use its pectoral fins and swim harder on one side to spin around â in kind of a corkscrew manner
but it did not seem to be in any trouble
' the whale , which will average 40 to 50 feet in length when fully grown , likely lost its fluke recently after becoming entangled in fishing gear , such as ropes from crab or lobster traps or gill nets
the entanglement could have cut off blood supply to the animal 's tail , reported captain dave âs dolphin & whale safaris , which ran the boat trips during which the striking creature was seen
this may have led to the whale 's flukes dying and falling off without harming the rest of its body
iintelligent : captain tom white of the dana pride whale watching boat , which runs from dana wharf whale watching , said the rare sighting of the whale ( pictured swimming ) proves how intelligent the creatures are another appearance : on monday , the determined young cetacean was caught on camera swimming in waters off point vicente ( above ) in los angeles , accompanying two other gray whales on the northbound migration speaking to the dodo , marine biologist michael j. moore , ph.d. , of woods hole oceanographic institution , said chronic entanglement trauma could be ' the worst form of animal welfare abuse '
he said it was likely that a gill net had slowly cut off the whale 's flukes , ' giving the major blood vessels that feed the fluke time to clot and heal as the damage got deeper
' according to captain dave 's , researchers estimate that entanglement in fishing gear and other items kills nearly 1,000 dolphins and whales across the world on a daily basis
every year , gray whales make a 10,000 - to 14,000 - mile round trip from their feeding grounds in the cold chukchi and bering seas to mexico 's baja peninsula peninsula and the southern gulf of california

above , a file photo of the dana pride there , they mate and have calves in the regions ' warm lagoons
the migration is believed to be the longest annual migration of any mammal
gray whales typically live between 55 and 70 years
it is not the first time a whale has been sighted with no flakes following an entanglement
in the 1990s , a flukeless gray whale was seen a number of times over nine years off the baja peninsula
two others were seen in 2011 and 2012 - one in the same location and another near australia .
