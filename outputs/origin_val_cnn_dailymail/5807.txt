france is inching closer to a ban on the use of skinny models , a trend which one leading mp has branded the ' glorification of anorexia '
socialist politician olivier veran , who is also neurologist at the university hospital of grenoble , is demanding that fashion bosses who hire underweight girls be punished with six months in prison or fines of up to â¬ 75,000 ( Â£ 60,000 )
he has proposed that models should be required to present medical certificates demonstrating a healthy body mass index ( bmi ) , which is calculated by dividing one 's weight by the square of one 's height
' a level of acceptable body mass index should be set and enforced
websites encouraging young girls to lose weight should also be banned
' some of these sites tell pre-teenage girls they should have a gap of 15 centimetres between their thighs , or give tips on how to survive on as little food as possible
' there are now 40,000 people in france suffering from anorexia , around 90 percent of whom are adolescents , mr olivier veran said
measures similar to those proposed by mr olivier veran are already in place in a number of countries in europe and around the world
spain bars models below a certain body mass index from featuring in the madrid fashion shows ; italy insists on health certificates for models ; and brazil is considering demands to ban underage , underweight models from its catwalks
in norway , mps have proposed that images of airbrushed fashion models should come with a ' cigarette - packet ' style health warning in a bid to tackle eating disorders
one suggested text for the warning reads : ' this advertisement has been altered and presents an inaccurate image of how this model really looks '
medical experts around the world have warned against the dangers of ultra-skinny catwalk models and images airbrushed to make girls look thinner , which they say encourage anorexia in girls as young as six
two years ago , fashion guru giorgio armani said that the fashion industry had a duty to ' work together against anorexia '
he added at the time : ' the industry has to recognise the link between its preference for abnormally thin models and the growth in eating disorders among young women
