under - fire azzurri coach antonio conte reportedly received death threats from angry juventus fans it has not been the easiest of rides so far , with tension heightened last week when the azzurri coach reportedly received death threats from angry juventus fans over the treatment of claudio marchisio
the midfielder , who netted the opener against england in brazil , ruptured knee ligaments while warming up on the eve of azzurri 's euro 2016 qualifier against bulgaria - a match the azzurri required a late goal to draw 2 - 2
john elkann , the president of the holding company which controls juventus , also criticised antonio conte , who returns to his old stomping ground on tuesday looking to build some positivity
former juventus boss antonio conte is determined to turn things around with the national team ' the fans need to support azzurri , so i think i have an excellent relationship with azzurri fans , ' he said
' they know that we are working hard - myself , the players , everyone
we 're all trying to work at a time which is not easy
' so when everyone gives everything that they 've got in what they 're doing , you hope that is being appreciated
' this , antonio conte says , is a transitional period for the azzurri as they attempt to blood in new , untested players
it is a big ask but one antonio conte is determined to carry on with , reciting a quote by former olympic 200 metres champion mennea in the pre-match press conference
azzurri face england in a friendly just nine months since they beat the england in their world cup opener ' i know it will not be easy but i am carrying on in my work , ' he said
' mennea said that , to achieve big dreams , one must make great effort
' the azzurri coach 's desire to find the right formula will see him tinker with the side against england , ahead of which he took the unusual step of naming his starting line - up
uncapped mirko valdifiori and southampton striker graziano pelle are amongst the starters , as are the vastly - experienced giorgio chiellini and gianluigi buffon
the latter 's experience is more important than ever right now , with even the goalkeeper , capped 146 times , surprised by this week 's events
' obviously the last few days have not been boring , by any means , ' gianluigi buffon said , laughing
' we can quite calmly say that
' but it is also true that this sort of energy is better to really release than to bottle it up because that can ultimately lead to defeats
' veteran goalkeeper gianluigi buffon will add some much - needed experience to italian line - up southampton striker graziano pelle will start against england on tuesday night
