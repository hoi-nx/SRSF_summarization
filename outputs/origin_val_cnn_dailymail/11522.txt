we go to the cinema , take the kids to the school , i take the children three or four times a week

normally we do quite badly
i âm terrible at general knowledge
i get my husband to do history and politics

the children come back here for play dates and sleepovers but you are a bit further away from that network
' all the parents get used to popping in and out
â he âs a very good cook
he finds that very relaxing
nancy âs learning to cook
i âm trying to train them to tidy up as they go along but it âs slightly futile
' i am quite tidy and he âs not very good at picking up his clothes
that âs the other one
â mrs samantha cameron made the comments during a fundraising event at the flat the family lives in above no 11 alongside comic walliams
the choice of celebrity will no doubt prove a slightly sore spot for the pm , because when mrs samantha cameron was asked to name her favourite david , she chose walliams
in a previous interview , mr cameron said : ' samantha cameron admitted to me the other day that her favourite david is walliams , which i thought was disappointing as she 's married to me
' she sat next to him at a charity function and said he was the funniest man she 'd ever met so i 'm going to have to learn to live with that
' mrs samantha cameron added that while david is a very good cook , he is also messy , constantly leaving clothes and newspapers strewn around the house ( pictured , she supports her husband after a run in his constituency ) mr walliams has been a frequent visitor to downing street

and in 2013 he led a unicef campaign with 100 schoolchildren , when he could not resist the temptation to touch the prime minister 's hair
mr walliams said later : ' because i 'm taller than him , i offered to stand on a lower step so we would n't look odd together - he 's a tall man but i 'm ridiculously tall
' he 's the prime minister so he should be the one who is most powerful - looking
' he told me not to flick my hair like my character sebastian in little britain , who flirted with the pm relentlessly
of course , i immediately did it
in previous interviews , mr cameron has revealed that he and his wife try to cook a meal or go out for a date together once a week ' when they have time '
the prime minister added : ' everyone has their own keys to a happy marriage , but for us that has really worked
