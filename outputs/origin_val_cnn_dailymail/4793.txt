turkish authorities have admitted the country is grappling with the issue of femicide - a hate crime generally considered to mean the killing of women because they are female
the issue rose to prominence in recent weeks after the body of ozgecan aslan , 20 , was found burned near woodland in tarsus
it 's alleged she was killed after trying to stop a man from raping her - triggering protests across turkish that were attended by thousands
her death caused outrage particularly because women are frequently killed at the hands of violent men and are seen as having a lower status
this perception was recently inflamed by comments made by the turkish president who said women were not equal to men .
