it has famously been a showcase for fast cars , flash watches and high - class liquor - but the latest bond instalment is set to go one step further by promoting an entire country for tax - breaks
the new movie , spectre , will be a truly pro-mexican affair with beautiful shots of the country , a leading role for one of the nation 's most glamorous actress and a strict rule that bond 's nemesis is not from mexican
in exchange for these considerable lengths , the hollywood producers making the film , who are under pressure to cut their huge budget , will have an extra Â£ 14million to spend how they choose
sigman , one of mexican 's rising stars , was recently unveiled as bond girl estrella , appearing alongside italian monica bellucci , who plays lucia sciarra
the mexican actress , 27 , is best known for her role in the award - winning mexican film miss bala , in which she played a beauty queen forced to do a gang 's dirty work after witnessing a murder
in addition , mexican also asked that an assassination target in the film , the mayor of mexico city , be changed to an international leader , the telegraph reports
tax incentives : it is believed that hollywood producers making the new bond movie will save as much as Â£ 14million by showing mexican in a favourable light these measures are said to have secured tax breaks worth Â£ 10million
around Â£ 4million was said to have been earned by filming flattering shots of the country 's ' modern ' skyline and replacing a cage fighting scene with footage of mexican 's renowned day of the dead festivities
sigman will be the first mexican - born bond girl on the big screen , but not the first overall
mexican 's linda christian - the original bond girl - starred in the 1954 television adaptation of casino royale
the movie 's alterations were reported by us website tax analysts , which provides information on tax news , based on emails leaked in last year 's sony hacking scandal
large numbers of internal emails were released by guardians of the peace , which the fbi has since identified as a north korean - backed group of hackers
according to the leaked emails spectre 's budget was at one point exceeding Â£ 200 million - which would have made it one of the most expensive films in history
studio executives spoke of being under ' immense pressure ' to reduce the budget
the plan to give mexican a flattering portrayal was outlined in a memo titled ' elements needed to preserve mexican deal '
it spoke of how producers should cast a ' known mexican actress ' as estrella and female villain lucia sciarra ' can not be mexican '
it also called for aerial shots of ' modern mexico city buildings '
rising star : ms sigman ( pictured left in an advert for her hit mexican film miss bala ) will star alongside daniel craig and italian actress monica bellucci , who who plays lucia sciarra another condition : other leaked sony emails suggested bond producers were asked to film shots with mexican 's ' modern ' skyline in the background other emails suggested the mayor of mexico city should no longer be assassinated while it was decided bond would steal sciarra 's helicopter and take off ' into the mexican skyline '
a senior studio executive later wrote to producers saying : ' you have done a great job in getting us the mexican incentive
' by all accounts we can still get the extra $ 6m by continuing to showcase the modern aspects of the city , and it sounds like we are well on our way based on your last scout
let 's continue to pursue whatever avenues we have available to maximise this incentive
' in an email amy pascal , the former co-chair of sony pictures entertainment , added : ' we should insist they add whatever travelogue footage we need in mexican to get the extra money
' sony pictures entertainment has not commented on the mexican tax incentives
the new film , set to be released in the autumn , had budget exceeding Â£ 200million , which would have made it one of the most expensive movies in history
