america used to be a place where we said , " give me liberty or give me death
" we live by a credo that " freedom is n't free , " and that our constitution is worth dying for
how inspirational it is to believe that this is the wind of thought that blows underneath the eagle 's wings
unfortunately , whenever that wind becomes just a little too gusty for comfort , we find out just how little relationship our poetic credo has to our collective guts
the latest example : nine seconds of video of a number of boys singing an offensive song
immediately , the university of oklahoma expelled two of the boys for their speech
forget whether you like the speech or not
these boys got kicked out of a public school for singing a song , on their own time , in a privately rented bus , simply because the government did n't like the content of their song
opinion : what 's the right way to face racism ? censors overstepping their bounds is no surprise
what surprises me is how readily the public supported the expulsions , and how many supposedly intelligent people were willing to turn the first amendment on its head , because of nine seconds of video
i do n't like the song or its message either
i ca n't imagine anyone reasonable who would
but i want to live in a country where the government does not listen to my songs and then decide whether or not i should be punished , based on what words i used
i understand that most of us hate racism
we are on a mission to eradicate it from all corners
but i am not willing to trade the first amendment for a society where we do n't need to hear racist words
in abrams , justice holmes wrote a passage that ultimately became the cornerstone of a liberty - based view toward free speech , and which became the dominant theory in first amendment jurisprudence
in abrams , holmes gave us " the marketplace of ideas
" and what a brilliant theory it was
holmes noted that if someone was completely confident in the belief that they were right , then it would seem logical that they would want to suppress dissenting views
" if you have no doubt of your premises or your power , and want a certain result with all your heart , you naturally express your wishes in law , and sweep away all opposition
" those who wish to eradicate racism are certain that they are right
i believe in a racism - free world
i have marched in counterprotests against the kkk
i 've stood up in places you do n't want to be , against violent neo-nazis
and i would do it again
but i feel no kinship with anyone who would harm the first amendment to fight racism
some things are worse than racism -- like a loss of the right to speak your mind and think your own thoughts
unfortunately , that is a price that too many of us are willing to pay
as certain as i am that my views on race are correct , i can not shake holmes ' wisdom from my mind
he wrote : " but when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths , they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market , and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out
that , at any rate , is the theory of our constitution
" for that reason , i would gladly protest against the kkk , but i would never abide any government official denying the kkk its right to speak
i understand those who would wish to do so
they want to eradicate racism , and the end will justify the means
however , we have slowly been descending into a place where we are trading this for freedoms that are far more precious than the freedom to avoid having our feelings hurt by offensive statements
of course , some say that these were more than " offensive
" the song was a " threat
" after all , it did mention lynching black people
but was that really a threat ? an idiotic ditty in an all - white bus ? to call it a threat is disingenuous
what about the disruptive nature of the song ? should other students have to go to school with people who clearly despise them , and who carry these offensive racist thoughts ? yes
they should be free to have these thoughts , they should be free to say these things
if it crosses the line into action , or even imminent incitement to action , that 's another story
in this case , that never happened
opinion : the danger society does n't talk about it is easy to claim that these sae boys did not deserve first amendment protection
but , when you hear that , your immediate reaction should be one of skepticism
the first amendment is not there to serve as a comforting blanket of civility
in fact , it is there precisely to protect the sharp edges
it is there for the kkk , the nazis , sae , and you alike
it is there for words that shock us , challenge us , and that bother us
you should want to protect the sae boys -- not that they deserve it
you should do so because the day will come that your speech is unpopular
once , speech in favor of racial equality was considered to be " bad speech
" once , professors were kicked off campus for not being " anti-gay enough
" but , today , the thought of equality and tolerance have won out in the marketplace
let that victory stand , without trying to cement it with the force of law , and without destroying the very liberty that allowed these " good thoughts " to flourish in the first place .
