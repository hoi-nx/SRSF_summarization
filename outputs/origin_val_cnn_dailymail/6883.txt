the average intelligence of the human race has been steadily increasing , scientists have claimed
in research looking back over iq tests from the past few decades , they found that the tests were becoming harder - but people were still doing just as well
but the reasons why people are becoming smarter is not known - with theories including better education and improved medical care
researchers at kings college london looked at scores over 64 years
in total , more than 200,000 participants in iq tests were studied
since 1950 , average intelligence was found to have risen by about 20 iq points
explanations include better education ( stock image shown ) and improved medical care the research , titled a cross-temporal meta-analysis of rpm and reported by william kremer for the bbc , was published in the journal intelligence
carried out by wongupparaj , veena kumari and robin morris from kings college london , they looked specifically at the rpm ( rpm )
poverty affects the intelligence of children as young as two , a separate study in december 2014 found - and its impact increases as the child ages
deprived young children were found to have iq scores six points lower , on average , than children from wealthier families
and the gap got wider throughout childhood , with the early difference tripling by the time the children reached adolescence
scientists from goldsmiths , university of london compared data on almost 15,000 children and their parents as part of the twins early development study ( teds )
the study is an on - going investigation socio - economic and genetic links to intelligence
this tasks participants with looking for patterns in an array of shapes - and is thought to be a good measure of intelligence
in total , more than 200,000 participants from 48 countries over 64 years were studied in the research
since 1950 , it was found that the average intelligence had risen by the equivalent of 20 iq points
' rpm is a valid and reliable measure of general iq , dr wongupparaj told mailonline
' also , it is cultural - free test so that it has been widely used for nearly 80 years
' â iq tests are designed to ensure that the average result is always 100 , so this is a significant jump , â the bbc reported
the research builds on earlier evidence from philosopher and psychologist flynn , from the university of otaga in new zealand
he had noticed that iq tests were getting harder , but people were still getting similar scores on them - which became known as the flynn effect
this graph shows how the rpm ( rpm ) scores have been increasing over time
rpm is seen as an accurate way of measuring intelligence , and ' it is cultural - free test so that has been widely used for nearly 80 years , ' dr wongupparaj told mailonline the research was carried out by scientists from kings college london
they looked specifically at the rpm ( rpm ) - an example is shown
this tasks participants with looking for patterns in an array of shapes - and is thought to be a good measure of intelligence apparently , if modern us took a test from a century ago , they would get a relatively high average iq score of 130 ; vice versa , and our ancestors would score a measly average of 70
this equates to a three - point rise in iq per decade
according to the new study , though , outside of the us the biggest change was clearly in developing countries , iq was â catching up with the developed world â
â there are multiple possible reasons proposed for this phenomenon , â they write
these include improved education , increased exposure to testing , improved medical care and nutritition and decreased family size
perhaps most importantly , though , is that the instance of iq increasing was not just true in general for the world as a whole - but could also be noticed on a much smaller scale
â the flynn effect is strong enough to be showed in even small and non-representative samples as well as in the very young and older adults , â the researchers conclude .
