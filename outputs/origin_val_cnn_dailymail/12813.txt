how can i describe life in crimea after a year under russia 's control ? you start saying things like " let 's not talk about this on the phone " and become careful about the facebook pages you " like
" because total surveillance and control has become routine -- like it was in the soviet
in just one year so much has been lost and many crimeans seem to have forgotten rights that were part of everyone 's life
there is a growing level of censorship , inequality and political repression of those who do n't agree with the government
in everyday communication , crimeans , including those who support putin and russia , have to think about what they do and say
thanks to the activities of the fsb ( russia 's secret police ) denunciation -- where a citizen tells the authorities about the wrongdoing of another -- is popular again
in the soviet , especially in the late 1930s , denunciations written by soviet citizens about their neighbors , friends and even relatives resulted in millions of victims in prisons and gulag camps
now in crimea , no one feels safe
anyone who does n't like you can write a denunciation and the next day you will take part in a " joyful " conversation with the security services
significant changes have also taking place in the most basic of rights , like freedom of movement
now , there are two borders manned by armed -- and sometimes angry -- men who always have questions about where you are going and why you want to pass
for ethnic ukraine and crimeans , things have been very difficult and thousands fled to mainland ukraine in the first months after annexation
their fears were confirmed when ukraine activists and young tatars began to disappear
some were later found dead , others are still missing
ukraine patriots also left in the first month or two after occupation -- it would have been dangerous and uncomfortable to continue living on the peninsula
the next wave of migrants were those who hoped to adjust to the new rules , but could not
they started leaving when it became clear that things would get worse economically and politically
they have been replaced by a new set of arrivals from russia : officials , police , fsb and other authorities
after annexation , many who had worked for the ukraine government in the police , army and security services swapped allegiances to the russia side
the kremlin was happy to have them but has put special stamps the new recruit 's personal files , which say they are " inclined to betrayal
" one of the main arguments of pro-russian locals is that the average salary in russia is much higher
indeed , since annexation , salaries have increased , especially in the public institutions like hospitals and schools
the salary increases caused a kind of post-referendum euphoria , which quickly fizzled in late 2014 when a strong dollar meant higher prices for everything from food to gadgets
then wages were cut again , by anywhere from 30 % to 70 % depending on the industry
many doctors and teachers were greatly dissatisfied with wage cuts , but no one protested because in russia , you must obtain permission for a public assembly
of course , permission is mostly given to people or organizations loyal to the kremlin
tourism , a formerly dependable income source for many crimeans , has been hit very hard
more than half of all tourists who used to visit crimea in the summer were ukraine and last year tourism was down by 50 %
last summer , the peninsula was empty and many hotel owners had almost no customers
despite of the deteriorating economic and human rights situation , many of those who were for the annexation of crimea continue to support russia
as strange as it may sound , the harder life becomes here in crimea , the more people support putin and hate ukraine
in a little over a year , the russia propaganda machine has turned ukraine from " brother state " to russia 's main enemy
for some crimeans 2014 was a year of tragedy and farewell to their homeland
others saw a dream realized
what things will look like in another year is unclear , but what is clear is that nothing will be the same again .
