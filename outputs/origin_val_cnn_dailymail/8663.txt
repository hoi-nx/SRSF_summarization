the morning after she so memorably sashayed through westminster abbey clad in a cream silk dress that showcased her famous derriÃ¨re , the world seemed to be pippa 's oyster
not only had the duchess of cambridge 's younger sister come dangerously close to upstaging her older sibling , her obvious lust for life and ever - ready smile swiftly won her admirers from across the social spectrum
but almost four years on from the royal wedding of april 2011 , things are looking very different for 31 - year - old miss pippa
writing in the daily mail at the time , reviewer jan moir pointed to her less than original ideas ( pumpkins at halloween anyone ? ) and her lack of any obvious qualifications beyond penning the blog on her parents ' party pieces website
' from the moment she appeared in butter satin at her sister âs wedding , pippa has struck absolutely no one as the kind of girl you would always find in the kitchen at parties , ' continued moir
' and would she really have gained a lucrative publishing contract to write about something she calls " simple , creative entertaining " if her sister were not married to a member of the royal family ? ' it was n't the first time that the question had been asked and it certainly would n't the last
next came news of a column for waitrose kitchen , which launched in april 2013 although not before a storm of criticism had broken over both magazine and writer 's heads
established chefs were appalled that a woman with no obvious cooking experience had been hired and accused waitrose kitchen of publicity seeking , while pippa was once again charged with capitalising on her royal connections
at the time , editor william sitwell hit back , arguing that pippa ' will be an excellent contributor to the magazine , bringing with her a wealth of experience of entertaining , gained in part from working at her family 's party business
' critics disagreed and pointed to the 31 - year - old 's lack of kitchen experience and talent for stating the obvious , with lines such as ' regardless of how tired i might be , the moment friday lunchtime arrives i get that contagious pre-weekend excitement ' widely mocked
nevertheless , the pippa bandwagon rolled on , with the duchess of cambridge 's sister adding a telegraph column and the role of contributing editor at vanity fair to her cv
then it all began to go wrong
first , in march 2013 , she was dropped by her literary agent david godwin who had helped her launch celebrate ! royal relations : pippa , left , at the royal wedding and right , at the 2013 christening of prince george speaking after the news broke , he said : ' i am very sorry it has happened , but yes , it is true : i no longer represent pippa and i wish her every good luck
' then , with lacklustre sales uppermost in publisher 's minds , plans for a follow up to celebrate ! were quietly shelved
in january 2014 , her us publisher viking dropped her altogether having sold just 18,000 copies of the book , with a source telling the sunday times that ' pippa 's celebrate sales are nothing to celebrate
' she was a superstar after the wedding , and everybody thought it would be a success
even sarah ferguson sold more books when she started her writing career
' just six months later , in june last year , her telegraph column , only six articles old , was axed after the paper discovered that its readers ' just were n't into it '
a source , speaking at the time , added : ' there was a lot of negative mail coming in after each column and there were too many off - limit subjects for her
they ran out of ideas
' her vanity fair column , meanwhile , was laughed at , with the 31 - year - old once again accused of trading on her royal connections and of stating the obvious
passion : pippa 's most recent column for vanity fair focused on the best places to ski problems : brother james , seen at the invictus games , has also been accused of trading on his royal relations one particularly memorable line in a piece on royal ascot written in june 2014 read : ' car park 7 ( which is reserved for royal enclosure members ) is also a lovely spot to soak up the atmosphere and watch people , their hats , and general activity pass by
' her most recent column focused on where to ski , with courchevel , st. moritz and royal favourite verbier all coming highly recommended
but while pippa 's foray into travel writing went relatively smoothly , her attempt to move into tv is apparently over before it even began
wooed by us broadcaster nbc after an interview conducted by host matt lauer proved a ratings winner , attempts to turn her brand of pippa magic into something more substantial hit the buffers when she apparently ' failed to convince ' in pilot scenes
according to reports over the weekend , talks over a Â£ 400,000 contract have ' stalled ' with sources describing a scene featuring wild west dancing as ' cringe - worthy '
not that you would know it from her december 2014 column for the spectator
excitedly describing her visit to wyoming , pippa gushed about her experience of line - dancing and talked of the ' stunning ' mountain scenery
' not convincing ' : pippa was a ratings hit when she appeared on nbc but contract talks have stalled ' wyoming is real cowboy country , ' she continued
' everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big , non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards
' not one to claim the laurels undeserved , she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on strictly come dancing
' it âs easy to get carried away with the whole free - riding atmosphere
my dance partner was about 80 , and i did my best to keep up , ' she continued
' but it turns out i have two left feet , at least as far as moving to rhythm is concerned
and yet , sources say that the breakdown of talks is n't only because of pippa 's ' two left feet '
indeed , as the more charitably minded have pointed out , she has plenty going for her in the uk - a factor that has made her reluctant to relocate to new york
that she is so attached to london has more than a little to do with the increasingly busy role she has taken on at the british heart foundation , a charity which she has long championed
taking priority : pippa has taken on an increasingly busy role at the british heart foundation love : boyfriend nico lives in geneva and friends say pippa was reluctant to put more distance between them then there 's boyfriend nico jackson , 36 , who has been part of her life since 2012 , but lives in geneva - friends say she was reluctant to make the distance between them even larger
more reasons to stay include her job editing the party times , the online magazine belonging to her parents ' company party pieces , and her continuing work for the spectator and waitrose kitchen
next month , pippa will become an aunt for the second time when her sister gives birth to a brother or sister for prince george
in june , she has another big engagement coming up , leading the london to brighton charity bike ride as part of her work for the british heart foundation
indeed , it seems there 's no shortage of things to keep pippa , whose company recently posted a healthy Â£ 220,000 profit , busy
she might have lost a column and a Â£ 400,000 deal with nbc but while she is no longer the fresh - faced ingenue who burst onto the scene so memorably in 2011 , the younger pippa sister clearly is n't beaten yet .
