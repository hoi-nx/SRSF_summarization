he said : ' i am privileged to be able to say that castle howard is my family 's heritage and has been since it was built over 300 years ago
' with that privilege comes the responsibility of ownership , and the trustees ' unanimous decision to hold this sale is the exercise of that responsibility
' if the sale helps to secure that heritage as the house moves into its fourth century then it will have achieved its goal
