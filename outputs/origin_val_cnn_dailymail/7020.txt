china has seen the first successful flight of a commercial airplane powered by what 's probably the country 's biggest threat to food safety - waste cooking oil
the boeing - 800 aircraft , operated by hainan airlines , flew around 100 passengers from shanghai to bejiing
it meant china joined a handful of countries in the world that possess the research and development ability to create its own biofuel production technology , according to the people 's daily online
pioneer : hainan airlines flew a boeing like this one using a biofuel made from cooking oil but the fact that the new fuel was developed from waste cooking oil - which is in all too plentiful supply in china , leading to many problems with blocked drains and sewers - has prompted excitement in the country
apart from the environmental concerns surrounding the dumping of cooking oil , there is also widespread concern about how much of it ends up on dining tables around the country after unscrupulous dealers remove it from drains and sell it back to retailers
the carrier informed all the passengers before departure that the aircraft would use a new type of fuel
' the flight was very smooth
i did n't experience anything unusual , ' said pu ming , vice president of hainan airlines who was also a passenger on the flight
' i hope the biofuel could be promoted throughout the country
' ' when i was asked on the phone whether or not i would mind flying with a plane using biofuel , i said of course i would n't
i 'd love to be a lab mouse , ' said one passenger named ms zhong
' the successful flight is a landmark and on one hand the low carbon biofuel significantly reduces greenhouse gasses which helps china realise its 2020 carbon dioxide emissions per gdp by 40 - 50 per cent , ' said lu dapeng , spokesman of sinopec
' on the other hand , it could help with altering the route of catering waste oil and help stop the danger of it from ending up on the dinner table
' food safety : the illegal recycling of waste cooking oil is a constant headache for the china authorities fly greener : the government is seeking to promote greater environmental sustainability produced by sinopec , china 's state - owned oil and gas company , this particular biofuel uses restaurant waste cooking oil , often known as the ' gutter oil ' in china , as the raw material
the cooking oil is then blended at a one - to - one ratio with ordinary jet fuel to create the finished product
animal fat is the reason why waste cooking oil can be turned into biofuel
sinopec has spent the past five years researching and developing biofuel , according to researcher xu hui , who also stated that the price of biofuel is two to three times more expensive than normal aviation fuel due to the cost of the raw material
apart from animal fat - based biofuel , china is also developing sugar - based and starch - based biofuels , whose prices are expected to be 15 - 80 per cent of normal aviation fuel
waste cooking oil is often collected by underground dealers in china
it 's then reprocessed in rudimentary means and will return to millions of dining tables
however , many airlines in china are reluctant to use biofuel due to its high cost , reported people 's daily online .
