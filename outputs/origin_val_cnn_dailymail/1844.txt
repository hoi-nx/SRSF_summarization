thanks to beautiful celebrities such as kim and beyonce , who 've perfected the use of instagram and twitter to share new images of their enviable faces and bodies , we 're always on the hunt for new ways to perfect our own shots
but for many of us , it is n't a case of ' i woke up like this ' , as a recent study revealed that women spend a total of 753 hours taking , deleting , retaking and touching up their selfies to look picture perfect - and it seems we may not be alone
certain celebrities and their all - too - perfect social media snaps have come under fire , with fans accusing them of giving themselves a digital do - over
i am guilty of putting a filter on , which changes the lighting of the image , but i have never changed my body shape or retouched out any imperfections
' ex on the beach downloaded facetune , an app that lets you retouch your skin , body shape , whiten your eyes and teeth , and had a play around on a few images of herself to see exactly what others are up to
' i actually think i look weird in the after shots , ' she said
' i think i look better before but that could be because i have n't got the hang of the app yet
' it is so sad that we are in a digital age where this is even possible as it makes us all insecure when we see these perfect women on twitter and instragram
' ex on the beach , pictured , left , naturally , and , right , after enhancing her snap , downloaded facetune , an app where you can retouch your skin , body shape , whiten your eyes and teeth ex on the beach says that beyonce is a prime example of this
in november last year , twitter fans slammed beyonce for what they believed to be a round of photoshopped images
the 33 - year - old posted some racy selfies to her tumblr while wearing a leotard printed with the words ' 99 problems but my a * * ai n't one '
fans , however , called foul
according to buzzfeed there was something fishy about how the curtains behind beyonce 's hips curve inward
ex on the beach , who thinks she looks worse in the after shot , right , said it is ' so sad ' that we are in a digital age that makes us all insecure when we see seemingly perfect women on twitter and instragram ex on the beach , pictured , left , before , and , right , after using the app , shows how skin can be smoothed using it a month earlier , in september , the halo singer was accused of photoshopping a thigh gap into snaps of her on a yacht for her birthday celebrations
and in yet another instance she was accused of altering a photo of her playing golf in a bikini in april last year
ex on the beach said : ' beyonce changes her body curves a lot in images
it 's sad to see possibly one of the most powerful women in the world , who claims to be a feminist , bowing down to the pressures of trying to look perfect in every single picture
' ex on the beach says that beyonce changes her body curves a lot in images and says it 's sad to see possibly one of the most powerful women in the world doing it she continued : ' there is too much pressure on young girls growing up in today 's society with a fake impression of how they should look as they grow into a women
' the celebrities of our age who are on instagram and twitter are editing their images into better versions of themselves
this makes other women feel inferior and unattractive
this can lead to all sorts of problems for others including eating disorders , drastic plastic surgery and non-surgical enhancements
' now , ex on the beach is pledging to hashtag all of her images with # filterfreebycg - and she 's asking others with a big social media following , as well as celebrities , to do the same
' that way , ' she adds
' we are nât fooling our followers
on top of that it would be great to see all women embracing their looks and hash tagging their images with the same
