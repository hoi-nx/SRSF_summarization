police had to scale scaffolding , despite facing a hail of bricks and being threatened with spades as two caravans were set on fire
in some cases officers had to use a cherry picker to get to the top of 40ft towers erected by the travellers
protesters had strapped themselves to buildings and scaffolding and some were chained by their necks to ruined vehicles filled with concrete
officers had to hacked through shabby fences and break through gates to get into the site but eventually , the protesters were removed .
