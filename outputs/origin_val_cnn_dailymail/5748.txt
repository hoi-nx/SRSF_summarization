a bungling u.s. military officer mistakenly disclosed ' military secrets ' during a media briefing last month when he accidentally blurted out the expected timing for an iraq - led ground offensive in the city of mosul
the briefer , whose presentation for reporters at the pentagon on february 19 was authorized by central command , said the u.s. wanted the iraq to launch the offensive in april or may , although he also said it might go later
' that clearly was neither accurate information nor , had it been accurate , would have been information that should be blurted out to the press , ' defense secretary ash carter told the senate armed services committee
' so it 's wrong on both scores
it has been widely known for months that the offensive is in the planning stages and that it would likely mark a decisive moment in the campaign to dislodge the islamic state from iraq
islamic state fighters overran mosul last june
iraq government forces folded quickly , leading to the start of a u.s. - led bombing campaign in iraq in august
army gen. dempsey , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , who was testifying alongside ash carter , said he had discussed the mosul briefing with gen. lloyd austin , head of central command
' he 's conducting an internal inquiry , ' dempsey said , adding that he is confident austin will ' take the appropriate action
' he did not say what that might be
the briefing was done by an officer at central command headquarters in tampa , florida
he spoke by phone to a group of reporters in the pentagon on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by central command
fighters from the islamic state group parade in a commandeered iraq security forces armored vehicle down a main road at the northern city of mosul : an offensive is now expected to begin later this year with iraq 's security forces requiring more time for u.s. - organized training the episode is remarkable in at least two respects
it was unusual for the u.s. military to disclose in advance the expected timing of an offensive as well as details about the makeup of the iraq force that would undertake it
and it was curious that a secretary of defense would wait nearly two weeks after such a briefing to denounce it publicly for having spilled military secrets
asked about it by reporters twice last weekend , ash carter was more circumspect
' the important thing is that it will get done when it can be done successfully , ' he said last friday , referring to the mosul offensive
' and even if i knew exactly when that was going to be , i would n't tell you
' asked to comment again the following day , ash carter said it 's important to keep the public informed , ' consistent with security and other considerations
' on tuesday he was more pointed and expansive in directly criticizing central command
' it is important that we be open as a department â not with military secrets and not with war plans , which was the mistake made in this case â but we do try to keep the country informed of what we 're doing , ' he said
' it 's about protecting them
and so , openness is important but it has to have limits when it comes to security matters , and those limits obviously were n't respected in this case
