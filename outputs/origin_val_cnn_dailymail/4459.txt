toffees 's defence may have been ruthlessly exposed by dynamo kiev on thursday but martinez 's problems do n't end there
the toffees were second best in all areas of the pitch as they exited the europa league 6 - 4 on aggregate , leaving them to concentrate on a premier league campaign which has failed to ignite
with martinez 's men languishing 14th in the table - 23 points and nine places worse off than at this stage last season - sportsmail takes a look at the underperforming players the spaniard must get rid of this summer if the blues are to get back on track in 2015 - 16
toffees 's players look dejected during their 5 - 2 defeat at dynamo kiev in the europa league last 16 toffees boss martinez has a huge summer ahead of him when the transfer window opens tim howard after a stellar first season under martinez and some brilliant performance at the world cup with the usa , tim howard been arguably toffees 's worst player this season
high profile errors - particularly at home to chelsea , crystal palace and leicester - have helped cost the toffees much - needed points and contributed to a shaky , unsure defence
martinez 's decision to return tim howard to his starting xi after injury - despite some promising displays from joel robles - has backfired
at 36 , he will only get worse
goalkeeper tim howard is left on the turf at the olympic stadium after conceding a third goal on the night antolin alcaraz off the pace and out his depth against dynamo kiev , antolin alcaraz 's 18 months at goodison park have been a mixed bag of injuries , decent performances and some truly awful defending
the paraguayan , who was also part of martinez 's back - three at wigan , lacks the speed and consistency to play for a team with europe aspirations , while he is always liable to pick up a knock
with his contract up at the end of the season , it 'd be wise to invest antolin alcaraz 's wages elsewhere
antolin alcaraz had an evening to forget as the toffees were dumped out of europe in embarrassing fashion steven pienaar a regular under david moyes , steven pienaar has simply been unable to stay fit under martinez
he shone on the opening day of the season against leicester , working in tandem with baines down the toffees ' left side , but has not played since mid-december and has made just eight premier league appearances this season
the team has missed his partnership with baines , guile and eye for a pass but , at 33 and with his injury problems persisting , steven pienaar 's time in the first - team looks over
steven pienaar ( right ) , pictured in action against krasnodar , has barely played this season due to injuries sylvain distin age appears to have finally caught up with sylvain distin after a catastrophic start to the season left him out of the team and almost certainly on his way out of the club
the 37 - year - old was consistently at fault in the early stages of the campaign , contributing to the toffees ' awful defensive record with ponderous , error - prone displays
now stuck playing for the under 21 side after falling out of favour with martinez , it 's time the frenchman hung up his boots or moved on
defender sylvain distin is believed to have fallen out with martinez and has not played since last year aiden mcgeady over a year into his toffees career and aiden mcgeady is still yet to show the form which convinced spartak moscow to spend almost Â£ 10million on him in 2010
although quick with the ball at his feet , the republic of ireland international 's delivery leaves much to be desired and he has chipped in with just one goal since his arrival
improvement is needed if he is ever going to earn a regular place in martinez 's starting xi - and in the hearts of evertonians
aiden mcgeady , pictured being sent off against west ham , has struggled to make an impact at toffees gareth barry one of the most important cogs in martinez 's well - oiled machine of last season , gareth barry has fallen well below the high standards he set last year
at 33 he has played too much football in 2014 - 15 and should 've been rested when in the midst of an awful run of form prior to christmas
nevertheless he looks to be growing slower by the game and is struggling more and more to keep up with the pace of the premier league
gareth barry , pictured tussling with kiev 's andriy yarmolenko , struggled with the pace of the ukrainian side tony hibbert another player with an awful fitness record , tony hibbert has managed just four premier league appearances all season and last played in the top - flight on december 6
as a local lad with over a decade at the club it 's easy to let sentiment get in the way when it comes to tony hibbert and his role as a squad player
but with promising defender tyias browning coming through the ranks , there 's little need for him now
