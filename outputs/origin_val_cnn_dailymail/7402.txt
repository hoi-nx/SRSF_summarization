an interior designer who was cut out of her mother âs Â£ 2.5million will has won a legal fight with her brother to keep her home
sunita day , 45 , who once dated sir terence conran , was disinherited by her gambling - addict mother russell
but a judge ruled yesterday that she was entitled to keep an Â£ 800,000 flat she had been given in 1995
sunita day , 45 , ( left ) was disinherited by her mother russell before her death in 2013 and everything was left to her brother rajan russell ( right ) the court heard that restaurateur mrs russell , who died in 2013 , underwent a personality change after being diagnosed with cancer
she frittered away much of her fortune in casinos and turned against her daughter
mrs russell left her entire estate to mrs day âs older brother , investment banker rajan russell
he maintained the estate included his sister âs flat in battersea , london
mrs day , who made headlines when she was in her 20s for â stepping out â with designer sir terence conran , 38 years her senior , said the flat had been a gift to get her on the property ladder
before her illness her mother , to whom she had been very close , often showered her with presents , she told central london county court
â she was always buying me things like mink coats and jewellery â you name it i had it , â mrs day said
â i was spoilt ... the flat just followed
â but she said her mother âs gambling addiction turned her into â a harridan with a capital h â and at one point she feared mrs russell would have her â bumped off â to get the flat back
her mother had given her a luxury Â£ 800,000 flat in battersea , south london ( pictured ) 20 years ago but mr rajan russell claimed it was part of his mother 's estate during her final years , her mother had visited casinos every night and even resorted to stealing gambling chips , mrs day claimed
she said she lived in fear of her multi-millionaire brother , whom she called â bully boy raj â , and that he was jealous of anything their mother gave her
mr rajan russell , 47 , denied his sister âs claims
but after a four - day hearing , judge marc dight ruled that mrs day was entitled to keep the flat , which had been â freely gifted â
he rejected mr rajan russell âs claim that she merely held the flat as a trustee and ruled he was entitled to only a Â£ 55,000 stake in the property to reflect a mortgage paid off by his mother
judge marc dight also ordered mr rajan russell to pay most of his sister âs six - figure legal bill
however he rejected mrs day âs claims that she had been put under â duress or undue influence â by her brother and mother
he said mrs russell âs personality had changed after her cancer diagnosis in march 2010
in a document she wrote in may 2012 explaining why she had disinherited her daughter , she claimed mrs day â never came to see me while i had breast cancer and has been very disagreeable all her life since the age of 14
i feel like i have done three life sentences with sunita day â
the judge said : â by the end of her life , and certainly from the time she was diagnosed with cancer , mrs russell had a deep - rooted and unhealthy gambling habit
â she was very unwell
the evidence satisfies me that she was unkind to those around her , including mrs day
she was manipulative with her relatives and many of her friends
â judge marc dight said mrs russell had tried to pressure and manipulate her daughter into giving her back the flat but mrs day had a â feisty â determination to hold on to the property
mrs day ( right , outside court this week ) ' stepped out ' with sir terence conran ( left ) when she was in her 20s and previously gave an interview to a magazine which ' dealt ' with their relationship
