as george osborne delivered his â giveaway â budget today , it was n't just his generous economic measures that got people talking
the chancellor of the exchequer appeared to be in the final stages of an image overhaul , adding the finishing touches to his new slimline figure and modern haircut with a trendy suit
and as he stepped out of number 11 downing street this morning , he was snapped with what appeared to be a face of makeup
however , thanks to a lifestyle makeover â which included lots of jogging and fasting twice a week on the 5:2 diet â the chancellor today cut a trimmer figure
the 43 - year - old 's new haircut was also compared to hollywood movie star antonio banderas âs in his early days , with a miniature wispy fringe edged over his forehead
but it was mr george osborne 's new suit that really drew reaction , with comments flooding on social media
mr george osborne 's new look echoed that of hollywood actor antonio banderas mr george osborne was wearing a thick layer of make - up to present the budget critics called the ensemble a strange cut â and said it appeared too large around the shoulders and too short in the length of the trousers
it also featured large stitching around the lapels that gave it a childlike quality
but it was the decision to go for the old - fashioned , three - button suit that really got people talking on twitter
jack harvard taylor posted : ' not a fan of george osborne 's suit - strange cut
' while jon pace tweeted : ' my old boss was on jury service and was convinced a man was guilty on the basis he was wearing a suit like george osborne 's ! ' and kenny farquharson added : ' george osborne controversially going for three - button suit , against gentlemen 's outfitters orthodoxy
' twitter was awash with comments about george osborne 's suit today mailonline fashion expert simon glazin said : ' he may be delivering the budget , but i did n't realise george osborne was shopping on a budget
' this suit screams cheap to me
you can tell by the strange stitching and the high - cut , sloppy lapels
also a big give away is the wrinkling material
' it definitely looks budget to me
and a three - button jacket is a very old school , strange choice
' maybe his expensive suits were all at the dry cleaners
' bad timing , and bad choice , for one of his biggest and most - covered speeches in the commons

despite a few setbacks , the chancellor 's style transformation has been a vast improvement on his original look of five years ago
the style overhaul has been thanks to one of his senior government aides , rogers , who used to work as a producer for bbc political editor nick robinson before mr george osborne hired her to manage his image
as well as his new look , she has also been responsible for the increase in appearances at places like building sites to make him appear more down to earth
thanks to a healthier lifestyle - and the 5:2 diet , which involves fasting for two days of the year , george osborne has lost weight as part of his style makeover - pictured , left , in 2014 , and , right , today mr george osborne has made appearances at places like building sites to make him appear more down to earth ms rogers was responsible for his new haircut and also for putting him on the 5:2 diet , which saw him slim down dramatically over the course of a year
the diet requires mr george osborne to limit his intake to 600 calories two days a week and eat normally on the other five
it has been reported that the new look has been tailored to give him the best possible chance of succeeding david cameron as prime minister when the time comes
