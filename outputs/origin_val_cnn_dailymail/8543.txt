joke : presenter boris lange told visitors the ' painting ' was done by famous swedish artist ' ike andrews ' and say everyone of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie a man in a flatcap , beard and glasses , claims he can ' clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism ' when asked how much they believe the artwork to be worth , one guesses ' over 1,000 euro ' , while another says : ' if you could buy this for 2.5million euros , i 'd do it
' ' the whole day everyone thought our " painting " amazing , ' the team behind the prank says
' when the people talked about that this image is a symbol of the painters spirit , and that it could be worth a 200,000 euros or even 2.5million euros it made us laugh inside ! ' when the pranksters told the art fans about their ikea hoax , a majority saw the funny side , but , lifehunterstv reveals , not all were pleased about being duped
' the last two guys could n't even say one word as a reaction and just walked away with red cheeks
we could feel the awkwardness '
taking it well : when the pranksters told the art fans about their ikea hoax , a majority saw the funny side hit a nerve ? two men who had praised the painting were so offended when told that it was a cheap ikea print that they left without a word this comes just days after ikea customers in the netherlands were stopped from organising a mass - game of hide and seek
a whopping 19,000 people signed up to a facebook group promoting a game at ikea 's amsterdam branch next month , and another 13,000 signed up for a game in the ikea store in the city of utrecht
but the swedish retail giant has bad news for folks wanting to hide among its room - like furniture displays : the numbers signing up are getting out of hand and the events have been blocked
' we have contacted these pages on social media and humbly asked them to have their hide and seek games somewhere else , ' ikea spokeswoman smedberg said tuesday
ms smedberg added that ikea does not want to be a spoilsport , but safety comes first .
