creflo dollar 's new scheme to raise $ 60 million to purchase a luxury gulfstream g650 airplane is the latest chapter in a long and sordid history of televangelists exploiting their churches ' tax - exempt status -- and their congregants -- to line their own pockets
preaching the word of faith , or " prosperity gospel , " and capitalizing on lax government oversight of his church 's finances has enriched dollars and his family to the detriment of his followers and the american taxpayer
creflo dollar , dollar 's 30,000 - member church , is a tax - exempt organization under the internal revenue code
that means the church 's donors receive a tax exemption for their donations ( including for dollar 's new jet ambitions ) , and the church pays no tax on the revenue
what 's more , because it is organized as a church , the federal government does not require world changers to file a publicly available tax return , as other nonprofit organizations are required to do
those tax returns provide at least some financial information to donors and the public about the organization , including its revenues , assets , expenditures and executive compensation
dollar is known for his custom suits , luxury homes and private jets that ferry him , among other places , from his home base in college park , georgia , to his satellite church in manhattan , where he and his wife reportedly have a $ 2.5 million apartment
for dollars , though , these excesses are n't embarrassments
instead , they are proof that his theology works , that god blesses the faithful with abundant riches
creflo dollar tells his congregants to " sow a seed " with him , promising that a plentiful harvest will be their own blessing and , essentially , a return on their investment
to promoters of the word of faith , or prosperity gospel , " sowing a seed " with your pastor is required for god 's blessing , even if you 're taking it out of your rent money or the last remaining cash in your wallet
many christians find word of faith a heretical theology , an embarrassing distortion of jesus christ ' teachings , not to mention a fraud on congregants
while the government can not constitutionally mediate theological disputes or otherwise interfere in a church 's internal affairs , it can use its oversight powers to ensure that preachers who use their pulpits for profit do n't exploit the tax advantages afforded to ordinary houses of worship to pursue their legitimate charitable purposes
in 2007 , the senate , under the chairmanship of iowa charles grassley sen. charles grassley , launched an investigation into the financial practices of six televangelists , including dollars
the committee requested documents from dollar and his wife , taffi , explaining that taxpayers " should be assured that their donations are being used for the tax exempt purposes of the organizations
" the documents sought by the committee included audited financial statements for world changers , information about related for - profit and nonprofit entities , and data on executive compensation and the church 's real and personal assets
more than three years later , after an outcry from the televangelists , most visibly dollar 's mentor kenneth copeland , the committee opted to abandon its efforts to instigate any sort of regulatory changes
instead , the committee called on the ministries to engage in " self - reform , " even though the committee staff 's findings plainly demonstrated that four of the ministries , including dollar 's , were unwilling to engage in any sort of meaningful transparency or accountability
of the six televangelists from whom the committee sought financial data , dollar was deemed the " least cooperative
" without creflo dollar 's cooperation , the committee was left to piece together a puzzle about his finances through public documents , third parties and news reports
it concluded that in 2006 , world changers had received $ 69 million in contributions at its atlanta church alone , that the dollars owned two multimillion - dollar homes in georgia , and that the church and related business entities had at various points owned four aircraft flown for personal use -- although none was nearly as pricey as the luxury dollar now seeks to acquire
the committee staff was clearly troubled by the array of business entities , " including private airports and aircraft leasing companies , " that raised red flags " about the use of the church 's tax - exempt status to avoid taxation
" precisely because of dollar 's lack of cooperation , the staff concluded , " we are unable to determine whether and the extent to which they are reporting and paying taxes on income earned in those entities
" dollar is now looking to raise $ 60 million for this new aircraft , purportedly " to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the lord jesus christ
" four years after the abandonment of the senate 's televangelist investigation , it looks like the absence of government oversight has only emboldened creflo dollar .
