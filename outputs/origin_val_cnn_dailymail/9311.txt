scientists using the hubble space telescope have confirmed that the jupiter - orbiting moon ganymede has an ocean beneath its icy surface , raising the prospects for life , nasa has revealed
the finding resolves a mystery about the largest moon in the solar system after nasa 's now - defunct galileo spacecraft provided hints that ganymede has a subsurface ocean during exploration of jupiter and its moons from 1995 to 2003
scientists told reporters on a conference call that it took some detective work to confirm the discovery
in this artist âs concept , the moon ganymede orbits the giant planet jupiter
a saline ocean under the moon âs icy crust best explains shifting in the auroral belts measured by hubble space telescope
scientists first suspected an ocean in ganymede in the 1970s , based on models of the large moon
nasa 's galileo mission measured ganymede 's magnetic field in 2002 , providing the first evidence supporting those suspicions
the galileo spacecraft took brief ' snapshot ' measurements of the magnetic field in 20 - minute intervals , but its observations were too brief to distinctly catch the cyclical rocking of the ocean 's secondary magnetic field
like earth , ganymede has a liquid iron core that generates a magnetic field , though ganymede 's field is embedded within jupiter 's magnetic field
that sets up an interesting dynamic with telltale visuals - twin bands of glowing aurora around ganymede 's northern and southern polar regions
as jupiter rotates , its magnetic field shifts , causing ganymede 's aurora to rock
scientists measured the motion and found it fell short
using computer models , they realized that a salty , electrically conductive ocean beneath the moon 's surface was counteracting jupiter 's magnetic pull
' jupiter is like a lighthouse whose magnetic field changes with the rotation of the lighthouse
it influences the aurora , ' said geophysicist saur , with the university of cologne in germany
' with the ocean , the rocking is significantly reduced
' scientists ran more than 100 computer models to see if anything else could be having an impact on ganymede 's aurora
they also repeated the seven - hour , ultraviolet hubble space telescope observations and analyzed data for both belts of aurora
' this gives us confidence in the measurement , ' saur said
nasa associate administrator green called the finding ' an astounding demonstration
' ' they developed new approach to look inside a planetary body with a telescope , ' green said
ganymede joins a growing list of moons in the outer solar system with subsurface water
on wednesday , scientists reported that saturn 's moon enceladus has hot springs beneath its icy crust
other water - rich worlds include jupiter moons europa and callisto
nasa hubble space telescope images of ganymede 's auroral belts ( colored blue in this illustration ) are overlaid on a galileo orbiter image of the moon
the amount of rocking of the moon 's magnetic field suggests that the moon has a subsurface saltwater ocean
scientists estimate the ocean is 60 miles ( 100 km ) thick , 10 times deeper than earth 's oceans , and is buried under a 95 - mile ( 150 - km ) crust of mostly ice
' it is one step further toward finding that habitable , water - rich environment in our solar system , ' said astronomer heidi hammel with the washington - based association of universities for research in astronomy .
