some united states military members on a ' kill list ' published by isis have said they are ' unfazed ' after having their names , photos and addresses leaked by the terrorist group
a list was posted online by a group called the ' islamic state hacking division ' gave personal information for 100 united states military members and called upon its lone wolf ' brothers residing in united states ' to kill them
however , several service members spoke out on sunday , saying that the intimidation tactic was ' not going to work '
one of three service members who spoke anonymously to abc said that it was not surprising that the extremists wanted to kill members of the united states military
' i would n't say i 'm scared , ' one said
' it 's just part of this ' new war ' against an enemy with a different , more developed capability than what we 've faced in the past
' we have to make the adjustments in order to continue to win the battles
' isis claimed it hacked several military servers , databases and emails to obtain the information
however , a defense official said that the list did not appear to be from a breach , and that the names and addresses were publicly available online
' we really were n't surprised because all the people i saw on that list are on a webpage some place anyways , all that information was already public , ' and identified soldier told abc
the group claimed it hacked several military servers , databases and emails to obtain the information on the list , though much of the information could be found publicly online posting read : ' kill them in their own lands , behead them in their own homes , stab them to death as they walk ' the islamic state hacking division posting read : ' with the huge amount of data we have from various different servers and databases , we have decided to leak 100 addresses so that our brothers in united states can deal with you
' and now we have made it easy for you by giving you addresses , all you need to do is take the final step , so what are you waiting for ? ' kill them in their own lands , behead them in their own homes , stab them to death as they walk their streets thinking that they are safe
' one anonymous serviceman said that the list 's publication was ' regrettable '
the defense department and the federal bureau of investigation are looking into the matter , the new york times reported
an official told the paper most of the information on the list could be found in public records , residential address search sites and on social media
many of the personnel on the list were mentioned in news articles about air strikes on isis
however some of them were part of units that had no connection to the middle eastern bombing campaign
the us marine corps said it was visiting all affected staff , and urged caution online
' it is recommended us marine corps and family members check their online / social footprint , ensuring privacy settings are adjusted to limit the amount of available personal information , ' us marine corps lieutenant colonel john caldwell said in a statement
he added that the threat remained ' unverified '
the us marine corps ( pictured , october 2014 ) announced that it was visiting all affected personnel and urged its soldiers to be careful about their online footprint isis ( pictured ) has claimed responsibility for previous online - based attacks on the united states military , notably hacking us central command 's twitter account in january us central command issued a statement on its facebook page saying that ' we are operating in a " new norm " in which cyber threats are real and constant
' ' any us central command teammate or family member could be targeted
to that end , we all should maintain a heightened sense of vigilance whether dealing with work or home computer usage , specifically as it relates to social media
' one serviceman said that ' we have a footprint -- the best we can do is to make that foot print not so deep in the sand '
the faces of the women who appeared on the list were blurred out
is has claimed responsibility for hacking attacks in the united states in the past , including against us central command , which oversees the air war against the is group
in january , the hacked us central command twitter feed posted what appeared to be an office phone directory of officers that was slightly out of date , forcing the military temporarily to take down the command 's twitter feed
the words ' cybercaliphate ' and ' i love you isis ' replaced us central command 's usual logo on twitter and youtube before the pages were suspended .
