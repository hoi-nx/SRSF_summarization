we will communicate directly with affected users with additional details
' the website additionally said in an email to customers that the information compromised could include usernames , email addresses , passwords and even some limit credit card information , which twitch described as ' card type , truncated card number and expiration date '
however , it added : ' twitch does not store or process full credit or debit card information , so your card number is safe
' the site has so far declined to comment beyond the official blog post
commenting on the attack , mark james , security specialist at eset said : ' gaming sites have always been a lucrative target
' not only do they represent gamers that may use the same login and passwords as similar sites but they also enable the possibility of other electronic goods to be stolen and sold elsewhere , in game items , in game gold
' there âs no perfect advice for when your details are stolen but changing your password is certainly one of the best
' the very best is to strengthen the importance of having unique passwords for each and every login you have - that way if your password is found it âs useless on another site

however , it does n't store full credit or debit card information , so stressed that individual card numbers are safe amazon bought the website ( pictured ) in 2014 for about $ 970 million ( Â£ 650 million ) , outbidding internet giant google for the company
