witness trevor oliphant said : ' when the little lad came in the dog went to his bed
the wee lad went to follow him and i said " i think he is tired "
it appeared the dog did n't want to play with him
' wilson denied wrongdoing claiming the boy 's injuries were caused accidentally
mckinley was taken to hospital where he was given eight stitches , leaving him with a scar above his eye she said her dog had always been allowed downstairs in the pub and had never had a problem with the animal previously
she said she was aware of gledhill and her children in the pub but ' had n't felt the need ' to take caine upstairs and ' had no worries about him at all '
she told police that she had earlier told the boy to stop bothering the dog who was ' always downstairs just trotting around , lying down '
she added : ' i allow children in my pub because i have six children of my own and 15 grandchildren
i have always said that other children can come in if they are supervised
' i have had christmas and halloween parties in my pub with 20 - plus children with no problem
as an animal he is very laid back
he gets bullied by my cat
' as a general rule if people say " i 'm not playing " he goes away
mckinley did go up to him a few times
i had asked him to leave the dog alone - he is not a toy
' but miss gledhill , who has since been barred from the pub , told the court : ' i had seen mckinley go up to the dog a few times but it does n't give the dog the right to bite my son
' there was a big gash to mckinley 's eye and around dogs now he is petrified
when he sees his scar he says he looks ugly
he wo n't leave the house without a cap on
' after the hearing she added : ' when it happened at first , i thought a pool ball had hit him in his face
it was all a blur but i was n't drinking
' the kids were always within eyesight as the pub is open and their dad was there and all our friends
there are loads of kids there
attack : cctv footage from the oddfellows arms , pictured , shown to bolton magistrates ' court , shows the schoolboy being licked by the landlady 's dog before it turns and bites him as he leans in for a cuddle ' when it happened mckinley kept saying " i 'm going to die , i 'm going to die "
he was braver than i would have been
' skin was hanging down and i could see lots of white bits which i guess was his tissue
' i tried to clean him up and then the ambulance said to put a dry towel on it
in the ambulance i was in shock
he was just covered in blood
' in hospital the doctor said that if the dog had bitten him a couple of millimetres lower , mckinley could have been blinded
' he was very lucky
it 's heartbreaking when he says he is ugly because of the scars
' after it happened we had to get rid of our jack russell rex who was a puppy we 'd got at christmas because mckinley was petrified of dogs
' now he is very conscious of his face and he says that his scar can itch and hurt
when i saw the cctv of the incident i started crying
' i do understand it is her pet but you do n't know with dogs - they can just turn
another kid could bend down and it could react the same
it could have happened to any kid
' father aaron , 32 , said : ' i know it 's a pub but it 's a family pub and there 's always lots of kids in there - and i want the dog to be destroyed for what it did to my son
