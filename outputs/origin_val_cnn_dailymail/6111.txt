a blind sled dog named gonzo is never far from his brother poncho , who for years has acted as his sight on the trails in nh
now that the alaskan husky brothers are nearing age 10 , sled dog rescue is looking to retire them and hope to send the two inseparable friends to the same family
both gonzo and poncho were born with sight but in 2010 , trainers started to realize gonzo was losing his sight when he started tripping over his food
inseparable : blind sled dog gonzo ( left ) is currently up for adoption with his brother poncho ( right ) , who has been acting as his sight on the trails for years
both are currently up for adoption , and their rescue center hopes to find them a home where they can live together when his blindness was initially diagnosed , a veterinarian urged his owners to keep him on the sled dog team , and that 's when poncho stepped up to the plate
' at first it kind of upset him ( poncho ) because it slightly hindered his ability to run straight because gonzo was leaning up against him , ' musher guerin told wmur
' over time , poncho kind of realized he was the only thing keeping his brother on the trail
he started to help him
if there was a left turn coming up or a right turn , he 'd pull him this way or nudge him that way and do whatever he had to do to make sure he ( gonzo ) did n't run off the trail or anything like that , ' guerin said
on the off occasion that gonzo has run off the trail , poncho has picked him up out of ditches by dragging him by the collar
a dog 's seeing eye dog : gonzo 's sight first started failing in 2010 , but his brother poncho stepped in and helped direct him on sled dog runs

while the reliance on poncho worked for several years , gonzo eventually had to quit sled running this fall , when a doctor removed the other eye that was giving him limited sight
since then he has become quite accustomed to life as an office dog while his brother continues to exercise with the other 131 dogs at the no - kill shelter
retirement - ready dogs at sled dog rescue can be adopted for a fee of $ 250 , part of which goes to supporting the shelter
this year they have about 40 dogs up for sale at their jefferson , nh facility
alaskan huskies can live to age 16 .
