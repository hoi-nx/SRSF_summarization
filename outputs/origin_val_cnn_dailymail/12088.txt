a highly successful businessman ' not willing to pay a penny ' to his wife in a multimillion - pound divorce battle has been slammed by a judge and told he must hand over around Â£ 80m
randy work , a former key executive in texan - based private equity company lone star , had argued in court that his wife was only entitled to Â£ 5m
the 47 - year - old said that ' unfortunately ' the mother of his two teenage children , gray , 45 , had failed to abide by a post-nuptial agreement
highly successful businessman randy work ( right ) , who was ' not willing to pay a penny ' to his wife gray ( left ) in a multimillion - pound divorce battle , has been told by a judge that he must hand over around Â£ 80m she was therefore prevented from receiving a more substantial sum - and would be given little over Â£ 3m when bills were paid
but mr justice holman , sitting in london , disagreed and told mr randy work : ' having offered to pay her nothing you now have to pay her tens of millions of american dollars
' he had told the businessman previously : ' i am not sure you and i are on the same planet
' the judge , sitting in the high court of london 's high court , said the couple had been equal partners in a relationship of more than 20 years
they married ' without a bean ' and the husband made his Â£ 150m fortune during the course of their marriage while supported by his wife , he added
mr randy work 's lawyers suggested he was entitled to a greater share of money because he made a ' special contribution ' through his skills at wealth - creating

mr randy work had argued the mother - of - two was only entitled to Â£ 5m after breaking a post-nuptial agreement in the witness box , the tycoon described how he had gone to japanese and made billions of dollars for lone star , buying up real estate , including troubled golf courses , after the japanese economy became stuck in a sharp downturn
mr randy work was ' the breadwinner ' and ms gray ' the homemaker ' , the court was told
he added that ms gray had been ' a good wife ' over 20 years and ' a good mother ' and would have been entitled to at least Â£ 70 million , the ' total sum payable ' under the post-nup agreement they signed in october 2000
but he argued that she was not entitled to any of his money , or any of his property , after coming to court to seek a better settlement
the judge disagreed and said : ' it would , in my view , be unsatisfactory and gender discriminatory now to make an unequal award
' mr randy work ( above ) must now pay Â£ 39m to ms gray within 28 days and the whole sum within 90 days he urged the couple to compromise and agree on a fair division of assets , including antique furniture and modern art , to achieve equal shares and ' to stop this terrible conflict '
the first tranche of Â£ 39m must now be paid to ms gray within 28 days of his ruling and the whole sum within 90 days
earlier , the judge described the two - week ' who - gets - what ' hearing as ' unedifying and destructive pugilism '
he told them as they sat on opposite sides of the courtroom there was ' plenty of money to go round ' , there were no difficulties and it ' should be so easy '
mr randy work and ms gray began living together in 1992 and married in california in 1995
they separated in 2013 and have two children , now aged 15 and 12
mr justice holman ( above ) disagreed with mr randy work and said : ' it would , in my view , be unsatisfactory and gender discriminatory now to make an unequal award ' in 1997 he was offered a job with lone star in dallas , texan , and soon afterwards he was offered a post in tokyo , where the couple lived from 1998 until 2005
they moved to the uk in 2008 and their matrimonial home has been in london ever since
the marriage broke down in 2013 when ms gray began an affair with the couple 's physiotherapist , referred to as ' mr h ' , and moved to a flat in kensington to live with her lover , the court heard
the judge said mr randy work was ' very shocked and very hurt by his wife 's infidelity and affair ' and it also caused considerable upset to the couple 's two children
but the judge said yesterday that ms gray had won the key arguments
she argued when she gave evidence that a clause in the addendum agreement to the post-nup gave her ' the unfettered right ' to seek from the court ' any form of financial provision the court has power to order '
she argued that the family wealth was generated during the marriage and there should now be an equal division of the current total net assets
during the hearing the judge repeatedly told charles howard qc , appearing for mr work , that he was ' really concerned ' about the husband 's ' open ' position that he was ' not going to pay her a penny '
the court heard that both mr randy work and ms gray were born in the american but had ' expatriated ' and both are now resident in london
ms gray told the court that the post-nup was part of the move to separate their assets when her husband first decided to give up his american citizenship to save tax in american
mr randy work , described in court as a world - class triathlete , denied that was true .
