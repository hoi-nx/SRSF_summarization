ms saldanha , a night shift nurse sister , was in charge of the hospital and transferred the hoax call to the duchess of cambridge 's bedside nurse
while ms greig said that she now understands that ' there is more to mental health ... it 's not normally an event like that that can trigger someone to commit suicide , ' she experienced overwhelming guilt at the time
ms greig said she had experienced deep depression for a year , and claimed that the event had changed her life permanently

' last year , ms greig said that she believed the incident would stay with her forever , but that she has done all she can do now that she has personally apologised to her family
' i do nât know how you completely forgive yourself â someone wrote my name in their suicide note , ' she told sunrise
' they thought of me before they took their own life and that will stay with me forever but i can move forward from that point i think because i 've tried to say sorry
' ' it was really tough but i made that promise to them over a year ago that if they wanted answers i would go to the inquest so i was always going to go , ' she said
' to be able to to look them in the eye and say sorry was incredibly hard but it âs something i felt i needed to do â everyone was very emotionally involved in that room
' ms greig now hopes she can try to move on with her life
' i do have a little bit more closure and i âve been finding it so hard to move forward and i think a lot of that had a lot to do with not being able to say sorry â just bearing that guilt and that blame , ' she said

' when asked how others involved in the prank had been able to put the tragedy behind them , ms greig simply replied that people handle situations differently
' some people were able to just move on from that â i was nât â it deeply affected me for a long time and when you are the face of blame publicly you believe it , ' she said
' as well , knowing jacintha herself has written my name in that suicide note and blamed me directly â you hold yourself responsible
' ms greig spoke of how the incident had taken its toll on her over the past two and a half years
' it took every bit of strength and every bit of support to get through that but you have a choice you can keep fighting or you can let it just take you over and i wanted to fight - life is so precious , ' she said
' i wanted to try to get better and a part of that was going to the inquest and saying sorry and helping the family out so combined i feel i âve got everything so i can truly move forward
