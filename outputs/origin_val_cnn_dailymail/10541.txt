over the last few weeks , jeremy has had to defend himself from all sides as he faced the axe from his top gear show
but while the tv star went through a range of emotions under the glare of the media spotlight , one constant that remained by his side was an attractive blonde , who was the first to rush to jeremy 's london home following the news of his bbc sacking today
phillipa , 45 , has been a feature in jeremy âs life since 2010 , while he was still in a relationship with his wife frances
phillipa worked as an events organiser for the show and so she was constantly by the team âs side as they visited the exotic locations
it was her job to make sure that the events ran smoothly and all of the guests were briefed and relaxed ahead of their appearance
the pair were reported to have shared hotel rooms in several countries on tour and were said to be openly affectionate with each other in front of the rest of the crew
jeremy and phillipa arriving at sir david tang 's 60th birthday party last november at the dorchester in london they were first pictured together beside a pool on march 18 , 2011 , in johannesburg , where jeremy was rumoured to have fed phillipa lettuce with his fingers
a year earlier , jeremy had appeared to make reference to his rumoured love interest in a motoring column in a national newspaper where he discussed a time that he test drove a maserati in new zealand , with phillipa in the back seat
in the article , which lead with the headline , â lie back , leggy philippa , while i have some fun , â the presenter also referenced the blonde âs impressive stature
he wrote : â in the maserati there was space behind nigel for our green - room director philippa , who 's so tall she 's actually measured in hands
â at the time , both sides were quick to deny the affair , with phillipa telling the mirror : â jeremy and i are friends , i have worked with him , er , them ( the top gear team ) for years
â and after being told that she had been seen leaving his hotel room , she replied : â what ? i often stay in colleagues â hotel rooms â that âs not unusual
â for his part , jeremy said : â i âm surprised to find that i âm the new tiger woods
â jeremy enjoying a day by the beach along with phillipa in a greece island while on holiday in 2013 the pair appears to share a laugh together as they enjoyed a few drinks soon after the pictures appeared in a national newspaper , it was reported that phillipa had left her position on the show in a bid to placate jeremy âs furious wife , who had to learn of the affair while at home with their three children
after jeremy returned home , the couple then took their children on a family holiday to barbados in an effort to get past the event
phillipa in the sea on their greece holiday for a while , everything appeared to have calmed down and little more thought was given to phillipa , until she was pictured with jeremy on holiday in rome in november 2012 , more than a year after they were photographed together
the couple appeared to be staying at the Â£ 650 - a - night hotel ruisse , which is perfectly situated between the spanish steps and the piazza del popolo for a romantic weekend away
by this time , jeremy and his wife were living in separate homes , although they remained on good terms for the sake of their three children
the star regularly goes back to their old home in chipping norton , oxfordshire , to spend time as a family and the pair also attend lunches and dinner parties with their shared friends
the couple still share many friends and sometimes go to dinner parties or lunches together
last summer , jeremy admitted to his old enemy - mailonline us editor - at - large piers that he and francie were going through a divorce
piers told the mail on sunday that jeremy told him : â i âm going through a difficult divorce , my first ex-wife has also came out of the woodwork to give me hell
' i âm smoking too much , drinking too much , my back hurts , i âm all over the papers with this n - word scandal , i âm at war with my bbc bosses , and my mother has just died
' i simply do nât have the energy [ to war with ] you any more
â although phillipa shied away from joining jeremy at any social engagements in the uk , the pair were then spotted on holiday together again in march 2013 , when they were photographed on a yacht and on the balcony of the tv star 's apartment in sydney , while he completed top gear commitments
phillipa and jeremy on a weekend break to rome in 2012 five months later they visited greece in august 2013 and were pictured openly kissing one another at a beach - side taverna in greece as they shared some drinks
then in november 2014 , they made their first public appearance in the uk together , as she accompanied him to the 60th birthday bash of businessman sir david tang
although jeremy appeared to have a change of heart inside the venue and opted to leave with the writer rachel johnson as phillipa exited alone slightly later in the evening
but over the last few weeks , phillipa has put her concerns about appearing with the television presenter aside and has been pictured arriving at his london home , picking him up from an event at the camden roundhouse and most recently today , when she raced to his home after hearing of his sacking by the bbc
phillipa relaxes on a yacht in sydney while visiting jeremy on location with top gear jeremy and phillipa on the balcony of his sydney hotel apartment so just who is this woman , who has hidden in the wings as support after first falling for him five years ago ? phillipa , who stands at a statuesque 5ft 11ins is best known to her friends as pip and lives in hertfordshire with her son , who she conceived during a previous relationship with a man called edward taylor , who works as an operations director
she lives with her son , who she describes at the love of her life , on a farm not far from where she grew up with her family in a barn conversion in knebworth
philipa was always somewhat of a tomboy after growing up with two brothers , although she initially trained as a beautician and masseuse at the local country club after graduating from grammar school phillipa arrives at jeremy 's home in west london last week but the job did nât hold enough of a challenge for phillipa and she soon moved into events , where she eventually started working at top gear , where she stayed until she a newspaper reported on her alleged affair with jeremy in 2011
she now works at an events company in london called key events , which deals with big brands including coca cola , samsun and bacardi
and while jeremy âs career appears to have hit a roadblock , his relationship with phillipa has remained strong
the pair are now reported to be planning an exotic break in the next few weeks in order to escape the media glare .
