this was a walkover , a day reading undermined the race for premier league promotion in a bid to reach wembley
clarke 's decision to make nine changes is surely down to the ridiculous scheduling of monday âs fa cup quarter - final replay against bradford , but some of his championship counterparts might not be impressed
young reading were picked off by watford
that âs not the fault of clarke , the blame lying squarely with wretched broadcasting rules which deem domestic cup games can not be played on the same night as champions league fixtures
almen abdi ( centre ) got watford off to a dream start against reading by scoring inside a minute watford striker troy deeney celebrates almen abdi 's strike as the hornets set the tone for the match early on watford ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : gomes 6.5 ; marco motta 7.5 , ekstrand 7 , cathcart 6.5 , pudil 7 ; watson 8 , guedioura 7 ( layun 58 , 6 ) , tozser 6 ; almen abdi 7 ( fernando forestieri 7 , 8.5 ) ; matej vydra 8 ( angella 83 ) , troy deeney 7.5 subs not used : darren bond , doyley , paredes , anya goals : almen abdi 1 , matej vydra 39 , troy deeney 48 , fernando forestieri 85 reading ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : andersen 5 ; keown 6 , knight 6 ( novakovich 86 ) , cooper 5 ; travner 5.5 , akpan 6 , guthrie 6 , taylor 6 ( jem karacan 59 , 7 ) , stacey 6 ; cox 6 ( blackman 59 , 6 ) , yakubu 6 subs not used : lincoln , long , kuhl , edwards goal : jem karacan 70 referee : darren bond ( lancashire ) attendance : 16,600 but other managers , particularly mark warburton and steve mcclaren - whose sides both dropped points - may talk of a duty of care to the league , even if reading can do nothing but finish mid-table themselves
the average squad number of the visitors here was 26 , a statistic to tell all
clarke is set to name a completely fresh xi tomorrow night and was understandably prickly when asked about the changes
â what ramifications ? i ca nât think for the life of me why there would be any ramifications - i âm not concerned whatsoever , â he said
i âm allowed to pick from my squad , so i âll pick from my squad
â fifty - two seconds is all it took the hosts , troy deeney popping a neat ball into almen abdi , who stroked beyond anderson with the outside of his boot
marco motta âs stunning 30 - yard half - volley cannoned off the bar six minutes later
anderson then made an acrobatic save from early substitute fernando forestieri âs overhead kick , and this was put beyond doubt when matej vydra slipped his man and lifted into the net with ease before half - time
prior to the match watford players show their support for fan nick cruwys who was attacked last weekend matej vydra doubled watford 's lead shortly before half - time with a right - footed effort vyrdra ( right ) watches on as his shot goes past reading goalkeeper mikkel andersen on 39 minutes just after the break fernando forestieri darted round his man at the byline , allowing troy deeney to get in on the act , tapping home from inside the six - yard box
â i âve got to be happy today , â hornets boss slavisa jokanovic said
â reading have an important game in front of them - i expected changes
â to their credit , clarke âs side improved and he will leave vicarage road with some sense of satisfaction after jem karacan - making just his second appearance since september 2013 because of persistent knee problems - bent a classy consolation on his comeback
but fernando forestieri was to slam in a fourth late on , banging the club mascot âs drum in celebration
back in the top two , more and more are banging the premier league drum around these parts .
