a crowd of tens of thousands filled yitzhak rabin square in tel aviv on saturday evening , calling for a change in israeli leadership amid growing discontent with the current administration
the rally , called " israel wants change , " was put on by one million hands , a grassroots movement that focuses its efforts on two major issues : a two - state solution and a reduction in the cost of living
on both of these topics , founder dror ben-ami says , prime minister netanyahu has failed
" we think that the only way to go forward on that account is to change government and to get this current government out of office
to get netanyahu out of office , " says ben-ami
organizers are not promoting any specific candidate or pushing voters toward any political party in the march 17 balloting
instead , they are encouraging voters to change the current administration
police estimated the crowd at 40,000 people
headlining the rally was dagan , the former head of mossad , israeli 's spy agency , and a vocal critic of netanyahu
in recent weeks , dagan criticized netanyahu 's decision to speak before the congress , and he continued his criticism at the rally , saying that he has never seen such stagnation in israeli politics
netanyahu still has broad support in israeli , and his likud party is doing well in the polls
the zionist union is likud 's primary challenger
in the initial round of polling immediately following netanyahu 's speech before congress , the zionist union was expected to win 24 seats in the knesset while likud was expected to win 23 seats
the poll comes from cnn affiliate channel 2 israel
because of the nature of israeli politics , netanyahu 's likud party could lose the election while netanyahu still becomes prime minister
in many ways , this rally was reminiscent of a similar social movement that began in the summer of 2011
hundreds of thousands of protesters packed the streets of tel aviv , demanding improvements in the cost of housing , education , and health care
what started as a small social media campaign turned into a nationwide movement that spread to other major cities
this time , the issues are different
but the growing sense of discontent and the calls for change remain .
