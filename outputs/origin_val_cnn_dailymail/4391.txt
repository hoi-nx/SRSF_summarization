labour and the snp are ' half way down the aisle ' to stitching up a deal to put ed miliband in number 10 , the tories claimed today after nicola sturgeon dropped the party 's red line over nuclear weapons
ms nicola sturgeon said the snp would still be prepared to put mr ed miliband in downing street even if labour refused to scrap britain 's trident nuclear deterrent â a key plank of the nationalists ' manifesto
the scotland first minister said the snp would never vote to renew trident but she insisted there were ' many issues we could agree on '
ms nicola sturgeon played down the prospects of a formal coalition , but said the snp could prop up a labour government ' on an issue - by - issue ' basis
nicola sturgeon said the snp could still do a deal with the labour party even if ed miliband insists on renewing britain 's trident nuclear weapons she said : ' on that basis , there are many issues we could agree on which we would support but we would not vote for trident
' ms nicola sturgeon 's remarks , to the guardian , come amid growing pressure on mr ed miliband to rule out going into coalition with the snp in a bid to stem the party 's loss of support in scotland
tories chairman grant shapps said ms nicola sturgeon 's move opened to door for a deal between labour and the snp after the election
he said : ' ed miliband and the snp have signed the pre-nup and are now half - way up the aisle
' day after day , vote after vote in westminster parliament , ed miliband would be forced to negotiate with salmond - the man who tried to break up britain - about how to run britain
' make no mistake : an ed miliband government , propped up by the snp , would mean more debt than our children could ever hope to repay , higher taxes on hardworking people and economic chaos for our country
' a labour government propped up by the snp - handing mr ed miliband the keys to number 10 - moved a step closer after nicola sturgeon dropped a red line over trident nuclear weapons scotland will be able to ' call the tune ' at westminster after the general election , according to salmond
the former first minister , who is standing for the gordon constituency in may , said neither labour or the conservative ' are fit to govern ' and believes a large group of snp mps will lead to ' progress for scotland '
working with plaid cymru and the green party , mr salmond hopes to ' shake westminster to its foundations , to rumble up the house of commons '
speaking ahead of a constituency meeting in the village of insch , aberdeenshire , he said : ' it is now clear that neither tories or labour will win an overall majority
neither are fit to govern
' it is also clear that scotland is swinging behind snp candidates the length and breadth of the country
in that situation scotland can call the tune in the next westminster parliament
' now thoughts should turn to what that tune should be
nicola sturgeon has laid out a clear strategy and key priorities
' we can not give any support formal or informal to the tories because of their track record of hostility to scotland interests and the total bad faith of david cameron towards the scotland people the day after the referendum
' however , support for any other administration comes with the conditon of progress for scotland
' progress to fully deliver the promises on real powers that were made to the scotland people during the referendum
progress to signal an end to austerity economics with all the damage that this is doing to the country and finally common sense progress in stopping the waste of countless billions on new nuclear weapons
' it comes after a poll of marginal constituencies in scotland revealed that a dramatic surge by the snp could see labour lose almost 40 seats north of the border
the survey , by the tories peer lord ashcroft , showed the snp could win as many as 56 of scotland 's 59 seats â up from just six at present
the snp surge would claim seats held by a string of household names , including gordon brown , alistair darling and former charles kennedy leader charles kennedy
the poll suggests that labour and the conservatives would end up being tied on 272 seats each â well short of the 326 needed to command a commons majority
but a labour government could be propped up by the snp â handing mr ed miliband the keys to number 10
however , labour 's scotland mps are urging mr ed miliband to rule out a deal with the snp ahead of the election in an attempt to reverse his party 's dire poll ratings north of the border
labour is holding its annual conference in edinburgh this weekend
former prime minister sir john major has also warned labour against doing a deal with the snp
sir john major claimed ' the snp would enter into any agreement with labour with one overriding aim : to break up the britain '
writing in the daily telegraph , he said : ' labour now have to make a choice
' they must summon the courage of their convictions and declare their intent
the britain people â north and south of the border â do not deserve to be misled
labour must remove any doubt
' if the outcome of the general election is inconclusive , will they refuse to govern with the support of a party whose principal aim is to break up the britain ? ' the snp said that labour would ' not be forgiven by the people of scotland ' if they refused to work with the nationalists
deputy leader stewart hosie said : ' for a former tories prime minister to tell labour what to do on the eve of their conference in scotland is hugely embarrassing for ( labour ) jim murphy
' john major wants the tories to be re-elected in may , and therefore he wants labour to rule out an agreement with the snp , because that would stop the tories
' ' there are no circumstances in which the snp would put the tories into government - the question is if labour have the same commitment , with a number of senior labour figures promoting voting tories in scotland , and even the idea of a ' grand alliance ' between the tories and labour .
