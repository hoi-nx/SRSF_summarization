venezuela has been declared a national security threat
' ' you 're a national security threat , ' a passenger remarked off camera

' after another warning by a flight attendant the woman protested : ' i know already the [ police are coming to take me off the aircraft
] but before i 'm arrested i 'm going to say my peace

' she pulls one out of her bag and lights up
this is the point where i pull eject and run to the back of the cabin
the police arrive after 20 minutes and escort her off the plane
' she only had a single drink on the plane ( however , others told me she was pounding them back pretty hard in the terminal and she also was on prescription painkillers )
