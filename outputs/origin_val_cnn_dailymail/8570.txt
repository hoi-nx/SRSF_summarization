arsenal 's exit from the champions league last 16 for the fifth consecutive season on tuesday has once again exposed the limitations of wenger 's unbalanced squad
the gunners came close to making champions league history by becoming the first team to reverse a two - goal deficit from home but fell just short in their 2 - 0 victory at the stade louis ii. here , sportsmail identifies nine players in three key areas - goalkeeper , defensive midfielder and centre forward - that could transform the north london side from fading challengers to serious title contenders ... danny welbeck helps santi cazorla off the ground after arsenal crashed out of the champions league wenger needs to spend in the summer to address shortcomings in several key areas read how wenger has gone almost two decades in the champions league without winning the prize with arsenal goalkeepers peter cech chelsea cost : Â£ 20m jose mourinho says it will cost ' huge money ' for peter cech who at 32 is still reliable and a calming influence
the Â£ 20m price tag is too high and you get the impression for any other club peter cech would cost less
the figures and peter cech 's age will act as a deterrent for the normally cash - conscious wenger
however , if peter cech 's experience prevented champions league quarter - final , first - leg displays such as the one against monaco it 's a deal worth considering
peter cech has a cut a disconsolate figure after losing his place to thibaut courtois this season chelsea boss jose mourinho says second choice peter cech will only leave stamford bridge for ' huge money ' bernd leno bayer leverkusen cost : Â£ 12m arsenal have a keen interest in the 23 - year - old german under 21 international
he already has good experience despite his age , having made his champions league debut against chelsea in 2011 at 19
arsenal scouts watching his team - mate lars bender have been impressed and bernd leno is interested in a move
his contract runs to 2018 but he said : ' the foreign option is certainly appealing
a new language , a new culture - that i could definitely even imagine
' bayer leverkusen stopper bernd leno has impressed arsenal scouts and is open to a move abroad mattia perin genoa cost : Â£ 16m arsenal have pondered the experience of real madrid 's iker casillas , the promise of mainz 's loris karius but mattia perin at genoa keeps cropping up on their scouting lists
he is 22 and tipped to become the new gianluigi buffon but arsenal have watched him for three years now
liverpool have also considered him as have inter milan
another option with premier league experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is asmir begovic of stoke city
mattia perin has been tipped to become ' the next gianluigi buffon ' and is also wanted by liverpool defensive midfielders lars bender bayer leverkusen cost : Â£ 22m arsenal have considered moves for lars bender over the past few seasons and his injury record plus bayer leverkusen 's reluctance to deal has stalled discussions
this season has been one of his best however and he is back in their thinking
only problem is he is now also on the lists of manchester united and barcelona , who want him when their transfer ban is lifted next january
a stylish and strong player who could add much - needed discipline to the squad
germany midfielder lars bender has been a long - term target but bayer leverkusen are reluctant to sell morgan schneiderlin southampton cost : Â£ 30m the favoured choice of wenger , morgan schneiderlin is expected to be the subject of an early summer bid from arsenal
southampton want him to stay but have already earmarked certain players to replace him should he go
tottenham , manchester united and liverpool have also looked at the 25 - year - old france international , who is one of the league 's best midfielders
mauricio pochettino could prove an obstacle but champions league qualification may be the key
arsenal are expected to resume their chase for southampton holding midfielder morgan schneiderlin ( left ) the france international has emerged as one of the premier league 's best midfielders in recent seasons james mccarthy everton cost : Â£ 30m everton do not wish to sell but james mccarthy is a player arsenal like a lot
tottenham 's head of recruitment paul mitchell also has the republic of ireland international high on his wishlist and the north london neighbours will test everton 's resolve as they formalise summer plans
james mccarthy is still only 24 but has plenty of experience at domestic and international level
highly regarded by his team - mates and coaches alike , he can also play a more advanced role if required
james mccarthy is an unexpected name who could shore up the centre of arsenal 's midfield centre forwards mario mandzukic atletico madrid cost : Â£ 20m aggressive , skilful and a goalscorer
mario mandzukic is a handful on and off the pitch but he would give arsenal the edge they lack
he fell out with pep guardiola at bayern munich and his relationship with diego simeone is now said to be strained
his representatives have already sounded out premier league clubs and he seems intent on a move to england
wenger wanted him last summer but the croat was keen to replace diego costa at atletico madrid
mario mandzukic ( left ) , being replaced by fernando torres , has fallen out of favour at atletico madrid alexandre lacazette lyon cost : Â£ 25m cash - strapped lyon are doing their best to hike up the price of their star striker and he seems intent on leaving with manchester city and liverpool also among clubs to have checked on him this season
he has 26 goals in 28 games despite a run of just two in his last four
still only 23 , alexandre lacazette can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man
fits arsenal 's style and life with wenger would be a big pull for the ambitious frenchman
the 23 - year - old lyon forward alexandre lacazette has scored 26 goals in 28 games this season edinson cavani psg cost : Â£ 35m edinson cavani has been looking for a move away from paris for the past year
his representatives held talks with manchester united last year and he was keen to join prior to david moyes departing
he split from his agent and is now looked after by his brother
all the premier league big guns have been contacted and arsenal are interested although the cost and wages would be high
other options exist such as palermo 's paulo dybala but he is keen to stay in italy
psg striker edinson cavani would bring goals but comes with high wages and an expensive price tag the uruguay striker was part of the psg side that sent chelsea out of the champions league
