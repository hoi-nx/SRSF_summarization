more than 200,000 britons second home owners are celebrating a decisive victory over french tax laws
the european court of justice has ruled that president franã§ois hollande 's eye - watering charge targeting second homes violated europe law , the telegraph reported
as a result , britons who have rented out or sold second homes in french over the past three years can look forward to receiving tens of millions of euros in reimbursement from the french government
victoire : britons citizens who own second homes in french , like this attractive stone manoir in sarlat-la-caneda , southern french , left , will no longer have to pay the large ' social contribution ' charge levied by french president franã§ois hollande , right , and can apply to the french government for a payout in 2012 , franã§ois hollande 's socialist government introduced painful new charges on second home owners , which hit hundreds of thousands of britons
tax on rental income from second homes was raised from 20 per cent to 35.5 per cent , while capital gains tax was increased from 19 to 34.5 per cent
a mandatory , 15.5 per cent ' social contribution ' was introduced on both capital gains and rental income , raising an additional â¬ 250 million a year for the french welfare system
this , the french finance ministry said , would ' remove an unjustified tax advantage ' for ex-patriot owners
the measures caused uproar among britons owners of french property
it meant they were paying towards a social security system from which they would not benefit , on top of paying towards the welfare state in britons
moreover , since the charge was categorised as a ' contribution ' rather than a tax , it did not qualify for britons 's double - taxation treaty with french , meaning that britons second home owners were effectively being taxed twice
according to calculations by the telegraph , this meant that a britons couple who bought a french home for â¬ 200,000 20 years ago and sold it for â¬ 750,000 would be forced to pay a painful â¬ 60,000 ' social contribution ' on top of standard capital gains tax , which would not be acknowledged by the britons tax system
but now the european court of justice in luxembourg , the eu 's highest court , ruled that the ' social contribution ' charge violated eu law because it is illegal for eu citizens to contribute towards the social security systems of two member states at once
' a person exercising an activity in one member state is only subject to social security regulation of that member state ' , said eleanor sharpston , the eu 's top legal advisor
experts in french tax law are advising anybody who may be affected by the ruling to submit a claim to the french tax authorities as soon as possible , also demanding a refund of fees charged by tax agents
britons couples duped into buying illegal spain homes finally have a reason to celebrate after a decade of campaigning led to a change in the law
during the property boom , britons who dreamed of spending their retirement in sunny spain forked out their life savings to buy new homes - only to find they had been built illegally and could be demolished and were not guaranteed compensation
but thanks to years of campaigning by heart - broken spain homeowners , the law now states homes will not be demolished until they receive a payout
at the beginning of the last decade , new homes were built in abundance in spain and buyers from northern europe were keen to snap them up
but thousands had been built without planning permission and property promoters were ordered by the court to demolish the homes at their own expense , despite having already sold them
although the court would acknowledge the existence of a buyer , there was no guarantee they would receive compensation
on tuesday , the senate of spain made an amendment to the law meaning those who bought their properties in good faith must be compensated before demolition
this is , in part , thanks to determined britons expats who have campaigned for change for many years .
