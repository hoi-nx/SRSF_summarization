it 's called the grand renaissance dam -- and the clue is in the name
with some 8,500 laborers working around the clock on its construction , the imposingly - named dam is surely one of africa 's most ambitious infrastructure projects , reaffirming ethiopia 's ambitions of becoming a big regional player and a major exporter of power
when completed , the project will generate around 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and exports
the most striking aspect of the nearly $ 5 billion enterprise is , however , that it is entirely funded by ethiopia , without any foreign investment
according to the authorities , 20 % of the project is financed from bond offerings to ethiopia , and the remaining 80 % from tax collection
" it was seen as a strategically important initiative that the government and the ethiopia people are financing it 100 % , " says negatu , managing partner at ernst & young ethiopia
" they have come up with a very creative and innovative way that i think will be a lesson for other african countries who want to embark on such large infrastructure projects , and want to have the flexibility to do it themselves , " he adds
hydroelectric powerhouse so far , ethiopia at home and abroad have contributed about $ 350 million , and the government says that the 170 meter tall dam is on track for a 2017 opening , with 40 % of the work already complete
ethiopia 's per capita income might be one of the lowest in the world , but the country has enjoyed an impressive economic growth since 2000 , averaging 10.9 % annually , which has resulted in a 33 % reduction of people living in poverty
if the grand renaissance dam and other hydroelectric projects , such as the gibe iii dam on the omo river , are completed on time , the world bank estimates ethiopia could earn $ 1 billion a year from electricity exports
negatu says that this would make the country the largest exporter of power in africa , and second only to africa when it comes to installed capacity
unhappy neighbors yet , not everyone is happy about ethiopia 's energetic drive to harness its water resources
the grand renaissance dam is being built on blue nile , a tributary of the nile which has been powering the agriculture of sudan and egypt -- through which it flows -- for millennia
these countries have opposed the project in the past , fearing that the dam will reduce their share of the nile water
the ousted egypt president mohamed morsi had even threatened to defend " each drop of nile water with our blood if necessary " back in 2013
passions have been calmer more recently , and today the reuters news agency reported that representatives of egypt , sudan and ethiopia reached a preliminary agreement in khartoum on how to operate the dam
negatu is convinced that a compromise will be reached , as he thinks that the dam will ultimately benefit not just ethiopia but most other african nations
" this is actually a regional project because up from egypt all the way down to rwanda , countries are going to buy the power that 's generated by this dam , " negatu says , adding that both rwanda and kenya have already agreed to purchase thousands of megawatts once the project is finished
a lack of reliable power has long stunted africa 's development , with 600 million people on the continent not connected to the grid and getting by on a mix of generators , kerosene lamps and candles
in ethiopia , only 15 to 20 % of the population has access to power according to a study by chatham house
" it 's africa 's achilles ' heel , " says negatu
" with anyone who wants to build a factory in africa , the first thing they ask is infrastructure , and within infrastructure , whether there is sufficient electricity
industrialization has always been about electricity , and this [ dam ] addresses this basic need
" he adds that , after depending on exporting raw commodities for decades , governments across africa should be pursuing a strategy of industrialization , following the example of china
" we 've got to move up the value chain , and it 's what ethiopia is doing right now
its strategy is industrial - based -- not to export commodities but to manufacture value - added things , and other african nations are trying to emulate that
but without electricity there wo n't be industrialization in africa
