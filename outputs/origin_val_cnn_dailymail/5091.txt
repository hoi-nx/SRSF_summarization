speaking at last month 's combine , elway addressed manning 's legacy
' i do think that the one thing he can add is another super bowl championship
i think with where manning is , as i told him in our meeting , i said , " you do n't have to throw for another yard and you do n't need to throw for another touchdown pass because your legacy is going to be one of the all - time greats as it is as we sit here now
" where he can really add to his legacy is to win a super bowl
i think that 's our goal , as it is for 31 other teams , but we feel like we 've got a real good football team and manning is the best player for us
' following the departure of former head coach john fox and offensive coordinator adam gase to chicago , manning will now start afresh with new head coach gary kubiak and oc rick dennison .
