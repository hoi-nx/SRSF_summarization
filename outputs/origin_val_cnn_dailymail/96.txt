the former wife of is leader abu bakr al-baghdadi , who was arrested by lebanese authorities in december , is to be released and returned to the terror group that worships her , the mail on sunday can reveal
according to security sources , a deal that would release 24 lebanese security officers being held by the al qaeda affiliate al-nusra is close to being finalised and saja al-dulaimi would be freed as part of the hostage swap
the infamous female jihadi , now thought to be married to a palestinian , has been held in a high security prison just outside beirut since december
saja al-dulaimi ( right ) , the ex-wife of isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi ( left ) , is to be released in a prisoner swap she is pregnant and expected to give birth soon , but lebanese security officers have cracked neither her , nor â astonishingly â hajaa , her ten - year - old daughter with al-baghdadi who was arrested with her
al-dulaimi is now one of 19 non-lethal terrorists who the lebanese government has agreed can be traded for the release of the soldiers held by al-nusra
al-dulaimi , who was married for three months to the is chief , defected to al-nusra in 2013 , becoming an invaluable courier for them while she was living in tripoli
the soldiers , four of whom have been executed , were abducted by the al-nusra and is militants in the wake of clashes in the border town of arsal in august last year
al-dulaimi was married for three months to the isis ( file picture ) chief , but defected to al-nusra in 2013
