six - year - old jessica bamford ( left ) with her father dwain ( right ) , who had bought the milk from iceland the previous day jessica bamford 's mother samantha , 31 , who has five other children , said she was left with glue all over her fingers after the incident
the youngster was understandably shaken up afterwards and was left with red marks where the substance had been
fortunately jessica bamford did n't swallow any of the mystery substance
her father dwain had bought the milk from an iceland store in plymouth the previous day
samantha , from devonport , plymouth , said : ' it 's just disgusting
she freaked out and was very shaken
' she remembers spitting it out in the sink the second she felt something was wrong
it 's just lucky she did n't ingest it because this could have been a completely different situation
' jessica bamford unscrewed the blue top and took a sip straight from the carton , when the milk began solidifying in her mouth , her mother said
iceland has said it was sorry to hear about the incident but the frozen food chain wishes to investigate further jessica bamford is back to her usual self but her mother samantha wants an apology from iceland where she was a frequent customer ' i 've tried contacting the iceland store and trading standards
iceland said i have to have a hospital note and then i can send the milk back and they will check for contaminants
' but thousands of people buy from iceland every day and the milk is still on the shelves
surely that ca n't be just
jessica bamford no longer has milk and cereal for breakfast and has switched to toast ' i would recommend people check their milk beforehand to be sure
' disgusted samantha said she has also contacted the dairy but told to contact trading standards
derriford hospital in plymouth , devon , have told the family it will take seven days from jessica bamford being admitted to send out an official note confirming she was treated there
she said : ' by then the milk will be gone off and it will be contaminated anyway
' i have six children and i am constantly buying from iceland to save money
it 's easy and convenient
' i always go there , but it 's just disgusting and it puts you off
' if she had swallowed , it would have been a really major situation
i just want an apology but i have n't even had that
' jessica bamford has now returned to full health but has now swapped her normal breakfast of cereal for toast
a spokesperson from iceland said : ' we are sorry to hear about this issue , but we would like the chance to investigate
' we would advise she call our customer call team so they can investigate the matter further
