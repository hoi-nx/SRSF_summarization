is it an april fool 's gag or flame - grilled brilliance ? we 'll have to wait until april 1 to find out
burger king ads in japan promise a limited - edition perfume for april fool 's day to make you smell like a couple of all - beef patties
the name may lose something in translation , but flame - grilled fragrance will sell for 5,000 yen ( about $ 41 ) and comes with a free whopper
how 's that for an offer ? it 's a one - day sale , according to burger king , and only available at stores in japan
sorry , rest of the world
burger king did this a few years back in the u.s. with the fragrance flame
flame was billed as " the scent of seduction with a hint of flame - broiled meat
