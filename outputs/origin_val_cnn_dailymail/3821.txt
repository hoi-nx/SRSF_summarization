the pack had already thinned out considerably when welshman geraint thomas made his big move with three kilometres to go of the longest stage of the race
it was a team sky one - two on the fourth stage of paris-nice secured by porte and geraint thomas australian porte then kicked away one kilometre from the finish and it was only geraint thomas who was able to go with him
michal kwiatkowski was third , eight seconds adrift , and that was enough for the pole to reclaim the overall race lead by a single second , with porte now next in line and geraint thomas another two seconds behind in third
porte , the race winner in 2013 , told the team sky website : ' that was a great performance from the team
we took it on from the bottom of that last climb
it was n't easy on there , so to finish first and second is fantastic

i love that climb and i 'd love to have a good ride there
i 'm in a good position and having such a strong team here will definitely help
