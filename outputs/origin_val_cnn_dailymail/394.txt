cosby has released his first video message since nearly three dozen women accused him of sexual assault and has insisted : ' i 'm far from finished
' in the 10 - second video , which abc news showed on monday morning , the embattled comedian can be seen speaking on the phone as he encourages someone to come to one of his shows
' you know i 'll be hilarious , ' he says in the clip , in which he wears his pajamas
' he also released a short message accompanying the video
' dear fans , i hope you enjoy my wonderful video message that 's filled with laughter , ' he said in the statement , shared by abc news
' hey hey hey , i 'm far from finished
he made no direct reference to the accusations or the scores of women making them , but the 77 - year - old comedian has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing
it comes as cosby continues to tour the u.s. with his stand - up comedy show
his next appearances are in wheeling , west virginia and lexington , kentucky this weekend
although the shows have continued to attract fans , they have also garnered protesters
among the demonstrations , 100 people stood outside a denver theater in january shouting : ' rape is no joke ! ' cosby has also canceled or postponed more than a dozen performances amid the allegations , many of which exceed the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution
just last week , thompson joined the 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against the the cosby show star to say she had also been assaulted by him
she says the beloved actor pressured her into performing a sexual act on him when she was a 17 - year - old aspiring model in 1988
she had met him through her new york modeling agency
when ms thompson 's story was originally revealed in november 2014 , cosby 's lawyer marty singer called it ' absurd ' to publish an ' unsubstantiated story from this anonymous person '
promotion : cosby , pictured on stage in florida last november , promoted his live shows in the video speaking out : last week , jewell allison , pictured left with cosby and right today , wrote in an op - ed for the washington post how she felt pressure as an african american not to tell anyone about the abuse and in an op - ed published on friday , former model jewel allison detailed how cosby invited her to dinner and slipped something into her wine , before grabbing her hand and putting it on his genitals
as an african american - african american woman she said she felt pressure not to speak out , she said
' telling my story would n't only help bring down cosby ; i feared it would undermine the entire african american community , ' she wrote
last month , cosby 's lawyers asked a federal judge to toss out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women - tamara green , therese serignese and linda traitz - accusing him of sexual offenses
tamara green , a 56 - year - old southern california lawyer , says cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in her los angeles - area apartment in the early 1970s
therese serignese says cosby drugged and raped her in a dressing room after a show in las vegas around 1976 , while linda traitz alleges he tried to drug her and then groped her on a southern california beach in about 1970
the former star of the cosby show has n't been charged with any crime
in their defamation lawsuit , the accusers , all of whom have stepped forward in recent years to detail the alleged abuse , said cosby 's representatives publicly branded them as liars while trying to defend his innocence
support : cosby 's wife camille , pictured in november , is standing by her man amid the multiple accusations but cosby 's lawyers said the actor was merely acting in self - defense as his character was under attack
' the law does not require that one stand idly by while he is publicly attacked , ' the lawyers argued in their 38 - page filing
' instead the law entitles an individual who is accused of serious wrongdoing to rebut the allegations without facing defamation claims
' joseph cammarata , a lawyer for the three accusers , said his clients disagree with that position
' we believe that the law provides that when you make a public statement about an individual , it must be truthful , ' he said
' we look forward to an opportunity to have the truth tried by a jury who can ultimately determine which of the parties was being truthful
' lawyers for the three accusers have until march 20 to file a reply to cosby 's motion to dismiss the suit .
