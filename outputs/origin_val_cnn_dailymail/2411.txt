a high school has been caught out editing photos of its students to rid them of piercings , acne , freckles and even one boy 's monobrow and moustache
students and parents at daylesford secondary college in victoria were left outraged when they saw their 2015 school photos last week
year 10 students jacki lipplegoes and annemieke visser both had nose piercings edited out without warning and claim the shape of their noses was changed in the process
their 15 - year - old classmate , ethan , had his eyebrows edited to remove his monobrow
ethan , who is in year 10 at daylesford secondary college in victoria , had his eyebrows edited ( right ) to remove his monobrow in his school photo ' i pulled my photo from the folder and saw there was something wrong with my nose
one of my friends noticed they had photoshopped my piercing out , ' jacki lipplegoes told daily mail australia
' everyone in my school who had piercings had them blurred out ... but we were never told to take them out , there was no warning
' ' it did n't look like me ... i was really angry and disappointed
principal graeme holmes admitted the school 's approach to removing piercings was wrong and they will offer students the original photos at no cost
' anyone with piercings was photoshopped but they also did freckles too , ' jacki lipplegoes said
' someone had his monobrow and moustache photoshopped - that 's a completely different story ... ( facial hair ) is natural
' it 's like they were trying to make the perfect teenager
' ethan 's grandmother said he was left feeling ' very disappointed ' when he realised his eyebrows had been edited in his school photo
year 10 students at daylesford secondary college in victoria , jacki lipplegoes ( left ) and annemieke visser ( right ) , say their school photos were edited to rid them of their nose piercings jacki lipplegoes , 15 , says her nose ring was photoshopped out and altered her nose in the process annemieke visser was wearing a nose stud as per school policy , but it was still edited out anyway mr graeme holmes said the edits were made because of school policy
' i acknowledge that we took the wrong approach in photoshopping piercings out of our school photos and i can assure the school community that this will not happen again , ' he said
' we do allow our students to have facial piercings - however , due to safety reasons , those piercings may only be studs , and can not include rings , sleepers or hoops
' but 15 - year - old annemieke visser says she did have a stud in and it was blurred anyway
' my nose ring was photoshopped and my face was airbrushed
my nose is n't the same - there 's brown marks near it , ' she said
year 10 students jacki lipplegoes ( left ) and annemieke visser ( right ) both had nose piercings edited out without warning and claim the shape of their noses was changed in the process ' we 've always been told no rings , but i have a stud
i 've never been told to take it out and i 'm still wearing it today
' it kind of felt like they did n't like your image so they had to change it
it 's sad to think a school needs to alter appearances
' mr graeme holmes said students would be offered the original portraits to those who wanted to exchange their photos
' next year , we will ensure that students have plenty of notice that they will only be able to participate in school photos if they meet our uniform policy , ' he said
