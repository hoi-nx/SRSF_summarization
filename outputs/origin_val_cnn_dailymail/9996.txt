some nations are developing swarms of small drones for combat , spying on warzones as well as dropping payloads
but russia has reportedly set its sights on a supersonic behemoth , which could strike terror into the hearts of any enemies in the future
called the pak ta , the conceptual aircraft is designed to carry troops and tanks at supersonic speeds and could take to the skies as early as 2024
but some commentators say it âs unlikely that the plans will get off the ground
the plane is an unusual shape because it is intended to carry up to eight armata tanks - which have yet to be built â complete with ammunition to anywhere in the world at supersonic speeds
it would fly at speeds of over 1,200mph ( 2,000km/h ) despite carrying a payload of up to 200 tonnes ( 200,000kg ) with a range of more than 4,350 miles ( 7,000km )
the plane is an unusual shape because it is intended to carry up to eight armata tanks - which have yet to be built â complete with ammunition to â anywhere in the world â at supersonic speeds
this illustration shows a cavernous opening at the back of the aircraft the programme envisages that 80 of these new aircraft ( illustrated ) would be built by 2024 , enabling russia to be able to drop a ready - made army wherever it may be needed in under seven hours conceptual : the pak ta aircraft is only a concept
purpose : the aircraft is designed to carry troops and tanks at supersonic speeds , so that a small army could be deployed anywhere in the world in just seven hours
speed : the plane would fly at supersonic speeds of over 1,200mph ( 2,000km/h )
payload : up to 200 tonnes ( 2 million kg ) which is enough for several tanks and ammunition
range : more than 4,350 miles ( 7,000km )
power : a video hints that the plane could be partially electric
timing : the pak ta programme envisages that 80 of the aircraft would be built by 2024
the speed is comparable to that of a light fighter jet , leading some commentators to brand the plans improbable and more of a flight of fancy than a serious plan
the top speed of the us â largest transport plane â the c-5m super galaxy â is 518mph ( 834km/h ) popsci reported
the design , imagined by an employee of a russia aircraft company , also hints that if the plane were to be built , it would be partially powered by electricity
while batteries can power small electric planes , the technology is unlikely to develop quickly enough to drive a huge supersonic craft , like the pak ta
the programme envisages that 80 of these new aircraft would be built by 2024 , enabling russia to be able to drop a ready - made army wherever it may be needed in under seven hours , expert online reported
the vehicles could load cargo autonomously and be able to airdrop tanks and men onto tricky terrain
the aircraft ( illustrated ) would fly at speeds of over 1,200mph ( 2,000km/h ) despite carrying a payload of up to 200 tonnes ( 2million kg ) with a range of more than 4,350 miles ( 7,000km ) the design ( pictured ) also hints that if the plane were to be built , it would be partially powered by electricity
so while batteries and electric batteries can power small planes , the technology is unlikely to develop quickly enough to drive a huge supersonic craft , like the pak ta â with the development of a network of military bases in the middle east , latin america and southeast asia , which is expected to be completed during the same time period [ by 2024 ] , it âs obvious that russia is preparing for a full - scale military confrontation of transcontinental scale , â expert online reported
the pak ta project is thought to have been underway for several years and is designed to replace the current generation of air freighters - ilyushin and antonov cargo aircraft
the only operating aircraft that can carry a comparable amount of weight is the antonov an-225 mriya , which is a one - off and is built for the soviet buran space shuttle programme .
