ancelotti has the best comeback lines
he 's a soft touch , they 've been saying in real madrid ; the club needs to be ruled with an iron fist , they add ; the players need tough love , they complain
ancelotti dealt with the issue last week in a press conference , arching his trademark left eyebrow into its most quizzical state of scepticism
' this soft touch has won three champions league , ' he said
and it 's hard to argue with that
they will argue with it , of course , at real madrid
tuesday 's champions league tie against schalke should be some blessed relief from domestic worries but then this has often been ancelotti 's way
he is after all the champions league specialist
the debacle of istanbul aside - when his team threw away a 3 - 0 lead to lose the 2005 final liverpool â it is a competition which has been very good to him
ancelotti characteristically raises his eyebrow during a press conference on monday ancelotti 's laid - back attitude means he is loved by the majority he comes into contact with it was the trophy that saved him last summer
the muttering at the club was that he would be dismissed but , having delivered the much - anticipated ' decima ' - real madrid 's tenth champions league after a gap of twelve years - even the powers that be at the bernebeu did n't quite have the stomach to sack him
but the credit ancelotti accrued for that historic win is now being called in
at the turn of the year real madrid were considered the most - formidable team in world football ; they had a four - point lead at the top of la liga and the so - called bbc â gareth bale , benezema and ronaldo â looked unstoppable
whatever happened to the players over the christmas break , it was n't good
since then the club has been knocked out of the copa del rey by atletico , which was quickly followed by the 4 - 0 defeat at the vicente calderon to their real madrid rivals
then there was the under - par home draw to real villareal last weekend and saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat at athletic
real madrid - and ronaldo - have struggled for results in recent weeks there are doubts over the suitability of welshman gareth bale at the bernabeu athletic players run off to celebrate with aritz aduriz after scoring during the win over real madrid angel di maria with last season 's champions league trophy - which saved ancelotti 's job the 4 - 0 defeat to atletico was the one that really stung president florentino perez and it elicited a presidential visit to the dressing room and promise from the team leaders that things would improve
but those captains include sergio ramos , currently out injured , iker casillas , described by one commentator as being reduced to the status of a ' celebrity ' in goal , and ronaldo , whistled at the bernebeu for enjoying an extravagant birthday party on the immediate aftermath of that 4 - 0 defeat
when the president demands more and the result is a 1 - 1 home draw and a defeat to athletic , then it 's the manager who gets the blame
ancelotti is well used to this of course
he is a specialist in working for the most - demanding owners football can fathom , his cv including stints with calisto tanzi at parma , who was eventually convicted of Â£ 6million fraud , former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi at ac milan , roman abramovich at chelsea and now florentino perez at real mardid
and he has played this part before
his final year at chelsea was also undermined by whispers that he was too friendly with the players , that he was n't tough enough on them , that the training was too soft
the fact that john terry , frank lampard and ashley cole loved ancelotti â they took him to the pub on the last day of the season in 2011 when ancelotti had found out he had been sacked â probably did n't help , given that those three players were not in the good books of the board at the time
real madrid president florentino perez has made his feelings known in the spanish capital there is a deeper parallel between chelsea and real madrid
both had tired of the antics and histrionics of mourinho and eventually settled on ancelotti as the polar opposite
where mourinho attacks at full throttle , ancelotti can make his point with a mere raising of those expressive eyebrows ; where mourinho sees conspiracies , ancelotti simply smiles enigmatically ; and while mourinho appears to value a state of perpetual conflict , ancelotti prefers to be a peacemaker
but while he is seen as the antidote to mourinho , when things go wrong , what were once seen as strengths are suddenly picked on as weakness : he is too conciliatory , too consensual , too caring
it is hard not to like ancelotti
not many managers at his level would have the self - depreciation to describe themselves as ' a fat boy with a bowful of emilian tortellini
' when juventus fans compared him to a pig , he objected on the grounds that it was insulting to pigs
after all , he had grown up on a pig farm and food is the other great passion of his life
he once took david beckham on a 100 - mile round trip to parma to ensure he tried a favourite restaurant
ronaldo heads home as real madrid comfortably swept aside schalke in the last - 16 first leg in germany mourinho and ancelotti 's feud was defused by the italian in a matter of seconds ancelotti once took david beckham ( centre ) on a 100 - mile drive to show him his favourite restaurant his playful humour is often lost in translation
but he is the man who once took up an entire team meeting at ac milan to organise a practical joke on mathieu flamini , the punch line of which was unprintable and adolescent in its obscenity and yet funny nonetheless
his geniality wo n't save him of course
though progressing through to the champions league quarter - finals should be a breeze , with a 2 - 0 lead secured in gelsenkirchen , there is a meeting with barcelona at the nou camp on sunday week which now looks ominous
being pleasant is never enough
but being good can be and fortunately ancelotti is
significantly all the signs are that the players at real madrid are behind him but then he is hard man to fall out with for long
when he and mourinho were trading barbs , when ancelotti was at ac milan and chelsea and mourinho was at inter , the italian eventually wearied of the whole charade
when chelsea and inter met in the champions league that year ancelotti deliberately sort out mourinho in the tunnel beforehand to shake hands and agree a truce
' we made a pact , ' said ancelotti
' no more bickering , no more controversy
six words , a handshake and in ten seconds we had an understanding
' it 's hard to fight against grace
in quietly going about his business , he demonstrates that there 's more than one way to be an effective football manager
the big bosses who run football clubs may be un-nerved by his manner but they can not deny his record
and if he does need the champions league to save him yet again this year , starting with schalke , at least he knows the competition is like an old friend to him , always there to help him through the critical moments in his career .
