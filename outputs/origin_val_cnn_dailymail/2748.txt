jason and aaron clark have always known they are different but the same
while jason is a high - achieving , sporty and confident 11 - year - old , his twin aaron has down 's syndrome , delayed speech and deafness
but despite such differences , the brothers from barnsley , south yorkshire , have an unbreakable bond that knits them together
eleven - year - old jason clark ( right , form bamsley , south yorkshire , is very protective of his twin brother aaron ( left ) , who suffers from down 's syndrome , delayed speech and deafness the boys ' mum , lynn , said : â they have always been extremely close
they have a very unique and special bond
they are nât just twin brothers , they are best of mates too
' i âve always told them they are very special and have different talents and skills that are unique to themselves
â jason is very protective over aaron - who looks up to his twin in a big brotherly way
â and now ever protective jason has sold all his old toys and books to help his brother âs education
over the last year he has raised over Â£ 400 in a bid to raise funds for the special school aaron attends
lynn , a businesswoman , said : â he âs had table top sales , a party and placed collection boxes in shops to raise money
â and now he is in the process of establishing his own registered charity to carry on supporting the school which means so much to aaron
â entrepreneurial and caring jason started fundraising as he wanted to give something back to greenacre school , who have supported aaron for the last five years
over the last year jason has raised over Â£ 400 in a bid to raise funds for the special school aaron attends bursting with pride , lynn said : â he has always had such a loving personality and been so protective over aaron
â he told me recently that when he is older he wants to run his own business so he can always look after aaron
he wants to be able to buy him a house and make sure he has all the care he ever needs
â i feel so proud of jason - he really is a very caring child
â when aaron was younger , his speech was badly affected , so jason along with ourselves learnt sign language so aaron could communicate with us
â jason never moaned about it - quite the opposite
he did nât want aaron to feel different so enthusiastically learnt the signs
â but they have also have their own way of communication - sometimes i ca nât quite decipher what aaron has said , but jason always knows and will explain for me
â i just put it down to the fact that they are twins and incredibly close
â so jason âs latest mission to help aaron does nât come as any surprise to lynn and her husband , jeff
as the boys mark the 10th anniversary of world down 's syndrome day , lynn said : â i was nât shocked when he came up with his plan - it âs just his latest way of helping his brother
â he initially created a business plan to raise the money
he took it to aaron âs headmistress to gain her approval and set up a website to promote his charity , suportthenoun
' he held a table top sale at his own school , invited his mates around for a party and charged them for refreshments and then asked local shops to display collection boxes
' the boys ' mum , lynn , said : â they have always been extremely close
they have a very unique and special bond
they are nât just twin brothers , they are best of mates too ' jason , who is clearly very keen to support his brother âs school , said : â i decided it was a good idea because it does quite a lot for people born with disabilities and i wanted to do something for them
' it feels really good to help and make a difference
i hope aaron will be very proud of me
' the money raised will go towards a gardening project for the school
headteacher susan hayter said : ' the money from jason will help to buy gardening tools and a lawnmower
the plan is for older children to have a chance to run a gardening service and then offer the service to people so they can learn new skills and how to earn money
' lynn added : â we have been completely overwhelmed by jason 's determination and enthusiasm
â jason told us he had lots of toys and books that he no longer needed and wanted to put them to something useful
â despite being born a minute after aaron , jason has always taken on the big brother role
lynn recalls : â when they were little jason would always keep a very watchful eye on aaron
if he fell over in the park , he was the first one to come to his aid and make sure he was okay
â and there has been the odd occasion where aaron has been the victim of nasty comments from other kids
a boy once hit jason immediately jumped to aaron âs defence and told the lad to leave him alone
â on their first day at school , jason kept a very close eye on aaron , knowing how hard it would be for him
â he made sure he was never alone and that he had everything he needed
and ever since he has been like aaron âs right - hand man
â despite being far more sporty and academic than his brother , he never lets aaron feel any different
in fact he constantly encourages and teaches him
â jason is very patient
he has helped teach aaron how to ride his bike , play football and show him how to use the ipad
he never allows him to be left out of anything
â i used to worry about what would happen when aaron got older , how he would cope with adult life , if he would be able to live independently
but i know now that he will always have jason to help him and with his brother by his side , he will never be alone in life
