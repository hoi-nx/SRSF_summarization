in the past 16 months , rhodes has been shunned by scotland and then dropped by blackburn
any suggestion that the mild - mannered forward might throw in the towel , however , has been a definite non-starter
deemed unsuitable for gordon strachan âs favoured high - energy 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system , a conciliatory rhodes vowed that if he could nât change his game he would certainly bust a gut to try to improve it
blackburn striker rhodes talks to scotland boss gordon strachan on the touchline on wednesday then , left out by gary bowyer for blackburn âs fa cup goalless draw against liverpool at anfield earlier this month , the 25 - year - old again elected to keep his counsel
in an era when young millionaires are nât slow to sound off about their perceived woes , the Â£ 8million man âs riposte was delivered silently on the park
a winning goal in his first game back against bolton was followed up by a deadly double at charlton the following week
it led to a Â£ 10m bid for his services from middlesbrough , swiftly booted out by blackburn owners venkys two weeks ago
gallacher , the former blackburn and scotland striker , is a big fan of rhodes but admits there were times he feared there might be parallels between the hitman and kris
rhodes ( left ) challenges northern ireland 's aaron hughes during the 1 - 0 victory kris may have been the finest goal - grabber scotland has produced in recent years , but the flaws in his overall game limited him to just 18 international caps and seven goals for his country
gallacher has been impressed , however , to see rhodes show a fighting quality to match his efficiency in front of the net
the boy seemingly without a temper has rolled up his sleeves and scrapped it out to win his first scotland call - up since november 2013
gallacher now feels rhodes could be a key player on sunday against whipping boys gibraltar in a european qualifying group where goal difference could prove decisive
â rhodes âs not egotistical
he would nât spit the dummy , â said gallacher
â but he â s a real predator
even though it âs not been his best season he âs still got 16 goals this season for blackburn
rhodes in action during his last scotland call - up which was back in november 2013 â we had someone like that before in kris
but for some reason kris never got the opportunity at national level to get many caps and many goals
rhodes had seemed to be going along similar lines
but he âs up for the battle
he âs proven that at blackburn , where he has found it difficult this season
he âs been in and out of the side
but he came back in and got a few goals and put pressure on the manager
â i know he âs elated to be back in the scotland squad for the northern ireland and gibraltar games and he âll be looking to start
he âs got to take his chance when it comes
since poland and northern ireland have both taken seven off gibraltar , i â ve a feeling this group is going to come down to goal difference â and jordan can certainly score goals
â gallacher recalls rhodes facing a tough baptism of fire at blackburn where fans viewed him as a striker proven only in the lower tiers of english football with huddersfield
but if ever a pedigree for scoring against mediocre opposition comes in handy , it âs against a gibraltar team so new on the scene they have no fifa ranking
rhodes , in action against northern ireland , will hope to feature in sunday 's contest with gibraltar â rhodes was scoring 20 - plus goals a season but people questioned him when blackburn bought him for Â£ 8million , â said gallacher , now 48
â he was nât tried and tested in the english championship
i do think people worry because he had nât played and scored at the highest level
and maybe that â s in the back of your mind as a manager
â but it âs up to jordan to keep his head down â as he does â and to work hard and score goals
his game is all about goalscoring but at international level you need to do that tiny little bit extra if you want to succeed
but that âs what rhodes âs been working hard at
he âs shown he will try his best to do what it takes to get back in
â by a quirk of fate , the last time scotland reached a major finals , blackburn striker gallacher âs goals secured craig brown âs team a place at the world cup in france
and his ewood park team - mate colin led the team out against brazil in the opening match in paris
rhodes ( right ) , who has been in impressive club form , celebrates with blackburn team - mate craig conway in 2015 , rhodes and his ewood park captain hopefully grant both find themselves in the squad as scotland hope to end their international exile by reaching the euros , also in france , next year
gallacher believes hopefully grant has a head start on colin but has the potential to be compared favourably to the man who in his prime was known as braveheart
â hopefully grant is young and has still got one or two mistakes in him
but if he keeps working hard it âs natural he will be compared with colin because they are both scotland and blackburn defenders
â but what i would remind hopefully grant is that colin was nât the perfect player at 23
colin was a late developer at national level and hopefully grant is away ahead of colin for his age
the older , the more caps , and the more experience hopefully grant gets will make him an even better player
â i loved going to major finals as a player and i âd like to do it with the tartan army
hopefully grant and rhodes can help that happen
