two days after odin lloyd was found dead , patriots star hernandez looked into the eyes of team owner kraft and said he was innocent , kraft testified tuesday in hernandez 's murder trial
kraft , answering questions from a prosecutor and one of hernandez 's attorneys on the witness stand in a massachusetts courtroom , recalled a private conversation that he had with the star patriots tight end on june 19 , at the patriots ' gillette stadium , as news spread that hernandez was being investigated in odin lloyd 's death
" he said he was not involved , " kraft testified in the courtroom in fall river
" he said he was innocent
" hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of odin lloyd , a semipro football player who was found dead in massachusetts on june 17 , 2013
hernandez also has pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge
his co-defendants , ernest wallace and carlos ortiz , also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately
kraft testified that he asked to speak with hernandez in an office near a weight room in the stadium , and asked the player to look him in the eye and tell him if he was involved in odin lloyd 's death
according to kraft , hernandez told him during that meeting that he hoped the time of odin lloyd 's death " came out , " because hernandez had been at a club that night
according to testimony from hernandez 's fiancÃ©e , jenkins , the player had not been at a club , but was at dinner with her and some friends before the shooting
robbins , a cnn legal analyst , called kraft 's testimony " explosive
" " what a great , great witness for the prosecution , " she said
" basically what happened is hernandez lied to his boss
and the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand
" how did hernandez know when the murder happened , robbins asked , unless he was there ? the patriots ' owner also testified , when asked by a defense attorney , that he 'd never had any problems with hernandez , and that the player was always respectful to him
the billionaire magnate of the kraft group , a company with interests ranging from paper and packaging concerns to sports and entertainment , said hernandez always greeted him with a hug and kiss
asked by the defense why hernandez was signed to a $ 40 million long - term contract , kraft said simply : " he 's a very good player
" at times during his 30 minutes or so on the witness stand , kraft seemed uncomfortable
" do you work ? " bristol county district attorney william mccauley asked kraft
" i think so , yes
" asked where he worked , kraft responded , 1 patriot place , or gillette stadium , where the super bowl champions play their home games
" what do you do for work ? " " whatever they ask me to do
" outside court , surrounded by cameras , kraft expressed sadness over odin lloyd 's death
" a man died , " he said
" this is about a man being killed
" later , briggs , head of security at gillette stadium , testified that he also asked hernandez whether the former star was telling the truth about odin lloyd
" he swore on the baby 's life that he was telling the truth , " briggs said
hernandez was arrested in connection with odin lloyd 's death a week after that meeting with kraft
the patriots released hernandez less than two hours after the arrest on june 26 , 2013
jenkins , 25 , and hernandez are the parents of a young daughter
jenkins ' sister shaneah was dating odin lloyd , 27 , who was shot six times , according to prosecutors
the trial began in late january .
