when nurse gregson decided to share an intimate moment with her boyfriend , privacy was nât exactly utmost in her mind
not only did her romantic liaison take place in the front seat of her audi , but she was also parked in the middle of a zebra crossing
and to top it all off , she left her hazard lights flashing
gregson , 26 , from preston , was arrested by police after they found her car parked at an angle on a zebra crossing on christmas eve while she was straddling her boyfriend in the passenger seat the 26 - year - old , who was nearly twice the drink - drive limit , was arrested after police caught her straddling her boyfriend in the passenger seat
yesterday , she was fined Â£ 300 and begged a judge not to take her licence , saying : â i âm really sorry
it wo nât happen again
â a court heard she had stopped in the middle of the road in blackpool at around 2.30am on christmas eve before clambering on top of her boyfriend
gregson , whose favourite books include fifty shades of grey , had parked her black audi at an angle on the crossing but put her hazard lights on to warn other drivers
the keen netball player at first denied she had been drinking and tried to get out of a breathalyser test by claiming that she had a cold , blackpool magistrates court heard
but officers carried out the test anyway , describing her as â smelling of alcohol â and having glazed eyes
prosecutor quanbrough told the court they had spotted her because of her flashing hazard lights
gregson initially denied being drunk , saying she had just finished a 15 - hour shift at preston hospital
she refused a breath test , saying she had a cold , but a urine test showed she was twice the drink - drive limit â she was straddling a male in the passenger seat , â said mrs quanbrough
â when she saw the police she got off the male
she then got into the driver âs seat and put on the seatbelt
â officers asked gregson to step out of the car and found she was unsteady on her feet
but she said she had not been drinking , and claimed to have just finished a 15 - hour shift at the royal preston hospital , where she works
gregson was taken to a police station where she refused to be breathalysed and was given a urine test instead
it showed she had 205 milligrammes of alcohol in her body
the maximum allowed by law is 107
gregson , who had no previous convictions , later admitted being in charge of the car while over the limit
she apologised and pleaded with the court to let her keep her licence , saying : â i need my car to get to work at hospital as i work shifts
â magistrates agreed and instead ordered ten points to be added to her licence
gregson , from preston , was also told to pay Â£ 85 costs and a Â£ 30 victims â surcharge
on her facebook profile she lists fifty shades of grey as one of her favourite books alongside what i wish i knew about nursing
pictures taken on christmas eve show her partying with her friends
drivers can be prosecuted for being â in charge â of a vehicle while over the alcohol limit
the offence is used when drunk people are caught either getting into or having just stopped their cars
they can be charged even if they are in the passenger seat if police think they were recently driving , as in gregson âs case .
