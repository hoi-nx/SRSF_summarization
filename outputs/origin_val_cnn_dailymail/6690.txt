yesterday , a twitter war escalated between danny dyer and katie hopkins after the reality star criticised his girlfriend for proposing to him
katie hopkins launched an attack on danny dyer 's partner joanne , saying : ' no woman should ever propose to a man , ' to which the eastenders star responded : ' i agree ... especially when you look like ya face should be on the side of a gothic building , ' and calling her sexist
but a post-graduate english student who proposed to her boyfriend using a personalised pint glass tells femail that katie hopkins 's notions of marriage are outdated
katy , 24 , and tim oâbrien , 29 , who are from texan but currently live in portugal , had been dating for several years before she decided to take the plunge last april
she said : ' my partner and i first met at an irish pub in texan
' we both very much enjoy drinking craft beer , visiting breweries , and sampling the local beers in every city ( and country ) we visit
' she continued : ' i knew he would love it if i tied this common interest into a proposal , so i picked a quiet craft beer pub in a residential area of dublin to bring things full circle
' i was a graduate student in manchester at the time , so ireland was nât very far away
' i had a pint glass etched with â tim oâbrien , after you finish this pint , i âm going to ask you a question â¦ â on the side , while the bottom that he âd see after downing the pint said â â¦ will you marry me ? â the pint glass that katy commissioned for her proposal to boyfriend tim oâbrien tim oâbrien was delighted with the proposal and immediately said yes , with the pair choosing to elope just a few months later
they said their handwritten vows on a hilltop in a quiet village on the island of mallorca , which katy describes as , ' one of the happiest moments of our lives
' katy is proud of her decision to propose to tim oâbrien and believes that ms katie hopkins ' views on marriage are outdated
she said : ' there are things of real importance women do every day that are cause for actual celebration
' a woman proposing to a man is not one of them , and i wish it were such an unremarkable event that we never felt the need to discuss it or to defend ourselves
' unfortunately , that is not the case , particularly not in the southern us where we are from
' etched onto the bottom of the pint glass was the question ' will you marry me ? ' while katy and tim oâbrien 's close friends and family were delighted at their happy news , she does admit that there was a backlash for more small minded people
she reveals : ' people asked if it was an april fools joke ( it was april 16th ) and asked me if the proposal was actually for real
' acquaintances of my partner had a hard time understanding the concept , and we heard the phrase â real man â tossed around , as if a â real man â is nât any man
' but the main source of awkward interactions was my lack of an engagement ring
' katie hopkins and danny dyer got into a twitter row yesterday after the reality star criticised the actor 's girlfriend for proposing to him katy believes that in order for us to move into a fully equal society , issues like who proposes to who should n't even be a topic of conversation
she said : ' this narrative of men always proposing and that being the only option is incredibly dull
' when it comes to relationships , everyone should do what is best for them ; however , i refuse to believe that following a man âs lead is what âs best for every single woman
' perhaps some women , like me , want to make romantic gestures to their partner
' obviously there are far more important feminist issues in society than who is proposing to whom , but if we âre going to speak out against gender roles , then why has this antiquated tradition remained so firmly in place ? ' instead , there âs this stigma where people see a woman who proposes as someone who is tired of waiting around for the man to do it
' the word â emasculation â is often thrown around when a woman proposes , and i find this entirely ridiculous and offensive to both men and women
