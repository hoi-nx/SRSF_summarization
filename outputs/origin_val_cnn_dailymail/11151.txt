vettel , tears in his eyes , a smile wide on his face , waved the ferrari flag high , his joy unconfined
millions around the world shared his moment of triumph , be they scuderia fans or not
even hamilton , who was prowling around in disappointment at coming second , could understand why
for , finally , the vice-like grip of his mercedes team had been prised open at a steamy malaysian grand prix

vettel was right when he said he won the race â fair and square â , ferrari having outpaced the previously impregnable mercedes machines over 56 absorbing laps
now a sport that has developed an impressive aptitude for navel - gazing , especially after the procession at melbourne a fortnight earlier when a mercedes one - two was expected to presage a period of total silver arrows dominance , can rest from its self - loathing criticism , at least for a while
the victors â joy and the losers â pain were equally piquant in the circumstances
for vettel , it was the fulfilment of the dream of a lifetime
he had won in the shiny red car of ferrari , the team he grew up worshipping
as a boy , he watched over the fence as schumacher drove around fiorano , the test track at the team headquarters in maranello , an industrial town in northern italian as blandly functional as detroit , michigan
but it houses the spiritual legacy of ferrari and all that is poetic about the world âs most famous car
â i remember when the gate opened in maranello and it was like a dream coming true , â said vettel
â you would have needed a heart as hard as flint not to be swept along as he screamed over the team radio : â thank you , thank you
â this was the 40th win of vettel âs career , but his first for the scuderia in only his second race for the team since leaving red bull

nine victories in succession in 2013 was vettel âs most one - sided stretch
before yesterday , mercedes had won the previous eight races straddling this season and last
and the losers â pain ? yes , it was pleasant for a change to see mercedes panic , if only because it showed they are human
it provides hope for the rest
hamilton was involved in tetchy radio exchanges with his engineers
that is what pressure , especially when it is unaccustomed , can do to even brilliant minds
â you âve put the wrong tyres on , â exclaimed hamilton after his third and final stop
the team then accidentally tuned him into a private exchange on the pit wall
they apologised for the mistake
then , annoyed by the confusion , he said : â once again i do nât know what i âm supposed to be doing
â in growing exasperation , he instructed them not to talk to him going through corners
â i almost just went off , â he added
finally , they told him he could catch vettel in the dying laps
it was a crazy , false hope to express and vettel won by 8.5sec
nico rosberg , who is out of form , was third , a place ahead of ferrari âs kimi raikkonen , who fought from 11th on the grid and an early puncture
hamilton was gracious in defeat and loyal to his team
the fact was that ferrari , who were able to run a two - stop strategy , just had too much pace on the day

the ghost of the day was ross
he established the mercedes super-team before being rashly pushed out at the end of 2013
the question of long - term importance is whether mercedes can continue on a clear - headed path of success without him
that burden falls to wolff , the team principal , and lowe , the technical director
wolff said : â there is no panic , but we were in a new situation
we were not in control of things today
â we had new information which was different from what we had assessed over the weekend
â it was clear the winning streak was not going to go on forever
it is not the end of an era , but maybe the start of a new era , of a good battle , a battle we would like to take on
it âs about staying calm and trying to come back with confidence and with the speed we have had in the last couple of races
â ross âs name also cropped up at ferrari , where he masterminded the schumacher years of unbroken glory
his old job there as technical director has been taken by the highly - rated , cambridge - educated james allison , a tall and slightly awkward - looking british engineer
ferrari 's finnish driver kimi raikkonen makes his way back to the pits with a blown out tyre toro rosso driver max verstappen , the 17 - year - old from the netherlands , on his way to an impressive seventh - place finis â ross has about a billion championships under his belt as a technical director and i have precisely zero , â he said
â come and talk to me in a few years â time when , if i am lucky , i hopefully might have half of what he has won
it would be premature to say anything different
â allison started to oversee the development of vettel âs car in january , 2013
since then two ferrari team principals have been sacked
the third , maurizio arrivabene , belted out the italian national anthem that greeted vettel âs win
allison , the subject of more interviews than in any other one - hour period of his life , summed up the mood of the day : â it âs good to win in anything but there is something absolutely fantastic about this team
at ferrari , they work especially hard but we also have the history and tradition of the team bearing down on our shoulders
â everywhere you go in the factory , there is the evidence of their massive success and anyone who works there when it is not successful is cowed by that
â but there is also the weight of expectation of an entire nation
those things are pressures that we soak up and when the pressure is released by a day like this , boy , does that feel good
everybody here wo nât be able to find proper words to express what they feel
â incident 1 lap 39 â hamilton complains about choice of tyres hamilton : ' this is the wrong tyre man
' his engineer replies they had no choice
engineer : ' the other was well used
' incident 2 lap 40 â with vettel picking up the pace , hamilton vents his anger again hamilton : ' i can hear you ( in response to one engineer trying to grab a quick word )
i do nât know what i âm supposed to be doing
lowe ( lowe , team technical chief ) says i might be doing another stop
' engineer : ' that was just miscommunication
