flores was presenting sportscenter on sunday evening when he made the wisecrack about iggy azalea while talking about her boyfriend , lakers star young and his fear of dolphins basketball star young took to twitter to express his anger at flores for joking about his girlfriend â we learned that , according to the lakers â young , a dolphin recently tried to kill him , â said flores during the what did we learn ? segment of sunday 's show
â so , young , while dolphins are trying to kill you , your girlfriend is trying to kill hip - hop
let âs call it even , okay ? â azalea has remained quiet on the dis after quitting twitter last month , but her boyfriend was far from amused at flores ' criticism
' your job is to talk about sports , not what me and my chick got going on , ' he angrily tweeted
young also appeared to threaten flores , tweeting ' we got a problem ' and ' i 'm pretty sure we are going to run into each other soon
' appearing on the sedano and stink radio show on monday , flores appeared to downplay any possible ' beef ' between him and young and said the joke was ' all in good fun
' the australian pop star has been accused by a number of hip hop artists including azealia banks , snoop dogg , q-tip , eve and soul singer jill scott of cultural appropriation flores however could n't resist continuing the joke and said that he was n't too worried about young 's apparent violent threat
' if you look at his numbers , there is a 70 percent chance that â if he takes a shot at me â he âs going to miss. i âm just looking at the numbers , so i âm good
' as azalea âs fame has grown , she has faced a growing wave of criticism â although up to now from hip hop artists â who have accused her of stealing from their culture and repackaging it for the mainstream
before departing twitter last month azalea , whose real name is iggy azalea , had become embroiled in various wars of words online with rival azealia banks as well as snoop dogg , q-tip , eve and soul singer jill scott
azealia banks has accused azalea of not caring about ' black issues '
' its funny to see people like igloo australia silent when these things happen ... black culture is cool , but black issues sure are n't huh ? , â she tweeted last year
the singer and boyfriend la laker young , seen at the ucla men 's basketball game at the galen center in los angeles in january azalea rowed online with both azealia banks and snoop dogg before announcing that she was quitting twitter last month while azalea accused azealia banks of having a bad attitude
she wrote : ' special msg for banks : there are many black artists succeeding in all genres
the reason you have n't is because of your p * * s poor attitude
azalea has also rowed with snoop dogg after he posted a picture on instagram of a person with pale skin and cornrows , claiming it was a photograph of iggy azalea wearing no make - up
snoop dogg compared her to the two main characters from the film white chicks naming the photo , ' white chicks 2 starring iggy azalea '
she fought back comparing him to the type of guy that asks for your number and then says you are ' ugly when you say no '
last month azalea announced that she is taking a break from social media
' i want you to know i am taking some time away from social media
i need to be happy and it is too negative and draining , ' she told her followers
minutes later she added : ' to become nasty because of the way i feel i am treated would be a disservice to my fans and i promise i will try to keep smiling
' she explained : ' i feel the hatred and pettiness i see online at all times is making me become an angry person and i can not be that
