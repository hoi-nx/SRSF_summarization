one has straight ginger hair , a fair complexion and deep blue eyes
the other has masses of curls , far darker skin and her eyes are a sparkling brown
with such opposing looks it âs hard to believe this striking pair are sisters
but they are much more than that â they are twins
the girls were born with radically different colouring thanks to a quirk of their mixed - race parentage
the girls were born in january 1997
their mother was astonished when she first saw the twins , as nothing on the scans had prepared her for their different skin tones
fair - haired lucy , who lives with her family in gloucester , said : â it was such a shock for her because things like skin colour do nât show up on scans before birth
' so she had no idea that we were so different
when the midwife handed us both to her she was just speechless
â their mother , who is 47 and a warehouse worker , and their 53 - year - old father , who works as a scaffolder , split up after the twins were born
family line : the twins ' mother donna is half jamaican and their father vince is white , and their siblings george , chynna and jordan all have darker skin than lucy and lighter than maria two of a kind : the twins , who live in gloucester , were born in january 1997 different strokes  studies law at cheltenham college , while ' shy ' lucy studies art and design at gloucester college all together : maria and lucy with their mother donna and siblings george , 23 , chynna , 22 , and jordan , 21 the 18 - year - olds have three older siblings , george , 23 , chynna , 22 , and jordan , 21
lucy said : â our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween maria and i. we are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween
non-identical twins come from separate eggs , so inherit different genes
the girls â half - jamaican mother carries genes for both white and black skin
by chance , lucy will have inherited genes for white skin and maria will have genes that code for black skin
people with afro-caribbean heritage often have some european dna , dating back in many cases to the slave trade
this increases the chance of them passing on a gene for white skin to at least one twin
â but my grandmother has a very fair english rose complexion , just like mine
â she added : â no one ever believes we are twins
even when we dress alike , we still do nât look like sisters , let alone twins
friends have even made us produce our birth certificates to prove it
â certainly at school there were no problems mistaking the twins for one another â and no way of playing tricks to confuse their classmates
lucy said : â we were in the same class , but no one had a problem telling us apart
twins are known for swapping identities
but there was no way maria and i could ever do anything like that
â most twins look like two peas in a pod â but we could nât look more different if we tried
we do nât look like we have the same parents , let alone having been born at the same time
â the twins â interests are as different as their looks
lucy studies art and design at gloucester college whilst maria studies law at cheltenham college
lucy explained : â maria was outgoing whilst i was the shy one
but maria loves telling people at college that she has a white twin â and i âm very proud of having a black twin
