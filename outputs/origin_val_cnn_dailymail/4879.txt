the plans were agreed by cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood who was nicknamed sir cover - up for preventing the chilcot inquiry ministers were last night struggling to contain a spiralling row about highly contentious plans to bar 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists
critics raised concerns about a quiet change to the civil service code , which they warned could â stifle whistleblowing â and open government
the code has been amended to include a new provision making clear that officials could be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister
downing street was understood to have intervened in the row , forcing the cabinet office to offer a series of concessions
cabinet office minister maude agreed to redraft guidance to â strengthen protection â for those speaking out to blow the whistle on scandals or abuses of public money , and include a commitment to being â as open as possible â with parliament and the public
however , that is unlikely to appease critics , who have asked why such a change has been enforced just before the general election campaign
it appears to have been agreed by sir jeremy heywood , the cabinet secretary , who has been nicknamed sir cover-up for preventing the chilcot inquiry into the iraq war from seeing letters and records of phone calls between tony blair and george bush
however , the impetus is understood to have come from ministers , who wanted to control the flow of information from departments to make clear that they , not civil servants , are ultimately in charge
a line has been added to the civil service code , which governs officials â conduct , saying : â ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media
â margaret hodge , who chairs the commons public accounts committee , said the cabinet office was â using a sledgehammer to crack a nut â
margaret hodge ( pictured ) said the cabinet office was â using a sledgehammer to crack a nut â â you do nât want to encourage briefing against ministers , or criticising people behind their backs , â she said
â but the more openness , the more understanding people have of the way government works , the better
â tory mp charlotte leslie , who has championed more openness in the health service , said it could stifle whistleblowing
â it makes sense that the government wants to get its work done without a running commentary from inside the system , but i would like them to set out what they have in place to help people whistleblowing , â she said
ministers point that out civil servants can blow the whistle on a major scandal using legal protections afforded to them in the public interest disclosure act 1988
but penman , general secretary of the fda union that represents civil servants , said it was absurd to enforce a â blanket ban â on all 430,000 civil servants having unauthorised contacts with journalists
mr penman : â civil servants will become worried about every contact they have with the media , and will be looking over their shoulder all the time when talking to the public â as that âs who they are talking to through the media â about the service they deliver
â the cabinet office insist that the amendment will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media
they insist it simply â clarifies â current practice
mr maude last night : â the cabinet secretary and i are both clear that no one should be exposed to personal and professional risk for doing what is in the public interest
â the amendments make no change to the rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation or our drive to increase government transparency and openness
' however , we will consult on strengthening the protections for whistleblowers
