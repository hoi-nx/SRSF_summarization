a u.s. court of appeals in washington , dc has decided to hear oral arguments on may 4 in a lawsuit that challenges president obama 's executive actions on immigration
a lower - court federal judge threw out the case in december , brought by maricopa county , arizona sheriff joe arpaio
his lawyer , conservative firebrand klayman , told reporters outside the courtroom after he pleaded his case that ' we have serious issues of constitutionality involved
' joe arpaio claims the house 's plan to mainstream more than 5 million illegal immigrants is clearly unconstitutional
lawsuit : maricopa county , arizona sheriff joe arpaio has a date with a federal appeals court , which will re-hear his legal challenge against president obama 's controversial immigration executive actions klayman of the conservative nonprofit freedom watch represents joe arpaio 's sheriff 's office , and wants an injunction to stop obama from granting legal status to millions of illegal immigrants obama plans to give them social security numbers , residency cards and work permits , even though they snuck into the u.s. illegally
the lawsuit argues that the policy changes , made without approval from the republicans - dominated congress , amount to an amnesty and will encourage more people to cross the border
last month a texas judge ordered the obama administration to halt its implementation of the plan , saying it would be impossible to roll back the action if a higher court ruled that it violates the u.s. u.s. constitution
last week , the department of justice requested an emergency stay to put that decision on hold so the homeland security could move ahead
joe arpaio , a colorful and polarizing figure , is known for his ' tent city ' jail where inmates brave the elements are are forced to wear pink underwear and clothing
some of his deputies also use pink handcuffs while on duty in the jails
he has employed ' chain gangs ' to force inmates to work outside his facilities
and he once put inmates on a bread and water diet for desecrating an u.s. flag
joe arpaio also famously claimed in 2012 that president obama 's birth certificate was ' fraudulent
' the administration has been busily fending off a handful of legal actions designed to stop it from guaranteeing that millions of illegal immigrants could live in the u.s. with a guarantee that they wo n't be deported
joe arpaio 's suit is the first to reach the level of a federal appeals court , the final step before a possible supreme court review
beryl howell , the u.s. district court judge who tossed his legal action late last year , was nominated to the federal bench by obama in 2010
she ruled that the sheriff lacked legal standing to challenge obama 's immigration program , and it should be tackled in congress
but klayman , the attorney , had argued that the president 's plan would burden u.s. law enforcement as more illegal immigrants enter the country and commit crimes
' it 's not policy , ' klayman said in december
' he 's creating law and he can not do that under the u.s. constitution
' inspired by sheriff joe arpaio , other law enforcement agencies are now forcing inmates to wear pink ; these jailed men are in grovetown , georgia this week republicans in the house and senate failed in a bid to tie homeland security funding to an order prohibiting the government from spending any money implementing obama 's immigration vision
joe arpaio has suffered stinging political defeats in his attempts to slow the flow of illegal immigrants into his arizona county
maricopa county has already disbanded its squad of deputies that has raided businesses , arresting more than 700 immigrants who were charged with using fake or stolen ids to get jobs
on december 17 joe arpaio threw in the towel on the effort , which won him popularity among voters but was gradually dismantled by the obama administration and the courts .
