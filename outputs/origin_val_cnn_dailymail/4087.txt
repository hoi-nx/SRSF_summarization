the board will last for up to three months on a single charge a team of designers has created a folding keyboard that fits easily in a pocket and contains eight so - called ' ultra smart ' keys that cover all 26 letters of the alphabet
textblade uses software mapping to recognise and learn which keys the user is typing , and this is said to offer the same full spacing as on a standard desktop keyboard
the $ 99 ( Â£ 65 ) textblade was designed by california - based waytools
it consists of three pieces that are held together by magnets , either when folded together or assembled in front of a tablet or phone
this includes the two rows of keys , and a wrist rest
there are eight so - called â ultra smart â keys that contain the 26 letters of the alphabet , numbers , and punctuation marks
waytools claims textblade offers the same full 0.7 - inch ( 19mm ) finger spacing seen on desktops , while being half as thick as a 0.2 - inch ( 7.1mm ) iphone 6
when laid flat , the board is 0.1 - inch ( 5mm ) thick and when folded it stays together using magnets it is also water repellant and features a fabric that prevents it from slipping on a surface plus the board can pair with two devices at the same time
because the board is designed to work with multiple devices , microsoft has ditched the windows key as well as function keys from its original universal keyboard
when laid flat , the board is 0.1 - inch ( 5mm ) thick and when folded it stays together using magnets
it is also water repellant and features a fabric that prevents it from slipping on a surface
the board will last for up to three months on a single charge before needing to be recharged via microusb
microsoft said the board will go on sale in july and costs $ 99.95 ( Â£ 62 ) .
