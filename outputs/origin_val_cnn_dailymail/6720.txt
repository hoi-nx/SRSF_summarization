scully was charged on friday and he could now face the death penalty in the filipinos after being accused of killing a child and orchestrating an international paedophile ring
the age reports scully was never charged with child sex crimes in victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history
an unnamed former business associate , who lost more than $ 200,000 in the fraudulent scheme , told the age he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against scully
' does it surprise me ? ' the associate said
' yes and no. the signs were always there for him , but it 's gone to a dark place
' a search warrant was issued for his arrest in 2012 but scully remained in the filipinos , where he allegedly established a lucrative business live - streaming videos in a ' pay for view ' scheme
police alleged scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe , who paid to live - stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused
it has sparked such an outrage in the filipinos that calls are growing daily to have him executed
it 's alleged scully , from the melbourne suburb of burwood , had took part in perverted acts against children as young as one , which he filmed
the death penalty was suspended in the filipinos in 2006 , but an influential conservative politician told the sydney morning herald that the australia 's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death
' the filipinos government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia , child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty , ' sherwin gatchalian , an mp with the nationalist people 's coalition , said
filipinos across the country took to social media to call for his execution
scully managed to avoid being arrested until february 20 this year before a former partner told police that scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013
it was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10 - year - old girl were found at a home formerly rented by scully
an extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls , who survived the trauma of scully 's alleged torturous abuse , paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home
agent janet francisco ( right ) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from scully 's house , is pictured with one of the rescued girls ( left ) cousins , going by the name of daisy , 11 , and and queenie , 10 , told rappler news site about the fateful day in september 2014 when they were approached by scully 's live - in partner , carme ann ' angel ' alvarez
alvarez , who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of scully 's , offered the girls food at centrio mall in cagayan de oro city and then invited them back to their house
daisy said when they got to the house , alvarez bathed the girls while scully , who she referred to as the ' american ' , videoed them
the next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task
it was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other
