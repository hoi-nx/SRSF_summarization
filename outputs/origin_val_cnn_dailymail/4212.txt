lord lord warner , pictured , has accused the labour leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care miliband âs pledge to rein in nhs â privatisation â by capping profits of firms providing care has come under fierce attack from a former labour health minister
as labour made the nhs the central issue of its election campaign launch , lord lord warner accused his party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care
he said competition between different providers was vital to ensure the nhs can cope with spikes in demand , which occur most winters
â it is very difficult for the nhs to cope with the peaks and troughs of demand without the involvement of the private sector , â he said
kicking off his campaign at the site of the 2012 london olympics in east london , mr miliband said the election â may come down to the wire â , though his deputy harriet harman insisted labour was already â within touching distance of victory â
his main policy announcement was that labour would halt what he called a â tide of privatisation â in the nhs
firms brought in to provide free treatment to patients would be hit with a five per cent profit cap , he said
labour said the cap would apply to all nhs contracts worth Â£ 500,000 or more
any company that made more than five per cent from the contract would be forced to reimburse the nhs for any returns above the level of the cap
local nhs commissioners would have the power to allow higher profits in exceptional circumstances , if approved by nhs england or the health secretary
the cap would not apply to gps , pharmacies or dentists
mr miliband repeated his pledge to introduce a â mansion tax â on expensive homes , impose a levy on the tobacco companies and close tax loopholes exploited by hedge funds
the Â£ 2.5 billion raised would pay for 20,000 more nurses , 8,000 more doctors , 5,000 new care workers , and 3,000 more midwives , he said
claiming another five years of conservative government would mean â the disintegration of our public services â , mr miliband added : â we âll scrap david cameron âs market framework for the nhs and stop the tide of privatisation
â the nhs will be the preferred provider
no company working with the nhs will be able to profit by cherry picking : rejecting patients with the more complex and expensive needs for their own advantage
â and , for the first time , we will cap the profits that private health companies can make from our national health service
â the standard rule will be a five per cent cap
because the money we pay for our health care should be invested for patient care , not for excess profits for private firms
â miliband kicked off his campaign at the site of the 2012 london olympics in east london critics accuse party of hypocrisy , since expenditure on nhs services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before , when labour was in power
overall , around just six pence in every pound is spent in the nhs with the private sector , compared to just under five pence under labour
labour insists that the government âs nhs reforms have accelerated the number private firms winning nhs contracts , with around one in three now going outside the health service
lord lord warner , a health minister between 2003 and 2007 , pointed out labour had expanded the use of private sector providers in the nhs â and insisted it could not now survive without them
of mr miliband âs profit cap , he told the daily mail : â it runs the risk of being one of these pre-election promises which does nât stand up when confronted with the reality of government
â it âs far from clear how you would actually implement it
a lot of the private sector is currently providing services to the nhs at standards nhs tariffs
is that a profit ? miliband 's main policy announcement was that labour would halt what he called a â tide of privatisation â in the nhs ( file picture ) â if you want to scare people , you can scare people
but all the work that was done in the blair government on choice and competition showed that people did nât have concerns on whether work was done by the private or public sector
â what they were concerned with was whether they would have to pay and was their care safe
' the labour peer said some senior people in his party appeared overly â preoccupied â with the issue of private sector involvement in the nhs , insisting : â it rather misses the point
â the point is what âs the best quality of care we can provide for patients at a reasonable price
â health secretary jeremy hunt said : â if you bankrupt the economy like labour did last time â then you âll put our nhs at risk
we can only have a strong nhs if we have a strong economy , but miliband does nât have an economic plan
â we all know labour want to â weaponise â the nhs but this is another policy from miliband that looks ill - thought through
it risks higher infection rates , higher waiting times and chaos for our nhs
this incompetence is exactly why miliband is simply not up to the job
â independent commentators confirm that use of the private sector has grown at half the rate under this government as it did under , o this is no more than a gimmick to scare people about privatisation that is nât happening
â the real issue for the future of the nhs is how to fund the growing needs of an ageing population , and by tearing up an economic plan that is working labour would threaten the real increases in funding that conservatives are promising
no one can deliver a strong nhs without a strong economy
â lord lord warner , a health minister between 2003 and 2007 , pointed out labour had expanded the use of private sector providers in the nhs â and insisted it could not now survive without them dr leonard shapiro , a consultant cardiologist at papworth hospital nhs trust , said of the profit cap : â practically implementing something like this is going to be virtually impossible
â most private sector bodies work both for the nhs and privately , and pooled costs , he said
â to try to figure out how much profit they make from the nhs is going to be nearly impossible
in fact , it may actually cost more money to go through the accounting papers than the amount it will save from making a cap
â but dr mark porter , chair of the bma council , backed labour
â proposals to remove the most damaging elements of the health and social care act 2012 , to support more joined up care and to prevent the private sector from cherry picking the most profitable services are a step in the right direction , â he said
â the bma wants a publically provided and funded health service , and believes the nhs should always be the preferred provider
â liberal democrats health minister liberal democrats said : â liberal democrats in government put an end to labour 's sweetheart deals with the private sector , while the independent king 's fund has poured cold water on labour 's claims about privatisation
â only the liberal democrats have a credible plan to invest the Â£ 8bn per year by 2020 that nhs bosses say is needed
â a private sector profit cap sounds appealing but the devil would be in the detail and a simplistic policy could cause chaos for local hospitals
â dr louise irvine , of the national health action party , said labour âs plan â does nât go far enough â and an extra Â£ 2.5 billion â wo n't stop the nhs from teetering over the cliff - edge â
â the bottom line is that labour 's policies will leave the nhs under - resourced and open to continued privatisation , which will make it impossible to provide a comprehensive , high quality , efficient and safe health service , â she added
â a cap on private profits is unworkable
it 's easy for private companies to arrange their tax affairs so as to avoid registering profits
for example , virgin do not currently record a profit in the uk on their nhs contracts
â labour 's commitments on the nhs are lukewarm and tinkering around the edges
