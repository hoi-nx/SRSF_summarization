gop presidential candidates who flocked to iowa on saturday for an agricultural summit hosted by a gop mega donor lit into the obama administration over its willingness to negotiate with countries that have ' terrible ' track records
' when you 've got the iranians and the cuba doing terrible things to their people , you do n't give them ice cream and candy for heaven 's sake , ' former arkansas gov. mike huckabee said after the event 's host , bruce rastetter , a major player in the renewable energy sector , asked him if he supported the opening of trade with communist country
responding to the same question during his 20 - min q and a with bruce rastetter , new jersey gov. chris christie referenced black liberation army member joanne chesimard and argued that the u.s. should n't be trading with a country that is ' promoting someone who is a cop - killer
protesters are seen here outside the all - day extravaganza that attracted top - tier presidential hopefuls
bruce rastetter is pictured here wearing a crown in a protest sign former texas gov. rick perry said president obama ' really missed the point ' of sanctions on cuba and had ' basically empowered the castro regime ' by renewing high - level diplomatic relations
' this is a regime that has been incredibly onerous to the people of cuba , ' the 2012 presidential candidate said
if the point of the shift in cuba policy was to put the country 's people in a ' better position , ' rick perry said , obama 's plan failed
' i 'm not sure you 're ever going to change the culture of cuba until castro is dead and gone , ' rick perry said , not specifying whether he was talking about the country 's previous dictator fidel , or his brother , raul , who now runs the country
' i think we got a bad deal
i think the cuba people got a bad deal , ' he said , stressing that the exchange of three cuba spies for aid worker alan gross ' release was n't enough
' in my opinion , we got the way short end of that deal , ' rick perry added
mike huckabee said that the u.s. should ' quit pretending that cuba is some wonderful nation with whom we can sit down and visit with any more than the iranians are
' ' they 're not , ' mike huckabee , a 2008 gop presidential contender and likely 2016 competitor , he stated ' these are untrustworthy people who never kept an agreement in their lives
' furthermore , mike huckabee , said they , ' they kick their people in the groin
' ' you do n't go around making plans to be nice to people who do horrible things , ' he argued during an extended critique of the current occupant of the oval office 's relations with foreign governments
' you put pressure on them , you do n't release the pressure
' continuing , he said , ' i mean , my gosh , if my parents had raised me that way , i 'd be a monster
' my parents corrected my bad behavior
they did n't encourage it by rewarding me with ice cream and candy every time i did something horrible

rick perry said president obama ' really missed the point ' of sanctions on cuba and had ' basically empowered the castro regime ' by renewing high - level diplomatic relations
new jersey gov. chris christie referenced black liberation army member joanne chesimard and argued that the u.s. should n't be trading with a country that is ' promoting someone who is a cop - killer
' texas sen. ted cruz said he is an ' emphatic advocate of free trade ' but does n't support it with cuba
' the castros have been brutal dictators , ' he said
former florida gov. jeb bush said ' any efforts taken by the obama administration right now have not gotten anything in return
' ' cuba dissidents are still in prison
the economy is controlled by a handful of what we would call , basically party apparatchiks
in the regime there 's no small business development , ' he asserted
' all the economy built up by cuba â the simple fact is it looks more like north korea than a country that 's emerging toward a freer place , ' he claimed
jeb bush said a ' better approach would have been to say to cuba , to the regime , " you make these changes and of course we will open up diplomatic relations
of course we will open up trade
" ' that would ultimately create ' great opportunities
' ' but right now this is not something that we should be doing unless there 's big - time changes in cuba , ' he concluded
texas sen. ted cruz said he is an ' emphatic advocate of free trade ' but , ' i do n't support it with regard to cuba
' ' the castros have been brutal dictators , ' he said , and ' they are exporting terrorism throughout the hemisphere
' last year , cuba was caught trying to send a shipment of arms to north korea
pyongyang recently paid a nearly $ 700,000 fine to the panama canal authority for attempting to traffic arms
' we 've got ta be able to walk and chew gum at the same time , ' the freshman lawmaker said
president obama 's actions will ' directly prop up the castros , ' ted cruz said
noting that he would be ' thrilled ' to open up trade with cuba , ted cruz said he would only support it ' once we see freedom returned to the nation of cuba
' that means free elections and free speech , he explained
fugitive : joanne chesimard killed a new jersey police officer , escaped from a new jersey prison and fled justice in cuba , where she still lives under the castro government 's protection ' the simple fact is it looks more like north korea than a country that 's emerging toward a freer place , ' former florida gov. jeb bush said of cuba chris christie said the u.s. should n't be doing any business with cuba until it stops harboring a fugitive who killed a new jersey police officer in 1977
' you can not start trading with a country that is promoting someone who is a cop - killer , ' he said of joanne chesimard
the 67 - year - old escaped from a new jersey prison in 1979 and has been hiding out in cuba since at least 1984 , when fidel castro 's regime granted her asylum
' if they 're going to keep harboring fugitives , ' he said , ' i have a problem with that ... the president does n't know how to negotiate
you do n't give away the idea of trading with u.s. for nothing
' castro 's regime refused last week to extradite joanne chesimard , who now goes by the name of joanne chesimard
' i can say it is off the table , ' gustavo machin , deputy director for u.s. affairs at the cuba ministry of foreign affairs , told yahoo news while discussing the latest round of trade negotiations between the u.s. and his country
josefina vidal , cuba âs head of north american affairs , had previously rejected a deal that would have released five cuba prisoners being held in the u.s. if his country handed over joanne chesimard
' every nation has sovereign and legitimate rights to grant political asylum to people it considers to have been persecuted , ' she told the associated press in december
' we âve explained to the u.s. government in the past that there are some people living in cuba to whom cuba has legitimately granted political asylum
' both texas politicians who spoke at the summit said that unlike cuba , they support trade with china
china is different , rick perry said , because it basically practices communism at night and capitalism in day time
ted cruz , who spoke after rick perry , said that ' with china you can make direct investment
' ' you can directly trade with the people , ' which you ca n't do in cuba , where workers paid just eight cents of every dollar , ted cruz said .
