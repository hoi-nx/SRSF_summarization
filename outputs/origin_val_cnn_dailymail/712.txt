international criminals are using uk property as their preferred â safe haven â to stash their corrupt money , a startling report claims
transparency international uk said 36,000 london properties are owned by hidden companies registered in offshore havens
they fear many of these are being used by corrupt overseas politicians from the world âs poorest countries who want to hide their criminal cash
a new report has revealed that thousands of homes in london are being bought anonymously by offshore companies so they can hide corrupt money ( file picture ) the charity said more than Â£ 180million worth of property in the uk has been investigated by police as suspected proceeds of â grand corruption â since 2004
the organisation defined â grand corruption â as the theft and laundering of assets by foreign politicians , public officials and their associates from the developing world
more than three - quarters of these cases investigated by the metropolitan police involved â hidden â offshore companies , which makes it hard to identify the owner , the charity said
astonishingly , almost one in 10 properties in the westminster and one in 14 in kensington and chelsea are owned by companies registered in offshore accounts
more than a third of foreign companies holding london property are incorporated in the british virgin islands , followed by jersey , the isle of man and guernsey
while many register their properties in offshore havens to avoid their tax obligations in uk , campaigners say others do so to hide stolen assets

they said analysis of documents from the land registry and the proceeds of corruption unit showed this problem was on the rise
robert barrington , of transparency international , said : â there is growing evidence that the uk property market has become a safe haven for corrupt capital stolen from around the world , facilitated by the laws which allow uk property to be owned by secret offshore companies
â this has a devastating effect on the countries from which the money has been stolen , and it âs hard to see how welcoming in the world âs corrupt elite is beneficial to communities in the uk
â it is astonishing that the uk has sleepwalked into this situation , and the government needs to act quickly to make sure that the uk does not become the destination of choice for global corruption
â they called for a new law requiring that the owners of companies which hold uk properties are named in land registry documents
the metropolitan police admitted that the current system meant â it can take years to unpick the layers of corruption and secrecy which ultimately result in the purchase of uk properties â
more than three quarters of cases investigated by the metropolitan police involved â hidden â offshore companies a spokesman said : â such properties are often owned by companies registered in foreign jurisdictions and while secrecy jurisdictions have been co-operative with our investigations , obtaining evidence can take years
â dci jon benton , of scotland yard âs proceeds of corruption unit , said the uk property market was attractive to criminal investors
he said : â the london property market is attractive for many reasons , not least because of the safety of the investment and that it provides a home in this great capital
in nearly all the grand corruption cases we investigate , we find â what we suspect is â proceeds of corruption being used to purchase high - value properties
â properties that are purchased with illicit money , which is often stolen from some of the poorest people in the world , are nearly always layered through off - shore structures
â he said that while the percentage of properties purchased with illicit money was tiny compared to the numbers of homes sold legitimately , the values of such houses were often huge
the average price of a uk property under investigation for proceeds of corruption is Â£ 1.5million â more than five times more than the typical uk house price .
