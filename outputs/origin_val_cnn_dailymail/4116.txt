andy murray 's hopes of playing july 's davis cup quarter final at queen 's club look likely to be fulfilled after positive noises emanated today from the famous west west london venue
while there will undoubtedly be logistical challenges in hosting what is great britain 's biggest home tie in 29 years there appears an enthusiasm among the club 's hierarchy to overcome them
given andy murray 's desire to play at a venue where he has won the aegon championships title three times already , there is likely to be a concerted effort to make it happen , including on the part of the lawn tennis association
andy murray with the aegon championship trophy at the queen 's club in west london last month ' we have been approached , along with some other venues , and are actively looking at whether or not we could host it , ' said a queen 's spokesman
' there are a number of logistical issues that would have to be resolved , but if it is possible to overcome them queen 's would be delighted to host the davis cup in july
' that date of july 17 - 19 comes nearly four weeks after the conclusion of the aegon championships , which is the main wimbledon warm - up
among the issues is keeping up the huge main stand which takes the centre court capacity to nearly 7,000 , above the 6,000 threshold required for a quarter final
other challenges include a scheduled refurbishment of the clubhouse due to begin in early july , and making sure the grass court â the quality of which is reckoned to be at least wimbledon 's equal â can recover in time from the summer atp event

it had been thought the disruption might be too prolonged , although today 's statement appears to knock that down
at the weekend andy murray , due to play germany 's philipp kohlschreiber in indian wells on monday night , pointed not only to his own good record at queen 's but also the fact that his brother jamie has made the doubles final there and james ward the semi-finals
however , it is also a place where france players have done well , notably tsonga , who is an enormously popular regular visitor
the scot is in action at the indian wells in indian wells , facing philipp kohlschreiber on monday night eastbourne , birmingham 's priory club and nottingham have also been approached , but andy murray 's opinion carries a decisive amount of weight
france were the opposition when queen 's 's last staged a davis cup tie , back in 1990
gb were beaten 5 - 0 then , but with andy murray in his prime and france ' s players by and large â bar the presently injured tsonga â not at their best on grass , it is likely to be extremely close this time
with a three week gap between roland garros and wimbledon this year , it means there will be six weeks of top - class grass court tennis played in the uk this summer
