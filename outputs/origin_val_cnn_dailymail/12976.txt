the fiancÃ©e of former new england patriots star aaron hernandez said at a hearing friday that she was asked to conceal a box and take it out of her massachusetts home after the murder of odin lloyd in 2013
jenkins ' testimony came outside the presence of the jury during a hearing on the limits of her testimony
but it signaled where the prosecution intends to take its questioning of the key witness , who took the stand before the jury later friday
she is testifying after being granted immunity
aaron hernandez , the ex-tight end who had a $ 40 million contract until he was charged with murder , has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of odin lloyd , a semi-pro football player
he has also pleaded not guilty to other weapons charges
his co-defendants , wallace and carlos ortiz , have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately
" you took that box out and concealed it
were you attempting to do it in a way so that people did n't know what you were doing ? " bristol county district attorney mccauley asked
" that 's correct , " jenkins said
the weapon in the case has not been recovered
the prosecution has said aaron hernandez 's high school sweetheart removed the weapon from their north attleboro home after odin lloyd was killed on june 17 , 2013
the state also alleges that she lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in the home
she faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges
jenkins has pleaded not guilty
jenkins testified she was " instructed " to take the box out of the home , and that it was " important " for her to get rid of it
on the day after odin lloyd 's killing , prosecutors have said jenkins received a coded text message from aaron hernandez
search warrants said aaron hernandez asked his fiancÃ©e to remove something from their basement
the text message said : " go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u ( sic ) get home an ( sic ) there is a box ... jus ( sic ) in case u were looking for it ! ! ! member ( sic ) how you ruined the big tv ... was just thinkin bout that lol wink wink love u ttyl ...
k " asked about the text message friday afternoon , in the presence of the jury , jenkins said she did n't know what it meant
jenkins also told the jury that she met her fiance 's two alleged accomplices in the killing of odin lloyd and gave them $ 500 in cash as police were questioning aaron hernandez about the slaying
jenkins testified that she took aaron hernandez to a police station on june 18 , 2013 , and that he asked her to give wallace money
wallace was comforting to her , jenkins told the jury
" he said everything would be ok , " she said
she went to a bank atm and withdrew $ 500 to give wallace
" i do n't remember the dollar amount he asked for but i remember telling him that was the amount i could take out , " she testified
hours after odin lloyd 's death , jenkins said , aaron hernandez appeared " normal " and his two alleged accomplices appeared " fine
" jenkins , 25 , and aaron hernandez are the parents of a daughter who was just a year old when her father was arrested on june 26 , 2013
her sister shaneah was dating odin lloyd , 27 , who was shot six times , according to prosecutors
at one point , mccauley asked jenkins if she ever saw guns in the home
she told the jury that she saw one " in the kitchen junk drawer
" prosecution witnesses have testified that odin lloyd was shot to death with a .45 - caliber glock handgun
mccauley approached jenkins on the stand with a glock similar to the one used in the murder
" is that a secured firearm ? " she asked , moving back slightly
" mccauley asked if the glock 's shape was similar to the one she saw in the junk drawer
" yes , " she responded
" color ? " " yes
" size ? " i 'm not sure , " she told the jury
jenkins ' testimony resumes next week
