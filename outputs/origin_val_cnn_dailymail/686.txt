robbie , 11 , drowned in a canal after slipping while playing a game of dare and walking along a gas pipe , as his father and grandfather had done when they were children , an inquest heard robbie had been about to reach the end of this pipe , which stretches over the leeds and liverpool canal in burnley , lancashire , when he slipped and hit his head on the canal banking the edwardian pipe , which was fitted in 1903 , had remained exposed to danger from children 's pranks for more than 110 years despite maintenance work being carried out three times between 2001 and 2006
protective iron shields on either side of the pipe were finally installed by national grid 24 hours after the tragedy on april 22 last year to stop children attempting a similar challenge
an inquest at burnley coroner 's court was told that robbie and his two friends had finished their lessons at shuttleworth high school and had been on their way to meet others at a nearby cricket club
but on their way they spotted a gap in the railings of the dugdale bridge and climbed through to the pipe crossing
robbie 's father described him as ' an absolutely brilliant child ' and that since his passing his house had been ' extremely quiet without him ' the inquest was told it was a well known dare among school children to see if they could walk across the raised cast iron pipe in order to get to the other side of the canal
' when they got towards the bridge there were some railings , ' detective constable wendy rothwell of lancashire police told the hearing
' it 's believed one said there was a gap in the railings and climbed through
it was sometimes a dare to see if they could walk across
the three boys decided to walk across , there was a conversation who will go first
' listening to the children it seems to be a dare possibly between children
' she told the inquest that robbie went second and he and one of the friends walked with their backs to the wall as they made their way across
' there were rivets on the pipe which they had to step over and the boys spoke of the pipe being ' a bit slippy
' the officer added : ' as they approached the far end of the bridge one said that he is about to climb down onto the opposite ledge and hears a shout from robbie and he falls into the water
he strikes himself on the bank of the canal before falling backwards into the water
' robbie 's father , dean williamson , and his stepmother clare lay flowers at the scene following his death more members of robbie 's family pay their respects to the 11 - year - old , who died in april last year the boys then climbed down and on seeing robbie in the water screamed for help , as one ran to find assistance
graham , who heard the children 's ' pleas said : ' i could see a body lying face down in the canal
i grabbed the child and said , " help me get him out "
' he added that robbie had appeared ' lifeless ' , with his eyes closed , and did not appear to be breathing
as he waited for paramedics to arrive , mr graham began cpr and robbie was then taken to the royal blackburn hospital
he was placed in a medically induced coma but suffered a cardiac arrest and died later that night
tests showed he died from drowning and a head injury
the edwardian pipe , which was fitted in 1903 , had remained exposed to danger from children 's pranks for more than 110 years despite maintenance work being carried out three times between 2001 and 2006 these protective iron shields on either side of the pipe were finally installed by national grid 24 hours after the tragedy on april 22 last year to stop children attempting as similar challenge robbie 's father dean williamson told the inquest that as a child he had crossed the pipe , as had his own father , but he did not know robbie had been scaling it
he told the inquest that had he known of his son 's activities he would have ' told him off '
' i did n't want him to do it , obviously if i 'd found out i would have really told him off , ' mr robbie said
he added that despite the iron shield being installed , children could still jump down onto the pipe
' that shield that they have put on , you can still climb round , ' he said
' why ca n't they slope the pipe so there would be no climbing at all , there would be no access
if sloped you have no chance to get onto it
you can still drop onto it
' tributes left at the scene where robbie died in a statement read to the court , mr robbie described his son as ' an absolutely brilliant child ' and that since his passing his house had been , ' extremely quiet without him '
he added that robbie had ' absolutely loved life ' and had been an outdoors type of child
year 7 pupil robbie had only started at his secondary school the day before his death
representatives from the national grid said they had believed that the pipe had been underground and was not aware that it was in fact exposed until after the accident - despite work being carried out at the location in 2001 , 2004 and 2006
' some of our crossings have contact details around the site , this one did n't , ' said national grid 's engineering policy manager ian aldridge
' you would n't have known who to contact
' the inquest was told there had been no complaints about the pipe to health and safety or the national grid
coroner mr richard taylor recorded a conclusion of accidental death said he would be contacting other gas and utility companies to report the incident in order to prevent similar tragedies
he added : ' there may be exposed , raised pipe works for which you are responsible either attached to bridges or otherwise , that are accessible to members of the public
' ' the loss of a child is the hardest to bear
we who have heard the evidence today ca n't possibly appreciate your grief , we can only share it with you
after the inquest ruth trippier , speaking on behalf of robbie 's family , said : ' today has been a great ordeal for them and understandably it has n't actually allayed any other disquiet about the circumstances that led to the accident
they are glad that national grid are now , albeit too late for robbie , taking steps to prevent it from happening again
these unguarded pipe crossings are just an accident waiting to happen
' national grid said : ' we have installed protection on the pipe over dugdale bridge and have carried out a thorough review of all the other pipe crossings we own to see if there is a need for additional measures to be taken to prevent access
we will share details of our review with the wider gas industry
' our investigations found we had no record of anyone contacting us or our predecessor companies to report an issue with children climbing on this pipe
