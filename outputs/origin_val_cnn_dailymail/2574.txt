he said the team may make more arrests in the coming weeks and months
he warned anyone who had not yet disclosed details about their relationship with the chef or the events in the days leading up to her disappearance to come forward - or risk arrest
the detective said some people locally knew miss lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some have deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef
the original probe is thought to have worked on the theory claudia was attacked on her way to work early on the 19th
but the new team believe she may have let someone into her home , who then escaped through the alley
a number of new searches have been carried out since 2013 , including a detailed re-examination of miss lawrence 's house in heworth place , york , and a fingertip search of the alleyway that leads to the back of her home

speaking in york , miss lawrence 's father , peter , said : ' this clearly shows someone who is very distinctive
' whoever it is is very tall
if it 's not a man then it 's an extremely tall woman
they 're acting very strangely , but it could be completely innocent
' i only hope that whoever it is comes forward and speaks to the police
i think this person could hold the key to finding out what happened that night
police believe miss lawrence - seen on cctv on her way home from work in 2009 - was murdered ' even though this footage was taken earlier on in the evening before i spoke to her on the phone , it does n't mean it 's not someone involved in claudia 's disappearance , or someone who may know something vital
the map showing miss lawrence 's usual route to work
she did not turn up for her shift ' the whole purpose of releasing it is to find who was in the area that night and interview them
' mr lawrence added : ' if anything , this cctv shows that the investigation is still very much active and that police are getting the public to look and say something
' everything is another step forward to finding out what happened
' this person in the footage may still be walking around unaware they 're part of a major investigation , so as i 've said consistently for the past six years anyone who knows anything or was in the area that night should just come forward
' the fact that this new police team are very experienced has given us more confidence than ever
' but the fact that anyone might be hampering the investigation by staying silent is just dreadful
' he said : ' to have had six years without her company , without her chat , her smile , her laugh , meeting her for a drink , days out and meals out - it tells
i just miss that companionship , that love so much that it just really hurts so much
' it galls me that someone out there knows what happened claudia but has not said anything
' he added : ' six years on , it does not get any better
all we can hope is that we find out what happened to claudia
if she was murdered , as the police believe , then i want to be able to bury her
' as i have been saying for six years , it 's the not knowing that makes it worse and it means that the family just can not move on at all
