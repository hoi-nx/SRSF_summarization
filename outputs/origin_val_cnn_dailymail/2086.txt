janet-da-silva , 30 , a mother - of - two , said she was getting off a bus in denaby main , south yorkshire , with her son gabriel and her mother when the attack took place last wednesday
she said three men were walking towards her when suddenly one launched himself forward , clawing at gabriel 's face
janet-da-silva , 30 , a mother - of - two , was climbing off a bus when a teenager launched himself at her son gabriel 's pram , scratching at his face ( pictured right with a scratch on his cheek and below his left eye ) it later emerged that the 17 - year - old was a pupil at a nearby special needs school who was out walking with two carers
ms da-silva said : ' he shoved both hands in and clawed gabriel âs face
he could have blinded him
' i screamed : â what the hell are you doing ? â then he stood up , looked at me and laughed
' gabriel was screaming out and i saw blood on his face and i started screaming
' the other two men then grabbed the guy on either arm and stood him up against a wall
neither of them said anything to me , i did nât know who they were or where they were from
' it happened so fast i did nât have time to stop him
' despite ms da-silva asking the men to stop , they turned their backs and walked away
it later emerged that the boy was a 17 - year - old pupil with autism who studied at nearby fullerton house , and had been on a walk with two carers she added : ' they would nât listen to me or stop
one of them said : â we âve got to get him away before he gets more angry and violent
" ' i kept asking them where they were going but no - one gave me any information
' ms da-silva left baby gabriel to be comforted by grandmother debbie rojas marinero and followed the men , eventually seeing them going into fullerton house
the institution caters from teenagers with learning difficulties
the pupil in question is said to have complex needs arising from his autism and has been at the school for some time
a spokesman for the school said that both carers have been suspended and an internal investigation is underway
the spokesman said : ' due to the complexity of his disability he does not have the mental capacity to be charged
' chris mcsharry , chief executive of the hesley group which runs fullerton house said : ' this is an incredibly unfortunate incident and my thoughts are with the baby and his family
' ms da-silva said she has been left afraid of going out with baby gabriel following the attack , which took place last wednesday ( pictured , the road where the attack took place ) however , ms da-silva said : ' i was disgusted by their attitude
i understand people need their freedom and sunshine but they knew the teenager was violent so why was he not walking within the school premises ? ' she has now been left scared to go out with gabriel
' it was the worst day of my life , ' she added
' it âs broken me
i pray gabriel does not remember but unfortunately we will
' a south yorkshire police spokesman said they were aware of the incident and no arrests had been made
any decision on a prosecution would rest with the crown prosecution service .
