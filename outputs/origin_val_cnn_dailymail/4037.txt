this is bristol city 's season
coasting to the league one title and now with a glistening piece of silverware in the cabinet , times are good again at ashton gate
this was as straightforward as a wembley final gets for steve cotterill 's team , who reaped the first rewards of what has been a stunning season by easily seeing off the challenge of walsall
in front of 40,000 jubilant fans , they lifted the johnstone 's paint trophy following goals from aden flint and mark little
but it 's merely a taste of what is to come

winning this competition for the third time in their history is a nice distraction , but steve cotterill will demand his players remain focused on the season 's primary task of returning to the championship
the job is almost done
like so often in this campaign , they were in control from start to finish here , showing the greater assurance in front of goal in a game of few chances

well clear of preston north end at the league one summit , it would take a devon loch - style collapse to deny them a return to the second tier after two seasons away
the saddlers sit 16th in the standings , some 37 points behind their opponents , but were still optimistic of springing a surprise as they arrived at wembley for the first time in their 127 - year history
they more than matched their opponents in the opening exchanges , with the goal threatened at both ends
bristol city fired the first salvo when freeman 's 20 - yard hit cleared the bar on four minutes , walsall responding when anthony forde tested goalkeeper fielding from range
then , on the quarter - hour , a breakthrough
bristol city won a corner and marlon pack 's corner was pinged to the back post
aden flint , completely outmuscling his marker to gain the necessary elevation , headed home and sparked delirium among the visitors from bristol
the tempo of the game immediately dropped and both teams constructed spells of tidy passing football without finding any penetration
chances were at a premium and scoring opportunities snuffed out as defences dominated
the best of the half - chances came shortly before the break when walsall 's andy taylor whistled a shot over from the edge of the box but there was little else to report
you sensed that a second bristol city goal may settle the contest and it duly arrived six minutes after the break
aden flint ( left ) scores the opening goal for bristol city during the johnstone 's paint trophy final the big centre half runs away to celebrate his opening goal at wembley for bristol city freeman 's tricky feet worked space to cross from the left and after o'donnell blocked mark little 's first header , he followed up and bundled the ball home with his knee from a few yards out
it was all little deserved for a fine performance in which he was constantly looking for ways to unpick the walsall defence
but far from being subdued , walsall almost responded when jordan cook 's vicious inswinging cross from the left had to be touched onto the post by fielding
the guests from the midlands were briefly encouraged but it did n't spark the resurgence they needed
city were content to sit back and soak up the pressure , duly claiming the first of what will surely be twin trophies this season
