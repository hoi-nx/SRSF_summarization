driver distractions are at an all - time high , according to new research
the use of phones , text messaging and heavy urban traffic means people concentrate less than ever while driving
and this is extremely dangerous , warn the researchers , as taking your eye off the road for just two seconds can increase the risk of an accident up to 24 times
researchers from oregon state university studied driver distractions
they found texting , eating and other tasks were more distracting than ever
and they warned that young drivers are unaware of the dangers
a previous study found that text - driving ( stock image shown ) was equivalent to being drunk the researchers , led by oregon state university compiled findings that showed so - called ' distracted driving ' was a bigger problem than ever
the research was published in the journal of transportation safety and security
the striking sight of a solar eclipse will capture the attention of commuters across uk on their way to work this friday
it will be the first time that the astronomical spectacle has occurred during rush - hour in the uk , and there are fears that motorists may take their eyes off the wheel to watch the cosmic alignment
experts have warned that drivers may be distracted as they watch the sun or risk a crash simply by letting their concentration falter
rac spokesman simon williams told mailonline : â the biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist âs perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness
' he said that distraction is a major cause of accidents on the road and was a contributory factor in 23 per cent of fatal accidents in 2013
' based on recent studies , anything that takes your attention away , any glance away from the road for two seconds or longer can increase the risk of an accident from four to 24 times , ' said dr hurwitz from the university
' this is a dramatic increase in risk , with inexperienced drivers who are least able to handle it
' according to oregon state university , a previous study found that texting was equivalent to being drunk
' the absolute worst is texting on a phone , which is a whole group of distractions , ' added dr hurwitz
' with texting , you 're doing something besides driving , thinking about something besides driving , and looking at the wrong thing
' in their study , the researchers found that interactive presentations administered to young drivers in a classroom or auditorium can raise their awareness of the problem
they concluded that more young people should be educated in this manner
while many young drivers understand the risks of texting , dr hurwitz said they are much less aware of other concerns that can be real
these include eating , drinking , talking on a phone , smoking , adjusting the radio , changing a cd , using a map or other controls
while many young drivers understand the risks of texting , dr hurwitz said they are much less aware of other concerns that can be real
these include eating , drinking , talking on a cell phone , smoking , adjusting the radio ( stock image shown ) , changing a cd , using a digital map or other controls ' automobile manufacturers have made cars significantly safer , but in the interests of passenger comfort they also continue to add more pleasant distractions within the vehicle , ' dr hurwitz said
' more experienced drivers learn how to control these distractions , but we 're finding the most problems with the very young driver , within six months of getting a license
' aside from lack of experience , he said , young drivers also have a higher risk tolerance , use seat belts less , and choose higher speeds
the recent research found that 27 per cent of respondents changed clothes or shoes while driving , and some worked on homework
however , they added that it was ' reasonably safe ' to talk to other passengers in the car
' for one thing , if an incident happens that requires a quick reaction , everyone in the car may see it , stop talking and pay immediate attention , ' said dr hurwitz
' and you literally have more sets of eyes on the road to see upcoming problems
' there are some gender differences among young drivers , too
females are more likely to use a phone while driving , and males are more likely to look away from the road while talking to others in the car
the project was funded by the pacific northwest transportation consortium , an initiative supported by oregon state university , the university of washington , university of idaho , washington state university and the university of alaska-fairbanks .
