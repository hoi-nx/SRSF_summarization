he is said to have carried out 40 murders himself and ordered the deaths of at least 120 others in a career spanning more than 60 years after he joined the mob as a teenager

overseas adventure tour offer on their website ' an enlightening discussion about the cosa nostra ' but furious campaigners have denounced the move by the travel company , describing it as a story that ' still drips with blood '
dino paternostro , an anti-mafia campaigner from the provenzanos ' home town of corleone , told the times : ' i do n't know what angelo provenzano tells the tourists , but i 'm sure he does n't tell them of the unspeakable acts of violence committed by cosa nostra and by a ferocious boss like his father
' his performances may be building up negative heroes , who dramatically reduce the perception of the dangerousness of the mafia phenomenon
' maria falcone , the sister of the murdered anti-mafia judge giovanni falcone , said : ' it 's true that the sins of the fathers should not fall on the sons , but it 's not right to exploit the mafia , a story that still drips with blood
' a group called addiopizzo , set up to provide support for people in sicily forced to pay protection money , has been left outraged by the revelations
dario riccobono , from the organisation , told the guardian : ' he 's the son of the most famous mafia boss in sicily , the director of the worst period of slaughter in the italy mafia
' it 's clear that a person ca n't pay for their father , no one 's asking for him to go to prison , but if he wants a normal life he should act in a certain way
' the mafia boss , pictured in 1963 , when an arrest warrant was issued against him and ( right ) in 2006 after he was finally captured the brother of giuseppe impastato , also known as peppino , was a political activist who opposed the cosa nostra , which ordered his murder in 1978 - campaign groups have condemned the move by the travel agent the talks take place at the hotel opera plaza , in palermo ( pictured ) and take place on the third day of the 15 - day trip to sicily offered by overseas adventure travel provenzano was born on january 31 1933 in corleone , a sicily town synonymous with mafia activity ( and which gave its name to the fictional family in the the godfather films )
he is said to have joined the mafia in his late teens , after the second world war
in 1963 , as he rose up the ranks , provenzano went on the run when an arrest warrant was issued against him for the murder of one of his rival 's ( navarra ) men
over the next five years , provenzano helped his ally leggio hunt down and kill many of navarra 's surviving supporters
in 1974 , leggio went to prison , leaving toto riina in charge with provenzano his right - hand man
riina was captured in 1993 and sentenced to life in prison
during his time as a fugitive , he corresponded with his family via ' pizzini ' - small pieces of paper - instead of taking the risk of meeting them in person
provenzano was convicted in absentia of a string of murders , including the 1992 killings of two judges , giovanni falcone and paolo borsellino , for which he was sentenced to life in jail
he was finally captured on april 11 , 2006 in a sicily farmhouse in corleone at the age of 73
angelo provenzano , bernardo 's eldest son , defended his new job for the travel company
speaking to italin media , he described the matter as a ' personal affair ' and asked : ' do i have the right to a normal life or not ? ' he told la repubblica newspaper : ' for me , it 's only a matter of an important job opportunity in a sector , tourism , in which i have always thought there 's potential
' he added : ' meeting people from another culture , who are free of prejudice , is a very stimulating adventure for me
' angelo provenzano , who spent the first 16 years of his life living in hiding , said people in sicily and elsewhere were prejudiced against his family
he has previously described his life as being similar to a ' big brother contestant '
' we have lived , and continue to live , as if we were big brother contestants
we have been actors in the biggest reality show on cosa nostra
' i always try to make myself known by my christian name , and not by my surname
i always introduce myself as angelo provenzano and only if it is necessary do i add the rest
' discussing his upbringing , he said : ' i was born and brought up in captivity '
in 1992 , angelo provenzano , his younger brother francesco , now 32 , and their mother saveria benedetta palazzolo returned to their home town , corleone , when ' my growing - up began ' , he said
he acknowledged he had found it ' difficult ' to integrate with society and his family were closely watched
' they monitored every setting , every space - the living room , the car , the bathroom , the windows
whether they still monitor us , i do n't know
we certainly behave as if we were [ under surveillance ]
' according to reports , angelo provenzano gave a talk to about 15 tourists charting his childhood on the run with his father
on a description of the third day of its $ 2995 ( Â£ 2017 ) 15 - day sicily trip , the tour company invites the group to ' gather for an enlightening discussion about the cosa nostra ( also known as cosa nostra ) with one of the sons of a former mafia boss

' we also help them to meet fisherman in portopalo and immigrants that have newly arrived in sicily
there is also this mafia tour
we help them to understand italy 's south and all its problems
' another tour guide said : ' if he is not allowed to work , how can provenzano support himself honestly ? '
