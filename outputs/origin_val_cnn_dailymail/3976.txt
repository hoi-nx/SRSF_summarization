prosecutors are considering taking action over footage which shows a hunt follower 's horse ' mowing down a anti-hunt protestor ' , in an incident which left the alleged victim with seven broken ribs
warren was trampled by the galloping horse while she attended the blackmore and sparkford vale meet in somerset last august
the 43 - year - old suffered a collapsed lung and shattered ribs and was left unconscious on the ground following the dramatic incident
the cps said there was ' insufficient evidence that the incident could have been foreseen '
mr mark doggrell had initially rode away from the scene but later voluntarily handed himself in at a police station
but the organisation is now reviewing the footage , after 12,000 people signed a petition urging the organisation to reconsider charging the rider
the review is taking place under the victims ' right , a process brought into force in 2013
it allows victims to appeal against a decision not to bring charges or to discontinue a case once a prosecution has begun
the cps said : ' we are in communication with the alleged victim and will be in contact with her when we have made a decision
' the hunt insists the rider is innocent
the injured woman , who has asked to use a pseudonym because she fears being targeted by pro-hunting groups , said she was left ' devastated ' by the cps 's original decision
she said : ' i 'm a victim of crime and feel absolutely abandoned by a system that 's supposed to protect me
' as i lay in hospital the only thing on my mind was " have they got this on video ? " because i wanted to ensure it was looked at properly
i thought it was irrefutable evidence , the fact it was caught on video
' the organisation is now reviewing the footage ( above ) , after 12,000 people signed a petition urging the organisation to reconsider charging the rider the woman is seen being trampled as she stands with two fellow protestors at the meet in august ms warren , who works full - time as an nhs health worker , had been at the meet at charlton horethorne near wincanton , close to the dorset - somerset border , with colleagues from the dorset hunt saboteur group when the incident occurred
she said she started ' sabbing ' â a term used to describe hunt saboteurs protesting at fox hunts â in the aftermath of the badger cull
saboteurs attended the planned hunt in a bid to raise awareness of animal cruelty and used two main tactics to throw the hunt off course
she said : ' we sounded a horn , hollered , and some hounds looked up and started to come our way
the cps said no charges were brought because there was ' insufficient evidence that the incident could have been foreseen ' the man did not stop after the collision but later handed himself in to police , who charged him with gbh ' i think he [ the hunt member ] got angry at this
he came along a public road behind us at speed , he did n't issue a warning , he was completely silent , then he hit me and rode off
' as i was lay there , struggling to breathe , i could hear the horns going and i was worried that if the horses came back that i would be trampled to death
i was left lying there with potential life - threatening injuries
' ms warren , from hampshire , was taken to yeovil district hospital where she stayed for two weeks
she added : ' he rode his horse at us at full speed and rode off
i had my back to him and he hit me and the horse 's chest contacted with my rib cage , breaking seven ribs , injuring my shoulder and i was unconscious
' when ribs are broken you ca n't splint them - they have to move
they have healed in a grossly displaced position
' the master of the blackmore and sparkford vale hunt , rupert nuttall , said : ' we apologise that an awful accident happened but the due process of the law has been gone through
' mark doggrell is innocent , as found by the cps
' a fox hunter who took a tumble from his horse was given first aid by a hunt saboteur
the anti-hunt campaigner put his differences to one side to come to the aid of the injured huntsmember , who lost consciousness after a nasty fall from his horse
ian hamson , a hunt master of the old surrey , burstow and west kent fox hunt , is believed to have been injured after his horse fell and rolled on top of him during a meet on saturday near cowden , kent
a fox hunter who took a tumble from his horse was given first aid by a hunt saboteur at a meet in kent a member of croydon hunt saboteurs , also a trained paramedic , stepped in and helped the injured man until other paramedics arrived
lee moon , spokesperson for the hunt saboteurs association , said : ' well done to the sab who put his differences aside to act so compassionately , even in the face of hostility from the injured huntsmember
' his actions prove once again that saboteurs are compassionate not only towards animals but humans as well
' this is another nail in the coffin of the countryside alliance 's campaign to portray us in a negative light and it would be interesting to see what would have happened if the roles had been reversed
' a spokesman for kent police said : ' officers attended cowden pound to ensure public safety on saturday morning after receiving a report of a hunt demonstration
the anti-hunt campaigner put his differences to one side to come to the aid of the injured huntsmember , who lost consciousness after a nasty fall from his horse in cowden ' however , no offences were reported so no further action was necessary
' while in attendance , a man required medical attention after falling from a horse and was treated at the scene by a first - aider
' charlotte cooper , spokesman for the countryside alliance said : ' just as hunting attracts a wide variety of people it is only common sense that not every person who sabs hunts is the same
the relationship between hunts and sabs varies from hunt to hunt and is not always acrimonious
i have heard stories of unsuitable attired antis being helped across muddy fields by gallant hunt supporters and broken down sab vehicles being towed out by helpful farmers
' however just because those opposed to hunting can boast that on this occasion one of their number showed human compassion it does not diminish the appalling behaviour of others , for example the cowardly gang of masked thugs who beat tedworth huntsmember brian lane with metal bars in january
' the number of people involved in saboteur activities is far fewer than in the past , however we are concerned that those extremists who remain are increasingly resorting to violence
