this little critter 's certainly got to work hard for his dinner
eita , a three - year - old red panda from the maruyama zoo in sapporo , japan , was filmed as he determinedly licked apple slices from the glass walls of his enclosure
by using his sharp claws and teeth he eventually pries the fruit off and munches it up
footage shows him repeating the same action over and over as he spots another slice of apple stuck before him
one piece proves particularly difficult to ease free but eita finally manages to paw it away
he is then seen standing with the apple in - between his paws , gently nibbling it up
the apples sure seem to taste good after all that effort ! along with fruit , red pandas are partial to acorns , roots , and eggs
