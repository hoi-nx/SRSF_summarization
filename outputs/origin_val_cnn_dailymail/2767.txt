marine biologist : diane cowan has worked with lobster breeding since 1996 off the coast of new england sick of the snow , the ice and the brutal cold weather ? then spare a thought for diane cowan who has been stranded on a island off maine for more than a month thanks to heavy ice
with no helicopter available to pull her out and crossing the mile stretch to the mainland on foot or in a vehicle too dangerous , marine biologist diane cowan has been running low on supplies
iced - in on friendship long island for the past 32 days , diane cowan was delivered from hunger pangs by friends who chartered a plane to drop food and supplies for her and her dog , as the winter shows no signs of ending anytime soon
having spent the past 15 - years on the island where her nonprofit lobster conservancy has a six - acre lobster pond , diane cowan , 54 , has said this winter is by far the worst she has known
' i 've been iced in for 32 days , ' said diane cowan to usa today
' the longest i 've been trapped on the island before was two weeks
' ' i still do n't know how much longer i 'll be stuck here , ' she said
boats have been unable to leave friendship harbor for three weeks after this years painful winter that has seen temperatures rarely rise above freezing
while diane cowan does n't have running water she does have her dog , phone , a stove , electricity and the internet
however , her friends began to worry about her and organized a care package which they dropped in by plane
all alone : diane cowan is seen here from the plane hired by her friends to air drop supplies to friendship long island over the weekend relief is on the way : friends of diane cowan load up their plane with coffee and fresh meat and dog food friends to the rescue : bob - shoving the first box out the window while the temperatures stood at minus 10 degrees remote : diane cowan is currently working on friendship long island - which is visible in this picture as the furthest speck on the archipelago they loaded three boxes with food and hired a pilot to fly over the two mile long and half - mile wide island so they could get low enough to drop the boxes safely
the temperature was a chilly minus 12 degrees when they made the drop
' the pilot was awesome , ' said bob to usa today
' he did a couple of flyovers and got his bearings , ( then ) opened the window and said , ' chuck it
' and i did , twice
' while the first box hit the roof of one of the buildings on the island , the second one made a perfect landing
' i was thrilled , absolutely thrilled , ' said diane cowan to the bangor daily news
' and i also like the idea this could be done because it gives a whole new dimension to getting stuff out here longer term
' diane cowan usually stocks up with two months of food to be on the safe side when she departs for the winter and keeps herself warm with a wood fire and solar panels for electricity
but next year she says she is going to bring along a small box of treats which she will label , ' do n't open until february ' , just to be on the safe side
low flying : the plane hired by diane cowan 's friends casts a shadow on the pack ice as it prepares to make its food drop the crew-pam , tomas , ellen , stewart sherry and bob who banded together to help marine biologist diane cowen
