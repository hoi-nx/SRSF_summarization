' in the hastily written note , scrawled on a scrunched up piece of lined paper , he says he was only speaking to a friend for a ' few seconds ' was not ' constantly talking
' the teen , who has not been named , added ' i do not like german ' and signed off the letter with ' i have nothing else to say for myself so i 'll just tell you i had chips for lunch
