when adam scott waved a short putter to magical effect during the first round of the wgc-cadillac championship at doral on thursday , he effectively consigned to history one of the most contentious subjects the game has known
nine months ahead of the official death knell for long putters , the great and good have seemingly imposed their own sanction
the banishment was started by ernie els and webb simpson , who snapped his over his knee to ensure he would not be tempted any more
then came bradley , leaving adam scott as the last man standing in terms of players who won majors using a long putter
australian adam scott putts for birdie on the eighth green during the wgc-cadillac championship adam scott watches his tee shot on the 14th hole in the second round of the wgc-cadillac championship it was this group who forced the hands of the governing bodies when they claimed all four majors between them in the space of just 18 months , from bradley 's pga championship triumph in 2011 through to scott 's masters victory in 2013
the authorities were persuaded by the powerful evidence that less nerve was needed in anchoring a long putter to the body and the plain inequity that such a crutch could prove decisive at a major
hence the ban on anchoring which , by extension , meant the end for long putters
adam scott was the most high - profile since his long putter was the ugliest contraption of all
as long as he kept turning up with it in his bag , the subject rumbled on
it was during a three - month break that the genial australian decided it was time to change
his caddie steve williams had announced his retirement while adam scott 's wife had given birth to their first child , bo
' everything was getting a little boring so i thought why not change everything completely and ditch the putter as well , ' said adam scott ( right ) , wryly
at home he experimented with a range of 50 different putters
he tried various grips and methods
by the time he arrived in miami , adam scott was confident enough to announce he was going back to the short putter he last wielded in competition in 2011

as things turned out , it went better than he could have imagined
using the ' claw ' grip favoured by sergio garcia , the putting stroke looked pure and he had just 27 putts in an opening round of 70
' i 'm really pleased , ' adam scott said afterwards
' i 've tried not to clutter my mind and i 've shown myself it is not that big a deal
it helps that i used a short putter for years , so the adjustment was really to do with muscle memory
' one or two middle - ranking players such as the swede carl pettersson and south african tim clark still use long putters
but even here they will surely take encouragement from the example of those at the top
as for adam scott , did he ever feel like following simpson 's example and snapping his putter in two ? ' it treated me pretty well , so i do n't think it deserves a snapping , ' he said , smiling
adam scott 's two - under - par round left him in the top 10 but still eight strokes behind runaway leader holmes , who carded a 62
' that 's the most unbelievable round i have ever seen , ' said ian poulter , who opened with a 74 â one worse than world no 1 rory mcilroy
for holmes , it was another heartening milestone in his remarkable recovery from brain surgery three years ago
