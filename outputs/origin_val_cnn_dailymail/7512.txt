when bale scored in the final of the champions league and the spanish cup in the same season last year , he did something for real that only raul and ferenc puskas had managed before him
we can be fairly sure that no one ever tried to kick ferenc puskas â 1959 mercedes 180 as it pulled out of the club âs training ground
the same can not be said for bale âs white bentley , which was attacked as he left real âs valdebebas training complex in the early hours of monday morning after the el clasico
bale has joined up with the wales national team ahead of their upcoming match against israel bale 's car was attacked by angry real fans following their 2 - 1 defeat by barcelona on sunday the world 's most expensive footballer was confronted by fans as he left the club 's valdebebas training base the Â£ 86million signing 's white bentley is struck by this fan while others jeered wales international bale bale has struggled to replicate the form he had shown during his first season at real bale would not expect to have earned the same level of respect as the â galloping major â , who won three european cups and scored 156 league goals in 180 games , but he has four trophies in his first year - and - a - half at the club , so the animosity he has encountered is impossible to justify and hard to understand
â he scored the winner in the spanish cup final ; he scored the winner in the champions league final
he is already a real legend , â gushed real sports daily marca when bale won the champions league in lisbon last may
its rival publication in the spain capital , diaro as added : â marcelo and ( cristiano ronaldo ) cristiano ronaldo both scored afterwards but bale âs was the winner because it was game - over after that
â those two publications have changed their tune 10 months on â dedicating pages to fan polls that call for the welshman to be dropped
on tuesday , 70 per cent of 8,000 supporters responding to one online survey said they wanted bale left out of the team
there was no shortage of ammunition in the real press , with statistics such as â he never set foot in the penalty area in the second half against barcelona â and â he only played seven passes after the break â just three more than lucas silva who came on three minutes from time â
the fan tries to give the car a kick as bale pulls away and the abuse continues to be thrown his way in spain bale and his real team - mates lost 2 - 1 at the nou camp on sunday night in a fiercely - contested el clasico an estimated 400 million people watched bale struggle on television as real moved four points behind barcelona following the incidents that occurred involving three individuals in the early hours of monday morning outside ciudad real madrid , real wishes to outline the following : 1
the club has already identified the individuals responsible , one a real member , for these aggressive and violent actions against several of our players
details of this member 's identity were sent to the discipline commission , requesting that it expel the individual from real for what is considered a very serious offence
this afternoon , the discipline commission held an emergency meeting and decided to open a disciplinary investigation and provisionally suspend the individual 's rights as a member and access to the santiago bernabã©u or any real facilities
real has notified spain 's national anti-violence commission of the incidents that took place , as well as the identities of the individuals responsible , requesting that it apply those sanctions that it considers appropriate
furthermore , real will take any applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for these incidents
all this supposedly supports the theory that bale is in decline
but behind the numbers the story is a little more complicated than his critics care to admit
bale came back to pre-season training in peak physical condition last summer and was comfortably the club âs best player on the tour of the us , scoring in friendlies against manchester united and inter milan
when real went on a run of 22 straight wins , bale scored in the 5 - 1 win over basle that began that hot streak , he got two in the next game that saw them beat deportivo 8 - 2 and netted again in the 5 - 1 win over cordoba that followed
but a thigh injury suffered in october saw him miss three weeks of the season and in his absence carlo ancelotti fielded a midfield quartet of james rodriguez , toni kroos , luka modric and isco
and that is where many of his current problems began
bale has been criticised by real supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013 bale followed in the footsteps of former real duo ferenc puskas ( left ) and raul by scoring in the final of the champions league and the spanish cup during the same season the wales international took his anger out on a corner flag after netting a brace against levante on march 15 real superstar bale ( right ) will be hoping to lead chris coleman 's wales to euro 2016 wales , who are currently just one point behind group b leaders israel , need bale to be firing on all cylinders the team kept winning and with the four passing midfielders the football resembled that played by pep guardiola âs barcelona which many real followers had spent so long envying
the purists loved it and they also loved isco âs part in it â a malaga lad who felt like one of their own
bale came back into the team and his part in the club âs historic run picked up where it had left off , scoring in the 2 - 0 win over san lorenzo that made real world club champions in december
but when the run came to an end in their next competitive game against valencia , the season began to unravel and he became the scapegoat
in the defeat by valencia he was blamed for squandering a late chance and ignoring karim benzema âs screams for a pass
the idea that he should make way for isco now went hand in hand with the theory that he was selfish
cristiano ronaldo did him no favours in the next game when he very publicly chastised him for shooting instead of passing late in a match against espanyol
â puta â ( f * * * ! ) shouted the portuguese throwing his arms down in disgust
bale âs every touch from there on in was whistled , despite the fact that he had scored direct from a free - kick earlier in the game â something that cristiano ronaldo has nât done now in over 50 attempts
the under - current of competition between bale and cristiano ronaldo is another factor
it is no secret that president florentino perez sees bale as cristiano ronaldo âs eventual successor both on the pitch as a match winner and off it as a big - money contract winner
cracks appear to be appearing in bale 's relationship with real team - mate cristiano ronaldo bale and his girlfriend emma rhys-jones must decide where their young daughter goes to school cristiano ronaldo is not enamoured with the idea of being replaced by anyone and , despite the fact bale lives in the same luxury â la finca â neighbourhood as cristiano ronaldo , there is not the closeness between the two that has developed at barcelona between neymar and lionel messi
when cristiano ronaldo threw a party for his 30th birthday , bale was invited but did not attend â perhaps wisely , considering the fall - out that followed the festivities , coming as they did on the day of a 4 - 0 madrid-derby defeat
bale âs partner emma rhys-jones lives with him in real although , with a young daughter alba-violet not yet three years of age , frequent trips can be made back to wales
at some point in the future a decision will have to be made about schools
and he will need to be a sure that real is the right city to justify putting down deeper roots
he says he barely noticed the thugs who tried to kick his car as he drove away from the training ground at 1.30am on monday
but how long before the lack of respect from supporters , commentators and at times even team - mates begins to take its toll ? tuesday marked 10 months to the day since real won the champions league and bale arrived back in the city at 4.30am to be greeted by an open - top bus that took him through streets filled with jubilant supporters
the real homecomings are not as pleasant as they used to be .
