she was frustrated at how complicated her children 's baby grows were to do up
so , melanie chiknagi came up with an alternative - to create her own range of ' parent - friendly ' suits
the mother - of - two , a former commercial property surveyor from excel london , developed a new design of baby grow that does not include traditional leg poppers , which she found ' difficult ' to use
instead , her design , dubbed the picklesuit , features plastic zips on each leg , with concealed flaps to protect the infant 's limbs
it also includes wide arms and non-slip soles from size ' 6 months ' up
creative mother : melanie chiknagi ( pictured with her son , samson , dressed in a picklesuit ) has developed a new design of baby grow that does not include traditional leg poppers , which she found ' difficult ' to do up innovative : instead , her design , dubbed the picklesuit , features plastic - moulded zips on each leg ( pictured ) , with concealed flaps to protect the infant 's limbs
the suit also includes wide arms and non-slip soles ' easy - to - use ' : while the suit ( pictured ) can be fully opened ' so that it is easy to dress little ones ' , its zips also allow parents to undress only their child 's lower half during nappy changes , mrs melanie chiknagi told dailymail.com while the suit can be fully opened ' so that it is easy to dress little ones ' , its zips also allow parents to undress only their child 's lower half during nappy changes , mrs melanie chiknagi told dailymail.com
' the design means that the baby 's top half stays nice and warm , ' she said
' it 's an innovative baby grow that is easy , practical , and hassle - free to put on , take off , and open for nappy changes
' and despite mrs melanie chiknagi having launched her picklesuit range only last year , it has already become a great success with british parents , with many deeming it an ' easy - to - use ' and ' thoughtful ' innovation
the mother said she was first inspired to create the picklesuit - which is now available in three star designs ( red - and - white , grey and white ) - after struggling to do up her baby son samson 's baby grow
' our second child was born and we still could n't do up his baby grows , ' said mrs melanie chiknagi , who lives with her son , daughter , matilda , and husband , pascal , in an old victorian house in the capital
' frustrated at the fiddly design on most , pascal and i decided to design our own , parent - friendly one
we replaced leg poppers with a zip up each leg
then we fitted a fabric flap inside the ykk zips

' she added : the picklesuit took us a year to design , and getting this flap right was laborious
' another flap on the baby grow 's front ' prevents the baby from playing with the zips , and means that when a parent is carrying their child , the zips wo n't dig into the carrier 's skin ' , said mrs chignaki
the picklesuit , which is produced in a british factory that mrs melanie chiknagi visits on an almost daily basis , was perfected after ' many , many prototypes ' , all of which the mother tried out on her two children
' the result is the easiest , most straightforward babygrow to put on - even in the middle of the night , she said
' parenthood is hard enough without having to struggle with complicated clothes
