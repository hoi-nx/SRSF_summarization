english âs euro - flops flipped the hand - wringers into overdrive , like a le mans - style dash for their favourite hobby horse as soon as manchester city âs fate was sealed in barcelona
winter breaks , possession statistics , revenue streams , what âs your poison ? or any other hell - in - a - handcart issue which is about to bring down our national game
two years in three without a team in the champions league quarter - finals is a worrying trend and the premier league will lose its cherished four - team party invite if it can not be reversed
yaya toure 's manchester city side struggled to impress as they crashed out of the champions league to barcelona sergio aguero ( left ) missed a penalty as manchester city were eliminated 3 - 1 on aggregate by the catalan giants manchester city 's defeat would have been much worse if not for the superb form of goalkeeper joe hart ( right ) there is no english presence in the europa league either after everton âs harsh lesson in kiev on thursday night
yet in german , a similar debate is unfolding because bayern munich are the bundesliga âs sole representatives in the last eight , two years after bayern munich and borussia dortmund contested the champions league final at wembley and nine months after the world cup triumph
â there is no time to rest , no time to ease off , â said wolfgang niersbach , president of the german fa
â we have to keep at it if we are to remain at the top
â in english , the usual excuses were aired but it is to be hoped the big clubs are looking at what they might do to improve as well as grumbling about how the system is stacked against them
there is no english presence in the europa league after everton âs harsh lesson against dynamo romelu lukaku scored his eighth european goal of the season , but it was n't enough the dynamo players celebrate during their impressive 6 - 4 aggregate victory over everton too many games ? let âs start with the favourite complaint of the managers who overlook how the extra income from the champions league should improve their squad , if spent wisely
besides , who has the most games ? barcelona have played 44 to manchester city âs 42 this season , chelsea 44 to psg âs 45 and arsenal played 45 to monaco âs 44
lionel messi has played 3,531 minutes for barcelona and cristiano ronaldo 3,323 for real madrid , while alexis sanchez has played 3,326 for arsenal and eden hazard 3,539 for chelsea
it âs more intense in english , they say
no easy games , more physical , no respite
well , it always has been this way
luiz helped psg knock chelsea out at the last 16 stage following a 1 - 1 draw in france luiz celebrates victory with team - mates thiago motta ( right ) and maxwell at the final whistle john terry looks defeated during chelsea 's last 16 exit at the hands of psg last week it was in the 1970s when liverpool , nottingham forest and aston villa were winning the champions league and it was in 2008 when united and chelsea were in the final in moscow and half of the last eight were from the premier league
the intensity of english football used to be considered an advantage with improved fitness and hardened minds
modern players may run more but usually on better pitches , with lighter balls
in fact , footballers have never had it quite so good
at the top of the premier league they have the best money can buy in terms of physical care from the moment they step into the academy building
but tell them they are tired and they might feel tired
in 2008 united and chelsea were in the final in moscow and half of the last eight were from the premier league eden hazard has played 3,539 minutes for chelsea compared to cristiano ronaldo 's 3,323 for real madrid when competition ends , touring begins
tottenham will visit australia in may
southampton were skiing in switzerland earlier this month
manchester city flew to abu dhabi before returning to lose at home to middlesbrough in the fa cup
chelsea had two days off and a free week to prepare before they were knocked out of europe by psg
the wrong type of football ? the competitive tempo which gives english football its appeal will never nurture a player like andrea pirlo , and yet all - action midfielders thrive in the domestic game , living on mistakes which rarely occur against the best european teams
this is perhaps most keenly felt at international level
only one english outfield player started for manchester city in the nou camp , and it was not all james milner âs fault
city have a foreign team and a chilean manager
arsenal have not subscribed to traditional english values for years
few pass the ball better than wenger âs teams and few have played in the champions league with such regularity without winning it
few have passed the ball better than wenger âs teams , but the gunners still struggle in europe wenger 's arsenal teams have not subscribed to the traditional english values for years james milner was the only english outfield player to start for manchester city against barcelona on wednesday night barcelona can mesmerise in possession , but it is four years since they made a final
in the 2010 semis , they lost to an inter milan team that did not want to know the ball
it is about finding ways to win , which is what chelsea were doing when they surrounded the referee against psg
since west ham won the cup winners â cup in 1965 , through the domination of liverpool and into the renaissance led by united and maintained by chelsea , english clubs have been successful with fast , aggressive football and spirited , well - balanced sides
in the past two years , our strongest teams have dipped
the chelsea side first built by mourinho is being rebuilt and the new model is not yet as good
united are in post-fergie turmoil , arsenal are left short by the same old problems and manchester city are still trying to learn what it takes
there are also the restrictions of europe âs financial fair play rules but english clubs do not want for income , thanks to a bumper television deal , which is about to get even bigger
money is not the problem
it guarantees nothing in any case
real madrid spent a fortune chasing their 10th champions league
it is about finding ways to win , which is what chelsea were doing when they surrounded the ref against psg chelsea were the last english to to win the champions league , defeating bayern munich on penalties in 2012 it took them more than a decade because they became obsessed with superstars and forgot about the team
in english wealth confuses strategy
clubs have realigned for the moneyball generation with sporting directors , finance experts and sports scientists involved in transfers while coaches are marginalised
the upshot ? squads lack balance and big - money investments sit on the bench because managers can not â or will not â accommodate them
what is united âs recruitment strategy ? are manchester city about to sack manuel pellegrini and start again ? will wenger ever change his approach ? yes , a winter break might be helpful , as would the complete restructure of the english league system
and yes , it would be nice if english players could pass the ball , and clubs should invest in youth development until they can
but if our euro - flops are to flip and rule the champions league again , they must use their millions more carefully and build better teams
real madrid spent a fortune chasing their 10th champions league , but it took time to get there city boss manuel pellegrini is under pressure after his side 's champions league exit
