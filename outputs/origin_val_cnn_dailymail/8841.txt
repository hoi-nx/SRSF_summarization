a masterchef contestant who built a restaurant in a hut in her back garden may have to pull it down after failing to get planning permission
minchew , who was a semi-finalist on the bbc show , set up a restaurant in a finnish summer house in her back garden - but it has now got her in hot water with the local council
now mrs minchew , who was a contestant on the show in 2008 , may have to pull down the ' food hut ' she opened at her home in gloucester , because she did not secure planning permission
the restaurant features just two tables and opens for exclusive bookings and special events only
built around a single hexagonal table it seats just six diners , who all sit across from each other on wooden benches that are covered in reindeer hide
a summer house was already in the garden when mrs minchew and her husband james moved in - but she did not realise she had to apply for planning permission to use it as a restaurant
but gloucester city council officials visited the restaurant and told her she must apply for if she has any hope of keeping it
mrs minchew opened her tiny ' gloucester studio ' eaterie last november and it has proved popular with locals the restaurant features just two tables and only opens for exclusive bookings and special events ' when i first looked into building my studio , my builders and i believed that planning permission was not necessary , ' she said
' it was only at the end of the year that someone from gloucester city council contacted me
' i immediately invited him to visit and he is satisfied about the business activity but he felt that contrary to my research , planning permission was needed
' i do n't think you can really take something like that personally and everyone i have been in contact with has been lovely
' mrs minchew 's creation was inspired by a trip to barcelona , where she visited a restaurant set in an apartment in the city
the restaurant was inspired by a trip to barcelona , where mrs minchew visited a restaurant in an apartment mrs minchew said her neighbours have so far been ' very enthusiastic ' about the restaurant in her garden she currently takes two bookings a month in her restaurant , set in a finnish kota hut , and said neighbours have so far been ' very enthusiastic ' about the project
she added : ' i think what makes gloucester studio popular is that my customers get to enjoy an evening out that has all the benefits of a night in with friends but with someone else cooking , serving and washing up
while the menu constantly changes , a sample three - course menu , set at Â£ 35 per person , looks like : a mug of mead to start
butternut squash and chinese mushroom soup with aubergine crisps
beef bourguignon served with fire - baked potatoes and petits pois a la francaise
brandied fruits of the forest with brown sugar ice cream
' i 've had lovely compliments about the food but what people seem to really love is how personal everything is
' if any of the local residents have any objection to it they certainly have n't made comment to me
the neighbours i have directly spoken to were interested and enthusiastic
' mrs minchew made it to the penultimate round of masterchef in 2008 but said she never had a desire to work ' in someone else 's restaurant '
martin shields , gloucester city council 's corporate director of services and neighbourhoods , said residents have until march 26 to give their comments on the hut
he said : ' we 've written to residents in the area and invited them to send us their comments
' if anyone else would like to give us their comments please visit gloucester.gov.uk and choose planning then search for 15/00288/ful
