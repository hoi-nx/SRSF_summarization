footage from a camera installed by the family of gladys wright , 79 , showed her being pushed , shoved and pulled by staff at the granary care home near wraxall , north somerset three staff members can be heard calling the helpless pensioner a ' nasty aggressive b * * ch ' and telling each other to ' f * * * her ' , throughout the recordings the appalling treatment only came to light after mrs gladys wright 's son , james , placed a hidden camera in the room
he set the device up to reassure himself the treatment his mother was receiving in the specialist home was unlike the horror stories he had read about , but he was so disturbed by what he saw he immediately took the footage to police
the men , who were suspended from their positions as soon as the evidence came to light , pleaded guilty to the abuse , which took place in october and december 2012
three care workers were later prosecuted for the abuse , which was caught on a camera installed by mrs gladys wright 's concerned son james
but now the company which runs the granary care home near wraxall , north somerset , has introduced a policy banning covert cameras
relatives have been told that any devices found during inspections of rooms will be removed and the footage retained
shaw healthcare says the ban is down to ' legal issues around filming people without their consent '
liam scanlon , head of safeguarding and compliance at shaw healthcare , said : ' shaw healthcare condones the use of cameras so long as they are installed in a way that complies with the mental capacity act and is in the best interest of the service user
' given the legal issues around filming people without their consent and the ability of those who may not have the mental capacity to give proper permission for this to take place , we ask relatives and residents to discuss the placement of cameras with us before they do it
' that way , we can have an open dialogue with the family to address the reasons behind why they want to place cameras in the service user 's room , and also to ensure that when cameras are installed it is done so in a way that complies with uk law , regulation and is in the service user 's best interest
' but families say the policy ' negates the whole purpose ' of hidden cameras , which bring them peace of mind
now the company which runs the granary care home near wraxall , north somerset , ( pictured ) has introduced a policy banning covert cameras retired solicitor sykes , whose 87 - year - old mother and 60 - year - old sister are at the granary , has vowed mount a legal challenge to the ban
mr sykes , 58 , said : ' by informing shaw that cameras are in the room it negates the whole purpose of them
' if cameras were not in the room at the time the elderly lady was being abused it is possible those three men may never have been caught and they could still be abusing residents to this very day
' i , and many other relatives , do not accept this new ruling
' i will be writing to shaw to tell them this and also warning them that i will be bringing civil and criminal proceedings if they interfere with our actions in the best interest of our family members
' my mother is paying more than Â£ 800 a week to live at the granary
her room there is what is left of her home and is her only bit of privacy and a space she can continue to command
' she should be allowed to do what she wishes in this personal setting
' using cameras gives relatives peace of mind their relatives are being cared for as they should be
' hidden camera footage was crucial in the prosecution of three carers at bristol in june last year
