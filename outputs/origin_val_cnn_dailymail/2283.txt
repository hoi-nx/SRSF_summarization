mps will be banned from claiming expenses for dinners , tv licences and taxis before 11pm following the general election
the independent parliamentary standards authority ( independent parliamentary standards authority ) confirmed that politicians ' perks will be cut from may 8
the move , which is likely to cause anger among mps who already complain that the system leaves them out of pocket , emerged as the watchdog announced a raft of changes for the next parliament
the independent parliamentary standards authority has confirmed that certain perks for politicians will be cut from may 8 ipsa said : ' we will implement the rule changes agreed in december 2013 , including removing hospitality claims and the late sitting food subsidy
we have tightened the rules on taxis and hotels after late sittings of the house
' we will no longer allow claims , under the accommodation rules , for tv licences and home contents insurance
' elsewhere , staffing budgets are to go up 1 per cent to Â£ 147,000 for mps in the london area , and Â£ 140,000 for those from outside the capital
the office costs budget is rising 0.5 per cent to reflect inflation , but accommodation budgets have been frozen
the watchdog had proposed a raft of curbs to expenses in 2013 as part of a wider package that included salaries rising by 10 per cent from Â£ 67,000 to Â£ 74,000
it suggested that trimming perks and pension benefits would offset the costs of the controversial pay rise
prime minister cameron has said that a 10 per cent pay rise for mps is ' unacceptable ' at a time when public sector rises are restricted to one per cent the changes will go ahead even though the pay rise is still subject to review and cameron , miliband and clegg have signalled they may block it
mr cameron has said he regards the hike as ' unacceptable ' at a time when public sector rises are restricted to one per cent , while mr miliband and mr clegg have said they do not believe it should go ahead
the move - which is likely to cause anger among mps who already complain that the system leaves them out of pocket - emerged as independent parliamentary standards authority announced expenses rules for the next parliament
but while the expenses reductions will now come in to force automatically on may 8 , the mps salary boost will be subject to a review due to be carried out in the weeks after the poll
the watchdog theoretically has the final decision on the issue - although there have been suggestions that the law could be changed in order to prevent the increase
the cross-party commons standards committee has previously condemned the expenses cuts , arguing that the rules are already ' considerably less generous ' than in many companies
highlighting the plan to drop the Â£ 15 currently claimable for dinner when the house sits beyond 7.30pm , the committee said : ' if such expenses are not met by the employer , then the employee is able to claim tax relief on subsistence costs of travel between work places
' the rules for mps are already considerably less generous than this
' we also note that when there is whipped business , members must be within easy reach of the division lobbies
' once again , we consider there needs to be a stronger evidence base before it can be asserted that these are costs which other professionals would expect to meet for themselves , unless they had been dealt with through a salary supplement rather than expenses
' the committee said mps routinely worked 60 or 70 hours a week and the tightening of the expenses system in the wake of the scandal that rocked westminster already meant some had taken to sleeping in their offices
' we do not consider that independent parliamentary standards authority has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses , ' the report said
the changes will see a halt to claims for tea and biscuits , and hotels only allowed if they are booked after 1am .
