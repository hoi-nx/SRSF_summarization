phil jones says public criticism of manchester united has fuelled the team 's recent revival
manchester united are now odds - on to qualify for the champions league after they recorded back - to - back wins over spurs and liverpool
such a double would have seemed impossible just a few months ago
manager louis van gaal came under fire after his team put in a number of underwhelming displays
phil jones ( left ) celebrates after manchester united 's 2 - 1 victory over top four rivals liverpool on sunday juan mata ( left ) scored twice to put manchester united in the driving seat for champions league qualification some of the strongest criticism came from ex-united players like gary neville , who compared van gaal 's side to a pub team and paul scholes , who labelled some of manchester united 's play ' prehistoric '
but with manchester united now five points clear of fifth - placed liverpool , their critics have fallen silent
' people criticising does spur you on , ' phil jones said
' you are always going to get critics
we are at a massive club here at manchester united and if things are n't going as well as they should be then there is always going to be people wanting to have a dig and a pop at you
phil jones admits that public criticism sparked manchester united 's impressive performances in recent weeks manchester united also defeated spurs in their previous premier league game at old trafford ' we have been well aware of the criticism we have had
we are professionals and we are in a job where people have an opinion about you and they are entitled to it and we just have to get on with it
' people can assume and predict and it is up to us to prove them all wrong
that is what the lads enjoy doing
we enjoy proving them wrong
so far we have done that
' phil jones has come in for criticism himself this season , but he and chris performed well against a fierce liverpool attack at anfield and the two kept 29 - goal striker harry kane quiet in the 3 - 0 win over spurs
phil jones and chris were identified as long - term replacements for ferdinand and nemanja vidic at manchester united
phil jones and his manchester united team - mates applaud supporters after their away win at anfield phil jones and fellow defender chris ( centre ) were once doubted as the future of england 's defence the pair were also touted as alternatives to the ferdinand - john terry partnership with england , but as phil jones points out , they have not played together often as a centre - half pairing
' it has been difficult for us , ' said phil jones , who has played alongside chris at centre - back for england just once
' it had been documented that me and chris were going to be the next centre - backs at manchester united but it has not gone how we would have liked it
' somebody told me the other day that we have actually only played alongside each other about four times in four seasons
' you can not build a partnership on four games
' hopefully now we have had back - to - back games together we can keep it going and keep playing well together
we complement each other well
