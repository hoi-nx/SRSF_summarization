former us representative weiner was spotted taking his son for a quick stroll near his downtown manhattan home yesterday
they were seen enjoying themselves amid claims weiner 's wife has been caught up in the hillary clinton email scandal they were spotted enjoying themselves as weiner 's wife abedin faces scrutiny about using a private email account
abedin is one of three top clinton aides who reportedly used email addresses hosted on the former secretary of state 's private server
senior figures in congress were already investigating clinton 's communications from 2009 - 13 , which they say were not conducted via official state department accounts but a ' clintonemail.com ' address
clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of communications from the time - but admitted on tuesday during a news conference that she deleted more than 30,000 emails she decided were personal in nature and unrelated to her job
the 50 - year - old house husband made sure he pushed three - year - old jordan high on the swings before the pair ran off to get pizza the investigation has now widened after it emerged that one of abedin 's email addresses is huma@clintonemail.com , showing that she could have also been using the server to conduct official business
daily mail online confirmed the address through nexis , a commercial service that compiles public records
it comes nearly four years after weiner 's own scandal where he resigned from congress for sending sexually suggestive photographs of himself via his public twitter account to other women
clinton aide abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state 's private server , judging from records maintained by nexis abedin ( left ) , shown with then - secretary of state clinton during a 2010 diplomatic meeting in vietnam , was her deputy chief of staff and is expected to play a key roll if clinton runs for president at the time he admitted that he had sent images to six women in three years and said that he had stopped
but in 2013 further claims were made that he sent more under the alias ' carlos danger ' to a 22 - year - old woman
he tried to return to politics by taking part in the 2013 new york mayoral race but lost after receiving less than five per cent of votes .
