the bbc could lose millions of pounds a year if it sacks top gear presenter clarkson the bbc is set to lose as much as Â£ 67million a year if top gear presenter clarkson is sacked over claims he punched a producer
the corporation 's commercial arm rakes in an estimated Â£ 50million a year from selling the rights to top gear overseas , with the show watched in 214 countries around the world
on top of that , bbc worldwide makes millions more from top gear magazine and live shows in the uk and abroad , as well as sales of dvds
but all of this could be lost if clarkson is sacked - an outcome he hinted at during a charity ball last night
the top gear star , who is alleged to have hit producer tymon during a ' fracas ' over a steak dinner , said he wanted to do one more lap of the show 's track ' before the ' f * * * * * * b * * * * * * * sack me '
the bbc could lose tens of millions of pounds in annual profit if they do give clarkson his marching orders , with the sale of the show overseas making Â£ 50million
top gear magazine has a global circulation of 1.7m , bringing in another estimated Â£ 7.4million - not including profit from advertising , as well as the costs of producing and shipping the magazine
the motoring programme is also set to make around Â£ 7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the uk this year
the conservative estimate is based on 15,000 tickets sold for each show at the cheapest price of Â£ 35 each , however with more expensive tickets and vip packages available , this figure could be far higher
car manufacturers are also thought to pay to have their cars featured on the stadium tours
the programme 's 2014 christmas dvd - top gear perfect road trip 2 - was the highest - selling in the uk , with 272,000 copies bought in just three months , accounting for about Â£ 2.17million
other dvds , top gear merchandise and mobile apps are other sources of revenue that could be cut off if the show comes to and end with the sacking of clarkson , with hammond and james may refusing to film without their suspended co-presenter
last night the top gear frontman was caught on camera as he launched into a foul - mouthed rant at the bbc during a charity gala

a video of his speech emerged as it was claimed last night that clarkson visited his producer 's home to apologise for their top gear altercation - but was given the cold shoulder
in footage obtained by the daily mirror , he spoke to the roundhouse audience about a charity auction for his ' last ever lap ' on the top gear track - which later went for Â£ 100,000
clarkson said : ' i did n't foresee my sacking , but i would like to do one last lap. so i 'll go down to surrey and i 'll do one last lap of that track before the f * * * * * * b * * * * * * * sack me
