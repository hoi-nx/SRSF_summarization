teachers are to get a pay rise of up to 2 per cent , ministers are set to announce tomorrow amid claims of a major coalition dispute
clegg tonight accused the tories of trying to block the rise in a ' fierce ' row over honouring the recommendation of an independent pay review body to give the full rise to teachers in england and wales
but education secretary nicky morgan insisted the salary increase would go ahead as planned
at present maximum pay in england and wales outside of london is Â£ 32,187 , with the minimum rate set at Â£ 22,023
downing street this week denied there was a coalition dispute over the issue , insisting it was ' being dealt with in the normal way ' by lib dem treasury minister danny alexander
but mr clegg accused the chancellor of blocking the plan
he told mailonline : ' it 's important that where we can be as generous as we can be â¦ for people who are working in the public sector , we should do so
' he stressed that it was important to be ' responsible with the public finances ' but insisted that the teachers ' pay rise could be funded
deputy prime minister clegg revealed details of a ' fierce ' coalition row over honouring the recommendation of an independent pay review body to give the full rise to teachers in england and wales speaking this afternoon he said : ' there 's quite a fierce debate going on in government right now about what we do for the recommendations for teachers
' the recommendation is that for some teachers , it depends where they are on their pay band , they get a 2 per cent increase
' that 's being resisted by george osborne
i just think it 's affordable , it would n't cost us the earth , it 's recommended and we should get on and do it
' he admitted that at a time of ongoing austerity the money ' has to be found from somewhere ' , but said next week 's budget would focus on raising more in tax from ' people who have got the means to chip in a bit of extra '
however , the tories hit back insisting there was not row and the deal was agreed this evening
mrs morgan told the bbc : ' this country is lucky to have a truly exceptional teaching workforce who do a vital job of opening up young minds
that 's i 'm delighted to approve a pay deal today which gives heads the freedom to offer their best and most experienced teachers a 2 per cent pay rise , something that is only possible because we trust heads and governors to decide how to reward their staff
' the pay review body believes that the rise for teachers could be made from within existing school budgets , meaning no additional cost to the taxpayer from central government
chancellor george osborne is accused of resisting a 2 per cent pay rise for teachers , something the tories denied tonight the nasuwt teaching union has warned teaching is already a far less attractive career choice after a series of coalition pay freezes and caps
it urged the pay body to recommend a ' substantial above - inflation pay rise '
general secretary chris keates said : ' the cuts to teachers ' pay has been a major contributory factor in the current teacher recruitment and retention crisis
' many teachers did n't even get the 1 per cent awarded in 2014 thanks to the excessive discretion schools have been given over teachers ' pay
' that is the context in which the argument over 1 per cent or 2 per cent is apparently taking place
it does n't even scratch the surface of what teachers have lost at the hands of this coalition
