' she added she feared a documentary on television the previous night about shipman , who killed hundreds of elderly patients , may have sparked caused her father to hallucinate

an investigation into mr albert bevins 's diagnosis was launched by the nhs trust after his death
at its conclusion , psychiatrist dr sean lennon from the manchester mental health and social care trust said mr albert bevins 's condition , dementia with lewy bodies , was not treated soon enough
' the referral was n't responded to urgently ... there were a number of delays in providing him with the care he required , ' he told the manchester inquest

' the widower 's family fear he may have been having a dream sparked by a television documentary about killer shipman ( pictured above ) shipman , a gp who murdered patients by administering killer injections , is described as one of the most prolific serial killers in uk 's history
for years the doctor went unnoticed as he prescribed patients with death sentences , killing them off for no other reason than for his own entertainment
born in leeds , the former doctor was his considered his mother 's favourite child
after she was diagnosed with lung cancer , he oversaw her decline and carefully observed the effects of morphine as a means of pain relief
following her death he vowed to attend medical school and later qualified to become a doctor , registering with a practice in yorkshire in the early 1970s
he later moved to hyde with his family where his sadistic tendencies were revealed
it was a local undertaker who first raised concerns after an unusually high number of shipman 's patients died in similar circumstances
largely they were recorded as having been found propped up on a sofa , fully clothed , at the time of their deaths
an inquiry was launched after one of shipman 's colleagues expressed similar concerns but he was cleared
but after a more thorough investigation police discovered he had altered medical records to evade suspicion
in 1998 , shipman was arrested for the murder of several patients
he consistently denied the allegations and was , according to investigators , arrogant throughout police interviews
a trial found him guilty of the murders of 15 patients though experts believe he is responsible for hundreds of other deaths
pathology reports found morphine toxicity was the cause of death among most of his victims
in 2004 , four years after being jailed for his crimes , shipman 's body was found hanging in the cell of the wakefield prison where he was being held
