the monopolies commision have clearly had a word with david pipe before saturday 's betfred midlands grand national as the nicholshayne handler does not have a runner
the uttoxeter marathon has been a benefit for the devon operation which has dominated the feature for the past four years
the absence of a pipe representative means the likes of jonjo o'neill , paul nicholls and venetia williams will fancy their chances of landing another prestigious staying event
jonjo o'neill has the ante - post favourite in catching on , who was ridiculously impressive at exeter on deep ground last time , travelling through the race like a horse well in advance of his current handicap mark

the layers look to have those two pegged , however , and there could be a little more juice in the price of samingarry ( uttoxeter , nap , 3.50 ) who hails from a yard that could not be in better form
five of nigel hawke 's last 11 runners have obliged , which is an outstanding feat given the size of his stable , and the selection looked a chaser capable of taking fairly high rank last year
he never quite lived up to that billing but the first - time headgear and tongue tie applied today could produce a better showing and he looks overpriced at his odds this morning
the coral.co.uk winter derby looks a terrific race and tryster ( lingfield , nb , 3.05 ) is taken to continue his rapid progress
