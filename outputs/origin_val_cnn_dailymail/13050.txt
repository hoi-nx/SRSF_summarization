moscow the ukraine girlfriend of slain russia opposition leader boris nemtsov faces constant psychological pressure from moscow authorities and fears she will be implicated in his death , her mother told cnn
model anna duritskaya , 23 , was walking with boris nemtsov on friday night when a gunman shot the politician about 100 meters ( 330 feet ) from the kremlin
" she was crying and she was saying boris nemtsov had been killed and he 's lying next to me , " said her mother , duritskaya
" she was in such shock she could n't say anything else
" duritskaya said her daughter was questioned until 2 a.m. monday
she said she fears authorities will implicate her daughter in the death because they have threatened to take her attorney away from her
the model had been staying at the apartment of an aide to boris nemtsov under constant police guard
late monday , yevhen perebyinis , a spokesman for ukraine 's foreign ministry , tweeted that duritskaya had left moscow for kiev
the assassination has spawned a flood of conspiracy theories
boris nemtsov was one of president putin 's most outspoken critics , and many suspect the kremlin of either direct or indirect involvement
duritskaya said her daughter knew the risks of getting involved with the prominent opposition leader
" of course when i heard she was dating him it was a bit of a shock , " she said
" then when i met him in person i liked him a lot as a person
he was straightforward , he treated my daughter very well , she was happy
and i could n't influence it anyway ; my daughter did what she wanted to
of course , i was worried and scared , but i could n't change it anyway
" thousands of boris nemtsov supporters gathered sunday in moscow to mourn the death of the 55 - year - old , who was deputy prime minister during president boris yeltsin 's administration
the event took place the same day boris nemtsov was supposed to lead a rally in moscow decrying russia 's policies on ukraine
ukraine president poroshenko said saturday that boris nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to russia interests , ukraine 's state - run ukrinform news agency reported
" a few weeks ago i had a conversation with him on how to build relations between ukraine and russia , as we would like them to be , " ukrinform quoted poroshenko as saying
" boris nemtsov said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the russia armed forces in ukraine
someone was very afraid of that
boris nemtsov was not afraid , the executioners were afraid
" putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting , the kremlin said
the president also wrote to boris nemtsov 's mother , saying he shared her grief , and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice , the kremlin said
police said they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches , russia 's sputnik news agency reported
the shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater
the investigative committee of the russia is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ( $ 49,000 ) for information leading to the arrest of the killer
it said the tipster will be guaranteed anonymity
on monday , the russia television station dozhd published an interview with anna duritskaya after her release
duritskaya told the interviewer she did not see who killed boris nemtsov , but that when she turned around she saw a light - colored car driving away
duritskaya said that her wish was to go home to ukraine to see her mother and that she did not believe she could attend boris nemtsov 's funeral on tuesday
speculation has pointed blame at everyone from putin , to a putin associate , to someone just irked by boris nemtsov 's business activities
" i doubt it was a direct order from putin , but it was this toxic atmosphere of hatred , " russia pro-democracy activist kasparov said
" it has been propagated by russia television 24/7
" boris nemtsov 's friend and political colleague yashin blamed putin more directly : " it 's clearly a political murder , " yashin said
" i do n't know who killed boris nemtsov , but i know that it 's the government and personally putin who are responsible for it
" putin offered a different theory : that the killing was a contract hit , but one meant to fire up political strife , his spokesman dmitry peskov said
one man near the site of boris nemtsov 's memorial said he thinks the killer was a putin opponent
" i do n't think putin did this , " he told cnn
" i think this was some radical group that wants to make putin look bad
" boris nemtsov had said he was at risk for assassination
he told the russia newspaper sobesednik last month that he was " a little bit " afraid his mother 's fears that putin would have him killed would come true
but he added , " i 'm not afraid of him that much
if i was afraid i would n't be heading an opposition party and do what i 'm doing
" opinion : the complicated life and tragic death of boris nemtsov critics of putin have in the past suffered miserable fates
last year , a moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of russia journalist and fierce kremlin critic anna politkovskaya
business magnate mikhail khodorkovsky accused putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps
late last year , kremlin critic navalny was found guilty of fraud in a politically charged trial
russia 's official news agency reported monday that a request by navalny to attend boris nemtsov 's funeral had been denied
and before his death , boris nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against putin 's government
kasparov , chairman of the human rights foundation 's international council , suggested the killing was linked to the kremlin 's own insecurity
" if you are popular your critics do n't have to be shot down in front of the kremlin , " kasparov tweeted
" putin is just food in a prison , eat it or starve
