contact police bird dies a slow agonising death ! â bizarre : the unknown criminal left a menacing note made from letters cut from magazines , saying : ' want your bird back alive text [ phone number ]
contact police bird dies a slow agonising death ! ' miss cosson ignored the threat and called police , who arrested a man in his 40s before bailing him
but joejoe , 16 , is still missing and she fears she will never see her pet again
now , she has made the ransom note public in a bid to highlight her case - and said fellow animal - lovers have offered to hire a private investigator to track down the bird
contracts officer miss cosson said : â everybody in the bird world knows about it and there has been no sign of a bird like joejoe being sold
i think the person who stole him still has him
this is not a conventional bird theft
' i released the letter because i thought if people saw the circumstances they would realise just how serious this is
it is getting harder as time goes on
it is things like going home and him not saying anything
' the house is so quiet without him
i am even considering moving house now because of the memories that i have of the theft - but i am never going to give up on joejoe
â miss cosson has had a pet bird since she was a child and is well - known locally as a parrot breeder
she has owned joejoe since he was 14 weeks old - and said he loves reggae and motown music
parrot : cosson was out at work when a raider entered her home and stole joejoe the african grey joejoe dances along to music and his favourite songs are needle in a haystack by the whispers and heat wave by martha and the vandellas , according to miss cosson
his owner , who lives alone , said he whistles the tune of summertime by nina simone , meows like a cat and enjoys drinking earl grey tea
she has even consulted a clairvoyant who said that the bird could be returned to her by may
miss cosson added : â joejoe is not a pet , he is family
he is a real character and everyone who had met him loves him
it feels to me that my child has been kidnapped , to want of a better word
people will think it is just a bird but he âs not
â the burglary took place on february 20 and miss cosson believes she knows who was behind it - because nothing else was touched
she suspects joejoe is being held in rushden or kettering in northamptonshire and is offering a Â£ 1,500 reward for his safe return
bedfordshire police said a man in his 40s was arrested in relation to the theft and bailed
a spokesman added : â unfortunately at this stage the parrot has not been recovered and the police investigation is continuing
â the african grey is regarded as one of the most intelligent animals in the world , on a par with dolphins and chimpanzees , and the species can live until they are 70 years old
they can develop human emotions and bored african greys can literally become sick as distress causes them to pluck out their own feathers .
