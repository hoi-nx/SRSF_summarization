we 're all guilty of putting an instagram filter or two on our pictures from time to time to try and make ourselves look better
but would you go so far as to slim yourself down in a picture ? well , some celebrities seem to be
from supermodel miranda kerr to pop princess britney spears it appears some of our favourite stars have been using photo editing tools to make themselves appear thinner
stars such as charlotte crosby and lauren goodger have previously posted pictures to the social networking site where they look considerably smaller than in paparazzi pictures of them taken on the same day
of course , people like beyonce and kim kardashian are no strangers to being accused of altering their photographs
these two photos were taken just two days apart whilst charlotte holidayed in perth in february , in the picture on the left she looks rounder than she does in her instagram snap on the right holly hagan has lost a lot of weight over the last year , however , she looked like her waist was slimmer in this picture posted to instagram ( right ) around the same time that she attended the ntas ( left ) when kim kardashian took a trip to the versace house in march 2014 she faced criticism for the picture on the right , in which she appeared to have slimmed her waist and hips some users like lauren goodger , who posted this picture before attending the clothes show live last year , may have used filters to smooth out their pictures even though she is already incredibly slim when miranda kerr attended a michael kors event in japan last year she raised eyebrows for this instagram snap in which it looked like she had slimmed down her waist jennifer lopez has beautiful skin already but it looks as though she used a filter to make it completely flawless in this picture taken as she promoted the boy next door in january beyonce is no stranger to controversy , she has previously been accused of slimming down her pictures and in this snap , taken whilst she was holidaying in the south of france , it looked like her waist was slimmer this week 's heat is out now when singer beyonce posted photographs of her summer holiday to instagram last year she was accused of slimming down both her waist and legs
and when kim kardashian took a trip to the versace house last year the picture she posted to the social networking site made her look thinner than those taken of her by the photographers waiting outside
they say the camera never lies , but some seem to be telling a few fibs
here are some more stars that might have been given a helping hand
in a lot of these pictures the difference between the paparazzi photographs and the stars instagram snaps is clear to see
for example in a picture posted by jennifer lopez in january , whilst she was promoting the boy next door , she posted a picture which looked like it had been heavily filtered
instagram first became popular a few years ago after initially being launched in 2010
on the app , which you download to your phone and tablet , you can take photos and then edit them or filter them to change their appearance
stars such as kim kardashian are a huge fans of the social network , it was even once reported that she has a special assistant whose job it is to edit her instagram pictures for her .
