the meyers family told police that tammy meyers was giving her daughter a driving lesson when there was a confrontation with the driver of another car
tammy meyers drove home and sent her inside to get her brother , brandon , who allegedly brought a 9mm handgun
tammy meyers and her son then went back out , police said
