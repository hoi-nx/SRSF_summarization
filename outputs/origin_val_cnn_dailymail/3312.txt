this time last season there was sudden hope for united , too
from the mist of poor football and modest results emerged a 3 - 0 home win against olympiacos in the champions league
glimpses of what we presumed was the real united were seen once more
a win at west ham followed in the premier league but then the opposition hardened
manchester city arrived at old trafford and took another huge chunk out of united âs credibility
it was a crushing loss for united from which they , and manager david moyes , never recovered
united manager louis van gaal pictured during his press conference on friday van gaal recognises the rivalry between united and liverpool is among the most fierce in football once again this weekend , united will attempt to build on something they hope will prove to be of substance
last weekend âs surprising 3 - 0 dismantling of tottenham has lifted spirits for louis van gaal and his team , but once again opposition of real calibre threatens to cast a shadow across united âs new dawn
and this time it is the greatest foe of all
the very mention of their name is enough to harden a mancunian stare
â they will always be our greatest rivals , â sir alex ferguson used to say
at anfield on sunday , liverpool and united begin in earnest a fight not for a champions league title or european eminence but for respectability
a scuffle for a top - four place is one motivated certainly by money but more by old - fashioned pride
for united , to finish outside the champions league places once again is unthinkable
if they really are to find the form they will need to see them through an uncomfortable run of fixtures between now and the season âs end , one feels it really needs to start here
wayne rooney ( centre ) and his united team - mates train ahead of the trip to liverpool on sunday van gaal revealed that the united team chef has been helping his side prepare for their premier league clash antonio valencia and radamel falcao battle for the ball during training on friday ahead of liverpool â the win ( against tottenham ) means nothing if you lose the next one and liverpool is not a ground where this club has won a lot , â said van gaal
â if we show that form again in liverpool then we are little bit further along
for our fans , it âs the enemy and it âs very important
â but the last time they lost in the league was against us
it was a long time ago so this will be very difficult
â liverpool have issues of their own to deal with between now and mid-may
raheem sterling âs contract stand - off will worry them while steven gerrard âs farewell from the club this summer needs to be handled properly
on the field , though , liverpool have the better form
monday night âs win at swansea was a little fortuitous but liverpool are now unbeaten in 21 domestic matches and if that âs not daunting enough , they play exactly the kind of football the modern united hate
â i have played their system , â said van gaal
â it âs not new
â mata scores against liverpool during their 3 - 0 pummelling at old trafford in december the last time liverpool lost in the premier league was at old trafford against united back in december mata ( from left to right ) , robin van persie and wayne rooney celebrate during their 3 - 0 win over liverpool van persie celebrates scoring against liverpool and united will hope they can do the same at anfield nevertheless , while his own side currently tends to play football by numbers â methodical and at times predictable â liverpool are more instinctive
ironically , that was evident the last time liverpool lost in the league , at old trafford back in december
the score was 3 - 0 to united that day but it was totally unrepresentative of the match pattern as their opponents began to use a three - man defensive line which manager rodgers has stuck with ever since
â i was impressed that day , â said rodgers
â the result was nât great and we had criticism because we lost but i was pleased with how dynamic the team looked
â we looked fast again
that gave me the real confidence
i knew i needed to be radical because we were so far off from where we wanted to be
it âs about putting in place something the players can fully believe in
â united manager van gaal will have to be on guard against an in - form liverpool unbeaten in 2015 in the league liverpool play quickly and love to go on the counter-attack , which van gaal will have to prepare his team for liverpool , as we know , play quickly , love to counter and have the kind of midfield runners who trouble earnest but limited defensive midfield players such as united âs daley blind
if united are to profit on sunday they must hope to take their opportunities and defend resolutely
it can be done , of course
for all liverpool âs attacking prowess , they can have days when they hit brick walls , days when the timing is out
rodgers still has not fathomed a plan b and it âs worth noting that for all the plaudits which followed liverpool âs recent win at home to manchester city , both goals came from distance
united do generally defend well and their goalkeeper remains on form
the save david de gea produced from santi cazorla towards the end of united âs fa cup defeat at home to arsenal 11 days ago was testimony to that
united goalkeeper david de gea has been in fine form for van gaal in the premier league this year liverpool must find their way past an in - form de gea if they are to get revenge for their 3 - 0 defeat a year ago , good goalkeeping was not enough to help united mask their deficiencies
as it turned out , their victory over olympiacos was little more than a shaft of light during a season that resembled a nine - month eclipse
this time we still do nât know which way they are heading
on friday night , van gaal suggested sunday will not be definitive
â the fight will last until the end , â he said
if it does , given their fixture list , the united manager will have done very well indeed .
