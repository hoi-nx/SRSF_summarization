why and how certain types of mushrooms glow has long confused scientists , but now they think they might have an answer
it appears that some fungi emit light to attract insects at night , which then spread their fungal spores around
and interestingly , the mushrooms are also able to sync up their ability with the circadian clock , so they only become bioluminescent when it is dark
scientists in brazil studied why certain species of mushroom glow
they found the ability helps them attract insects at night
these creatures will then move their fungal spores elsewhere
but the mushrooms are able to turn off the ability during the day
pictured is n. gardneri the research , published in the journal current biology , was led by the university of sao paulo
among bioluminescent organisms , fungi are the most rare and least understood
of more than 100,000 species of fungi , only 71 are known to produce green light , a process that uses oxygen and energy
scientists had thought they produce light around the clock as byproduct of their metabolism , but based on new evidence it seems that is n't so
the effect is triggered by a chemical reaction between luciferin , a light - emitting pigment , and the enzyme luciferase
it can occur in fungi as well as in a range of animals including jellyfish , squid , scorpions and other insects
in fact , the mushrooms ' glow appears to be under the control of a temperature - compensated circadian clock
this level of control helps them ' save energy ' during hours of daylight when they do not need to grow
at night , the green glow attracts insects including beetles , flies , wasps and ants
' it appears that fungi make light so they are noticed by insects who can help the fungus colonize new habitats , ' said dr stevani of brazil 's instituto de quã­mica-universidade de sã£o paulo
the circadian control of bioluminescence makes the process more efficient
' regulation implies an adaptive function for bioluminescence , ' added dr jay dunlap of dartmouth 's geisel school of medicine
here the species n. gardneri is seen during the day , when its bioluminescent ability ' turns off ' in order to conserve energy
scientists had thought they produce light around the clock as byproduct of their metabolism , but based on this new evidence it seems that is n't so to make the findings , the researchers made sticky , fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green led lights ( shown )
when those pretend fungi were placed in the forest , the ones that were lit led many more insects to get stuck than did comparably sticky dark mushrooms the research focused on n. gardneri , one of the biggest and brightest of bioluminescent mushrooms
n. gardneri is also called ' flor de coco , ' meaning coconut flower , by locals in brazil , where the mushroom can be found attached to leaves at the base of young palm trees in coconut forests
other fungi have other methods to disperse their spores like the common stinkhorn ( shown ) , which releases a foul smell to get flies to attract flies to make the findings , the researchers made sticky , fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green led lights
when those pretend fungi were placed in the forest where the real bioluminescent mushrooms are found , the ones that were lit led many more insects to get stuck than did comparably sticky dark mushrooms
the team are now hoping to identify the genes responsible for the mushrooms ' bioluminescence , and aims to explore their interaction with the circadian clock that controls them
they are also using infrared cameras to watch the interaction between n. gardneri mushrooms and arthropods , especially larger ones , more closely
and the findings could also reveal how mushrooms are dispersed by insects , which is important because n. gardneri plays a key role in forest ecosystems
' without them , cellulose would be stuck in its form , which would impact the whole carbon cycle on earth , ' said dr stevani
' i dare to say that life on earth depends on organisms like these
' some fungi in the group known as basidiomycetes , including two bioluminescent mushrooms , are also parasites of coffee and pine trees
as a result , stevani says , ' it is very important to know how basidiomycetes grow and consequently how they spread their spores
