a series of pictures snapped at a elimbah home - north of brisbane - owned by a man only known as bill shows the australian icons feasting on mince , the abc reported
griffith university 's darryl jones has been studying bird for about 20 years , taking a particular interest in bird feeding , and says he has never seen a phenomena like this before
this photo of lorikeets eating mince meat was snapped in elimbah - north of brisbane in queensland ' i 've not ever heard of lorikeets , who are seed eating birds , eat meats , ' he told daily mail australia
' what on earth are lorikeets eating meats for ? ' it 's not unusual for animals to eat bad food , humans do that every single day - we eat fat and sugars
' i ca n't imagine it could be good for them
i do n't recommend people feeding them meat
' professor darryl jones shed some light on why he thought lorikeets had taken a carnivorous turn
he said they must have acquired a taste for proteins when people put out food for other birds
griffith university professor darryl jones has expressed shock at seeing these seed - eating birds chow down on meat ' although you really should n't feed birds , there are a huge number of people who do anyway , ' prof darryl jones told daily mail australia
' magpies , butcher birds and kookaburras are meat eating birds and people put out chopped up sausage and ham for them
' since expressing his views on the photos , prof darryl jones said he had been inundated by emails from people claiming it was more common than he had thought
lorikeets are normally birds that favour a diet of seeds
prof darryl jones does not recommend feeding them meat ' i 've had 188 emails coming in , saying it happens ... so it 's not as rare as what i was thinking , ' he said
wildlife carer fran sanders - who has been taking in animals for 25 years in brisbane - told the abc she had also never seen this kind of behaviour from lorikeets
' i 'm absolutely amazed and horrified , ' she said
' i 've never heard any of them [ people she had helped ] talk about lorikeets coming down and eating mince
