west ham manager allardyce has again criticised referee mike dean for his handling of saturday 's london derby defeat by crystal palace
the west ham , currently in ninth place in the premier league , were beaten 3 - 1 by the crystal palace at the weekend in a contentious contest
allardyce felt that crystal palace striker murray , scorer of two goals at upton park , before being sent off in the 69th minute , should have been dismissed by mike dean in the first half for persistent fouling
murray was sent off for crystal palace during the 3 - 1 win against west ham on saturday allardyce was frustrated that murray was not sent off earlier in the game allardyce said : ' the biggest problem for me was that murray should n't have been on the field , not only because of persistent fouling but the level of his fouling
' mike dean , whom i have a lot of respect for , is a very good referee , but he was too lenient with murray by telling him ' that 's your last chance ' after the first booking
' in that particular instance , crystal palace have been let off
mike dean has a massive responsibility on the fact that ( murray ) was one of the main reasons why crystal palace won
' and for me that is something disappointing
the fact a referee warns a player for a tackle he has just made , which normally gets a yellow card , and yet he is only warned because he has just had a yellow card
' murray climbed highest to open the scoring for the visitors in the first half with a header murray got his second and crystal palace 's third when he glanced a header past adrian palace captain mile jedinak was caught on sky sports tv cameras apparently elbowing diafra sakho as they both challenged for the ball in the closing stages
though the incident was not seen at the time by the match officials , the fa have since charged the player with violent conduct â and crystal palace have until tuesday evening to appeal against that decision
allardyce has welcomed any retrospective punishment , saying that the australian midfielder deserves a ban for acting in a dangerous manner against the senegal striker
he added : ' mile jedinak was clearly in a position where mike dean could n't see it
i think about how dangerous it was
it was a very dangerous thing he did
he could have seriously injured diafra sakho
and he will have to take the punishment â because i think he deserves it
' mile jedinak has been charged by the fa with violent conduct after catching diafra sakho with his elbow the incident went unpunished during the game but mile jedinak was retrospectively charged elsewhere , in his pre-match press conference , ahead of the visit of chelsea to east london tomorrow night , allardyce spoke about the chats he enjoyed with dave , the former tottenham , derby , hearts and scotland enforcer , who died aged 80
allardyce said : ' i knew dave
he lived in around nottingham , when i was at notts county for three years ( 1997 - 1999 )
i spent many a good night with him talking away about his time in football , about management
' it 's a sad day
he was a terrific guy not just a terrific a footballer
in life , you take a lot of things from a lot of people
' if you want to get better , you do n't just read a book or do a masters ' degree at university ; you learn a lot from listening to the experiences of people who have been great in their own careers
