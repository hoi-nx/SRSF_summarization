wenger admitted arsenal paid for their first - leg collapse as they crashed out of the champions league at the last - 16 stage for the fifth successive season
their 3 - 1 first - leg defeat by monaco at the emirates came back to haunt them as they clinched a 2 - 0 win last night that sent them out on away goals
wenger said : â football is not a fairytale
it âs just a matter of being realistic and clinical and monaco were clinical in front of goal and maybe a bit lucky as well
wenger saw his arsenal side crash out of the champions league on tuesday monaco celebrated a place in the quarter - finals of the champions league at the expense of arsenal santi cazorla reacts to arsenal 's champions league exit despite a 2 - 0 win in the second leg in monaco â the performance was enough today and it could have been over at half time with the chances we had
â we knew before the game we had a 98 per chance to go out
we did fight but i felt some players were jaded offsnsively as they gave a lot on saturday and lacked bit of freshness
â overall we paid for the first game when we did nât produce the game we wanted
but when monaco played at home they had zero shots on target
â olivier giroud âs 36th minute goal and aaron ramsey âs strike in 79th minute gave arsenal hope in a night on which they attacked throughout and did their utmost â but ultimately the damage had been done at the emirates
arsenal defender laurent koscielny said : â we say the same thing every year
our first game is catastrophic
we have to put it right ... play well in two games â olivier giroud scored arsenal 's first goal at the stade louis ii to give them hope of a comeback aaron ramsey 's 79th - minute strike set up a grandstand finish , but arsenal could n't find a vital third goal wenger added : â it âs difficult to compare to the previous years because before we played against bayern and barcelona
we âre very disappointed to be out tonight but overall we âre on positive trend and this game on line with what we did recently â i would separate it from other years in which we have gone out
we âre very disappointed to be out of course bu there were a lot of positives in the games
but overall situation is very disappointing captain per mertesacker said : `` the best team went through
they deserved it because they played much better in the first leg
we had to come back from a massive deficit
we played well today but it was nât enough
â you come here and try absolutely everything
you look at the game and we could have scored more than two
we do nât look back to the first game - that was already over - and we tried to do our best today but it was nât enough
