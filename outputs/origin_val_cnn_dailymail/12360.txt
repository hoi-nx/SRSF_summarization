" law of the jungle , which never orders anything without a reason , forbids every beast to eat man
" i still remember the first time i read the passage from " the jungle book , " heart racing beneath my pajamas covered with man
" the real reason for this is that man - killing means , sooner or later , the arrival of white men on elephants , with guns , and hundreds of brown men with gongs , rockets and torches
then everybody in the jungle suffers , " kipling wrote
i probably understood that tiger attacks were fairly rare in milwaukee , but to my 11 - year - old brain , kipling was dropping wisdom that just might keep me alive on the next expedition into the weedy lot behind piggly wiggly
" the reason the beasts give among themselves is that man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things , and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him
" reading that passage 35 years later , while rolling through the very forest that inspired the classic , the irony in that line finally clicks
when we hear the woof of a frightened deer and my guide kills the engine , my grown - up heart pounds once again
it is a sign that there may be big cats nearby
" i wonder who will be the last person to see a tiger in the wild ? and are they alive today ? " these are the questions that launched this stop on " the wonder list , " and they led us to a much bigger question about life in the 21st century : is the planet still big enough for man and man - eater ? india is about one - third the size of the continental united states , with four times as many people
that kind of human pressure has changed kipling 's " law of the jungle " in dramatic ways
according to the animal conservation group born free , there are more tigers in cages in texas than in the forests of india
so i set out to understand how and why
having covered the poaching of african animals to feed the huge market for asian medicine , i assumed the demand for tiger - skin rugs in dubai or tiger - bone wine in beijing would be the biggest threat to this endangered cat
can tigers claw their way back from the brink ? but it turns out that tiger - human conflict is a much bigger problem
almost half a billion rural india have no plumbing and answer nature 's call by squatting in the forest
most tiger attacks happen when these people are mistaken for prey , and most tiger kills come in the angry hours that follow , as friends and neighbors of the victim seek revenge
and so , a new specialty in conservation is the art of tiger conflict mediation
it is not easy to convince a frightened farmer that the cat that ate his cow is more valuable alive than caged or dead
but these efforts , along with a more pointed anti-poaching campaign , seem to be paying off
the latest tiger census counted 2,226 big cats in india , a 30 % increase over the previous count in 2011
if the estimates hold , this would make india the only country in the world with a growing tiger population
but the human population is growing much faster
maintaining a healthy population of apex predators is just one new challenge on a planet that will welcome a couple billion more people in just the next generation
you 'll be surprised by the others as we seek india 's magnificent treasures -- both natural and man - made -- on the next episode of " the wonder list
