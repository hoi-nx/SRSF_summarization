' however , she admitted there are some advantages of having a mansion to play with , like this one on avenue road

the bedroom in 42 avenue road : ' there is nothing nicer than stepping out of bed onto a luxurious carpet for that feeling of comfort and luxury each morning , ' she says celia reveals her 10 simple design rules to transform any property rule 1 : mirror mirror on the wall according to celia , mirrors can be cleverly positioned to maximise light and give the feeling of space
' i will always use mirrors in rooms to enhance the sense of space and depth , ' she said
rule 2 : keep the floor constant ' linking flooring throughout enhances the sense of space
' keep the hallway living room , dining room and kitchen the same , she advised
' this will create a larger open - plan space and help your furniture and style flow
' rule 3 : create a colour punch celia advises keeping the colour scheme neutral but adding an accent shade to stay on trend
' by keeping colour in your accent colours it means they are also easy to change , giving you more flexibly in the future , ' she explained
rule 4 : find your star pieces ' one of my greatest tips is to always add a star piece into a room , ' said celia
the designer suggests a fantastic light , or an amazing centrepiece that captures attention on entering the room
rule 5 : play with textures celia advises layering and using different textures to add luxury and glamour
' mix plenty of textures with chrome , metallics and leather to really bring out the beauty of the contrasts
' rule 6 : plan ahead according to celia , mood boards are essential so that you plan your room out correctly
' you can choose the colours , layouts and style your rooms in advance to achieve your vision , ' she said
rule 7 : go large for impact ' large pieces of furniture in smaller rooms give the impression of a larger room when executed properly
' so do nât hold back on using large sofas and armchairs to create impact
rule 8 : set the mood think about the mood of the room and create a lighting scheme that fits
you do n't need fancy leds or systems , lamps can be just as effective
' mood lighting is essential to create a desired vibe in the room
from up - lighters to smart , changeable leds that give a warm glow , lighting is a powerful tool that must be used wisely , ' said celia
the bath creates a focal point in the bathroom : ' one of my greatest tips is to always add a star piece into a room , ' says celia ' by keeping colour in your accent colours it means they are also easy to change , giving you more flexibly in the future , ' celia explains rule 9 : walls are your walls a blank canvas for displaying art , or are they to be treated as features in themselves ? ' these are important question to ask yourself , ' advised celia
' in some projects i mirror the entire wall to create a feature piece
it âs important not to mix up the two up ! ' rule 10 : do n't forget comfort there 's no point making your house a masterpiece if it 's not enjoyable to live in
one comfort celia never goes without is carpet in the bedroom
