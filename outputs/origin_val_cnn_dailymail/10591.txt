police revealed they had performed the mandatory five - year review in ocotber 2011 before these concerns were raised and his gp had failed to inform them of further developments
chief inspector glen pavelin said : ' had essex police been in receipt of information from the gp around his deteriorating health that would have generated a period of review and intervention
' coroners mrs mcgann said : ' these are a very , very sad set of circumstances
' i am going to draw the attention of the home office to the fact that gp 's surgery was under no legal obligation to inform essex police of mr ambrose 's dementia
' the inquest at chelmsford coroners ' court ( stock picture ) today ruled mrs ambrose had been unlawfully killed while mr ambrose took his own life the couple had been described by neighbours in the village as ' pillars of the community ' , and at the time , neighbours paid tribute to the loving couple
anne grant , who lived nearby said : ' ambrose and wendy were a really likeable and very well - respected couple
' they were very kind and friendly and had lived in the community for more than 30 years
' they were pillars of the community
' they were really smart and a couple who were very loving and close to one another
' wendy had n't been very well and had been diagnosed with cancer and ambrose was in the early stages of dementia
' one good friend and neighbour said : ' there is no way he would have hurt her without good reason
' mr ambrose was a classic country gentleman - very traditional and law abiding
' he would tip his cap to you if saw you in the lane
' we know that his wife had suffered from poor health for several years
' recently she had been in and out of hospital with respiratory problems
' my understanding of the facts is that he wanted to end her pain and could not bear to live without her
