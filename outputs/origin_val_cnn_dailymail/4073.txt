a record has been set for the most snowfall in a day after a tiny italian village was dumped with 100 inches in 18 hours - forcing residents to ski between houses and climb out of second - floor windows
the village of capracotta , located in central italy around 125 miles east of rome , was hit with the polar blast on march 5 in a remarkable blizzard aggravated by powerful wind gusts
breaking a 1921 record set in silver lake , colorado , of 76 inches , incredible photos from inside the village show walls of snow carved out from the fronts of doors and shops
in some parts of the village the snow was like a long , white wall
' it was tough but everybody pulled together and made sure that the old people who could n't leave their houses had the food and medicines that they needed , ' the telegraph reported
according to weather website meteoweb , it was just one more record in a ' historic winter for italy , with numerous incidents of frost and snow '
pictures taken of the village show residents digging through snow that is metres deep and shaking hands from inside the second floor of homes with others standing on the snow piled up outside windows
remarkably , the town is not located within the alps - its susceptibility to massive dumpings of snow lies in its unique geography and location
sitting at an altitude of 1,421metres , it is the second - highest district in southern italy
it is also close to the sea and sits exposed to cold fronts from the northeast , making it one of the snowiest areas of the world when measured in terms of abundance over short periods of time

rather , its altitude and exposure to cold fronts from the northeast are what makes it susceptible to blizzards the town 's mayor , antonio monaco , described the snow as like a ' long , white wall ' residents use snow shovels ( left ) to work their way through the mountains of snow filling the city streets ( right ) a man digs a tunnel as high as himself using a snow shovel as he creates a pathway from his home even heavy machinery had difficulty making its way through the city streets
