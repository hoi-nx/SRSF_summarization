dhanusha , nepal at kathmandu 's tribhuvan international airport , hundreds of migrant workers line up daily at the immigration counters , clutching newly printed passports and boarding passes
many of them , though , are clueless as to where they 're headed
as a frequent traveler to the country , i 've been approached many times by these men , asking me to help fill out their departure forms
usually , when i ask what country they 're traveling to , i get the same answer : " i 'm not sure
" they seem weary and lost but still hopeful that they can make their lives better
this time , however , i 'm at the airport to follow up on the repatriation of the most unfortunate of these migrant workers -- far too many of them make the return journey in caskets
almost every day , the remains of three or four workers arrive back in nepal from the middle east , according to bhola prasad siwakoti , the secretary of the nepal ministry of labor and manpower
every other day , at least one dead body arrives from qatari , he said
" nepal migrant workers have the lowest per capita income in qatari , " says mishra , who served as ambassador to qatari from 2007 to 2012
" they get exploited the most out of all the migrant workers
" he cites lack of education and technical skills as the main causes
we are waiting for the body of kishun das , who left nepal for qatari only eight months ago
the 38 - year old was his family 's breadwinner and the father of five children
his younger brother , bishun , is at the airport to receive the body
he also works in qatari and is in nepal on leave
i ask him why he 's alone
" we do n't have money to bring other family members to receive the body , " he says
" but they have been calling me every other minute asking for the update
" i 'm at the administration filling out the paperwork
" he tells the caller on his phone
" no , he is n't getting any compensation
" with more than 350,000 migrant workers , nepalis make up the second - biggest community in qatari , after indian , the embassy in qatari claims
when contacted about the deaths of foreign workers in qatari , a spokesman for the labor ministry said that all workers deserve to be protected against exploitation
al-mraikhi estimated that some 400 indian and nepal workers die each year in qatari
" it is desperately unfortunate that any worker should die overseas , in a foreign land , away from their family , " the spokesman said
" but it would be wrong , we believe , to allow the statistics to be consistently distorted to suggest that all deaths in a population of 1.5 million people are apparently the result of workplace conditions , either directly or indirectly , which is the prevailing and erroneous narrative
" al-mraikhi spoke about recent changes in his country , including the introduction of a wage protection system , improved living conditions and increased penalties for companies that violate rules
" while the vast majority of workers in qatari are fairly treated , we recognise that a minority are not
that is why we are reforming labour laws and practices , " he said in a statement
as we wait at the airport , a qatar airways plane lands
at 7:40 pm , it is the last of three that depart and arrive every day
before qatari won the right to stage the fifa world cup in 2022 and embarked on a hugely ambitious , holistic construction plan to support it , it was a single flight a day
hundreds of passengers disembark from the plane
" they are mostly migrant workers returning home , " an airport official tells us
we spot a cargo worker transporting a bright red box carrying the body of kishun das
even in a country where even a fight between two stray dogs can gather a sizable crowd , coffin arrivals do n't seem to attract many spectators
the scene has become all too common
the coffin is loaded on to a jeep provided for free by the nepal government
we follow it on the journey to the family 's village in dhanusha district , a seven - hour drive from kathmandu
" normally , vehicles are not allowed to drive on this highway after 8 p.m. because of the dangerous condition of some of the roads at night , but since i 'm carrying a coffin , the police let me go , " the driver of the jeep tells us
the nepal government has eight vehicles designated to deliver coffins
" they call me the coffin guy , " the driver says with a dark smirk
at around 1 a.m. , we stop at a roadside shack
all of us eat except for kishun das ' brother
for religious purposes , i need to remain pure
so , i ca n't eat anything , " he says
i see him buying alcohol shortly after
" i 'm too stressed because of my brother 's death
i need to comfort myself
" back in qatari , where alcohol is banned , he and his friends manage to fulfill their needs courtesy of the local black market , he tells us
" it ( the alcohol ) is of very poor quality , but that is our only option , " he adds
even before we arrive at the village just at the break of dawn , we hear the howling
dozens of villagers have already gathered at kishun das ' home
his father cries out in agony , " hey lord , what have you done ? " then he faints
all the family members shout at the coffin
the wailing and shouting is almost deafening
and it goes on for hours
as a journalist working in south asia , i have seen a lot of desperation and misery
but the screeching was so intense ; it 's something i will never forget
" he alone was taking care of his parents and his family
how will they survive now ? " a villager asks
most of the spectators are women
most of the men from the village have gone to the middle east to work
the few who are left behind start preparing for his cremation
mishra , the former ambassador , says 55 % of nepal migrant workers deaths in qatari are from " sudden " cardiac arrest , 20 % die from work - related accidents , 15 % from traffic accidents and an alarming 10 % commit suicide
nepal government records show more than 290 workers have died in the gulf state in the past 420 days
put another way , two nepal workers die in qatari every three days
these are young men dying in the prime of their life
" the cause of deaths needs to be investigated properly , and urgently , " mishra says
" in general , it is due to tension led by exploitation , adverse climate , poor working and living conditions and alcoholic intoxication
" in kishun das ' village , almost all the men we meet have spent time working in the middle east
many had recently returned from qatari
they tell stories of hardship and of the deaths of their co-workers
time and again , none of them seems to be convinced with investigations into their friends ' and compatriots ' deaths
and again , amongst the keening and wailing of his distraught family , no one is sure how kishun das , brought back home in a red coffin along hazardous roads , met his end in qatari .
