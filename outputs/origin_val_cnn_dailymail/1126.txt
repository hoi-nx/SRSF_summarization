michael has revealed that his teen son dylan was the victim of anti-semitism on a family holiday last year
the 70 - year - old actor found himself forced to confront his son 's abuser after the 14 - year - old came to him in tears
in an op - ed piece in the los angeles times douglas explained how he told his child : ' dylan , you just had your first taste of anti-semitism
the father and son pictured during a visit to israel 's city of david last year michael explained that the teen was visibly upset when he came to his father in the family 's hotel room , following a visit to the hotel swimming pool in europe
being the father of a teenager , michael asked if the boy had provoked the man 's anger by misbehaving , only to be met with his son 's tears
it was then that the game star caught sight of his son 's star of david necklace
he wrote : ' i had an awful realization of what might have caused the man 's outrage ... after calming him down , i went to the pool and asked the attendants to point out the man who had yelled at him
it was not a pleasant discussion
afterward , i sat down with my son and said : " dylan , you just had your first taste of anti-semitism
" ' defending his faith : michael explained that like his childhood , his son dylan is growing up with a father who is jews , but a mother - the actor 's wife catherine zeta-jones ( l ) - who is not ' like a disease ' the actor compared anti-semitism to a disease that flares up for reasons such as bad economic times , demographics , and an irrational and misplaced fear of israel

the star of david is a symbol of the jews faith , made out of two overlapping triangles
the hexagram was never a uniquely jews symbol but became a widespread sign of the faith when it was chosen for the flag of the first zionist congress in 1897 and later the state of israel
the star of david is often worn by jews believers in the same way christians wear necklaces with the cross
michael was not raised in the jews faith for although his father kirk douglas is jews , his mother diana is not
however his son 's growing interest in judaism led michael to explore his father 's faith later in life
he told of the first time he had to defend his faith , when a high school friend casually commented : ' all jews cheat in business
' ' anti-semitism , i 've seen , is like a disease that goes dormant , flaring up with the next political trigger , ' he continued
the oscar winner cited bad economic times , demographics , and an irrational and misplaced fear of israel as reasons for a resurgence in anti-semitism
however , he is n't content to just accept such circumstances , commenting that he hopes his son will never have to teach his children about it the way he just had to
he issued a call to action for people to fight back against such feelings of hate , saying : ' so that is our challenge in 2015 , and all of us must take it up
' ' because if we confront anti-semitism whenever we see it , if we combat it individually and as a society , and use whatever platform we have to denounce it , we can stop the spread of this madness
