for those desperately in need of a weekend by the sea , look no further than scotland 's southeast coast , only an hour drive from bustling edinburgh
while the charming town of north berwick offers plenty of quaint b&bs to choose from , the refurbished sheriff hall granary , in east lothian , provides the perfect base for larger groups or families to explore the area
but , be warned : you will be required to disconnect fully , as wifi is not always readily available , and 3g access is spotty to say the least
sheriff hall granary , located near north berwick in east lothian , scotland , is a refurbished grain storehouse as it turns out , the three - day break from our mobiles was a blessing - though no easy feat for seven twenty - somethings from london - as it forced us to get outside and actually speak to each other while spending time in the home 's circular sitting room
finding the house - without cell phone service , i might add - was the first hurdle to cross on our way to a relaxing weekend by the shore
arriving in edinburgh on the last thursday evening flight out of london luton , by the time we had secured our car rental , we were well into the midnight hour
our first several attempts to find the house , without the help of gps or street lights , was simply put , a comedy of errors
thankfully , the owners are used to dealing with such overwhelming confusion and after several hours - and several phone calls - we pulled up to the sprawling granary , which had been turned into a holiday home several years ago by the owner 's father - in - law
sheriff hall is located just a 10 minute drive from the quaint seaside town of north berwick charlie ( pictured ) posing at the north berwick marina , where plenty of sailboats are available to rent despite the late night , we woke up early to set out in search of the closest town , north berwick , with its quaint shops , artisanal bakeries , and most important for our weary - traveller purposes , a tesco
our hunt for food was quickly abandoned , however , when we saw the stunning west bay beach , which in the low tide , seemingly went on forever
the small marina was every bit as picturesque , offering views of the firth of forth and plenty of brightly - coloured sailboats and canoes tied up and waiting to be taken out
for those travelling with small children , it 's also worth noting that the harbour is home to the scottish seabird centre , where tours can be organised to learn more about the area 's local marine life , most notably gannets and puffins
in the low tide , the stunning west bay beach seemingly goes on forever , overlooking the firth of forth the small town is full of quirky souvenir shops , artisanal bakeries and charming local eateries on the sprawling sheriff hall property , there are many friendly horses ( and chickens ) roaming free back at the granary , the holiday home is situated on a working farm , which means , animal lovers may even be able to take part in the horses ' morning feedings , so long as you ask nicely
chickens roam the property freely , alongside the horses and , at times , the owner 's two friendly labradors
near the main entrance of the granary is a cow barn , which , especially for the young urban males in our group , provided many hours of entertainment
what can i say ? they work in the city
the north berwick law towers 187 m ( 614 ft ) above the town , but offers a relatively easy climb along its paths at the summit of the law is the famous ' whale 's jawbone , ' although its now a fibreglass replica the law offers beautiful panoramic views of the township , coastline and the firth of forth in the distance follow the gravel driveway from the house 's front door and you 'll stumble across the entrance to john muir way , a 215 km ( 134 mile ) walking path that stretches across the country , from helensburgh in the west through to dunbar on the east coast
from sheriff hall , you can walk towards the town of north berwick and the tantallon castle , which turns out to be about a two - hour trek , or , alternatively toward east linton and on to the end of the trail at dunbar
although we initially set out for dunbar , we unexpectedly wound up walking back toward north berwick and its staggering 187 m ( 614 ft ) hill , known as the law
the summit features the remnants of an iron age fort and the town 's infamous whale jawbone , which has stood there atop the peak since 1709
currently , a fibreglass replica of the original can be seen upon scaling the hill , after being anonymously donated in 2008
inside the home , which has been remodelled to the highest quality , there is a working fireplace and piano the sleeping quarters are located in two separate wings - perfect for families vacationing together and inside the house , the rustic furnishings are just as beautiful as the stately grounds
the main living and dining area is circular , with several floor - to - ceiling windows illuminating the entire space
a working fireplace and grand piano offer two additional luxurious touches
there are two bedroom wings located on either side of the house and accessible via separate staircases
a second sitting area can be used upstairs , next to the master bedroom and master bathroom the main staircase leads to a second living space , complete with master bedroom , bathroom and children 's play area - perfect if two families are travelling together
on the other side , the upstairs boasts a double bedroom , one room with two twin beds and an additional bathroom
downstairs , off the kitchen , you 'll find the house 's fourth bedroom , complete with bunk beds , and during the warmer months , younger visitors will undoubtedly be equally as thrilled to find an enclosed pool off to the side of the back garden
and with easter , and the may bank holidays , just weeks away , there 's no better time to visit
