ryan taylor looks set to start against man united after haidara sustained a knee injury ryan taylor ( centre ) has made just four premier league appearances since the start of the season haidara had to be carried off on a stretcher during newcastle 's 1 - 0 win against aston villa head coach john carver is already without steven taylor and paul dummett , while davide santon and mapou yanga-mbiwa were allowed to leave the club in january
and he said : â we thought haidara might be available but he 's got a bit of fluid on the knee and has been for an injection , so he almost certainly wo nât make it
â we 're short of defenders and we 've not got many possibilities , so ryan taylor comes into contention and he filled that role very well the other day
â but with another injury i 'll have to start to try pulling rabbits out of a hat
â when asked if he had been left short by the club âs failure to bring in january reinforcements , john carver said : â the squad itself is big enough , we 've just been so unfortunate with these injuries
â you normally have three or four of these long - term injuries per season , but we 've had more than that with nine already
â our squad at the start of the season was in a healthy position , the only thing you can do is go into the out - of - contract market and it might be something we look at , but not yet
â papiss cisse will be hoping to add to his first - half winner against aston villa when he faces man united john carver is all smiles as he puts his players through their paces ahead of wednesday 's match
