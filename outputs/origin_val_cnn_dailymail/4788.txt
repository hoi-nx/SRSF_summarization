scully , from melbourne , was charged last year with human trafficking and child porn - related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients
the 51 - year - old managed to avoid being arrested until february 20 this year before a former partner told police that scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013
it was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10 - year - old girl were found at a home formerly rented by scully in malaybalay , bukidnon

cousins , going by the name of daisy , 11 , and and queenie , 10 , told rappler news site about the fateful day in september 2014 when they were approached by scully 's live - in partner , carme ann ' angel ' alvarez
alvarez , who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of scully 's , offered the girls food at centrio mall in cagayan de oro city and then invited them back to their house
daisy said when they got to the house , alvarez bathed the girls while scully , who she referred to as the ' american ' , videoed them
the next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task
it was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other
' i started crying , i do n't know what we were doing , ' a tearful daisy said

the next day daisy said they were forced to perform sexual acts on the man
' i was crying and screaming so much that alvarez covered my head with a pillow
i choked so much but scully continued his abuses on me , ' daisy said
' alvarez slapped me and said that i if do n't stop crying , scully will continue doing this
' the girls were then told to keep digging after the horrendous ordeal
