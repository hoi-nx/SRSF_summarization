out of european , out of the fa cup and on the verge of being out of the barclays premier league title race , this was the first of nine games man city simply could not afford not to win
operation siege mentality kicked in shortly after the final whistle of wednesday 's champions league exit at the hands of barcelona when hart faced the cameras in the nou camp tunnel
' i will never give up , ever , and i could safely say that nobody in our dressing room will ever give up either , ' said the defiant goalkeeper
wilfried bony celebrates after scoring man city 's first goal after 25 minutes at the etihad the ivorian opened his account for the club when he spun inside the box before firing into the net man city boss manuel pellegrini believes his side are capable of catching league leaders chelsea ' west brom is a huge game and we turn our focus to that
we have no excuse not to throw everything at the barclays premier league now and give our all - to the fans , the owner , to everyone
' his under - fire manager sang from the same hymn sheet in his programme notes
' it 's not impossible for chelsea to drop six points , ' manuel pellegrini wrote
' we have to continue to believe
' it is nonsense to suggest there is nothing to play for
' the message spread to the home support
they like being the underdogs here ( remember last season ? ) and from the off the masses were behind their team
after 90 seconds they got a boost they could not have dreamed of when referee swarbrick wrongly sent off mcauley after last - man dawson brought down wilfried bony on the edge of the area
swarbrick brandishes a straight red card to a bemused mcauley after just 89 seconds of the match west brom players darren fletcher and jonas olsson protest as swarbrick shows mcauley the red card bt sport showed the incident from referee swarbrick 's perspective , with no 25 dawson the closest to him apparently the joke flying around the west brom training ground is that the lookalike pair are never seen in the same place at the same time
nobody from the visiting contingent was laughing here
this was time for man city to prove themselves and prove to the nation that there is still life left in the title race
wilfried bony , with no goals in six outings since his Â£ 28million switch from swansea city , had his own point to make and he did so to break the deadlock , calmly capitalising on a lucky deflection to neatly turn , set himself up and fire the home side into the lead
after help from the referee , man city then got some from west brom
for long periods , with a game of attack vs defence taking place , the etihad resembled a school playground
the woeful defensive mix - up that handed fernando the second goal on a plate would have caused red faces in the classroom , let alone a barclays premier league dressing room
the procession continued throughout the second half
in the absence of yaya toure , out with an achilles problem , frank lampard probed and created
with west brom reluctant to leave their own half there were few occasions when hart , so busy on wednesday night , had to contemplate taking off his slippers and putting down his pipe
man city midfielder fernando doubled his side 's lead in the 40th minute with a close - range finish man city playmaker david silva added a third in the 77th minute to complete the rout at the etihad saido berahino inexplicably headed onto the bar from close range but other than that there was little to lift the mood of those who had travelled from the black country which will have darkened further when david silva deflected sub stevan jovetic 's shot home for the third
at times this was man city back to their fluent best
quick short passes and chance after chance against overwhelmed opponents
too much , however , should not be read into this cakewalk
tougher challenges will lie ahead and manuel pellegrini , who believes a lack of goals is what is hurting his team the most , will have been upset by the number of missed chances
but on a sunny , spring afternoon at the etihad we saw the first shoots of a man city recovery which might just see a title challenge blossom .
