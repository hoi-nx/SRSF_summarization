ronaldo disappeared straight down the tunnel of the santiago bernabeu on sunday night while the rest of his team - mates went to the centre - circle to applaud supporters
it followed a strange night for the real madrid forward just seven days ahead of the clasico
he failed to celebrate bale âs opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring
ronaldo failed to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the area and when the ball was headed off the line bale volleyed it into the top corner
incredibly ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after bale converted the rebound
ronaldo can not mask his frustration after striking the post with an early chance to put real madrid ahead the world player of the year endured a difficult game , with his temper bubbling below the surface it was a tough night for ronaldo , who will need to improve in time for next week 's clasico gary lineker tweeted : â ronaldo 's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to bale scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy
â ronaldo was also frustrated when bale scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a ronaldo shot but enough to divert it past the levante goalkeeper to wrap up the three points
he also missed a string of chances the day after he was overtaken by messi in la liga âs list of top scorers for this season
ahead of their meeting at the nou camp next week the argentine has 32 goals â two more than ronaldo
ever since ronaldo collected his third balon dâor in january and announced to the world that he was â coming for â messi who has four ballon d'or awards , things have worked in reverse for the planet âs two finest players
ronaldo nicks the ball past levante 's ivan lopez but he did n't stay behind at the end to applaud the fans this acrobatic ronaldo volley was headed off the line , before bale fired in the rebound to make it 1 - 0 video bale was more motivated - carlo ancelotti messi was 12 goals behind ronaldo last december but he has not been able to stop scoring since the turn of the year and real madrid âs portuguese striker has dried up
â ronaldo was lively because he made the first goal and the second
he did nât score but he contributed a lot , â said carlo ancelotti after the game
ronaldo hardly cracked a smile when celebrating with team - mate dani carvajal the frustration was written all over ronaldo 's face as he leaned against the frame of the goal and he did n't look a happy chappy sitting on the pitch during his side 's la liga victory the italian coach said he had no reason not to be positive ahead of next week âs clasico and admitted : â bale was more motivated than usual and the presence of [ luka ] modric helps him
they know each other very well from playing together at tottenham
' he will need his talisman ronaldo back in the right frame of mind before the game however
last week ronaldo had to be dragged to the centre - circle by captain iker casillas , on sunday night he ducked out of the post match tradition altogether
at least next week âs league deciding showdown is away from home .
