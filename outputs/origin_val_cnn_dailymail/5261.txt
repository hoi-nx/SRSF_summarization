extreme care should be taken when washing your hair and while you may think scrubbing hard will thoroughly cleanse it , that could n't be further from the truth
putting too much pressure on your scalp can actually result in greasier hair
as barton explains : ' do nât rub your scalp too vigorously
this will encourage oil secretion from the sebaceous gland '
stylists also say it 's imperative to rinse your hair for twice the amount of time as lathering on product and never use hot water
' women often wash their hair with water which is too hot , thinking it will make hair cleaner , ' said barton
washing your hair in tepid water is better for the follicles with the added bonus of saving money on your bills
' the hot water activates the sebaceous gland which secretes oil and can leave hair greasy soon after washing
use warm , tepid water for ultra clean hair and to extend the life of your blow dry
' do n't rely on just one shampoo thought a standard shampoo will give you the hair of your dreams ? wrong
' we put our hair through a lot in the week , so as you might exfoliate your skin once a week to remove dead skin cells , washing hair with a clarifying shampoo will allow hair and scalp to breathe , ' said barton
use a clarifying shampoo , such as pureology purify , once a week to remove impurities and product build up
when drying , avoid rubbing with towels , this creates friction and can damage the cuticle leaving hair dull and lifeless , blot dry instead to prevent damage barton also believes it 's essential to work scalp care treatments into your regime
' this is where the nutrients are produced to support healthy hair growth , ' he said
scalp care products such as kã©rastase initialiste and tresemmã© renewal hair & scalp range can help leave hair feeling thicker , shinier and more resistant

nioxin have launched dermabrasion services for the scalp , which promise to remove build - up and restore the condition by accelerating scalp surface regeneration through exfoliation
aveda , meanwhile , have a healthy hair service whereby specialists use a camera to magnify the scalp to 600 per cent to analyse hair density and the scalp 's oil levels
they then analyse the results and create a bespoke programme for your hair , which promises to leave it glossy from root to tip. issie churcher , hob salons â creative colour director , also believes in the power of double shampooing and exfoliating
she explained : ' investing in professional shampoo and conditioner such as a duo from the wella sp or nioxin range means washing your hair daily can be beneficial to a healthy scalp , aiding in hair growth
' to achieve the best results from your shampoo , make sure hair is well saturated with water this will help in achieving the best lather , allowing the hair and scalp to be cleansed thoroughly
' two shampoos is advisable to make sure hair and scalp is thoroughly cleansed and always finish with a conditioner appropriate for your hair type and avoid conditioner on the scalp to prevent oily roots
do n't rub too hard and never towel dry your hair you may be in a rush but all hairdressers emphasise the importance of avoiding towel drying
' when drying , avoid rubbing with towels , this creates friction and can damage the cuticle leaving hair dull and lifeless , blot dry instead to prevent damage , ' said issie churcher
dabbing your hair with the towel , followed by a quick squeeze to get rid of excess water is the way forward
it 's also important to avoid combing your hair after you 've showered and instead take a wide - toothed comb through locks whilst your in the shower waiting for your conditioner to work its magic
never comb your hair straight after washing it , instead comb through it whilst the conditioner is setting in
