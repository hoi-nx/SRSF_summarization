blair and brown attended the service but left out of a back entrance of st paul âs to avoid coming face to face with the families of those who died in afghanistan
mr blair , the prime minister who took britain to war , and his successor left several minutes before the other guests , escorted by bodyguards to separate bmw saloons
relatives had reacted with fury last week when told mr blair and mr brown would be among the congregation , with one saying mr blair has â got blood on his hands â
meanwhile , inside the cathedral , labour leader ed miliband , was seen rubbing his eyes and cupping his head in his hand before he appeared to drop off to sleep
a spokesman for mr blair said he had to leave quickly to fly to an economic conference in egypt
a labour spokesman said : ' to suggest ed miliband fell asleep during the afghanistan memorial service yesterday is categorically untrue
it is deeply offensive to both our armed forces and to ed. ' out of line : ed miliband seems to duck down as he stands with prime minister david cameron and nick clegg feeling tired ? mr ed miliband rubs his eyes , cups his head in his hand and then appears to drop off quick exit : former prime ministers brown ( left ) and blair at friday 's commemoration
