the sound of popping champagne corks and hushed conversations fills the small garden terrace
fairylights twinkle in the palm trees , illuminating the frescoed ceilings of the chateau marmont
beyond the tall , white walls of los angeles 's most historic hotel - built in the twenties - is the murmur of hollywood , where on sunday eddie redmayne 's oscars dreams came true
in the hotel restaurant , my fish comes with a sprinkling of hollywood glamour - eva longoria and richard gere are dining
glamour at every turn : tourists can gain a close glimpse of the hollywood sign with via a ranch ride no one bats an eyelid , except me
running into the odd a-lister - or desperate housewife - is business as usual in hollywood , particularly in awards season
but you do n't stand much chance if your tinseltown experience is limited to the walk of fame and cemented handprints outside the tcl chinese theatre on hollywood boulevard
happily , there are plenty of better hotspots where you can catch up with your favourite celebs

the following evening , i dodge the paparazzi waiting for jessica alba outside craig 's restaurant in hollywood
i am tucking into my southern fried honey chicken when she slips out via the kitchen

this is where local foodies - including cameron diaz and claire danes - come to pick up their groceries
just up the road is the hollywood roosevelt hotel , a glorious spanish - inspired property that 's earned its place in history
not just as the birthplace of the oscars - the first ceremony took place in the blossom ballroom in 1929 - but for the showbiz royalty that have stayed and played here
