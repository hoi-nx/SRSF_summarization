they were just ten and seven when their beautiful tv presenter mother , caron , lost a long battle with breast cancer at just 41
a decade later , they have transformed from angelic - looking boys into strapping , handsome young men
charlie is currently enjoying a year out from his advertising degree to complete internships and gabriel , his gentle younger brother , is in his final year studying his a-levels
the boys were just ten and seven when they lost their mum , caron , to breast cancer as they were : doting gloria , pictured with her grandsons as young children , says she feels disappointment that her daughter is n't here to watch her sons ' achievements the days when she could cradle them in her arms have long passed but their achievements leave their grandmother , gloria , bursting with pride
however she admits her happiness hides traces of disappointment that their mother has missed sharing their milestones
the loose women panelist and tv presenter , 74 , said : â the only time i do get frustrated is when i think about all the brilliant moments caron âs missing as the boys grow up
' when charlie first went to university , i felt really quite disturbed by that
caron had an understanding of english literature that i do nât have
she would have loved to sit down with charlie and now with gabriel to discuss whatever it was that they were studying
â from the research i âve done , it seems that a child misses a parent most when he graduates , when he gets engaged , when he marries and particularly when he has his first child
you want to show your child to your parents
and charlie and gabriel will never be able to do that with their mother
â what bolsters miss hunniford , who is married to hairdresser stephen way , is the warm and loving relationship she has with her grandsons
they tease her mercilessly , which she plainly adores , calling her a variety of names from glo , to g-dog , g-lo or big g. she said : â what helps to sustain me now is that they âve turned out to be such fine young men
and i think it âs lovely that they âre still very huggy with me , very demonstrative which is nât always the case with boys of their age and they rib me all the time
â they âre part of my healing
i see caron âs spirit living on in them and that âs a comfort to me
charlie has her wicked sense of humour and gabriel looks so like her
they âve been in my life from the moment they entered the world , quite literally
caron asked me to be there as each of them was born
so the bond between us has always been exceptionally tight and was made even more so because of her loss
â miss keating was a popular blue peter presenter and was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997
she was initially told she would be lucky to survive more than 18 months but went on to live for seven years before she died in her mother âs arms in 2004
unbreakable bond : gloria keeps the memory of caron , who passed away in 2004 , alive with regular fundraising events for the caron soon after , miss hunniford , backed by the rest of the family , set up the caron which has now raised millions , given away in small grants to hundreds of deserving causes for all types of cancer
at the end of november ( 2014 ) , a glitzy dinner at the dorchester was organised to celebrate caron âs life and to talk about the foundation
a succession of famous faces , both in person and on screen , paid their tributes
ant and dec , cliff richard , janet ellis , rod stewart , michael ball , neil diamond , rob brydon â all shared recollections of the popular tv presenter
the blue peter presenter lost her battle with breast cancer when her sons , charlie and gabriel , were just 10 and seven charlie joked : â and i learnt a few things about mum - i did nât know that phillip schofield could have been my dad
apparently , he and mum went out together for about a year which was something no one had ever told me
â there were insights for gabriel , too , about his quirky dress sense : â i did nât realise me and my mum shared the same shopping habits
she also tended to buy clothes that a normal person might not
' for example , i got it into my head recently to buy a completely white puffa jacket which is totally impractical as i discovered today when a girl gave me a big hug and got foundation all down it
glo tells me mum was into grunge before it had been invented
she had a really wacky dress sense
and she was a hoarder like me
â gloria on caron 's wedding day to the boys ' father russ lindsay
he 's since gone on to remarry , to television presenter sally meen , and have two daughters their father russ lindsay went on to marry breakfast presenter sally meen , 49 , in 2006 and the boys have two half - sisters they adore : tilly , six and flora
charlie and gabriel are committed to running the foundation in the future but for now miss hunniford is more than happy to carry on , for keeping caron âs memory alive is a source of comfort : â i have a little saying , â she said : â people never die if they live on the lips of the living
