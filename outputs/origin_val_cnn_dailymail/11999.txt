death row : gissendaner is set to die by lethal injection in georgia at 7pm tonight the only woman in georgia on death row is due to be executed tonight at 7pm - after an astonishing last meal of cheeseburgers , fries , ice cream and a fatty salad - unless lawyers can convince officials to spare her life
kelly renee gissendaner , 46 , is due to be given a lethal injection at a state prison in jackson in retribution for plotting the murder of her husband in 1997
she was sentenced to die after her boyfriend , owen , stabbed douglas to death at her urging
gissendaner , who will be the first female executed in georgia in 70 years , has also made headlines with her request from prison authorities for a no - holds - barred last meal
the feast includes two burger king whoppers , two large orders of fries , cornbread , a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing , popcorn and cherry - vanilla ice cream
however , there is a chance she receive a last - minute stay of execution - if her lawyers convince georgia 's justice system to cancel the killing
attorneys are mounting a last - ditch attempt to persuade the state board of pardons and paroles to commute her sentence to life without parole
she was denied clemency at a hearing last week , but lawyers argue that extra witnesses from within the prison system could help persuade them
previous attempts have rested on her remorse and new - found faith
in a statement ten years ago , gissendaner herself said : ' i deserve to be here , but i do n't deserve to die '
murder : gissendaner , shown left in her arrest mugshot from 1997 , is facing death for plotting the murder of her husband
however , her boyfriend owen , right , who actually did the deed , is not on death row and could be paroled within a decade monster meal : gissendaner , pictured above with a regular prison meal , requested an enormous spread including two cheeseburger meals , cornbread , ice cream , and popcorn for her last meal she has also drawn attention to the fact that , while she did not kill her husband , the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing death - and will be eligible for parole in 2023
if the bid fails , her lawyers are expected to ask the supreme court to intervene
it has already denied one appeal
her execution had been due to take place last week , but was canceled after a winter storm caused disruption in the area
gissendaner would be the first woman executed in georgia since 1945 and only the 16th woman put to death nationwide since the supreme court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976
gissendaner 's lawyers note that the parole board already heard from many people testifying about her faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency
but , her lawyers argue , the board did not hear from many department of corrections employees whose perspective ' would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case
' the most important witness the board did not hear from is seabolt , who served as her warden for six years , first at metro state prison and then at lee arrendale state prison
locked away : gissendaner , pictured above in 2004 , has been locked up for the past 17 years seabolt could testify that former parole board chair donald promised gissendaner would receive clemency , her lawyers wrote
each time the topic came up in conversations between donald and seabolt , ' donald reiterated his statement that ms. gissendaner did not need to worry about clemency as it was a foregone conclusion , ' they wrote
gissendaner 's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation
although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings , the reality is less clear , gissendaner 's lawyers wrote
some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on gissendaner 's behalf , but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden , who succeeded seabolt last year
' under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside the institution
staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed , ' kathleen kennedy wrote on jan. 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution
gissendaner 's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial , she had been offered the same plea deal as owen - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years
' at one time , therefore , all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for ms. gissendaner , ' her lawyers wrote
owen , who is the one who stabbed douglas to death , took the deal and testified for the prosecution
gissendaner balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer 's advice to go to trial
the parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants , her lawyers wrote
' in fact , this board has on at least four occasions in the past commuted a death sentence of a co-defendant who was not the actual killer of the victim , ' the lawyers wrote
douglas 's parents and sisters want her to be executed , but two of gissendaner and douglas ' three children have asked the parole board to spare her life , the lawyers wrote
in statements submitted with her clemency application , kayla and dakota gissendaner describe a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness ; finally they have a meaningful relationship with their mother
' we also believe that gissendaner 's death will not restore them or make them whole , ' gissendaner 's lawyers wrote of the entire gissendaner family .
