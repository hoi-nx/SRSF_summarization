no one forgets their first job , and for one woman that will always be especially true
calhoun 's first job was as a bank teller at the national bank of spring city in spring city , pennsylvania , and when she learned in 1989 that the bank was closing and up for sale , she decided she would purchase the property
what 's more , she decided to turn the bank into her new home
according to cnn money , the clipping room of the bank , where individuals would clip coupons from their bonds , became a powder room , the upstairs vault became a bar , and the downstairs vault , which had no ventilation , became a steam room
calhoun also restored the clock that used to be in front of the bank , and emptied many of the safety deposit boxes , finding money that had been printed at the bank , old ledgers and books , and even spectacles
calhoun had the ceilings painted with pink and blue clouds the upstairs vault was turned into a bar she made the boardroom into her master bedroom the bank is on the national register of historic places she also put new lettering outside , labeling the building calhoun federal
the boardroom meanwhile became her master bedroom , one of three bedrooms in the building , and there is still one area left to explore in the basement
it seems that when the bank stopped printing money , the machine was concreted in rather than being carried out , and for her next project , calhoun just might see what 's back there in that basement
calhoun also put new lettering outside , labeling the building calhoun federal calhoun also restored the clock that used to be in front of the bank a closer look at the steam room in the old vault and it seems she may not be alone in the home either , and after a 1921 robbery left one man dead after he suffocated in the vault , some have claimed to see his ghost wandering the stairs
not to worry though , calhoun says if he is there , he is very friendly .
