an oregon woman arrested on a drug charge while traveling in east timorese arrived home in portland on wednesday to a swarm of national and local media after six months of diplomatic negotiations
stacey addison , who said she was never in possession of drugs , was imprisoned for two months and then released without travel documents in december , leaving her unable to leave the southeast asian country
' it feels really good to be back home
really strange , but really good , ' said addison , a 41 - year - old veterinarian who was initially detained when a man with whom she shared a cab was arrested on drug charges last september
after addison 's release from prison , former east timorese president and nobel peace prize laureate jose ramos-horta housed her in guest quarters within his home
' i did make some friends , ' addison said of her time seeking permission to return home to the u.s.
' and it helped having support behind me back home
' a travel enthusiast whose planned two - year - journey had already taken her from antarctica through south america before her detention , addison said she still intends to explore more of the world once she has recovered from her ordeal
' i do n't anticipate anything happening like this again
i hope not , ' she said with a laugh , as she held the hand of her mother , kero
' i 'm glad to have her back , ' kero said as she ushered her daughter away from reporters
' it 's a great feeling , ' addison said in an interview with koin
' it 's a relief to finally be back home
to be out of there after all this time , so i 'm really happy to be home
' ' i 'm not going to let go of her , ' kero told the television station
' it 's been really hard , it 's been an emotional roller coaster having all these setbacks , getting hopes up and having them crash down , getting hopes up and having them crash down , ' addison told koin
' so , i 'm glad finally for it to be over
' kero enlisted u.s. senator jeff merkley of oregon and secretary of state john kerry to negotiate with east timorese diplomats for the return of addison 's passport
