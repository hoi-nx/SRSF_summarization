as many as 13 senior leaders of al-nusra , including the terror group 's military commander , were killed in two syrian airstrikes thursday , a middle eastern security source who was briefed by syrian intelligence told cnn
al shami was among those killed in the strikes against al-nusra , al qaeda 's largest affiliate in syrian , the source said
syrian 's state news agency sana also reported al shami 's death
the special operation that took place in hobait , in idlib province , was part of a wider effort by syrian forces to destroy areas believed to be gathering points for al-nusra militants around the province , according to sana
according to a 2014 al-nusra video , al shami joined the group after years of training in afghanistan and iraqi
also killed in the northwestern province of idlib was a senior saudi operative in the group , the source said
there were initial indications that al-nusra leader al jolani was wounded in one of the strikes , the source said thursday
but on friday , the source told cnn the latest assessment of syrian intelligence was that al jolani was not injured
the strikes took place in the towns of salqin and hobait , both near the city of saraqeb in idlib
one strike targeted a meeting of senior al-nusra leaders ; the other was on a home being used as a base , the source said
a spokesman for the u.s. - led coalition that is hitting isis targets in syrian said its planes were n't involved
" within the last 24 hours , we have not conducted any airstrikes within 200 miles of the province of idlib , " the spokesman said earlier thursday
al shami was featured in a march 2014 video released by al-nusra , in which he discussed his failed attempt to mediate between his militants and isis after rising tensions between the groups
the video included a biography by the group of al shami , which was translated by the long war journal
it said that in the late 1990s , al shami traveled to afghanistan , where he was trained in a camp run by abu musab al suri , a veteran syrian jihadi strategist
al shami then trained in al qaeda camps , where he met one of the 9/11 hijackers and personally swore allegiance to bin laden
by the time of the 9/11 attacks , al shami had started to train recruits in afghanistan and was named as the head of the syrian jihadist contingent within al qaeda
after the fall of the taliban , he fled afghanistan with senior egyptian al qaeda operative sayf al adel , the group said in the video
al shami began operating in iraqi , where he began working with al qaeda in iraqi founder abu musab al-zarqawi , conducting training for the group during the iraqi insurgency , the al-nusra video stated
in 2005 , al shami returned to afghanistan for a short period , at the request of al qaeda 's leadership
when he got to the afghanistan - pakistan region , one of bin laden 's top deputies , attiyah abd al rahman , tasked al shami with leading al qaeda efforts in syrian , but he was arrested as he traveled through lebanon , according to the video , and was detained for five years
after being released , he found his way to syrian , where he joined al-nusra , the group said
