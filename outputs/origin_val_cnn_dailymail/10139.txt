martin o'neill has demanded that his players put aside their club woes and don â t allow themselves be distracted as they prepare for sunday âs vital euro 2016 qualifier with poland
the ireland manager said it would be understandable for some of his squad to be lacking in confidence but stressed the importance of being fully focused when the group d leaders arrive in dublin
oâneill has had to contend with a couple of injuries to personnel already this week â gibson sat out training again with a groin complaint while james mcclean will go for a scan on an ankle problem â while also attempting to boost the morale of players currently feeling the heat at their clubs
the ireland squad train ahead of sunday 's euro 2016 qualifier with poland at home manager martin o'neill hopes his players can put aside club woes to focus on the game at hand john o'shea has suffered a dismal season and is involved in a relegation fight with sunderland james mcclean ( right ) is an injury doubt and will have a scan on his ankle before making a decision â that âs the nature of it , i would nât get too concerned , â said oâneill
â someone asked me quite rightly about whether i âd be concerned about three or four players going into the side and of course you would , it would stand to reason
it is what it is
â i would nât be too concerned , though
the players are up , ready to go , there âs a good enthusiasm around them
â a month or six weeks ago you start to formulate a few plans but you know those disappear when you pick up a few injuries along the way or maybe some people have a bit of club form
â some players are coming in absolutely fine form , others have had trials and tribulations at club level which is a bit of a concern but i think put that to the side , just think of us
â just think of the game ahead
if you are coming in great form , then fantastic
if it âs not , then do nât worry
â sunderland âs john oâshea and aston villa âs ciaran clark are in a premier league relegation fight and even though toffees trio seamus coleman , james mccarthy and gibson won last week , the toffees remain close to the drop zone
assistant manager keane appeared in good spirits during the training session on monday keane watches on as ireland players , including keeper shay given ( left ) , take part in practice stephen quinn and kevin doyle ( right ) share a laugh while jogging during the session david forde , meanwhile , has a battle of his own with millwall second from bottom in the championship
oâneill , though , says it will be business as usual as he sets about putting his plans in place to ensure ireland bounce back from the defeat to scotland in november and take all three points against poland
â i think the most important thing for us is we do need to be a bit flexible and in so doing try to make sure the players know what they âre doing
â say you want to change the formation or something , you do nât want it thrust upon them on sunday morning
so we âll try and do a wee bit of that in the course of the week
â we âre training at the aviva [ today ] and that should be good
it will give us a feeling about it again
â on the injury front , oâneill also revealed that gibson is â concerned â by his groin problem and that stephen ward did not have an operation on his ankle and will have a second scan before determining his plan of action
ireland are hoping to recover from their shock defeat by scotland in their previous european qualifier
