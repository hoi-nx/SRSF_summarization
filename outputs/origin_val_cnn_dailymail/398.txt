mr fletcher said : ' because of his notoriety , risk and age , they have put him in an " approved premise " - pretty much a bail hostel
' he was n't deemed a risk to the public or to himself but the risk is that people in the community would recognise him , although that risk was deemed low as he has n't really been photographed recently
' however given these recent revelations the chances are he will now have to be moved to another accommodation
' he explained that the typical stay in one of these hostels is between three and six months and after that the authorities would ensure he gets another form of sheltered accommodation
' during the day he will be unrestricted
he will be subject to some form of curfew - probably about 9pm and then he will stay in the hostel until around 7ish the next morning
' he will report to the probation service weekly and there will be staff in the hostel he will see daily
if he is deemed to be coping okay this will be reduced to fortnightly and then monthly
he is on a life licence so he will need to do that for the rest of his life
' he added : ' someone that has been in prison that long will be institutionalised and so they would have considered keeping him in an open prison but as he did n't pose a risk to the public he was put in a bail hostel
