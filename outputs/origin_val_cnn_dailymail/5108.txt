a man has been fined Â£ 250 for leaving rubbish in the alleyway behind his house because he claims the council failed to give him a wheelie bin
tatton said he had nowhere to put his household waste for five months after stoke-on-trent city council failed to provide him with a bin
the 24 - year - old claims he told his local authority about the matter in october 2014 but only received a wheelie bin earlier this month
tatton , 24 , was fined Â£ 250 for leaving rubbish in the alleyway behind his house because he claims the council failed to give him a wheelie bin he had argued that during those five months he had no alternative but to dispose of bin bags at the back of his home in cobridge , stoke-on-trent , staffordshire
however , the council disagreed and said they had delivered the bin as soon as they could , and tatton was hauled before magistrates charged with fly - tipping
yesterday at stafford magistrates ' court he admitted the charge and was fined Â£ 35 , ordered to pay Â£ 200 costs and a Â£ 20 surcharge
' i told the council i had n't got a wheelie bin in october and they said i would have to dispose of the rubbish , ' he said today
' i have n't got a car to take it to the tip. what was i meant to do with it ? i had no alternative but to leave it in the alley at the back of my house
' they only got me the bin just before i went to court so it would look better for them
' the court heard stoke-on-trent city council had received complaints about black bin bags , cardboard and blankets piling up in the alleyway
correspondence found inside the bags linked the waste to tatton , who was interviewed last october
he admitted to officers that he had put out the waste but said it was only because he did not have a wheelie bin
the council said that a request for a bin was only logged in february
tatton argued that between october and earlier this month he had no alternative but to dispose of bin - bags in this alleyway at the back of his home in cobridge , stoke-on-trent , staffordshire the court heard stoke-on-trent city council had received complaints about black bin bags , cardboard and blankets piling up in the alleyway councillor andy platt , the city council 's cabinet member for green enterprises and clean city , said : ' our records show we received mr tatton 's request for a bin in february this year and delivered the bin in march
' we receive hundreds of orders each month for new or replacement bins ; we delivered the replacement bin as soon as possible given the number of requests we deal with
' not having a wheelie bin is not an excuse to dump rubbish outside your property , and we welcome the conviction , fine and costs imposed by the court
' dumping rubbish in the open , even in bags , can quickly bring down the appearance of an area and lead to other problems , including vermin and further fly - tipping
' steven pritchard , chairman of portland and century residents ' association , added : ' the council does seem to be cracking down on dumped rubbish but why should anyone have to wait weeks for a wheelie bin ? '
