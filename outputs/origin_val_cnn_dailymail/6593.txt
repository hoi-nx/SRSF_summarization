anthony denicola died after suffering an apparent heart attack in june 2013 at the fast food restaurant in brooklyn , new york
in a $ 10million lawsuit filed by anna denicola in brooklyn supreme court last week , it is alleged that medical assistance to save mr anthony denicola was delayed because the one - stall restroom was shut with a slide lock
the 67 - year - old grandfather , a part - time truck driver , had been meeting friends at the 86th street branch for breakfast near his home in bensonhurst before a fishing trip
he went to use the restroom , but when he had not returned several minutes later , his friends went to check on him
they received no answer when they knocked on the door
emergency services were called , but it took firefighters around 15 minutes to open the door - and mr anthony denicola had already died
his son anthony denicola jr. said employees ' told them there 's no way to get in , there 's nothing they can do '
the 38 - year - old told the new york post : ' if somebody could have opened the door , they could have started cpr on him until emergency workers got there
' what if somebody had been able to open that door ? he 'd still be here
' he added his late father had been planning a surprise retirement party for his wife , but instead , his funeral was held on that day
the family 's lawyer , stephen spinelli , said there was no way to open the door to the restroom from the outside and employees at the restaurant were not helpful
he added the restaurant has ' a duty to offer their customers a safe environment '
