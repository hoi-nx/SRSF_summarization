a bond between two longtime family friends has deepened after both michigan men received organs from the same donor
nelis , 60 , of holland , got a new heart , while 67 - year - old veldman of pentwater , got a new pair of lungs
the operations were held at the exact same time at a grand rapids hospital last june
nelis and veldman have been close friends for over a decade , however their transplants were completely coincidental
incredible bond : veldman and nelis have been friends for over a decade , but now consider themselves ' organ brothers ' after each received a transplant from the same donor last june , saving their lives lifesaving operation : nelis , 60 , underwent a heart transplant after living with idiopathic cardiomyopathy for the last 20 years on - the - mend : veldman , 67 , received a lung transplant to escape a genetic disease that reduced his lung capacity to 15 percent last year the medical director of the heart and lung transplant program at spectrum health says it was the program 's first simultaneous friend - transplant that he 's aware of
' it 's pretty wild , ' dr. michael dickinson told the grand rapids press
' we thought it was quite a remarkable story when it happened
' it 's nice for us because it kind of shows the growth of the program - that we were able to help both of these two friends right here in west michigan
' both men suffered from chronic conditions that caused their health to rapidly deteriorate before their transplants
nelis has been suffering for 20 years with idiopathic cardiomyopathy - a progressive heart disease with an unknown cause
then in 2013 he developed atrial fibrillation , an irregular heartbeat , and was placed on the heart transplant in march 2014
' organ brothers ' : godron veldman ( left ) and nelis ( right ) say they now put their heart and lungs together each time they see each other to show how thankful they are for their transplants veldman has a genetic disease called alpha-1 , which would potentially destroy his lungs , and caused him to develop emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
one year ago his lung capacity fell to 15 percent , making everyday talks like walking incredibly difficult
' the end was very near , ' he said
' i probably had two months left
' then on june 18 , 2014 , both men received a call - the wait was over
they were both admitted to spectrum health and underwent transplants , with nelis getting a new heart and veldman new lungs
new lease on life : nelis was a competitive swimmer for 40 years , before developing heart issues both have rebounded since the operations
the men known little about their 32 - year - old donor , however were able to send a letter to the man 's family through gift of michigan
veldman said that he and nelis put their new heart and lungs as close as they can every time they meet
' we got a gift , and it 's best that we treat it as such , ' nelis said
grateful : veldman ( left ) and nelis ( right ) say a single organ donor saved them both to see more photos of veldman and nelis , visit www.glasslakesphotography.com
