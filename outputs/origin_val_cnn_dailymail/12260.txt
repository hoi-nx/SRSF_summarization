gannon , police chief of lax , said the 54,000 employees with security badges undergo recurring criminal background checks and random screening
but even that may not be enough
" i agree that in any airport throughout the u.s. and here also , there is never a 100 % guarantee that somebody who wanted to do something illegal or wrong could n't make that happen , " gannon said
only two major airports in the u.s. -- miami and orlando -- conduct full employee screening by requiring all employees with access to secure areas to pass through a metal detector , a cnn investigation found
other airports like lax conduct random screenings
many airports do n't do any screenings at all other than a criminal background check before employees are hired
the crackdown on employee screening comes after the arrest of a delta baggage handler and passenger accused of gun smuggling at atlanta 's hartsfield jackson international airport in december
both atlanta and lax have since begun restricting access by closing access doors that lead to the airfield
nevertheless , gannon acknowledged that the potential of a lone wolf committing a crime at the airport worries him
" it concerns me all the time , " he said
with so many employees , " [ t ] here is no way that you are going to have the ability to screen every single person that comes to work in the airport
" at lax , employees punch in a code and swipe their badge to access the airfield
gannon said about 18 out of approximately 300 access doors have been closed as the airport evaluates employee screening procedures
he said , " the more you limit the access doors , the more you can focus things like spot checks and screenings and cameras
" even at miami , gannon said , " they still ca n't 100 % say that they can keep contraband or any type of item out of their restricted area
" stover , miami airport security director , agreed that id badges alone " are not enough [ to ] stop malicious intent
" " you can vet employees for basic information on their backgrounds , but it 's not going to prevent them from carrying out some kind of malicious activity against an airport
and airports need to know their threats
for us , we have threats from criminal activity to being targets of a terrorism attack , " stover said
in the wake of congressional scrutiny of airport employee screening procedures , private security guards at atlanta 's airport last month began checking employee bags as the first step toward moving toward full employee screening
the airport also plans to reduce the number of secure access doors from 70 to 10
" in the last six months ... people are being recruited to engage in terrorist acts , " said miguel southwell , the airport 's general manager
" people are being recruited from the u.s.
so now we have a greater insider threat
" the tsa is conducting a review of the feasibility of full employee screening , although previous government studies have concluded that would be too expensive and inefficient
