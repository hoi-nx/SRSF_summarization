tech experts , analysts and customers alike have bemoaned apple 's watch for needing an iphone to have any real use
but the firm has since confirmed the device will ship with 8gb of storage , and at least 2gb of this will be free for music and photos
although this is the equivalent to just 240 songs , it does mean the timepiece can be used independently for certain tasks
although this is the equivalent to just 240 songs , it does mean the timepiece ( pictured ) can be used independently for certain tasks
the remaining storage will be used for apps and ios the number of tracks it can store will also vary depending on the file sizes
apple confirmed the storage rumours to fan site 9to5mac but the company has not responded to mailonline 's request for more information
all three models of the watch will ship with 8gb of total storage
this will be used to run the watch 's ios software and apps
to put this into perspective , the entry - level iphone 5c came with 8gb of storage when it launched in 2013 and rival smartwatches typically only have 4gb built - in
apple will then let users store 2gb of music and 75mb of photos on the watch as well
this music limit is the same as what the firm offers on its ipod shuffle
the photo limit equates to around 100 images
to put this into perspective , the entry - level iphone 5c came with 8gb of storage when it launched in 2013 , and rival smartwatches typically only have 4gb built - in
users can additionally store 75mb images , or 100 photos
the music limit is the same as what the firm offers on its ipod shuffle ( pictured ) apple 's watch is available in three models : the watch , sport and watch edition ( shown ) and all models will be sold in 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions
apple watch is made of stainless steel , sport is made of 7000 series silver aluminum and the premium edition comes in 18 - karat rose gold and yellow gold this music feature will appeal to runners and cyclists in particular who will be able to use the health features of the watch while exercising and listen to music without having to take their phone out with them
the features of the apple watch rely heavily on pairing it with an iphone
to connect to a phone it either has to be within bluetooth range or connected to the same wi-fi
it ca n't take photos because it does n't have a built - in camera but it can be used to view pictures in the photo stream
with a phone : 1
use the phone 's network to browse the web 2
make and receive calls 3
send and receive messages 4
use any installed app including uber , shazam and more without a phone : 1
track steps using the built - in accelerometer 3
pay for goods using apple pay 4
dictate messages to be sent once the phone is connected 5
play up to 2gb of songs although they will still need to wear bluetooth headphones
the low photo limit may be because apple does n't want wearers to use the device for looking at pictures
the watch is meant to be a companion device and the photos will be more visible on the larger screen of an iphone and ipad
it comes in three models : the apple watch , apple watch sport and apple watch edition , and all models are sold in either 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions
it has been designed to be tethered to an iphone and the pair communicate over bluetooth and wi-fi which gives the watch added computing power
but this relationship means that as soon as the iphone is out of the equation , the watch has limited value
the watch also falls short of its rival âs samsung gear s that has an optional nano sim card slot
the apple watch is made of stainless steel and prices range between $ 549 and $ 1048 for the 1.4 - inch model and $ 599 and $ 1099 for the larger 1.7 - inch version
sport is made of 7000 series silver aluminum and ranges from $ 349 to $ 399
the premium edition has a similar build to the apple watch but comes in 18 - karat rose gold and yellow gold
prices start at $ 10,000
in the uk , the sport starts at Â£ 299 , the standard watch starts at Â£ 479 and the edition model will cost from Â£ 8,000
this music feature will appeal to runners and cyclists in particular who will be able to use the health features of the watch ( example app pictured ) while exercising and listen to music without having to take their phone out with them
although they will still need to wear bluetooth headphones reviews of the apple watch have mostly been positive but while some have said it âs the best smartwatch on the market , the biggest criticism have been its lack of independent features - so this storage option will be a welcomed addition
ernest doku , technology expert at uswitch.com told mailonline : â the apple reveal finally answered all of our questions on pricing and availability , but the all - important " why " remained elusive
â apple is asking us to pay for a level of technical craftsmanship and prestige - but this is unchartered territory and apple is stepping into one of the few arenas where it âs still outclassed
â but stephen ebbett from protect your bubble added : â sales will be driven by the novelty factor as well as the draw of brand apple
plus it has an exceptional track record
â apple made us buy into the tablet in our millions when sceptics questioned whether there âd be enough demand
there âs no reason it ca nât do the same again
