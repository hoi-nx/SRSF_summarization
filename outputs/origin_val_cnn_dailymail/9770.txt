a recent survey has revealed that more than a third of brits take four or fewer baths a year â preferring instead to opt for the convenience of a shower
more fool them , i say
i âm part of the tom ford school of thinking â the fashion designer has been reported to take up to five baths a day , revering them for their â meditative â properties
when it comes to relaxation , nothing beats a long , hot soak
these days , you can make your bath even more self - indulgent with gadgets that let you lounge in the tub while watching films , reading books or listening to music
and some of them will even run the water for you
i slipped beneath the suds to try them out
relax into pillow perfection the the savoy bath pillow lounge in utmost comfort with a bath pillow from one of the world âs swankiest hotels â the savoy bath pillow ( Â£ 15 , savoy tea shop )
while a night at the savoy will cost you the best part of Â£ 400 , one of their bath pillows â described to me by one travel editor as â the best i âve found anywhere , ever â â can be yours for a fraction of the cost
unlike its cheaper cousins , this luxurious pillow is not inflatable or square
instead , it âs a foam cylinder , covered in spa - style waffle cotton , which can be removed for washing
two suction cups on a flap of fabric hold it firmly against the bath , and the cylinder sits at the nape of your neck , cradling you gently as you drift off
keep a glass of wine safe bosign suction wine glass holder relaxing with a glass of red by candlelight sounds like a dream â until you knock it onto the floor or into the bath
to avoid such mishaps , look for holders , such as the bosign suction wine glass holder ( Â£ 6.95 , homearama.co.uk ) , a sleek , stainless - steel design that works best on a perpendicular bath side
they also do a tealight holder ( Â£ 6.45 )
for an all - in - one solution that will hold not only a glass of wine and a candle , but also a book , check out the bathroom bath tub caddy with wine , candle and book holder ( Â£ 14.99 , amazon.co.uk )
it may look a little twee , but it does the job so well , you âre unlikely to care
extending handles mean that it will fit over any bath up to 90 cm wide ( a standard bath is 70 cm ) and the candle holder , book stand and wine glass holders are all detachable
light up your lather colour changing spa lights if candles do nât light your fire , there âs a wealth of other lighting options to try out at bathtime
colour changing spa lights ( Â£ 6.95 , prezzybox.com ) are fully submersible and come with a suction cup , which means they can stick to the sides and the base of the bath
they change colour gradually and will even float on the surface
for a real saturday night fever effect , try the underwater disco lightshow ( Â£ 7.99 , firebox.com ) , a floating gadget that projects multicoloured patterns of light around your bathroom â rather like a watery mirrorball
it sounds bonkers but , with the lights off , it âs truly mesmerising
have a rave while you bathe the bluetooth speaker if you enjoy being lulled by handel âs water music while you bathe , then a waterproof speaker is a must
the best solution is a bluetooth speaker that connects wirelessly to your computer , tablet or smartphone , meaning your pricey gadgets can stay safe and dry outside the bathroom , while you listen to your music inside
the mini waterproof bluetooth speaker ( Â£ 6.15 , amazon.co.uk ) has a suction cup attached , so you can stick it to tiles
it does nât offer the best quality sound â what do you expect at that price ? â and for best results , you need to turn the volume right up on the source device , then adjust on the speaker
but it âs rechargeable and does everything that you need it to , including skipping tracks
you can even use it to answer your phone
that is if you do nât mind your bath being disturbed
for a better sound experience , though at a significantly elevated price , try the rechargeable waterproof ultimate ears megaboom speaker ( Â£ 249.95 , amazon.co.uk )
only about the size of two stacked tin cans , it produces seriously impressive sound
and if you really love your music , you might consider an upgrade to the kaldewei soundwave sound system ( Â£ 396.25 , ukbathrooms.com ) , which turns your whole bath into a speaker that wirelessly connects to the music source using bluetooth
the sounds are nât just audible , they can actually be felt as vibrations through the water â fine if you âre listening to waves or whales , though less relaxing if you have a penchant for heavy metal ! waterproof your ipad lifeproof âs nuud ipad case back in the old days , reading a book or magazine in the bath was the ultimate escape â until , of course , you dropped it in the water and had to leave it splayed on a radiator to dry
now that an estimated two in five of us own a tablet or ereader , the ramifications of dropping your novel in the bath have become a little more significant
so , although the kobo aura h2o ereader ( Â£ 139.95 , johnlewis.com ) is Â£ 60 more than the basic model and around Â£ 80 more than the cheapest kindle , it might be a worthwhile investment , because it âs waterproof for up to 30 minutes
if you âd rather watch television in the bath , you could either splash out on a hafele waterproof tv ( from Â£ 470 , hafele.co.uk ) or invest in a waterproof case and stream films or tv through your tablet
lifeproof âs nuud ipad case ( Â£ 89.95 , apple.com ) does the job , but comes at a price
if you âre just planning on leaving your device on the side , then a water - resistant one ( which is splash - proof , but not submersible ) , such as the griffin survivor case ( from Â£ 19.99 , amazon.co.uk ) , which comes with its own stand , will do
an even cheaper option is a go travel waterproof case ( from Â£ 5.09 , amazon.co.uk ) â effectively a heavy - duty plastic bag , which uses a velcro closure to keep the water away from your gadget if it accidentally gets dunked
... and the bath can even run itself ! crosswater digital if you dream of having a butler to draw a bath for you , then this gadget could make all of your downton abbey fantasies come true
crosswater digital ( from Â£ 499 , crosswater.co.uk ) is a seriously high - tech bath system that lets you take control of your bath or shower from an app on your smartphone
you can dial in the temperature and depth you want â and even store up to three presets , just in case you prefer a hotter or deeper bath than your partner
you âll need to be on the same wifi network ( so you ca nât start running the bath when you âre on the train on the way home ) , but it can be used from anywhere in the house
and if you âve got the additional electronic plug system , you can even drain the bath using the app , too
unfortunately , the one thing it wo nât do is to clean the bath for you !
