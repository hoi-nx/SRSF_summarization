as the man charged with ensuring the finer details of england âs attacking game are in working order , it would have been understandable to find catt in a much darker mood than he was on tuesday
three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against scotland , catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at twickenham
with 11 tries in four six nations games so far â and france to come on saturday in a game that could see england break their run of three successive runners - up finishes by winning the championship â catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope
england coach catt wants england to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points â ninety - nine per cent of the things were very good , â said the world cup winner turned skills coach
â obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with
â at international level , the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities
you might not get five or six like we had on the weekend
â we need to make sure we convert those into points
the players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water
it is all about us sticking to what we are doing , because it is working

and when you are travelling a lot of the time , that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery
it impedes you a bit
