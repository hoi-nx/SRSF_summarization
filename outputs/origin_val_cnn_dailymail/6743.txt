more than 100 nhs hospitals in britain contain fast food outlets , shocking new figures have revealed
critics argue the presence of burger king , costa and greggs around sick patients goes as far as being negligent - and is simply adding to the soaring obesity crisis
there are 128 outlets in britain hospitals selling junk food , plus a further 32 branches of whsmith , which sells confectionery - often at a discounted price
addenbrooke 's in cambridge operates a food court with a burger king ( pictured ) there are also dozens of coffee shops - with 27 starbucks and 92 costas ( such as this one at the royal surrey county hospital in guildford ) - selling calorie - laden treats the fast food branches include two burger kings , six subways and one greggs , an investigation by sun revealed
there are also dozens of coffee shops selling calorie - laden food and drink - with 27 starbucks and 92 costas
this is in addition to all the smaller , independent retailers in hospitals selling junk food
the news comes as figures from public health england show that in britain , 64 per cent of adults are either overweight or obese
and experts estimate treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the nhs around Â£ 6 billion every year - or five per cent of the entire nhs budget
it spends a further Â£ 10billion on diabetes
to make matters worse , some of the compass uk 's major hospitals have more than one outlet selling junk food
addenbrooke 's in cambridge operates a food court with a burger king , costa , starbucks and pizzeria , while and university hospital southampton foundation trust also hosts a burger king and a costa shop
earlier this month , it emerged the greggs bakery at the new cross hospital in wolverhampton , is the fast - food chain 's second busiest outlet in britain earlier this month it was reported that the greggs bakery based in an nhs hospital is the fast - food chain 's second busiest outlet in britain
the counter at new cross hospital in wolverhampton is often so busy selling steak bakes , bacon rolls and pizzas that ropes have to be used to separate queues of hungry customers which can reach 20 people deep
the sun investigation found customers could buy four sausage rolls for Â£ 2.40 , each which contained 25g fat
the total recommended daily amount of fat is 75g for women and 90g for men
those with a sweet tooth could buy three sugar and fat laiden doughnuts for Â£ 1
however a spokesman denied the hospital branch was the chain 's second biggest outlet
she said : ' there has been a greggs shop at new cross hospital for over 10 years
' while popular with customers and providing a wide variety of products , this shop is not greggs â second busiest shop
' critics argue the presence of burger king ( pictured in addenbrooke 's hospital ) , costa and greggs around sick patients goes as far as being negligent - and is simply adding to the soaring obesity crisis but loughton , chief executive of royal wolverhampton hospitals , said he had heard on good authority that the bakery at the hospital was the chain 's second busiest
he said : ' there is a cafe in site that sells all healthy food but it gets nowhere near the footfall that greggs gets
' you can understand the appeal
' earlier this week , mps called for a ban on fast - food outlets such as mcdonald âs and burger king from hospitals
the move is part of several measures to tackle the growing number of britain who are becoming dangerously overweight
as fast - food concessions come up for renewal , hospitals should demand healthier , tastier , affordable alternatives , experts say the report on the impact of physical activity and diet on health endorses the views of professor theresa marteau , an expert in public health at cambridge university
she states that hospitals are being negligent by allowing such firms to operate in places that promote good health
in her evidence to mps , she said : ' it is at best anomalous - and at worst negligent - that nhs properties continue to serve foods high in sugar , fat and salt , as exemplified by mcdonald âs and burger king outlets in some of our most prestigious hospitals , including guy âs hospital in london and addenbrooke âs hospital in cambridge
' simon stevens , the chief executive of nhs england , backed the mps â call and criticised hospitals for permitting the sale of fast food
he said : ' the nhs is being pennywise but pound - foolish selling junk food that ultimately just lands more people in hospital with expensive , preventable , obesity - driven illnesses
' so as these fast - food concessions come up for renewal , hospitals should demand healthier , tastier , affordable alternatives
' the chain sells a range of sandwiches , pies and pasties - such as the cheese and bacon wrap , a chicken fajita slice , and beef and vegetable pasties - ranging from 300 calories to almost 600
the hospital trust has joined forces with wolverhampton council to tackle the obesity crisis locally
but mr loughton said banning the chain from the site would not solve anything
he said : ' people say " ban the fast - food places " but i do n't think that will ever work
we have to change people 's mentality regarding the food they eat
' in devon , hospital chiefs have told staff not to allow deliveries from a new pizza hut - despite it being built in their own multi-storey car park
the move was revealed a month after the chain opened just 100 yards from the walls of derriford hospital in plymouth
staff were instructed to tell patients they could not order from the fast food restaurant , with bosses steering them towards ' healthier ' sandwiches in the hospital 's smoothie bar instead
and a hospital in surrey has came under fire when it emerged it had paid Â£ 24,000 to close a burger king branch inside its own walls
croydon university hospital had hosted the fast food chain in its entrance for 14 years , sparking the ire of health campaigners
it finally managed to close the outlet - which was next to posters promoting healthy eating - in 2011 and replace it with a costa branch
but in order to terminate the contract it had to pay Â£ 24,000 to compass uk , the company operating the fast food franchise
croydon health service admitted the ' world had changed ' since it signed the original deal in 1997
the news comes after the nhs announced last week that 700,000 overweight staff will be told to take part in free slimming classes to shed the pounds , in order to set a better example to their patients
the drastic scheme could help nearly half of nhs england 's 1.3 million workforce , who currently struggle with their weight
in a drive to ' practice what we preach ' , the nhs will sign employees up to one of three slimming classes , depending on the amount of weight they have to lose
staff will be put on personal eating plans and be offered cognitive behavioural therapy to help reassess their relationship with food
nhs england chief executive simon stevens , who announced today 's initiative , said : ' today the nhs is starting to practice what we preach - helping our own staff get healthier and prevent illness
dr sally norton , an nhs consultant specialising in weight loss surgery , says the nhs is contributing to the obesity crisis coffee shops offering sugar - laden drinks and cakes to hospital patients , visitors and nhs staff should be banned , a leading weight loss surgeon has said
dr sally norton , an nhs consultant specialising in weight loss and upper gastrointestinal surgery , said she no longer shakes the hands of her patients - more often than not because they arrive clutching a costa take - out
in the place of these popular coffee shops and fast food outlets , dr norton - who works at bristol royal infirmary and southmead hospital - has called for restaurants and cafes championing local food producers and offering healthy and tasty snacks
' we read every week , in the bmj and other leading medical journals , of research detailing the perils of sugar and fizzy drinks , ' said dr norton
' we frequently hear laments about the cost to the nhs of the epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes , which is threatening to engulf us
' and yet , the nhs , which i understood to be an organisation that promotes and supports health ( rather than just treating disease ) , is actually contributing to the problem
' as a weight loss surgeon , i find it frustrating and , frankly , embarrassing to spend time in clinic , explaining to my patients how sugary drinks and snacks are one of the biggest drivers of obesity , when i know that just outside in our hospital foyer are not one , but two costa coffee shops , as well as vending machines stocked full of coke and chocolate
' when i try to grab a quick coffee from costa , an obedient employee always tries to tempt me into buying one of their huge , sugar - laden and calorific cakes to go with it ... hard to resist after a stressful morning in theatre or a busy night on - call
' if i did need a snack , i would be hard pushed to find much that you could describe as healthy â there is very little fresh , nutrient - rich food and next to nothing that does n't involve a load of refined carbs .
