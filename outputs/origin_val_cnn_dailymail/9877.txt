he has become used to rewriting the record books these past few years , amending football history in style with wonderful goals and dazzling pieces of skill
but there 's one record messi has some way to go to break - one held by england 's very own jimmy greaves
it is the all - time leading goalscorer list across europe 's top five divisions - england , spanish , italy , france and german - but at least the barcelona wizard is making progress up the ladder
messi ( right ) is congratulated by team - mate luis suarez after scoring for barcelona in their 3 - 1 win over granada at the weekend - it moved him to 269 goals in the spanish league messi 's close - range finish took him into the top 10 all - time goalscorers list for europe 's top five leagues jimmy greaves , seen here playing for tottenham in 1967 , leads the chart with 366 league goals messi 's goal in barcelona 's 3 - 1 win at granada on saturday was his 269th in the spanish league and took him into the top 10 of the all - time standings for league goals , as pointed out by misterchip on twitter
however , he is still some way behind jimmy greaves ' tally of 366 league goals set between 1957 and 1971
the prolific england international striker scored 357 goals for chelsea , tottenham and west ham in the english top flight , plus nine for ac milan in serie a. it set some precedent , one almost matched by gerd muller , who scored 365 goals for bayern munich in the german top flight and is second in the table
there is then a gap to the pre-war english scoring duo of steve bloomer ( 317 division one goals between 1892 and 1914 ) and dixie dean ( 310 between 1924 and 1938 )
german legend gerd muller is second on the all - time list , just one goal behind jimmy greaves messi 's rival , cristiano ronaldo of real madrid , is sixth on the goalscorers list alan shearer , with his familiar celebration for newcastle united , comes in eighth on the list with 283 goals one man messi will be desperate to catch is his rival cristiano ronaldo , currently sixth in the list with 291 goals in europe 's top five leagues - 84 for manchester united in the premier league and 207 for real madrid in la liga
alan shearer is eighth , with 283 goals for southampton , blackburn rovers and newcastle united in the english top flight
if they continue at their present free - scoring rate , it 's highly likely cristiano ronaldo and messi will one day be topping this list
but the key question remains - in which order will they finish ?
