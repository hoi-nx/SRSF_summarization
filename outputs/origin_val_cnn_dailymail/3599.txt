a professor helping to identify 600 body parts belonging to the germanwings crash victims said today he would be haunted forever by the grim task
remains of the 150 passengers and crew are being categorised after co-pilot lubitz deliberately flew the airbus a320 into the alps
and german 's most prestigious forensic scientist michael tsokos spoke of the work ahead as it emerged lubitz 's remains have already been found
investigators at the crash site have so far retrieved about 600 body parts and have managed to isolate 78 distinct dna strands from the remains
some 50 bodies were identifiable visually , while many body parts were the size of a postage stamp - with the largest being the size of a suitcase
he said : ' these images will never go out of my head ' investigators at the germanwings crash site have so far retrieved about 600 body parts and have managed to isolate 78 distinct dna strands from the remains
but not one body has been found intact by rescue crews who continue to comb the site for remains ( pictured ) professor michael tsokos admitted that killer co-pilot lubitz 's remains were among those which had been found at the wreckage site and said dna testing had confirmed the body parts were his
it is hoped his remains may provide clues on any medical treatment he was receiving investigators continue to search for remains at the site while scientists have started the grim and gruelling task of identifying the body parts
forensic experts are photographing and 3d each and every body part before placing them in a morgue until id is fully confirmed forensic experts confirmed they have found the remains of co-pilot lubitz ( pictured ) , who deliberately flew the germanwings airbus a320 into the mountainside in the alps on tuesday
he was said to have been suffering from a ' severe psychosomatic disorder ' mr michael tsokos admitted that lubitz 's remains were among those which had been found and said dna testing had confirmed the body parts were his
it is hoped his remains may provide clues on any medical treatment he was receiving
scientists are now continuing the gruelling task of identifying the rest of the remains which involves photographing and 3d scanning every body part
police have asked victims ' friends and relatives for dna samples , and experts hope to match them against the remains and material objects at the site
professor : michael tsokos , a leading forensic scientist ( pictured ) , said he will be haunted forever by the grim and gruelling task of identifying the victims ' remains items with vital traces of dna , such as toothbrushes , razors , jewellery and hair have been collected at the scene and given to scientists in barcelona
forensic officers have also been testing samples at a mobile laboratory in seyne-les-alpes - the nearest town to the crash site
it is hoped the findings will provide some clues which will help identify the victims
some 15 teams of two people - a forensics expert and a mountain rescue expert - are working at the crash zone
psychologists are in seyne , from where the helicopter takes off , to support the rescue workers
wreckage is not being removed at this stage unless it is essential for analysis
families are also being asked if they can remember what clothes their loved ones were wearing when they boarded the ill - fated flight , in the hope the details could help with the identification process
they have also been asked about any distinctive marks , such as tattoos , their loves ones might have as well as their dental status and whether they wore dentures
mr michael tsokos , director of the institute of legal medicine and forensic sciences , said it is hoped such findings will help identify the remains which will then be cross-examined with the flight 's passenger list
he said each body part would be photographed and scanned in 3d before being placed in a morgue
once the body has been identified it will be placed in a closed coffin ready for a funeral
he told german newspaper bild : ' radiologists with mobile devices will take ct images of body parts , so as to recognise for example , medically - implanted foreign bodies such as a pacemaker or artificial hip joints
' specially trained forensic scientists take [ samples ] of fingers and palms fingerprints and everything is photographed
every little piece of fabric will be tested on the dna so that it can be assigned to a particular person
' he said that within the next three weeks , up to 95 per cent of all victims should be identified
but , he added that it was a haunting task for experts , saying : ' these images will never go out of my head
' and he said the bodies will strictly be kept in closed coffins because the ' sight of battered corpses can inflict on anyone '
the recovery of body parts must be completed by april 8 , otherwise decomposition will make dna identification impossible
meanwhile , a second black box is still missing following the crash
it comes as guards continue to keep 24 - hour watch at the crash site , with teams sleeping on the mountainside overnight
the guards have been on standby at the scene in the province in the southern alps since the flight crashed on tuesday

it adds to the belief that lubitz deliberately downed the germanwings flight 4u9525 because he was severely depressed and feared his pilot 's licence may be taken away from him over medical concerns
however , lubitz â who had notched up more than 600 flying hours - had been deemed ' 100 per cent ' fit to fly after passing regular medical tests
lufthansa ceo carsten spohr said all pilots undergo annual medical checks , but not special psychiatric assessments beyond training
he added : ' he passed all medical exams , all checks
he was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions
' a spokesman for germanwings told mailonline that under german employment law it was the responsibility of an employee to inform an employer if they were deemed unfit to work and stressed that it was unaware of any medical notes from lubitz
