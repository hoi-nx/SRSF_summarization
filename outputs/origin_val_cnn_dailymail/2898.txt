standing with a manchester united scarf in the middle of the kop while thousands of liverpool fans blast out ' you 'll never walk alone ' might strike most people as a crazy stunt to pull
so when a picture emerged of one brave soul appearing to do just that during sunday 's top - four clash , many twitter users got very excited
the image went viral , with even rooney tweeting about it after manchester united 's 2 - 1 win at anfield
a manchester united fan photoshopped into the kop at anfield ; rooney even tweeted about him after the game the original picture of the manchester united fan was taken on a pre-season tour in bangkok in 2013 the liverpool fans shown in the image were actually watching their team against birmingham in 2011 rooney wrote : ' very happy tonight
should of let him take penalty
and the manchester united fan in the kop
brilliant ' unfortunately , it turns out that the image was a fake , with everyone , including the manchester united captain , taken in by the clever use of photoshop
a few hours later sportsmail can reveal the original picture of the manchester united fan , taken a long way from the kop , which was super-imposed into the anfield crowd
the actual image was taken in bangkok in 2013 , when manchester united played there on a pre-season tour , and shows a fan at the airport waiting for the manchester united team to arrive
meanwhile , the image it was dropped into was not from anfield on sunday , but actually from a game against birmingham in 2011
the online pranksters , ynfa , did the job properly though , replacing a luis suarez scarf from 2011 with a generic liverpool one to keep up the illusion
