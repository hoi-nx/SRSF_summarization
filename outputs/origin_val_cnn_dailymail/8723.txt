a chicken which nearly died after it was savaged by a fox has recovered thanks to an innovative form of bird physiotherapy
seven - year - old rosie was attacked in the back garden of her owner jean hull , and vets said she was ' almost split in two ' following her ordeal
mrs jean hull resolved to do all she could to save the bird 's life , because she was the favourite pet of her late husband maurice , and spent five months nursing her back to health
mrs jean hull , from high salvington in sussex , said : ' she clearly wanted to live and was n't going to let that fox beat her
' she was my late husband 's favourite , so that is where the extra feeling comes from
she is a little bit of him
' the couple bought rosie and another hen in 2008 because they could not find eggs which were both fresh and organic
but in november last year , she was suddenly grabbed by a fox while she was running free in the garden
treatment : rosie has since undergone a new form of avian physiotherapy to help her recover stretches : the treatment involves manipulating her limbs to enable her to walk normally again mrs jean hull said : ' this fox came whizzing down the garden and grabbed her and dashed down the bottom of the garden
i screamed and i just had to try to stop the fox
' eventually , the fox did drop her and ran off but rosie was just laying there bleeding and there were feathers everywhere
' rosie was rushed to a nearby vet 's office , where parsons carried out emergency surgery to save her
but as the chicken recovered she was having difficulty walking because of the scar tissue which had formed over her wounds
hale and hearty : the physio has apparently been a success and rosie is now back to full health ms parsons said : ' last year , rosie came in almost split in two and had to have quite major surgery to stitch her back together
' i had never heard of physiotherapy for chickens but she responded to it really well
' i 've only seen it done on chickens on youtube videos in america
rosie is a very special hen and jean hull looks after her very well
' mrs jean hull also took rosie to a pet blessing service as church , which she says helped to speed her recovery .
