half of the premier league are yet to hit the fabled 40 points needed to renew membership for next season
but only once in the past decade â wolves in 2011 â has a team required that total to avoid the drop
rather , sportsmail has calculated that the magic number is just 36
since the turn of the millennium and the establishment of a hierarchy within the top flight â meaning more points are distributed higher up the table â the average of the club finishing third from bottom has been a shade above 35
struggling duo queens park rangers and leicester look destined to be heading for the championship at the end of the season the current bottom six of the premier league that being the case , you can assume that every team upwards of 13th - placed west brom , on 33 points , will be feeding off the premier league cash cow come august
indeed , this weekend saw the bottom six all lose and a points - per - game projection would have all of them finishing the campaign on fewer than 36
but with leicester and queens park rangers looking increasingly doomed , it is aston villa , hull , sunderland and burnley battling to avoid that final spot
hull ( odds on being relegated : 5/2 ) run - in : swansea ( a ) , southampton ( a ) , liverpool ( h ) , crystal palace ( a ) , arsenal ( h ) , burnley ( h ) , tottenham ( a ) , man utd ( h )
without back - to - back wins over queens park rangers and aston villa â inspired by deadline - day arrival dame nâdoye â hull would be odds - on for the drop
just look at their daunting run - in
remember norwich city 12 months ago ? at this juncture they were 13th and seven points clear of the bottom three
but one point from their final seven matches â which included games against the top four â saw them demoted to the championship
steve bruce âs side finish with a trip to tottenham and the visit of man utd and they âll want to be clear of trouble come the final fortnight
verdict : they might scramble to about 34 points , and that should be enough , just
tom huddlestone ( right ) will be hoping his side can climb the table during the final batch of league fixtures aston villa ( odds on being relegated : 7/2 ) run - in : man utd ( a ) , queens park rangers ( h ) , tottenham ( a ) , manchester city ( a ) , everton ( h ) , west ham ( h ) , southampton ( a ) , burnley ( h )
if the bounce factor of tim sherwood âs arrival falls flat , a deflated aston villa could soon be sucked back into serious trouble
three of the next four are at old trafford , white hart lane and the etihad and that , you would think , will throw up zero points
there is also the complicating factor of an fa cup semi-final
verdict : home games against queens park rangers , west ham and burnley will decide their fate â if they take six points from these and a draw elsewhere , then they should be fine
aston villa striker christian benteke has scored six goals for the midlands outfit so far this season sunderland ( odds on being relegated : 5/4 ) run - in : newcastle ( h ) , crystal palace ( h ) , stoke ( a ) , southampton ( h ) , everton ( a ) , leicester ( h ) , arsenal ( a ) , chelsea ( a )
sunderland were better during dick advocaat âs first game in charge at west ham
however , it still ended in defeat
and given that they see out the campaign with trips to arsenal and chelsea , the dutch boss probably has six games to save the season and preserve his record of never having been relegated
supposed january saviour jermain defoe is misfiring and the sunderland have scored just once in 11 hours
verdict : the club should have realised that they were heading for a relegation battle far sooner
fail to win the tyne-wear derby on easter sunday and they could be set on a downward spiral which will surely end in the championship
sunderland signed jermain defoe in hope that he can score the goals to fire the sunderland to safety burnley ( odds on being relegated : 10/11 ) run - in : tottenham ( h ) , arsenal ( h ) , everton ( a ) , leicester ( h ) , west ham ( a ) , hull ( a ) , stoke ( h ) , aston villa ( a ) a recent victory over manchester city and a draw at chelsea shows that dyche âs men show little regard for reputations and that spirit will serve them well as the stakes increase during the closing weeks
crucially , they play three of their relegation rivals and , to that end , their fate remains in their own hands
verdict : if burnley can take eight points from eight games then it could well prove enough and dyche would be shortlisted for manager of the year recognition
burnley striker danny ings is attracting interest from some of the premier league 's big boys sportsmail prediction ... 15th â aston villa ( 35 pts ) 16th â hull ( 34 pts ) 17th â burnley ( 33 pts ) 18th â sunderland ( 32 pts )
