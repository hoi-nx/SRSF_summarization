the conservatives have moved into their strongest poll position for almost five years
as cameron prepares to go to buckingham palace to mark the formal start of the general election campaign , ending the long phoney war between the political parties , an exclusive comres poll for the daily mail and itv shows the tories have opened up a four - point lead over labour
conservatives jitters about the party 's campaign will be eased by the survey , which suggests labour has slipped back since last week 's bruising tv encounter between the two main party leaders and interviewer paxman
it is their best vote share since george osborne 's so - called ' omnishambles ' budget , which included taxes on hot pasties and caravans , which prompted a conservatives slump
the party has to reach even further back - to september 2010 - for the last time it enjoyed a four - point lead with comres
ukip is on 12 per cent , well down on last year 's peak of 19 per cent , with the liberal democrats showing signs of a modest recovery , on nine per cent
the greens have slipped back to five per cent
the poll is the mirror image of a yougov survey over the weekend , which put labour on 36 per cent and the tories on 32 per cent
an opinium poll , meanwhile , yesterday put the tories ahead , on 34 per cent to labour 's 33 per cent
tbe comres poll finds mr cameron has extended his lead over mr miliband over which of them is best suited to lead the country an exclusive comres poll for the daily mail and itv news puts cameron and the conservatives up one point on last week with 36 per cent , while miliband 's labour is on 32 per cent , down three points the survey comes after last week 's bruising tv encounter between the two main party leaders and interviewer paxman ( pictured ) following thursday âs television grilling by mr paxman , half of all adults in britain think mr cameron would make a better prime minister -- 50 per cent -- compared to three in ten -- 29 per cent -- who back mr miliband
this represents a fall of four points for the labour leader on the last comres poll , conducted last week before the tv clash
incredibly , 18 per cent of labour voters think that mr cameron would make a better prime minister than mr miliband , suggesting even some of his party 's own supporters are unconvinced
this compares to just one per cent of conservative voters who think that mr miliband would be the better prime minister
with a seven - way television debate , featuring mr cameron , mr miliband and the leaders of the liberal democrats , ukip , the snp , plaid cymru and the greens looming this thursday , voters are around twice as likely to associate mr cameron than mr miliband with being ' good on television ' , by 64 per cent to 31 per cent
just 29 per cent back mr miliband as prime minister , which represents a fall of four points for the labour leader on the last comres poll , which was conducted last week before the tv clash mr cameron also has a big lead on which of the two is considered a strong leader , with 60 per cent of voters choosing him versus 33 per cent for mr miliband
however , it is not all good news for mr cameron : he is significantly more likely to be viewed as arrogant than mr miliband , by 52 per cent to 35 per cent
the labour leader has narrower leads on which of the two is seen as more genuine and understanding of the real world
when given a straight choice between a labour - led government and a conservatives - led government after the next election , the poll finds voters ' preference is too close to call , with 41 per cent wanting the former and 42 per cent the latter
however , in the event of a hung parliament , there is a clear preference for the current coalition to continue
presented with a decision between a conservative - liberal democrat coalition and a labour â snp arrangement , 45 per cent of voters say that they would prefer the con - lib option , compared to just 33 per cent who prefer lab - snp
tom mludzinski , head of political polling at comres , said : ' it is too soon to attribute any movement in the polls to the paxman effect
while this is bound to be a volatile election with both labour and the conservatives running each other close , the longer term trends points towards the conservatives beginning to dig in and strengthen their position
' cameron âs ratings as a strong leader will serve him well through the coming seven - way debate as the challengers attempt to bring him down
