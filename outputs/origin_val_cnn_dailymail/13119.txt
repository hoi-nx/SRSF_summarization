from the moment we are born , the first question our parents are asked is , " is it a boy or a girl ? " the answer to that seemingly simple question quickly establishes the child 's path and trajectory for years to come ; however , the question is not simple
the question is tragically flawed and here 's a newsflash for everyone who has ever asked new parents that question : you 're asking the wrong people
i realize that parents are simply sharing a bit of biological information based on their baby 's physical " parts , " but only that beautiful baby can accurately and authentically tell you what gender he or she is
you may want to give it a little time before you paint that nursery bright pink or pick out junior 's first baseball glove -- it 's just not that simple
i may only be 15 years old and will be the first to admit that i know very little about this great big world , but i know way too much about gender and being mislabeled
why transgender teen jazz jennings is everywhere you see , the doctor told my parents , " it 's a girl , " but he could n't have been more wrong
aside from my biology , i knew i was a boy from the age of 2
i was 100 % sure of who i was and biology was an insignificant part of the conversation
keep in mind that this was a time before i had even realized that being a boy trapped in a girl 's body was anything beyond normal , and this was long before i could possibly articulate what was happening
however , there was no need to articulate anything
i was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind -- not yet distorted by biology , other people 's confusion , or fear
it was when i was older that other people let me know something was " off
" no matter how many times i was told differently , i was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too , for the most part
i want to address the moment where people , gender , and respectful communication part ways
that is the moment when the word " sexuality " creeps into the conversation
that is when people get scared , cite religion , start whispering , and disconnect
it 's a sad moment , but i get it
people have always mocked what they do n't understand , and this is a tough one for most to grasp
that said , it has to change and i believe it is changing
the transgender life : what to know , say and understand i can not stress to the world enough , gender and sexuality are two completely different things , and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight
this is not something to be afraid of ; it 's an opportunity for us to evolve
nothing is completely black or white , hot or cold , here or there , or male and female ; there are varying degrees of everything and the quicker we respect that , the faster we all grow and allow people to be who they are
it all starts by taking sexuality out of the initial conversation
i first heard the term " gay " in the second grade , long after i had my first " girlfriend " and had proudly written " a penis " at the top of my christmas list
not until after i learned that there was such a thing as sexuality and homosexuality did i become afraid of who i was
it was n't until i learned that there were people out there that considered homosexuality " abnormal " or that people needed to put labels on our feelings toward others that i became terrified that i was " different
" i knew i liked girls and i was technically a girl , biologically , but i was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings
i was not gay -- but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over
thankfully , i grew up in a household that taught me that i could love anybody i wanted to and it was fine because it is fine
anyone can love anyone and there is nothing wrong with that
fortunately , people have developed more of an understanding of that over time , but there are always going to be people that think differently and we all have to accept that
do they matter ? of course they do because we all matter , equally ; however , ignorant people are here to help us learn how to better communicate ; everyone is reachable with the right circumstances and i look forward to the battles as much as the victories
as long as you 're happy , you 're indestructible
that said , i knew being gay was n't a bad thing , but i also knew it did n't describe me
i was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that , either
i was afraid of being thought of differently
the most crippling fear came from people not understanding that i was a boy trapped in a girl 's body and simply labeling me something i 'm not
that 's what i was truly afraid of

discovering that i was transgender was a miraculous moment
i finally found the key that unlocked the cage i 'd been trapped in for 14 years and that 's why i call this journey , " my transcension
" with the support of my parents , i am sharing my story
breaking free and owning your sexuality is something you find within yourself and is spectacular , but it is just the tiniest part of the greater transgender conversation
i am going beyond that and my journey is one that is constantly moving forward and upward
i 'm taking the body i was born into and transforming it into the body i know i 'm supposed to be in -- thanks to my family , friends , dr. jo olson , the support groups , the science , and lastly , myself
see , that 's the irony , i was the first person and truly the only person capable of answering the " is it a boy or girl " question -- not the doctor , my parents , or anyone who thinks they know better
that is the lesson , let each of us dictate our own path and respect everyone 's choice
i realize that it 's easier said than done but if you read this and find yourself open to a new conversation about gender , i consider that a win for us all
truthfully , i 'm most proud of myself for having the courage to find my own way and owning it , to proudly begin my transcencion from someone i was n't -- into the man i always knew i 'd become
whether i 'm a boy or a girl , white or black , rich or poor , gay or straight , it 's completely irrelevant
what truly matters is the fact that i 'm avery and i 've always known exactly who i was
i 'm here to share my journey and hopefully , help someone else recognize theirs .
