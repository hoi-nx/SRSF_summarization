three decades ago , mccurry took arguably the most iconic picture of all time
yet even after all this time , the pre-eminent photographer brims with enthusiasm when he talks about " afghan girl
" " i knew she had an incredible look , a penetrating gaze , " he recalls
" but there was a crowd of people around us , the dust was swirling around , and it was before digital cameras and you never knew what would happen with the film
" when i developed the picture , i knew it was special
i showed it to the editor of the national geographic , and he leaped to his feet and shouted , ' that 's our next cover '
" not only did " afghan girl " become the magazine 's next cover , but the most successful in its distinguished history
the striking portrait of 12 - year - old afghan girl , a pashtun orphan in the nasir bagh refugee camp on the afghanistan - pakistan border , was taken in december 1984 and published the following year
the woman , now in her forties , has recently been found to be living in pakistan
when mccurry reflects upon its popularity , what excites him most is the impact that this single image has had on the real world
" people volunteered to work in the refugee camps because of that photograph , " he says
" afghanistan are incredibly proud of it , as the girl is poor but shows great pride , fortitude and self - respect
" it drew attention to their plight , and inspired a lot of people
" it also led the national geographic to set up the afghan children 's fund -- and meant that to this day , mccurry is never charged a fare by appreciative afghanistan taxi drivers
the portrait forms the centerpiece of a major retrospective exhibition of mccurry 's work , which opened recently in villa reale di monza , italy , and will run until 6 april
" it 's great to look back on my work and see how themes and connections have emerged
but i am never even remotely thinking of retiring , " the 64 - year - old tells cnn from his studio in new york
" there are so many new places and stories that fascinate me
i have a long list of places to visit : iran , madagascar , mongolia , russians
" i believe that when you find something you love , you should do it your whole life
why would you retire from doing what you love ? it 's just not what we do
" the famous photograph is just one of thousands of extraordinary pictures that mccurry has taken over a 40 - year career , during which he has won dozens of awards
one which is displayed prominently in his retrospective exhibition was taken in kuwait in 1991 , during the first gulf war
it shows three camels silhouetted against an explosion of fire and smoke
" saddam hussein had blown up 600 oil wells , " he recalls
" it was an environmental catastrophe
lakes of oil were leaking all over the country , and seeping into the gulf
" half of it was on fire
there were geysers of oil spurting out of the earth , making it like midnight during the day
" he spotted the camels running along the edge of an oilfield , and followed them in his jeep
but they had been blackened by the oil , and there was no way to capture a picture of them against the black cloud behind
" suddenly they ran in front of a burning area , and they were illuminated by fire , " he says
" i took the shot , and then realized i had driven into a minefield
" i had to carefully back out , following the tire tracks i had made on the way in to avoid getting blown up
" for many years , frontline war photography like this was mccurry 's stock in trade
indeed , it enabled him to make his name
born in pennsylvania in 1950 , mccurry -- whose right hand was permanently damaged when he fell down some stairs at the age of five -- studied theater arts at penn state university
two years after graduating , he moved to india in search of a freelance photography career
his big break came in the late 1970s , when he disguised himself in afghanistan clothes and crossed illegally into afghanistan , just before the soviet invasion
there he took a set of searing photographs of people who were being attacked by their own government
" as soon as i crossed the border , i came across about 40 houses and a few schools that were just bombed out , " he says
" they were literally destroying whole villages with helicopter gunships
" this was a profound situation that really needed to be told , and few people could get access to it because it was too remote
" i got completely caught up in the story
that 's when i knew that this was what i did -- this was me
" against a background of the cold war , the russians backed the afghanistan army and americans supported the mujahideen
the lens of the western media quickly swung towards the region , and mccurry happened to be already embedded
his pictures were soon appearing in the new york times , time and paris match -- but not before mccurry had escaped from afghanistan by crossing the tribal areas on foot , with his precious film sewn into his clothing
this was the beginning of many years of war photography , which he now describes as " the gritty period " of his career
he covered the iran-iraq war , the gulf wars and several conflicts in afghanistan , as well as those further afield in lebanon , cambodia and the philippines
" when you 're working in a war zone , you 're living moment to moment with people trying to kill you , " he says
" there are so many ways i could have been killed , with guns , bombs and shrapnel
you live with fear you could cut with a knife
" several times i was held up at gunpoint
my camera and money have been robbed , people have broken into my hotel room while i was sleeping
" many times i thought that i had pushed things too far , that it was not a good idea to enter this skirmish or battle
many times i have thought that this is n't going to end well
" but i have found that i get completely consumed by the importance of the story i am telling , the feeling that the world has got to know
it 's never about the adrenaline
it 's about the story
" has frontline reporting become more dangerous ? " it has always been dangerous , but now there is the added dimension of trying to grab headlines , " he says
" you might have got kidnapped or shot in the past , but not beheaded
there was no wish to create a heinous piece of theater
" but we ca n't give in
these stories have to be reported , and writers and photographers have to continue telling them
" mccurry 's portfolio is far broader than his war photography , however
he has worked all over the world , from the jungles of central africa to the mountains of tibet , each time seeming to capture the soul of the people he photographs
" my camera acts as a shield when i 'm photographing something horrific , as it 's easier to look at distressing sights through a viewfinder , " he says
" but when i 'm not in a war zone , having a camera helps me talk to people , interact , and get involved
" to take a good picture , you need to spend time with people until they trust you and forget that you 're there to photograph them
" i try to make eye contact when i take a portrait , as it seems to allow you to understand the person , to see their story written on their face
" the advent of the digital camera , he says , has made his job easier
" i 'm not one of those photographers that hankers after the good old days , " he says
" digital photography is better than film ever was
" although everybody is taking pictures with camera phones , he says , this is " just noise " , and does n't " dilute the value " of a truly great photograph that will endure and be memorable
" " there has to be an emotional component to the picture that you connect with on a profound level , " he says
" once you see it , you ca n't forget it , and it is so compelling and powerful that it becomes part of the cultural landscape
" like " afghan girl " ? he pauses
" yes , like that
" mccurry - oltre lo sguardo runs until april 6 , 2015 at villa reale di monza .
