on sunday , mrs kirsty will remember the tragic circumstances she met her husband in
she said : ' mother 's day has become easier to cope with now i have the kids and they can make their own little presents
sarah was pleased her mother carol , who was diagnosed with cancer in 2007 , got to attend her wedding kirsty , pictured with darren , has paid tribute to her mother for helping her find the perfect man ' that gives things a nicer focus but it 's always bittersweet
' ms mellars was first diagnosed with grade - three inflammatory breast cancer in 2007
this meant that the cancer had spread from her breast to her lymph nodes
when she was undergoing her first round of gruelling chemotherapy , devastated mrs kirsty joined an online support forum
' when darren and i started messaging , the main topic of conversation was always about our mums , ' she said
' but then we got to talking about other things , like hobbies and how much we had in common
' it just felt like there was a bit of a connection there
' after 10 days of chatting online , the pair arranged to meet at a coffee shop as friends
she said : ' i was looking forward to the prospect of meeting up with somebody and being able to honestly tell them how i was feeling and know that they were going through the exact same thing
' when mr and mrs kirsty ' relationship deepened , they introduced their mothers
soon ms mellars and maureen summers , 67 , also became great friends
' i think their relationship was similar to mine and darren 's , they found someone they could talk to who knew exactly how they felt , ' mrs kirsty said
darren 's mother maureen ( left ) went on to be great friends with kirsty 's mother and the pair were pictured together at their children 's wedding in march 2008 , six months after the couple met , mr darren summers , a graphic designer , proposed in front of lincoln cathedral
the couple had something else to celebrate a month later when both their mothers were given the all clear
mrs kirsty said : ' we all went out for a meal
we had a lot to look forward to , and it was just brilliant
' but five months later , ms mellars developed a cough
' one day mum was struggling to breathe so she decided to go to hospital , ' her daughter recalled
' she packed herself a little bag , fed the cat and called herself a taxi
' most people would have got themselves an ambulance if they could barely breathe - but that was mum
' doctors ran a full body scan and blood tests which revealed the tragic truth â her cancer had returned
darren 's mother maureen holds his and kirsty 's daughter isabelle in a sweet family snap mrs kirsty said : ' i got a voicemail from mum asking me and darren to come round because she wanted to talk to us
i remember the car journey there - i 've never been so hysterical in all of my life
' we pulled into mum 's street and we had n't even stopped driving when i jumped out
i just wanted to get to her as soon as i could
kirsty continued : ' i banged on the door and when she opened it i fell straight into her arms and was just sobbing my heart out
' she made us a cup of tea , even though i just wanted to sit down and talk about it - the usual good hostess
i said : ' it 's back is n't it ? ' and she said yes and i started crying
' ms mellars told her daughter that the cancer had spread to her liver , lungs , brain , spleen and eye
doctors had given her just months to live
although mr and mrs kirsty had planned to get married in may 2010 â two years away - they vowed to bring the wedding forward so ms mellars could be there
' i arranged a whole wedding in four weeks , so she 'd be well enough to enjoy it , ' mrs kirsty said
' i imagined her at the reception dancing and still being in quite good health
' kirsty says that celebrating mother 's day will be made a little bit easier by her two children jack and isabelle kirsty and darren on holiday - the pair married in 2008 after meeting on a cancer support forum but by the time they married in october 2008 , ms mellars had already deteriorated
mrs kirsty said : ' she was in a wheelchair and on oxygen
she could barely speak anymore but she had a little notepad for writing down what she wanted to say
' she managed to whisper to me that i looked like a princess
half way through the meal , mum got really tired , so her carers took her home
' i locked myself in a room and cried in hysterics
i knew that was it
it was literally a countdown until she died because we 'd done the thing that she was living for
' tragically , ms mellars died eight days after the couple married
it also hit mr darren summers ' mother hard after they had forged a close friendship
' my mum became her best friend and so when we lost mum it was a huge loss for her as well , ' mrs kirsty explained
she is now keen to raise awareness of the importance of regular health checks
' mum was an extremely healthy person - she did n't smoke , she did n't drink
it just proves that cancer really does pick on anyone , ' she said
' you ca n't be too careful
' you have to take every little thing seriously , even if you feel like you 're bothering the doctor
' she misses her mum every day , but mother 's day is particularly difficult
' it 's just an extra reminder than my children are missing their grandma , ' she said
' there are times i could really do with her advice and her reassurance and mother 's day highlights that she is n't around
' i know she would have been so caring with them
mother 's day will be hard but now i have my own children we can make new memories
