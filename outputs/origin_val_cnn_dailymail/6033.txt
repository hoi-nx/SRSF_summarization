motorsport fans watched in horror on saturday as two classic racing cars which have been lovingly maintained for decades crashed into each other while driving around goodwood circuit
the unique mercedes sls ' , worth an estimated Â£ 4million , which was being driven by f1 and le mans legend jochen mass. crashed into the back of a lister - knobbly - thought to be worth around Â£ 1million
the one - of - a - kind 1955 mercedes sls - originally made out of aluminium - had been transported to the sussex racetrack from germany collector dr klaus lahr especially for the salvadori cup race
the lister , owned by barry wood , was entering the pits when mass powered out of a chicane to find the slowing lister in front of him
he slammed on the brakes but his wheels locked up , causing the mercedes sls to smash into the rear of the lister
it brought the qualifying period to an abrupt halt with stewards running onto the track to help both drivers and deal with fuel which had leaked onto the tarmac
both drivers emerged from their cars unscathed but were taken to the medical room as a precaution
the cars did not fare so well however , with both suffering serious damage
the mercedes sls came off the worst , with the front - end badly dented , meaning it could not be moved on its own
the back of the lister-jaguar was bent out of shape by the force of the impact
it is now known whether the vehicles were insured , but it is feared repairs could cost more than Â£ 100,000
at the time , tony wood was the second fastest in the lister while mass was 22nd
the mercedes sls is unique , having been created by a us mechanic in the 1950s , and it is feared it will be difficult to restore to its former glory the lister-jaguar fared equally badly in the accident and was left with the rear badly twisted into the air and damage to both sets of wheels stewards rushed to deal with fuel which spilled onto the track and the race was stopped
luckily , the drivers of both cars were unharmed a statement from goodwood motorsport said : ' there was a collision during qualifying for the salvadori cup on the afternoon of saturday , march 21 , 2015 , involving car 23 , a lister-jaguar ' knobbly ' driven by tony wood and car 8 , a mercedes-benz 300 mercedes sls " porter special " driven by jochen mass. ' following the contact between the two cars , both of which stopped close to the pit lane entrance , the session was immediately red - flagged and did not resume
' in line with our safety protocols , both drivers were taken to the circuit medical centre for precautionary checks and were released shortly afterwards to enjoy the remainder of the weekend
' unfortunately , neither car was able to be repaired in time to take part in sunday 's race and neither driver was able to take any further part in the on - track action
' the mercedes sls started out life as a mercedes sls 300 sl gullwing but was modified in the us in 1956 after a being involved in another serious crash
it was once well known in us racing circles as the ' mercedes-corvette '
th accident happened at the 73rd goodwood members meeting , in which cars from all generations are taken around the track for fans stewards were unable to move the classic mercedes sls and it had to be lifted on to a tow truck before being removed from the famous circuit side - view pictures show the damage to the front of the car , which will be returned to its owner in germany in a much worse state than it left
