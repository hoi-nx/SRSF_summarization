a politician who sued his rival for calling him ' del boy ' in a campaign leaflet is facing a Â£ 50,000 bill after dropping the lawsuit because he has ' developed thicker skin '
mcevoy launched the legal action after labour opponent michael michael distributed a circular which had his photo superimposed onto the face of the only fools and horses character
plaid cymru 's mcevoy , a former deputy leader of cardiff city council , claimed the leaflet implied that he was ' not to be trusted '
mcevoy ( left ) is facing a Â£ 50,000 bill after launching legal action against labour opponent michael michael ( right ) over a campaign leaflet which depicted him as del boy only fools and horses but a top judge found it was not defamatory to compare someone to david jason 's on - screen character , instead labelling it ' the stuff of political disagreement '
mr mcevoy later withdrew his high court libel case , saying he regretted bringing the action
but he has now been ordered to pay Â£ 50,000 of his rival 's legal costs
speaking after the case , mr mcevoy said : ' with hindsight , i now regret having started this action
' i have developed a thicker skin , and in future if i dislike something written about me i will write a leaflet of my own instead of issuing a writ
' i do n't think anyone has gained from this case going to court
this is the end of it , and it 's time to move on
' a judge ruled that comparing mr mcevoy to david jason 's on - screen character was critical but not defamatory the two councillors had become locked in a legal battle after the leaflet was distributed to around 2,000 homes in the fairwater area of the welsh capital
mr mcevoy , a member of welsh party plaid cymru , had claimed the leaflet ' questioned my probity '
his lawyer david hughes had argued : ' we all know who del boy is - del boy is best described as a " loveable rogue "
' the loveable element of del boy 's character comes from his good humour , his linguistic faux - pas , the amusing incidents that befall him , and the fact that he is fictional
' the newsletters entirely eliminate any suggestion that councillor mcevoy is in any way loveable
that leaves him being described as a rogue
' he 's not to be trusted
which of us would like to be compared to del boy ? ' mr michael michael had maintained it was a ' light - hearted ' leaflet and that he was ' surprised ' anyone was offended by its content
he said he had received feedback that people ' enjoyed ' it
his lawyer hugh tomlinson qc argued that the comparison would not have been taken literally by residents
high court judge andrew keyser qc , sitting at cardiff civil justice centre , said the leaflet implied that mr mcevoy was a â money - loving and money - seeking entrepreneur ' who was â prone to unrealistic fantasies and improbable business ideas â
but he ruled that it was not unusual or defamatory to suggest that politicians ' policies are fantasies , or lacking in realism
he said : ' the picture and words do not mean the claimant is a roguish character
' mr mcevoy , who withdrew the case on legal advice , is covered by libel insurance .
