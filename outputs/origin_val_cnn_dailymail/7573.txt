a 600lb woman , whose eating spiraled out of control after she was molested as a child , was left fighting for her life after she developed a deadly case of pneumonia following her weight loss surgery
on last night 's episode of the tlc obesity series my 600lbs life , laura , from san antonio , texas , admitted that she was afraid she would die on the operating table â but it was actually her persistent refusal to address the symptoms of a lung infection that almost cost the 41 - year - old her life
' we got her just in time to keep her alive , but its not looking good right now , ' laura 's surgeon dr nowzaradan told the cameras
' she is very close to dying
instead , laura was later rushed to the emergency room , where she was placed in the intensive care unit and given a ventilator because she could n't breathe on her own
' a patient this size ca n't handle any sort of sickness , ' dr nowzaradan said
' [ her ] body has nothing left to give
' laura 's common law husband joey tearfully watched her quietly battle the infection in her hospital bed
mad love : joey had to help laura get out of bed in the morning because she was morbidly obese , weighing 594 lbs team work : laura 's mom carmen and joey had to help clean laura 's body and get her ready for the day ' laura is my life , ' he said
' she 's been there with me through thick and thin
' despite her severe condition , laura miraculously managed to make a full recovery after spending two weeks in the hospital â but sadly her illness was just one of her many set backs
when laura first traveled to houston to meet with dr nowzaradan , she was told that she needed to shed 50lbs from her 594lb frame before being eligible for gastric bypass
' she is physically in one of the worst shapes i have ever seen , ' the doctor said of laura , who was a diabetic and needed an oxygen tank and a wheelchair with her at all times
after laura lost the necessary weight , dr nowzaradan proceeded with the surgery , only to find in the midst of the procedure that laura 's liver and spleen were far too large for her to actually undergo the gastric bypass
emotional trauma : when laura was a young child ( l ) , she did n't have a problem with her weight
she started piling on the pounds ( r ) after an older cousin started molesting her when she was only five - years - old constant struggle : laura continued to put on weight , and by the time she was in high school , she weighed more than 300lbs soulmates : joey and laura met when she was 27 - years - old
he said he was attracted to heavier women at the time and liked the way she looked instead , he had to do a gastrectomy , in which he removed 80per cent of laura âs stomach
although the procedure would n't be as beneficial to her weight loss as a gastric bypass , it was all he could do
laura , who almost cancelled the surgery the night before it was scheduled because she feared it would kill her , was devastated to learn that the doctor could n't perform the gastric bypass
weeks later she was deathly ill and fighting for her life , but battling pneumonia gave laura even more determination to lose weight once and for all
' it made me realize how much of my life i had wasted , ' she said
' i have taken all this pain and bitterness and all i have done was eat instead of dealing with it
' major problem : laura , who said she is addicted to sweets , can be seen eating candy that joey had given her bad news : weight loss expert dr nowzaradan told laura she had to lose 50lbs before being eligible for gastric bypass surgery panic mode : laura 's niece watched her aunt cry into her pillow the night before her surgery because she feared the procedure would kill her she continued : ' i thought if i lost the weight , then i would start to get happy , but its really just been bringing everything to the surface and i do n't want to run from it anymore
' as a young child , weight was never an issue for laura , but after an older cousin began molesting her when she was only five - years - old , her eating habits dramatically changed for the worst
' i never told my parents anything so the molestation went on for years , ' she told the cameras while crying
' my whole life just changed , so i turned to food , that was my comfort
' being the heaviest kid in elementary school brought her even more pain
family support : laura 's mom and sister spend time with her before her scheduled surgery change of plans : in surgery , dr nowzaradan learned that laura 's liver and spleen were too large for gastric bypass
instead , he had to perform a gastrectomy , in which he removed 80per cent of her stomach filled with fear : joe tearfully watched laura as she battled pneumonia in the intensive care unit at the hospital ' they would call me fat and say : " you are going to break the desk , " ' she tearfully recalled
' and i took all that pain and kept eating
' laura weighed more than 300lbs when she was in high school , and she was even heavier when she met joey at the age of 27
' i did like heavy set girls when i was younger , ' joey said
' i liked the way she was
' but after gaining so much additional weight laura confessed that she had started to feel more like a burden in his life
joey and her mom carmen had to do almost everything for laura , including bathe her

' it 's just humiliating to have to your family do everything for you like this , ' she said
' some days i want to die , so they do n't have to take care of me anymore
' she said she wants to get healthy , but admitted that she was battling an addiction to food
to make matters worse , joey was often helping her sneak sweets behind her mother 's back
' she means the world to me
i love my wife a lot , ' he explained
' it 's hard to tell her no because i love her
' warm embrace : laura hugged dr nowzaradan and thanked him for saving her life before and after : laura first entered dr nowzaradan 's office in a wheelchair with oxygen , and now she was able to walk out on her own two feet but joey also noted that his biggest fear is that she will just give up on herself
laura 's love for joey , her mother , and her nieces , whom she calls her ' babies ' , is ultimately what drove her to see dr nowzaradan in the first place
' i need to live for my babies , ' she said , adding : ' i need to live for myself
' after her bout with pneumonia , it dawned on laura that she needed to deal with her emotional issues and began to see a therapist
' a new body wo n't matter if i still feel the same way , ' she said
special trip : laura tried on a dress for joey
it would become the first one that she would ever purchase and wear arts and crafts : laura was able to go out with her nieces for the first time in their lives
they spent the day painting pottery dr nowzaradan was concerned that she had only lost 18lbs since her surgery , and noted that she was on her way to gaining weight again
but slowly , laura began to heal emotionally
she had a heart - to heart with her mom about the abuse she faced as a child and she was finally beginning to forgive those who hurt her
and it was this emotional closure that enabled her to really buckle down and lose weight
a year after she started her journey , laura lost 237lbs and could do almost everything for herself
she was even able to go shopping , purchase her first dress and go out with her nieces to paint pottery
' i feel like i new person , ' she said of her dramatic weight loss .
