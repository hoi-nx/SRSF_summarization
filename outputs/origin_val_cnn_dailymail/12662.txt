a britain boy whose parents were once arrested for pulling him out of a hospital now appears to be free of cancer , a family spokesman said monday
ashya king , 5 , had proton beam therapy and appears to have had no cancer for months , jonathan hartley said
is proton therapy the ' magic bullet ' for cancer ? the family is in spain
ashya king 's parents , brett and naghmeh king , are afraid to return to the britain for fear of arrest , though they are in talks to return , jonathan hartley said
britain 's crown prosecution service said in september that it would not arrest the parents
that announcement came after they were arrested in spain while authorities decided whether to charge them and extradite them to britain
the kings had serious concerns about the medical treatment that ashya king was receiving at university hospital southampton
so they defied doctors ' orders and took him out
dr. funes , who 's overseeing ashya king 's treatment , agrees with the assessment that ashya is cancer - free , he told cnn on monday
still , there is a high chance of recurrence , he said
funes gave cnn details : in august , ashya king had surgery in britain to remove the tumor
the kind of tumor ashya king had is very aggressive and can often relapse in the brain or the spinal cord
the standard treatment is radiotherapy in the brain and spinal cord , which can cause serious side effects or even death
ashya king 's parents wanted to instead do a new proton therapy , which is conducted by only a few sites in europe
one is in the czech republic
since ashya king was born in marbella , southern spain , his family contacted a hospital there and then took ashya king to have proton therapy in prague in september
the next month , the boy began rehabilitation in marbella
initially after the proton therapy , ashya king was mute and had no movement
but after three months of intensive treatment , he can walk generally unaided
he has also been swimming and playing with toys , funes said
his family comes to see him every day
ashya king has difficulty speaking but continues to improve
he can say a few words , and he can give simple answers when asked questions such as whether he is hungry
medical officials in madrid will make a molecular profile of the tumor that was removed to help identify the risk of relapse
doctors have requested a sample from southampton
the surgery conducted in southampton was excellent , funes said .
