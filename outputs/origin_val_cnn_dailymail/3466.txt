it is quite a good vantage point but being detached from the players makes life difficult
' i did not realise the significance of it at first , it just did not sink in
it is only the passage of time and games that makes you fully understand what it involves and just how much you miss. ' thankfully , james ( james wood , assistant manager ) , robbie ( yates , goalkeeper coach ) and the players have been relatively unaffected by it so they deserve all the credit
the personal difficulty for me is secondary
' killick , who was given a six - match stadium ban for remonstrating with referee ben knight following dolphins ' 1 - 0 defeat by redditch on january 17 , has just one game left to serve of his punishment
he will be hoping for a similar vantage point on tuesday when poole take on corby town in the second leg of the southern league cup final
