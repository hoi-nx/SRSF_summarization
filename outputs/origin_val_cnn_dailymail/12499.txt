congratulations , internet haters ! well done , keepers of the one - true - way - to - talk - about - race ! if we do n't tamp down the backlash against starbucks " campaign , i fear that no major corporation will even try to talk about race again -- for maybe 10 or 20 years
is that really what we want ? look , i get it
asking baristas to hold conversations about race is a lot to demand of already hard - working employees
not to mention , the topic should probably be called " systematic racism , " not just " race
" and there are legitimate questions about what starbucks could realistically hope to accomplish , here
but for crying out loud ! in the past 48 hours , racial justice activists have spilled more digital ink criticizing starbucks for trying to fight racism than they have against other ( actually racist ) companies
the truth is that we can not have it both ways
we can not demand that companies address race , and then attack them when they try
yes , it seems like harmless fun to pile on or retweet the snark
at some point , all of us have enjoyed the cheap thrill one gets by kicking around a big company online
but the cost this time is that no corporation will want to do anything creative or constructive on racial subjects for a very long time
in fact , some activists are responding with such little sympathy , empathy and grace , that other corporations are like to run the other way
again , is that what we want ? mellody hobson , an african-american member of the starbucks board and a personal friend , is a major supporter of this campaign
how will other corporate boards react in the future when a minority member encourages the company to publicly address issues of racial inclusion ? starbucks is trying to make a positive difference
if the company gets rewarded , others will follow
but nobody wants their brand to get beaten up
at some point in the future , activists will launch an online petition or protest against a company guilty of some legitimately racist behavior
but how seriously will anyone take us , when even the " good guys " end up getting kicked in the teeth and called racist -- for trying to oppose bigotry ? modern science tells us that bias lives on , in even the most dedicated anti-racist
the only cure is talking about it
our country needs more open discussion of race , not less
companies who try to further that discussion should be rewarded , even if their initial attempts are imperfect
we can put forward suggestions and criticisms in a constructive manner : " this is a great first step , corporation ! here are five ways to improve the campaign -- and make it even better
" i think any human anywhere would be open to hearing that kind of feedback
but nobody wants to be called an idiot , just for trying
unfortunately , today 's vicious backlash against starbucks could become a case study in proving that -- when it comes to race -- no good deed goes unpunished
ironically , after all this is over , starbucks will still sell plenty of lattes
the people who will suffer the most are the ones who said they wanted a conversation on race in the first place -- but then would n't take " yes " for an answer .
