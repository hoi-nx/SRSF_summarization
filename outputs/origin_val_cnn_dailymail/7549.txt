kerry tried to defuse the ongoing row over netanyahu 's forthcoming speech to congress - despite fears it will affect negotiations with iran over their nuclear program
the secretary of state said he did not want the israeli 's prime minister 's forthcoming address to a joint session of congress to become ' some great political football '
netanyahu 's speech , organized by john boehner , the republican house speaker , was set up without the blessing of the obama administration - and comes as the white house tries to strike a deal over iran 's nuclear ambitions
kerry played up u.s. - israeli unity in an interview on sunday for abc 's this week show , insisting ' the prime minister of israeli is welcome to speak in the u.s. , obviously
' and we have a closer relationship with israeli right now in terms of security than at any time in history
' there is , however , a clear different in policy between netanyahu and the white house - with the israeli leader expected to urge congress to stop iran 's nuclear ambitions by keeping up the current sanctions regime
congress wants to keep the sanctions regime strong , but the president has said he would veto any new penalties to preserve the negotiations
kerry reiterated d.c. 's determination to pursue negotiations with iran , saying the white house deserved ' the benefit of the doubt ' to see if a nuclear deal could be reached
by accepting an invitation from the gop party to address congress on tuesday , the israeli leader infuriated the obama administration , which said it was not told of the speech before plans were made public in an apparent breach of protocol
solemn : netanyahu has claimed his visit is above the political , and says he is standing up for all jews by visiting d.c.
he is pictured above praying at jersualem 's western wall but both sides have tried to downplay the rift
in remarks on saturday at jersualem 's western wall , netanyahu said : ' i would like to take this opportunity to say that i respect u.s. president obama
' he added that he believed in the strong bilateral ties and said , ' that strength will prevail over differences of opinion , those in the past and those yet to come
' netanyahu did not repeat those remarks as he departed on sunday
the israeli prime minister , who is running for re-election in a march 17 ballot , has framed his visit as being above politics and he portrayed himself as being a guardian for all jews
' i 'm going to d.c. on a fateful , even historic , mission , ' he said as he boarded his plane in tel aviv
' i feel that i am an emissary of all israeli 's citizens , even those who do not agree with me , and of the entire jewish people , ' he told reporters
not popular : anti-israeli demonstrator are pictured above protesting in d.c. ahead of netanyahu 's address netanyahu is expected to use his speech to urge congress to approve new sanctions against iran despite obama 's pledge to veto such legislation because it would jeopardize nuclear talks
u.s. officials fear he is seeking to sabotage the iran diplomacy , and critics have suggested his visit is an elaborate election stunt that will play well with voters back home
while white house and israeli officials insist that key areas of cooperation , from counter-terrorism to intelligence to cyber security , will remain unaffected , the divide over the iran talks has shaped up as the worst in decades
previously israeli has always been careful to navigate between the gop and democratic camps
the planned address , however , has driven a rare wedge between netanyahu 's government and some congressional democrats
some two dozen or more of them plan to boycott the speech , according to unofficial estimates
iran itself has weighed in on the speech as well
speaking in tehran on saturday , iran foreign minister zarif accused netanyahu of trying to undermine the nuclear talks in order to distract from the palestinians ' unresolved bid for an independent state
' netanyahu is opposed to any sort of solution , ' zarif said
meanwhile a u.s. official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the ' politicized ' nature of his visit threatened ' what undergirds the strength of the relationship '
as one former u.s. official put it : ' sure , when netanyahu calls the white house , obama will answer
but how fast will he be about responding ( to a crisis ) ? '
