a behavioral checklist that the tsa uses to help identify airport travelers they believe could be potential terrorists has been revealed
the screening of observation techniques system , nicknamed spot , breaks down body language and demeanor the tsa believes indicates either ' stress ' or ' deception '
mannerisms are assigned points based on their severity and are assessed by trained ' behavior detection officers ' , who observe passengers as they go through the security checkpoint
behaviors are given points based on their perceived severity
if you walk through security with a ' face pale from recent shaving of beard ' or happen to be yawning or whistling , you can be assigned one point
having ' widely open eyes ' will get you two points , as will showing ' unusual ' interest in a security officer 's work routine or having ' identical luggage or dress ' to an individual who does not seem related to you
appearing to be in disguise will get you three points
but you can also get points shaved off
if you appear to be a member of a family or part of a married couple , you get two points deducted from your score
being a female over 55 , or a male over 65 , gets you a one point reduction
the checklist includes a list of items and behaviors to look out for if a passenger is pulled aside for inspection
' suspicious ' items range from blueprints to liquids ' in excess of 3.4oz '
further signs of deception include excessive yawning or perspiration and lacking details about the purpose of one 's trip
the spot program , which has cost more than $ 800million since its inception in 2007 , was deemed ineffective by both the department of homeland security and the government accountability office last year
spot breaks down body language the tsa believes indicates ' stress ' or ' deception ' , including sweaty palms , a strong body odor , widely opened eyes or a bobbing adam 's apple ( file photo ) the government accountability office found that there was no scientific evidence to support the spot 's claim that terrorists can be picked out via ' behavioral indicators ' , and said the human 's ability to ' accurately identify ' suspicious behavior is ' slightly better than chance '
the department of homeland security report said that the tsa had not assessed the effectiveness of the spot program or designed a ' comprehensive training program ' for it
it concluded that the tsa could not ' ensure that passengers at united states airports are screened objectively ' with spot and did not believe the administration could ' justify the program 's expansion '
tsa was sued by the aclu last week for failing to respond to a freedom of information act request regarding the spot program
the aclu is alleging that the program leads to racial profiling
a spokesperson with the tsa told the intercept that ' behavior detection ' was just ' one element ' of the administration 's efforts to ' mitigate threats against the traveling public '
' no single behavior alone will cause a traveler to be referred to additional screening or will result in a call or a law enforcement officer
' ' officers are trained and audited to ensure referrals for additional screening are based only on observable behaviors and not race or ethnicity ' .
