the decision came on a split vote : seven for life , five for death
it came thursday on johnny garrard 's 50th birthday
under alabama law , a vote of at least 10 of 12 jurors was required for the panel to recommend death
a simple majority could recommend life
life : joyce hardin garrard was found guilty of capital murder last week by a jury that today voted 7 to 5 to imprison the 50 - year - old for life rather than put her to death for running to death her granddaughter savannah hardin in february 2012 horrific : savannah collapsed and had a seizure after carrying wood as johnny garrard refused to let her stop running

circuit judge billy ogletree will make the final sentencing decision at a hearing may 11
the same jury convicted johnny garrard of capital murder last week
the jury began deliberating late in the morning after prosecution and defense attorneys presented closing arguments in the sentencing phase of johnny garrard 's trial
assistant district attorney reid asked jurors to recommend the death penalty , adding that he 's never prosecuted a case like this one
' this case is the only case i know of where the perpetrator forced the victim to participate in her own death , ' he said
' joyce garrard forced savannah hardin to help kill herself
' prosecutors contend johnny garrard made the girl run as punishment for telling a lie about candy , and refused to let savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise
in court , they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured johnny garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson
reid told jurors that johnny garrard had cried in the courtroom at the mention of her birthday , but did n't cry when jurors were shown the soiled blue pants savannah was wearing the night of her collapse
she does n't believe she did anything wrong , ' he said
over some candy : johnny garrard forced savannah to run around the house and carry wood as punishment for a lie about eating candy in february 2012 while grandmother joyce hardin garrard was in the yard verbally prodding 9 - year - old savannah hardin to run and pick up sticks , witnesses and attorneys said , stepmother jessica mae hardin watched idly from a distance , seemingly immersed in her laptop computer
and with savannah struggling to keep going and near the point of collapse , savannah hardin went inside so she would n't have to keep watching the girl 's torment , a prosecutor suggested
later , it was savannah hardin who called 911 and told authorities the girl had collapsed and was having a seizure , but only at johnny garrard 's direction
savannah died within days in a hospital after being taken off life support
johnny garrard ( left ) and jessica mae hardin ( right ) , savannah 's stepmother , were arrested in february 2012
harden has also been charged with her murder , for allegedly sitting by as johnny garrard ran the girl to death , which carries a life sentence prosecutors portrayed johnny garrard as a domineering grandmother who controlled savannah 's punishment despite the advice of a counselor , but they say savannah hardin shares blame , too
authorities contend savannah hardin , who was married to johnny garrard 's son robert , should go to prison for failing to help her stepdaughter during the child 's ordeal on feb. 17 , 2012
her refusal to come to the girl 's aid is tantamount to murder , the state has argued
savannah hardin , 30 , has pleaded not guilty
she is free on $ 150,000 bond awaiting trial while prosecutors concentrate first on johnny garrard , charged with the more serious offense of capital murder
no trial date is set for savannah hardin , who was pregnant when savannah died and gave birth while in police custody following her arrest
defense attorney bone stood beside the jury box holding a small , dark rock and reminded jurors that in old times , the jury would participate in the execution by throwing rocks at the condemned
he said they have a right to say , ' i ai n't throwing that stone
' ' if you ca n't throw that stone , be the first one , then do n't , ' he added
johnny garrard 's family and friends had pleaded wednesday for jurors to spare her life after , calling her a loving grandmother who endured an abusive childhood that included being beaten by her own grandmother
johnny garrard , of boaz , testified last week she had no intention of harming the girl and denied she had forced her to run
johnny garrard said during cross examination that savannah wanted johnny garrard to help her get faster for races at school , and they both ran ' a bunch ' before savannah collapsed
savannah hardin mother , heather ( right ) , told the court that she believes her ex-mother - in - law deserves the death penalty heather had not seen daughter savannah in the year before her death , as she moved out of state to live with her father and stepmother
jessica mae hardin says she repeatedly sent things , which would be returned to sender to her bone argued that savannah would n't want her own grandmother put to death
' joyce hardin garrard loved savannah , that 's been proven
savannah loved joyce hardin garrard , that 's been proven , ' he said
he said circumstances made it especially hard to condemn her to death
' there is no comparison for this one because it is the first one of its kind ever
you people will be setting the bar
' because thursday was johnny garrard 's birthday , deputies allowed her to hug relatives across the short wall that separates the front of the courtroom from the spectators before court opened in the morning
joyce hardin garrard embraced her husband johnny garrard for several minutes , rubbing his back and the back of his head as she and her relatives wept
afterward , she sat down at the defense table and stared at her son and savannah 's father , robert , who was in the courtroom for the first time
he sat directly behind the prosecution table and did not appear to return the eye contact .
