a russia stripper and lingerie model needed surgery after a manicurist she criticised filed her nails so short her fingers were left bleeding and swollen
lomovskikh , 20 , visited a beauty salon to have her nails done , but told manicurist anastasia kretova she was disappointed about the quality of her work , calling it ' shoddy and unprofessional '
she claims that , in response , the beautician filed her nails so close to the skin her fingers began bleeding , leaving her in ' absolute agony '
' but then she went mental , and i realised she had filed them with such ferocity that they were bleeding
' after going home to bandage her wounds in her home city of voronezh , southern russia , she eventually had to go to hospital where she was diagnosed with having acute purulent inflammation of two nails and had to have them removed
igor korotkiy , the head surgeon who carried out the operation , said that surgery was the only option because of the mutilation caused to the model 's fingers
he added : ' the damage was so bad the only thing we could do was to take them off completely
it is difficult to say if they will ever grow again
