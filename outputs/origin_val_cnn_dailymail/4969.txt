dozens of soldiers from a battalion famous for using the emblem of a vicious comic book avenger to strike fear into the enemy in afghanistan are heading to iraq with isis in their sights
the telemark battalion is an elite mechanised infantry unit of the norwegian army which has been involved in the fight against the taliban as part of the nato - led security mission since 2003
around 50 soldiers from telemark battalion will be heading to the city of irbil in northern iraq to train kurdish forces to help them in their fight against islamic state , the norwegian ministry of defence has confirmed
it is thought the mission will begin in early april
the battalion has been involved in the fight against the taliban as part of the nato - led security mission since 2003 and lost two soldiers in the conflict , including olsson isis fighters in aleppo , syria
telemark troops are travelling to northern iraq to train kurdish peshmerga forces in their fight against the extremists some instructors will also be sent to the iraq capital baghdad in the hopes of stemming an insurgency which now controls large tracts of northern iraq and syria
the telemark battalion attracted headlines in 2010 when reports emerged some of its soldiers were spray - painting the punisher symbol on houses and property belonging to afghanistan suspected of being members of the taliban
punisher is a marvel antihero and vigilante who slaughters criminals and mobsters and has a striking skull - shaped emblem
since the death of olsson - known by his nickname ' jokke ' - in january 2010 , some members of the unit took to wearing patches featuring the punisher logo and the words ' jokke - we will never forget '
the 22 - year - old was killed when the storm tank he was travelling in was hit by a taliban roadside bomb southeast of the village of ghowrmach in northwest afghanistan

' the insignia of the telemark battalion ( left ) , which was lead by the fierce major rune wenneberg ( right ) telemark soldiers in afghanistan , where they became famous for spray - painting the punisher symbol on houses and property belonging to afghanistan suspected of being members of the taliban the wearing of punisher patches was subsequently banned by the norwegian military leadership , though some soldiers reportedly continued to do so
following olsson 's death a video emerged of company commander major rune wenneberg firing up his troops with a rousing battle cry name - checking valahalla , the mystical hall of norse mythology where specially chosen warriors go after they 've been killed in combat
during the footage wenneberg reportedly cries : ' you are the predator
to valhalla ! ' , as his troops punch their weapons in the air in support
one former soldier knows who firsthand how ferocious telemark battalion fighters can be is american stanley , who helped provide logistics for units from the norwegian battalion when they underwent two weeks of cold weather training in preparation for deployment to bosnia in the late 1990s
the 51 - year - old , who is a former sergeant in the 82nd airborne of the us army , told mailonline they would be a fierce asset to kurdish peshmerga troops in their efforts to combat murderous extremists
he said : ' isis should fear them for sure
they did n't hold back in work or play and when they went to the task of battle that was all of the business they cared for until the mission was completed
an iraq kurdish peshmerga fighter is pictured in september 2014 firing at islamic state positions from the top of mount zardak , 25 kilometres east of mosul in northern iraq
fighters like him are soon to benefit from the expertise of the telemark battalion - some of the fiercest soldiers in the world isis fighters on the march
stanley , a former sergeant in the 82nd airborne of the us army , says the jihadists should fear the norwegian forces being sent to aid their kurdish enemies isis has now expanded its reach across much of northern iraq and holds the city of mosul , around 90 kilometres from the kurdish capital irbil , to where the telemark battalion soldiers are being sent ' isis is a force of uncontrolled chaos and they have no discipline or defined battlefield strategy other than overcome by force
' this well - trained and disciplined unit of norwegian soldiers would be able to make very short work of any isis soldiers they encountered
' now a director of technology at a catholic high school in modesto , california , mr stanley added : ' my take on them is that they were a very aggressive and rugged team of warriors
' they had the attitude of whatever comes our way we will demolish it , be that from eating chow to driving their mechanised vehicles
' there was no half way with them - it was all or nothing in everything they did
i have a long history with airborne paratroopers and they are some of the toughest soldiers in the army , on and off duty - they train hard and play even harder
' the telemark battalion guys were every bit if not more rough and tumble
' i would say compared to other country 's soldiers they were among some of the most competitive and competent warriors that i have ever worked with
' when we were in [ operation ] desert storm [ against saddam hussein in 1990 ] their equivalent would have possibly been the french foreign legion soldiers as far as ferocity and competence goes
' american sniper kyle , who had his own take on the punisher symbol , which can be seen here on his cap kyle 's logo , with the punisher skull and cross hairs the 11 - year veteran of the 82nd airborne and father - of - one , whose son is currently serving in the us army , says the punisher symbol was not being used when he worked with the soldiers
he said : ' that incident did n't happen until later in afghanistan and i was aware of it and heard the stories
' that type of scare tactic has been employed for many years by many armies - the vietnam war had its death card ace of spades , and now they have moved to spray - painted skulls and comic book reference symbols
' kyle the american sniper had his also
' kyle is known for using a variation of the punisher symbol himself , featuring the words ' despite what your momma told you ... violence does solve problems '
the telemark battalion saboteurs back in britain after the incredible raid
six norwegian soldiers destroyed hitler 's nuclear dream in february 1943 at the norsk hydro plant near the town of rjukan , norwegian the telemark battalion share a name with a group of legendary second world war saboteurs
the heroes of telemark ( pictured ) , carried out a famous raid which helped thwart hitler 's plans to build a nazi nuclear bomb
the team successfully destroyed a heavy water production facility at the norsk plant in telemark battalion , a region of southern norwegian , in 1943
the raid , which is regarded as one of the most successful acts of sabotage in the whole war , was also remarkable for the fact all the team managed to escape by cross-country skiing 250 miles into sweden
the heavy water or deuterium oxide which the norsk plant produced , was essential to the german scientists working on an atomic bomb project and the allies were desperate to destroy it
it was no soft target
perched on an icy ravine , surrounded by machine gun - toting guards and floodlights the plant was virtually impregnable
but the six - man all norwegian squad from the special operations executive , trained at brickendonbury in hertfordshire , managed to parachute in and get the job done
in what was known as operation gunnerside , the raiders broke into the plant and set charges , the explosion of which caused 1000lbs of heavy water to wash away
they then made their remarkable escape , imortalised in the 1964 hollywood film the heroes of telemark , starring kirk douglas .
