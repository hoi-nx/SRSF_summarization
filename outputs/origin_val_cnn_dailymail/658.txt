the news comes after it was revealed that scotland yard has been accused of facilitating 14 cover - ups of vip child sex abuse
dossier : labour mp john mann ( pictured ) last year submitted an explosive dossier to police naming 22 politicians linked to historical child abuse over 35 years , officers are said to have protected â untouchable â figures by shutting down inquiries that reached the heart of government
the 14 alleged cover - ups were referred to watchdogs by the met itself yesterday
it threatens to be the biggest investigation into police corruption since the 1970s
the allegations were uncovered by detectives probing claims of historical sex abuse first raised by labour mp watson in october 2012
those on the inquiry , known as elm guest house , are understood to have raised concerns after studying files kept in storage
the claims include one that police deliberately stalled their inquiries into the elm guest house , in barnes , south - west london , leaving dozens of boys to be abused
victims claim that high - profile politicians , diplomats and civil servants visited the property to abuse boys in the 1970s and 1980s
officers are also accused of releasing paedophile mp cyril smith without charge after he was caught in an undercover operation at a sex party involving teenage boys
police are also accused of failing to end sex parties at the now notorious dolphin square complex , in pimlico , central london , following the intervention of â prominent people â
it is claimed that members of a wealthy and powerful elite believed they were â untouchable â after police were warned off shutting down the sordid activities
one senior figure under the spotlight is former tory home secretary william whitelaw , who is accused of demanding that police drop an inquiry into a paedophile ring
the politician , one of margaret thatcher âs closest allies , is suspected of quashing a year - long investigation into a gang accused of abusing 40 children
other inquiries focus on claims that the names of high - profile sex attackers were removed from witness statements and that police deliberately let senior politicians off the hook
one inquiry is examining allegations that special branch seized a dossier naming 16 mps and peers handed to an investigative journalist by a former labour minister
paedophile : a detective says he was ordered to cover up cyril smith 's crimes by senior colleagues unbelievably , two undercover officers are themselves suspected of sexually abusing a boy during a raid at the elm guest house
the ipcc is still considering two further cases , including the shadowy murder of eight - year - old vishal mehrotra in july 1981
his family believes he may have fallen into the hands of members of the vip sex ring and evidence leading to their door was deliberately ignored
green , of the ipcc , said police and her officials were examining claims that evidence was suppressed , investigations were hindered and halted and offences covered up
â these allegations are of historic , high level corruption of the most serious nature , â she said
â allegations of this nature are of grave concern and i would like to reassure people of our absolute commitment to ensuring that the investigations are thorough and robust
â defending the decision to â manage â the met inquiry , rather than undertake an independent one , she said : â the new criminal investigations looking at alleged police corruption are closely linked and well under way
â mrs green said this decision remained under review and could be changed if new evidence came to light
responding to the inquiries , mr watson said many child abuse victims will have mixed feelings but will be pleased that their voices are now being heard .
