the average wall street bonus rose two percent in 2014 as hiring in city 's financial sector picked up according to a government report the decline in profits was due to weakness in some trading divisions , costly legal settlements at large banks and higher capital reserve requirements imposed by regulators after the financial crisis
the industry added 2,300 jobs in new york city in 2014 , the first year of positive job growth in the sector since 2011
' the cost of legal settlements related to the 2008 financial crisis continues to be a drag on wall street profits , but the securities industry remains profitable and well - compensated even as it adjusts to regulatory changes , ' said new york city state comptroller dinapoli
' the resumption of job growth in the securities industry bodes well for new york city 's economy , but it remains to be seen whether this trend will be sustained
' ' one area that anecdotally we keep hearing is a growth sector is compliance , ' dinapoli said
the average increase in bonuses in 2014 was well below the rise notched in the previous two years
average bonuses fell from a peak of $ 191,360 on average in 2006 to $ 100,850 in 2008 during the financial crisis
average bonuses had fallen from a peak of $ 191,360 in 2006 to $ 100,850 in 2008 during the financial crisis the average salary including bonuses on wall street was $ 355,500 in 2013 , according to an october report from the comptroller 's office
' the compensation is five times the average for private employment in the city , ' dinapoli said
' but it 's a challenging work environment , and in recent years because of the downsizing it 's been harder to get these positions
' authorities have blamed inflated mortgage - backed securities that plummeted along with the u.s. housing market for the financial crisis in 2008
regulatory reforms since have included larger reserve requirements , new limits on proprietary trading and measures intended to reduce risk
securities firms now pay a smaller share of bonuses in the current year with more deferred
dinapoli added that it 's important to be concerned about excessive risk - taking and possible regulatory rollbacks to be sure there is n't another meltdown , noting the industry is key to the economic viability of the city and state
the goal should be a business model with sustainable profits , he said , not the short - term , high - risk , high - reward profits ' that invariably results in the periodic downturn or crash as we had
