one of australians 's most popular pain killers has been left with a splitting headache , as the national consumer watchdog gets ready to take it to court
reckitt benckiser , the company behind nurofen in australians , will square off against the accc ( accc ) in federal court this month over claims that it has mislead customers
the accc will dispute claims made by the company that the nurofen specific pain range is specially designed to target different types of pain
the consumer watchdog claims that all products contain identical ingredients
accc chairman rod sims said cracking down on false advertising surrounding medical products was a targetted priority for the watchdog
' the accc takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously , ' mr rod sims said
' in this case , we allege that consumers have been misled into purchasing nurofen specific pain products under the belief that each product is specifically designed for and effective in treating a particular type of pain , when this is not the case
' ' the accc takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously , ' chairman rod sims said
it also flagged the ' significantly ' higher cost of nurofen compared to other products as a concern , with the range in question costing up to twice as much as a standard pain killer sold by nurofen or another comparable brand
a nurofen spokeswoman denied the allegations in a statement , and said pain - specific products made life easier for customers
' nurofen is committed to the quality use of medicines and promoting and protecting the health of australians , ' the statement read
' nurofen works closely with all regulatory bodies to ensure high standards compliance to guidelines
' nurofen will continue to work with regulators to ensure its packaging continues to be fully aligned with all guidelines and requirements and still offer consumers with clear pain relief options for their pain type
' the accc is seeking declarations , injunctions , an order for the publication of corrective notices , penalties and costs
the matter is listed for a case management conference in the federal court of australia in sydney on march 31 .
