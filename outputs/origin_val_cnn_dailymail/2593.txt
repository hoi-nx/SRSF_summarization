ker was diagnosed with a brain tumour after enduring eight months of migraines ker woke up one morning with numbness on one side of his body
when the 24 - year - old construction worker went to a doctor the next day , he was sent home with some headache pills and told he was probably suffering from a bad migraine
but the pain did n't go away
for months , he put up with agonising headaches , dizziness and numbness
a new zealander who had moved to melbourne two years ago , mr ker was suffering and lonely , and turned to a dating site to find some companionship
' i ended up meeting a beautiful woman named rikki , â mr ker told daily mail australia
â from the moment i met her , i somehow knew she was the one who could help my migraines disappear â by making all my problems seem like they did n't exist
â but after three weeks of getting to know rikki , the left side of his body turned numb again
â i was struggling to talk , â ker said
i was trying to explain to rikki that it was all normal and it was just a side - effect of my migraines
but i could see the fear in her eyes too
â this time the numbness and paralysis did n't last just minutes
i rang my mum , who is a neuro nurse and all i remember her saying was " call an ambulance "
â when mr ker arrived at the hospital , he undertook a ct scan but alarm bells started ringing when he was told to do a second scan but with contrast dye injected into him
â that âs when i knew something was wrong , â mr ker said
â then the doctor walked in and all i remember her saying was : " i am very sorry and there is no right way to explain this but you have a large tumour in the right side of your brain
" ker pictured getting his head shaved after undergoing a surgery to get the large tumour removed mr ker said he did nât know what was going to happen next , which prompted him to end his relationship with his girlfriend at the time
â i told rikki i could n't be with her anymore because i was not able to put someone through what i thought i was about to go through , â he said
â but she said : â it would take a security guard to drag her out of there â
â i have no idea what kind of pain rikki would have been in watching it all unfold - my family members were crying on my shoulder while i was sitting in a wheelchair - having to do all this without really even knowing me
â she ended up having to hold me up in the shower , dress me and do everything i could n't do with only one side of my body working
this is now why i call her my other half
â the new zealand man pictured here with stitches after having his large tumour removed from his brain ker 's brother jordan ( left ) pictured with rikki and mother sharon during the tough recovery when mr ker went in for his mri scan , he claims the doctor made a â mistake â after leaving his ct scan on his hospital bed
â i read that the prognosis was a glioma and i instantly hoped onto google to find survival rates were a 30 per cent for more than a year , and 15 per cent for more than two years , â he said
â i told rikki that if i made it out of that hospital alive i was going to marry her as soon as i had enough money to put a rock on her finger
ker received good news when he was told the tumour was non-cancerous â then right before the scan , she walked in and knelt down beside my bed with a lollipop ring in her hand from the cafeteria downstairs and said : " i do n't need a ring ... ker will you marry me ? " â i instantly said yes
â after his mri results returned , he received some good news - he was diagnosed on september 2 with a meningioma - a benign ( non-cancerous ) tumour , which is normally found in elderly people
â the doctor told me i was a very lucky man , â ker said
following the results , mr ker went in for a surgery to have his tumour removed just a week later
â the neurosurgeon told me there was a 20 per cent chance i 'd never move my left side again and an even higher chance i 'd never get the same sort of movement in my left side , â he said
â i remember having tubes and lines put throughout my arms and then waking up being wheeled to the recovery room
â i looked at my left side , too scared to move it , then i just open my mouth and start rapping a song i had written and tears started streaming down my face
â i looked down and moved the toes on my left side and then my hands
i started saying in absolute happiness , " i can move my left side ! " over and over again
' ker , who now lives in melbourne , is a hip hop artist and hopes to get back into the industry when he 's well again after his surgery , ker tried to go back to work but was soon forced to leave after suffering seizures recalling the time before the tumour was found , mr ker said the pain was nearly unbearable
' my brother jordan thought i was having a stroke , â ker told daily mail australia
â i could nât move my body so he convinced me to see a doctor but when the ct scans came back â nothing showed up so i thought i was fine , until the migraines started
â i had already seen a neurologist and he had prescribed me heaps of different migraine medications to no effect , so i just toughed it out
the pain endured , weeks and turning into months of excruciating migraines during which he suffered physically and mentally
â this pain went on for eight months straight , â he said
â some days , i âd only get a few hours â sleep and that lasted weeks
â i âd wake up in the middle of the night in agony and it would feel like i had a knife inside my head â and the pain and pressure i had on my right eye was unexplainable
' when ker was released from hospital after his surgery , his fiance took time out of work to look after him
â i had found the most amazing woman in the world and could n't understand why she loved me , but she did and over the next few weeks i slowly regained my strength , â he said
â the recovery was hard and i had to learn how to walk again
â the 24 - year - old woke up one morning when he found half his body was numb where he struggled to move after being released from hospital , ker started working again but he soon suffered non-convulsive seizures , which forced him to quit
â one day at work , my head went blank and i could n't even fold a box , â he said
â i could n't do simple tasks or see friends because i was ashamed of not being able to talk properly
i was back to having my family and fiancÃ© pay for everything
â i felt like my brain had just stopped working and i could n't talk properly but in recent times , my seizures have stopped
â but i have promised rikki i âll fly her back to our beautiful country new zealand for a holiday
â i owe my thanks to my mum sharon and brother jordan , my fiancee and her mother and father pnina rosenberg and troy milne for accepting me as a son , and the rest of my family and friends for being there for me since day one
â family and friends have set up a give me a little appeal in a bid to raise funds for ker , who has not been able to go back to work since the surgery .
