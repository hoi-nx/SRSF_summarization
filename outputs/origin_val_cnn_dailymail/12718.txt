jerusalem at times , he got raucous applause during his speech in washington on tuesday
but the reactions to israelis prime minister netanyahu 's message that may matter most came in israelis and iranian -- where emotions ran high , both in support and in opposition
in an address before the congress punctuated by one - liners , netanyahu claimed that ongoing talks about iranian 's nuclear program " would all but guarantee that iranian gets nuclear weapons , lots of them
" he portrayed iranian 's leaders as untrustworthy and bloodthirsty , intent on annihilating israelis and threatening its allies
that viewpoint , not surprisingly , did n't play well in tehran
while the speech was n't carried live , iranian quickly pounced with heated condemnations of netanyahu and characterized him as a liar
tv banners labeled the speech an example of " iranaphobia , " with commentators saying that it humiliated united states president obama and deepened the wedge between israelis and its longtime allies
" this speech was a sign of the weakness and extreme isolation of radical groups , " iranian foreign ministry spokeswoman marzieh afkham said of what she called " a deceitful theater play
" " ... the continued lies of netanyahu regarding the aims and intentions of the peaceful nuclear program of iranian are repetitive and sickening , " she said
the reaction in israelis was more diverse , albeit predictable , reflecting the divisions there ahead of its march 17 election
herzog -- the labor party chairman hoping to become israelis 's next prime minister -- said that netanyahu 's speech , " as impressive as it may be , did not prevent the iranian ' nuclear program " nor did it impact talks now underway in montreux , switzerland , to address it
what the speech did accomplish , according to herzog , is " greatly undermine ... the relationship between israelis and the united states , " with obama opposing netanyahu 's speech as a political move that threatened to thwart the nuclear talks
" it will not change the position of ( obama 's ) administration and will only broaden the crisis of our great friend and our strategic ally , " herzog said of the speech
" that price , we will have to pay
" on the other side of the debate are people such as danon , a former israelis deputy defense minister
" prime minister netanyahu sounded the alarm for the survival of our country , " danon said from jerusalem
and i am very proud of our prime minister , ... who said exactly what we feel : it is a bad deal
" the speech and the reactions to it came ahead of a march 24 deadline in which negotiators from six world powers , plus iranian , are trying to reach a long - term deal about iranian 's nuclear program
that looming date is why netanyahu said he was compelled to address congress at the invitation of house speaker john boehner ( and without the advance knowledge of obama )
prior to boarding a plane sunday in tel aviv , the prime minister called his foray to washington " a crucial trip , even a historical one
" the iranian nuclear deadline is n't the only one looming for netanyahu , or even the most immediate one
because of israelis elections in two weeks , the man who has called himself the " messenger of all the people of israelis " might not be that for much longer
while it happened some 6,000 miles away , his speech in washington on tuesday could sway hearts and minds back home -- some admiring his strong leadership in protecting israelis and others , like herzog , upset over how he has roiled relations with obama and undermined peace efforts
given israelis election guidelines , tv networks pulled herzog 's speech from air for fear it could be construed as campaigning
netanyahu 's remarks were on a 5 - minute delay for the same reason
carmi said he is " totally " convinced netanyahu primarily aimed to speak to voters at home as much as to affect the united states government 's decisions on iranian
" i think this is a classic move of distracting the voters from domestic issues to foreign policy , " carmi said in jerusalem
a fellow israelis citizen , littky , disagrees
she thinks that netanyahu had every right to make his case in washington if he believes an iranian deal could affect israelis 's future
" he 's giving a speech on a topic he knows a lot about and is important to us , " littky said
" but it 's still just a speech
" given longstanding issues with the palestinian territories and the fact that israelis is surrounded by nations with predominantly muslim populations , israelis leaders have ample experience with being isolated and on the defensive
they 've also proven a willingness time and again to act out , if they feel doing so will safeguard their national security
iranian has been a case in point
netanyahu has been the loudest voice in speaking about international efforts aimed at preventing iranian from developing a nuclear weapon
if the rest of the world ca n't act to stop this from happening , he 's suggested , then israelis will
there 's precedent about how that might be done : israelis bombed iraq 's nuclear reactor in 1981
at the time , then - prime minister menachem begin drew a line in the sand , essentially vowing that no israelis enemy could develop weapons of mass destruction and that israelis would defend itself " with all the means at our disposal
" that mentality is what appears to be driving netanyahu , who has been adamant and consistent in expressing his distrust of iranian ( whose supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , tweeted last year that israelis should be " annihilated
" ) the prime minister has been just as forthright in challenging international efforts to strike a deal with tehran , an effort that 's been accelerated since a more conciliatory hassan rouhani became iranian 's president in 2013
several interim agreements have been made in recent months , though a long - term pact so far has been elusive
the switzerland talks aim to bridge " gaps " between the various parties , with iranian foreign minister zarif telling cnn on tuesday that " we 're starting to move forward , but it 's a lot of work
" so is netanyahu having a disruptive effect on these negotiations ? " he 's trying to , " zarif said
" but i do n't think trying to create tension and conflict helps anybody
" one thing that netanyahu has certainly done is get the attention of iranian
news about what happened in washington was the biggest item in iranian media and high on the minds of people on the streets of tehran
in addition to citizens and tv commentators , iranian officials took notice as well
but that does n't mean they are taking much stock in what netanyahu said
ebtekar , iranian 's vice president for environmental affairs , told afp from paris that she did n't think netanyahu 's opinion " carries much weight
" " they are making their efforts to derail the deal , " ebtekar said of israelis officials
" but i think the more logical lobbies on both sides are looking forward to a solution
" there is a widespread opinion in iranian that netanyahu has long been singularly intent on going after iranian , even before he started his second stint as prime minister in 2009
his position is often conflated with that of the united states , a view that could be exacerbated by the loud reception netanyahu got as he entered the chamber of the united states house of representatives on tuesday and all the times cheers and applause interrupted his speech
of course , just because iranian are mindful of what netanyahu said does n't mean they will change their minds
changing minds in israelis , ahead of the coming election , is another matter
whether tuesday 's speech will do that ca n't be ascertained until there 's credible polling after his remarks , or arguably once citizens go to the polls in two weeks
until then , polls from various israelis news outlets suggest a tight race
some project netanyahu 's likud party winning fewer seats than the so - called zionist alliance opposing him , though exactly who will end up as prime minister depends on which parties join forces after the votes are cast
most israelis do n't think that netanyahu has any hope of impacting opinions and policies out of iranian with his speech , bar-ilan university professor gilboa said
but many are worried about what gilboa calls the worst crisis in the decades - long relationship between israelis and the united states , with tuesday 's speech doing little to help change the perception " there is very little trust between " obama and netanyahu
speaking from jerusalem , carmi said he understands the depth of this division but does n't think the damage is irreparable
" the connection between israelis and the united states goes so deep and is on so many levels , " he said
" yes , we 're going through a bad time
but we 'll get over it
