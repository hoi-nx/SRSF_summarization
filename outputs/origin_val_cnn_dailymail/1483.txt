the former manchester united captain joined presenter gary lineker , former adversary shearer and ian wright in the old trafford studio to provide his views on the quarter - final clash

keane ( left ) , shearer ( centre ) and ian wright ( right ) were working for the bbc as pundits on monday gary lineker addresses the punditry trio during some of their heated pre-match discussion at old trafford keane was famously red carded for lashing out at shearer with a punch at st james ' park in 2001 - but the pair seemed happy enough to sit next to each other in the studio on monday
he also joked that he hated ian wright , who played for arsenal while the pair were both players and there were moments that their debate became heated at old trafford
in keane 's book the second half , he includes shearer , on a list with alf-inge haaland , rob lee , david batty and patrick vieira in as players ' at the back of my mind '
keane made it clear that although he regularly came across shearer while working as a tv pundit , there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other
ian wright talked briefly about the rivalry and hatred between arsenal and manchester united shearer rows with keane during their playing careers back in 2001 - and they were back together for tv last year , ian wright claimed in a video on his youtube channel that keane was the best tv pundit around at the moment
' keane is the best , ' the former arsenal striker said
' he 's got credibility and he 's another one who does n't care what anyone thinks
what he says is most probably right but it 's brutally honest and some people do n't like that
