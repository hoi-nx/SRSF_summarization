a man who survived a suicide leap from the golden gate bridge has told in detail how he was saved by a sea lion which kept him afloat until the coastguard arrived
kevin hines is now a global speaker on mental health issues and shared his remarkable story at a suicide prevention conference in new south wales , australian
aged just 21 , he was suffering from bipolar disorder and psychosis when he jumped from the san francisco landmark on a chilly september day in 2000
but immediately after the four - second fall there was another , more incredible miracle
he told the abc : ' i guess you would call it a mammal began swimming beneath me and i 'm thinking , " oh man , a shark is about to devour me "
' i was on a show for suicide prevention and i mentioned that i thought there was this shark on this show and a man wrote into the show and he said , " kevin hines , i 'm so very glad you 're alive , i was less than two feet away from you when you jumped "
' he said : " it haunted me until this day ; it was no shark , it was a sea lion and the people above looking down believed it to be keeping you afloat until the coast guard brought a ride behind you
" ' landmark : by a stroke of luck , a witness saw mr kevin hines jump from the vast bridge and alerted the coastguard conference : mr kevin hines spoke at the new south wales police force mental health intervention team conference in sydney , australian
the force attended nearly 50,000 mental health incidents last year with temperatures in the bay 's waters as low as 12c , mr kevin hines could have died of hypothermia had a witness not seen him jump and raised the alarm
mr kevin hines said he never intended to tell his story because he was ' embarrassed ' , but changed his mind after a life - affirming talk to 120 students , many of whom had suicidal thoughts
now he has written a book about his experience , cracked , not broken , and appears at conferences all over the world
with medication and professional help he has managed to reduce his symptoms , including the voices in his head which told him to jump on that day 14 and a half years ago
' the message is very very simple , ' he told abc
' you do n't have to die this way
' mr kevin hines says he is one of just 34 survivors of falls from the golden gate bridge , which rises high above the san francisco bay , and the only one to become a mental health campaigner
population : sea lions basking on piers in san francisco
mr kevin hines said the theory was perfectly plausible he spoke yesterday as part of the nsw police force mental health intervention team conference in sydney
the force attended almost 50,000 mental health incidents in 2014 alone , and set up to conference to discuss how the often - misunderstood issue should be tackled
mr kevin hines had talked about being saved by a sea lion before , including in a 2013 blog post
' there are a large number of reporters and speculators who have claimed it was really a seal , and even those who have claimed that there was nothing but me in that water , ' he wrote
' however , i know that it was a sea lion and it is not a statistic anomaly
marine animals ( dolphins , sea lions ) and other creatures have helped save humans and other animals from dangerous situations all over the world
' i say believe it or do nât , that âs completely up to you
i know the truth , and in this case and that is all that matters
