brazil came from behind to see off france in a friendly at the france , with goals from chelsea midfielder oscar , barcelona forward neymar , and wolfsburg defensive midfielder luis gustavo
france had taken the lead through a raphael varane header , and looked to be in total control before oscar 's well - worked equaliser , but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half , and could have scored more as the game wore on
neymar who already had 42 goals for his country before this game , made it 43 , firing past mandanda from an angle which will have disappointed the french keeper , before luis gustavo was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner
