it 's not great to watch but you have to say they are winning games
' not finishing fourth is not good , but to me not challenging for the league is not good enough
but we have to give him time
they ca n't keep on sacking managers
' scholes , who was speaking on bt sport 's fletch and sav show , said united must be patient with the dutchman but stressed that questions would have to be asked if the club were not challenging for the title next season
' maybe the coach does need time to settle in too , but the one thing he has got is ( ryan giggs , united âs assistant manager ) to help him settle and get him used to what to expect from liverpool and from united , ' he said
' i can probably forgive him for this season - he 's brought new players and they need time to settle in and so does he
but this time next year if they are not challenging for the league then something is wrong
