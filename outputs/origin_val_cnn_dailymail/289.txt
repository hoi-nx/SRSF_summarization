sport england 's top football clubs , all out of the champions league before the quarter - finals , are concerned their chances of signing the next generation of stars are being hampered by the fa âs new regulations governing agents
the rules , which come into force next month after fifa passed the buck on managing the middle men to national associations , include a ban on agents earning money for representing players under 18 years old
as a result , clubs fear there will no longer be a level playing field in the global hunt for young talent because the players â representatives will want them to sign for teams in countries where the agents â code is far more relaxed

after the fallout from sport england players â bad behaviour on a land rover promotional day during the 2011 world cup in new zealand , it makes sense that none of the sport england backers have been given sponsorship days with the squad during the 2015 tournament
however , the rfu claim the team have behaved â impeccably â on sponsorship duty since stuart lancaster took charge in 2012
the rfu claim sport england have behaved â impeccably â on sponsorship duty since stuart lancaster took charge uk sport spent Â£ 46,272 on a survey by research company comres â reassuring â the organisation their no - compromise approach to funding only olympic medal contenders is overwhelmingly the right one
as predicted , the only real change is that participation numbers will now be taken into consideration in judging sports with equal medal chances
so basketball , whose loss of backing from uk sport led to enough criticism of the no - compromise strategy for the survey to be commissioned , will continue to rely on special case hand - outs from sport england to afford to participate in elite competition
at a time when the ecb need to get their pr act together , head of selectors james whitaker chose not to front a print - media briefing when announcing the england test squad for the west indies
this meant when james whitaker , a hapless public performer , got in an embarrassing tangle with radio 5 live âs pat murphy over kevin pietersen and his possible sport england return , he did not have the press conference to redress the mixed messages coming out of the ecb over what kevin pietersen has been promised â which is nothing

in fact asa ceo adam paker even welcomed â sport england âs continued investment â
the sport realises the cuts could have been more drastic and the lost cash will at least stay in the sport as swimming pool operators , working with asa , have been charged with making venues more customer - friendly

instead sepp blatter only wants the microphone to address congress as fifa president
meanwhile , there have been a flurry of national association football chiefs from around the globe coming into zurich for audiences with sepp blatter , which fifa somehow claim is â business as usual â rather than electioneering
