newcastle united owner mike ashley has admitted his failure to invest in the squad in january has left them desperately short of cover as they prepare to face arsenal with just 13 senior players
head coach john carver appeared for thursday 's pre-match press conference with a 4 - 4 - 2 line - up of players unavailable to him
it read : rob elliot ( thigh ) ; paul dummett ( knee ) , fabricio coloccini ( suspended ) , steven taylor ( achilles ) massadio haidara ( knee ) ; rolando aarons ( hamstring ) , cheick tiote ( knee ) , mehdi abeid ( thigh ) , siem de jong ( lung ) ; papiss cisse ( suspended ) , facundo ferreyra ( back )
john carver revealed that mike ashley regrets not investing in the squad in the january transfer window the newcastle united owner did n't invest in january despite sanctioning the sale of davide santon and john carver says he has been left in a difficult position after newcastle united 's hierarchy â mike ashley and managing director lee â decided to allow defenders mapou yanga-mbiwa and davide santon to leave the club in january without bringing in replacements
' the fact that lee and mike ashley have acknowledged that ( we are paying the price for not strengthening the squad ) does n't make me feel better , but at least people understand that 's what has happened , ' said john carver , whose side have won just one in six since the close of the window as he bids to win the job on a permanent basis
' now whether it was me or alan pardew , if he was still here , that would be the same situation
mike williamson and daryl janmaat ( centre right ) are the likely pairing for the upcoming arsenal match captain fabricio coloccini ( left ) was sent off for a reckless lunge and will miss the next three games ' i have got to deal with that situation and i will
what i wo n't do is give up on it , i wo n't think , ' well , i 've got all those people out , that 's it , that 's me done , i 'm not going to get this job '
' and john carver says the board have already made assurances of significant investment in the summer
' the squad needs to be stronger and they have acknowledged that to me - they know they have to invest , ' he said
' i have been part of it in the last few weeks and there are things in place
that 's from the top
they 've got to do something about it , and they know that
' mapou yanga-mbiwa ( right ) is someone newcastle united could do with but he was sold to roma in january
