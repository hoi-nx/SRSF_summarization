if nottingham forest fans were sceptical when freedman was announced as pearce 's successor last month then they will be pleasantly surprised now
saturday 's impressive comeback against high - flying middlesbrough made it six wins in eight championship games under the scot and 19 points from a possible 24
nottingham forest have reignited their season in some style , scoring 22 goals under their new manager at an average of nearly three per game - and all that with 15 - goal top scorer britt assombalonga having been ruled out for a year with a knee injury two matches in to freedman 's reign
nottingham forest manager freedman has led his side to an excellent run of form since taking over gardner ( left ) celebrates his goal for nottingham forest against middlesbrough with jamaal lascelles blackstock ( right ) accepts the plaudits from michail antonio as nottingham forest made it 19 points from 24 bolton fans must be wondering where this freedman was hiding during his two years at the club
widely considered one of the best young british managers around before he left crystal palace for bolton , freedman departed lancashire in october with his managerial reputation tarnished
watching bolton play in freedman âs final few months - and in truth for the majority of his time at the club - was an uninspiring experience
freedman the self - assured crystal palace manager became freedman the big - headed bolton boss - blind to his team 's failings and unwilling to change his methods
freedman was widely considered one of the best young british managers around before he left crystal palace his spell with bolton was more difficult but he is using a similar system at nottingham forest with good results but in reality the character of the man has not changed
there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance and success is the litmus test
he will have learned lessons though from his testing experience at bolton - he has to have done if he harbours any hopes of a long and prosperous managerial career - which he does
despite the goal glut , freedman 's system - 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 - has not changed from his time at bolton but nottingham forest 's players are clearly responding better
his habit of tinkering with his line - up regardless of the previous result frustrated bolton fans but appears to have galvanised a nottingham forest squad where several players were left on the fringes under pearce
gardner blasts in his goal against middlesbrough at the city ground on saturday in the championship blackstock ( left ) finishes high into the net on saturday afternoon as nottingham forest beat the in - form visitors we can only guess what a manager does aside from his team selection and media comments but sometimes in football a manager and a club just click and sometimes , as with freedman and bolton , they do not
that being said , things clicked at bolton in freedman 's first season in charge for a short while , and sceptics will wonder if this is just a honeymoon period he is enjoying at nottingham forest
a brilliant run of form in early 2013 almost saw bolton sneak in to the play - offs and there are parallels with how he has started at nottingham forest - though that run was not as instantaneous as this one
freedman 's habit of tinkering with his line - up appears to have galvanised the nottingham forest squad several players were left on the fringes of the squad under pearce 's leadership but that 's changed freedman makes an appeal for a decision on the touchline during his time with bolton back in may forest owner fawaz al-hasawi has admitted that freedman 's future will be assessed at the end of the season but denied claims the scot 's contract was only for three months
either way , the 18 games he had ahead of him when he took charge have always felt like an audition , a chance to build for next season
keep up this form though and , with 10 games to play , nottingham forest fans might soon start dreaming of a return to the top flight after a 16 - year absence
having been 12th and 13 points off the play - offs when pearce left , they are now ninth and nine points off
the safe money is still on nottingham forest missing out on the top six but having lost momentum at bolton in the spring of 2013 , never to get it back , freedman will be desperate to keep this going
jamaal lascelles is already departing this summer for newcastle united but nottingham forest could get promoted karl darlow is also leaving - and nottingham forest ca n't afford to be in the championship for much longer with Â£ 22.9million losses for last season recently announced , the forced sales of karl darlow and jamaal lascelles last summer and having been under a transfer embargo earlier in the season it would appear nottingham forest can not afford to be in the championship for much longer
their kuwaiti owners came in with the target of premier league football nearly three years ago and , five managerial departures later , they needed to get this one right
time will tell if this is merely a honeymoon period for freedman and nottingham forest but it 's a case of so far , so good
owner fawaz al-hasawi has gone through five managerial departures since taking over three years ago good week for ... barnsley
three wins in three games under new manager lee johnson - the latest coming against walsall - have propelled the tykes right in to play - off contention in league one
the third tier is so tight - just nine points separate 14 clubs from sixth to 19th - that barnsley have managed to leap 12 places up to seventh in the space of just three weeks
bad week for ... hartlepool
ronnie moore 's side conceded a last - minute winner against burton albion to stay firmly rooted at the bottom off the football league
a point for cheltenham against mansfield has stretched the gap to league two safety to eight points with just 11 matches remaining
hartlepool are firmly rooted at the bottom off the football league and are eight points from safety talent scout : harry toffolo ( swindon town , on loan from norwich city ) there 's no shortage of promising youngsters at the county ground and the latest to hit the headlines is 19 - year - old england youth international left back harry toffolo
given freedom to attack from wing back in mark cooper 's 3 - 5 - 2 system , harry toffolo - who was part of the norwich city â fa youth cup - winning side two years ago - scored the robins ' third in their 3 - 0 win over notts county on saturday
