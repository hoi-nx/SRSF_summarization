lafferty hailed northern ireland boss o'neill as the best manager he has played for after yet another match - winning performance at windsor park
in recent months lafferty has been transformed from an infuriatingly erratic performer to the spearhead of his country 's unlikely push for a place at euro 2016
he netted both his side 's goals in sunday 's 2 - 1 win over finland , a sweetly - hit volley and a deft header , taking northern ireland to 12 points from a possible 15 and his scoring tally to five in as many qualifiers
lafferty hailed northern ireland boss o'neill as the best manager he has played for lafferty netted both northern ireland 's goals in sunday 's 2 - 1 win over finland in belfast it is all a far cry from o'neill 's first campaign , where lafferty contributed more red cards ( one ) than goals ( zero )
and the 27 - year - old , currently on loan at rizespor from norwich , knows who to thank
' the last campaign i let everyone down , but o'neill had a word with me and it really hit home
i 'm probably glad he did that , ' said the man who now occupies second place on northern ireland 's scoring charts with 14
' o'neill is the best manager i 've played under and he gets the best from me and pulls me to one side before every game
what he says inspires me and gets me up for the games
i 'm buzzing playing for him
' lafferty has been named man - of - the - match in all four northern irish wins , away in hungary and greece and at home against the faroe islands and finland
but while he grows increasingly comfortable with being the side 's headline grabber , he is equally keen to share the plaudits
northern ireland manager o'neill ( left ) and corey evans applaud the home support after the win o'neill has seen northern ireland take 12 points from a possible 15 during qualifying in group f ' i do n't like calling myself a hero , i think all the boys were heroes out there , ' he said
' there could have been five or six players who deserved to be man of the match in the game
' i thought jamie ward , for example , was superb
i scored two goals which is brilliant for me personally , but if i do n't score another goal in the campaign and we qualify i 'll be happy enough
' a place in france next summer would be a remarkable achievement for a side who have never reached a european championship before , last made the world cup finals in 1986 and placed fifth in their 2014 group
but belief is starting to turn to expectation before the players ' eyes
' we ca n't get ahead of ourselves but if we keep playing like we are now , it would be a disappointment if we did n't get there , ' he said
we still have five games to go and everyone is beating everyone
' the next game in june is going to be massive for us against romania because it 's a top of the table clash
