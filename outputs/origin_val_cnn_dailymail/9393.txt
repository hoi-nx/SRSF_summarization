the happiest year of our life begins when we turn 34 because it 's when we start ticking off boxes such as tying the knot , having children and making strides in a chosen career , according to a survey
a study of 2,000 over- 40s asked people to reflect on their levels of happiness through different stages of life and compiled the key factors for each decade
results showed age 34 was the happiest year for most people on average
a study of 2,000 over- 40s asked people to reflect on their levels of happiness through different stages of life and found 34 was the age when people were at their happiest in every aspect of their lives the study also found it is the age when we are most comfortable in ourselves , earn enough money to get on the property ladder , meet monthly payments with confidence and start to enjoy the finer things in life
meanwhile , those who thought their 20s were the happiest cited the freedom , social life and career progression they enjoyed in that decade
those who chose a year in their 40s as their happiest enjoyed watching the children grow up and getting a bigger home , the study by home security specialists yale found
people who chose their 50s said work winding down , the children leaving home , paying off the mortgage and getting a new start after a divorce as their happy factors
