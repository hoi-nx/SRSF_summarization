snoop , aka calvin cordozar broadus jr , brought the issue up after he took the stage in austin , texas , on friday as south by southwest music 's 2015 keynote speaker
the 43 - year - old said reaganomics prompted a shift away from football and fun to guns and drugs
the plot will center ' on a family whose seemingly idyllic life is turned upside down by the collision of their community and american politics ' , deadline reported
the hip - hop legend said reaganomics was ' designed ' to make things tough in the inner - city , the daily beast reported
snoop said : ' when reaganomics kicked in , certain things were taken away , after - school programs and things of that nature
' guns and drugs were shipped into the neighborhood
' so it was a shift of having fun and playing football to selling drugs and shooting at each other
' to me it was a system that was designed , because when the reaganomics era began , that 's when this began
' he began his remarks by speaking about what life was like before the reaganomics era began
snoop said : ' early in the ' 70s and toward the latter part of the ' 70s everything was beautiful because we had ways to have fun and communicate , and those who were underprivileged , the low economic side of life , the government would provide for us , which helped us get by
' it was a society and we all needed it and we all had it and we all helped each other
' later on friday , snoop posted a yakit video that was created of himself speaking to reagan about the allegation on instagram .
