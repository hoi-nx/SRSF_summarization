the yak is back and so is the question that used to annoy him but now just brings a smile
age , for the striker who scored more premier league goals than cristiano ronaldo and fernando torres , has always been more than a number
that is possibly because david moyes once joked yakubu was a â nigerian 25 â
and because steve mcclaren claimed the striker told him he was 25 when he signed for middlesbrough 10 years ago
reading striker yakubu insists he has never been concerned with the questions marks over his age so , how old is he ? the profiles say 32 ; the sceptics are ruder
the big man among reading âs big dreamers says he âs heard it all before
â it was always like this , â he says
â but it does not bother me
kanu has had it as well
' i just laugh about it â people joke and that is it
if i was lying i do nât think i would be playing now
â thankfully for reading and the fa cup , the jibes have not got the better of him
yakubu scored the goal that saw off derby in the fifth round to set up the tie against bradford , guaranteeing at least one side from outside the premier league will be at wembley in the semi-finals
for the neutrals , the hope is that bradford can trip up another bigger club
for yakubu , there is the hope that he can make it to wembley for the first time after a mangled achilles tendon kept him out of everton âs 2009 final defeat against chelsea
the nigerian striker scores reading 's second goal during the fa cup fifth round defeat against derby saturday ( kick - off 12.45pm )

if he does , it will complete a quite surreal journey that spans almost three years since he left blackburn â ending 10 seasons in english â following relegation to the championship
his absence has seen him scream at confused china footballers and gain a sweaty taste of football in qatar
â no regrets , â as yakubu says
and yet there were times in china , at guangzhou r&f in the days before sven rocked up , where he quite literally had no idea what was going on
â when i was there ( after leaving blackburn ) , we had a brazilian coach ( sergio farias ) and he spoke in portuguese , â yakubu says
â a guy that speaks english , he had to translate into english and then another guy had to translate from portuguese to china
the manager is supposed to speak for like five minutes but we are there for nine minutes
yakubu , seen here celebrating a goal against manchester city in 2004 , scored 43 goals for portsmouth yakubu made sure reading reached the fa cup quarter - finals with this goal against the rams yakubu felt he was away from english football for too long and jumped at the chance to return â it âs so difficult to speak with your team - mates
you do nât know how to tell him to pass
you just scream at him and when you scream , he knows that he has to give you the ball
â when you want to go shopping or to a restaurant , you have to have it written in your phone in china and you have to show it
everywhere you go , you have to take your phone and show it to the taxi driver
â but when sven came in , it was great to work with him again
i worked with him at leicester city
he is always really calm
he just wants you to enjoy the game
yakubu has scored more premier league goals than cristiano ronaldo ( above ) and fernando torres the frontman also scored 35 goals in 103 games for middlesbrough between 2005 and 2007 â sometimes when i played two or three games and did nât score , he never said to me , â you did nât score â
he âd just walk towards me and say , smiling : â it âs been a while since you scored â
â after 18 months in china , yakubu wound up at al rayyan in qatar last year
he is confident that despite having to train in the middle of the night , they can host a good world cup
â i had a good offer in qatar , â he says
â it was another experience so no regrets
believe me , they can get a good world cup there
but when it is hot , it is hot
we had to train at 9.30pm in summer
you finish training at about 12 and then go home at 12.30am and then bed at about 4am
you have to stay home all day because it is really , really hot
you ca nât train when it âs 50 degrees , it is too much
â the 32 - year - old had offers from american , china and qatar ahead of his move to reading he adds : â in winter it is good , we can train at 4pm
we played matches at 7.30pm or 8pm and they have to stop for water breaks once or twice
â on deadline day last month he came back to the country where he first arrived in 2003 , when harry redknapp took a punt on a striker playing in israel
â even when you play the big teams , harry redknapp makes you believe , â he says
â he âll say , â the defence is not good
come on , just kill him â
if you âre scared , like you âre going to play against sol campbell , he âd say , â sol campbell ? he âs s * * *
â the memories of his first english stint make him happy
now his hope is to finally reach wembley on his second chapter
â every player wants that , â he says
you âre never too old to dream
