in the spotlight : qi is said by its developers to be the most widely - used wireless charging type , and can be used in 3,000 public locations globally starting out : one technology industry analyst said it was a ' very early time in the furniture business to blend wireless technology ' menno treffers , chairman of the wireless power consortium - which developed qi - said the new collection shows customers ' the beauty and simplicity of wireless charging '
the most common type of wireless charging is known as inductive charging , which works on a well - known but rarely - used principle most often seen in electric toothbrushes
it was discovered by british scientist michael faraday in 1831
mobile phones are using a more advanced version of the technology , which can operate over centimetres , rather than millimetres
the docking station has a coil within the charger , which generates an electrical field around the device
when a suitable mobile phone is placed next to or on top of the station , a coil within the battery resonates with the primary field
it then takes power from the magnetic field and converts and stores it back as electrical energy
he added : â we applaud ikea for its unmatched insight and their unique passion for making wireless charging affordable and simple for consumers
â two months ago ikea - which employs 147,000 people worldwide - reported annual profits of â¬ 3.3billion ( Â£ 2.4billion ) for 2014 , unchanged from the year before
one of the designers of the home spot range , david wahl , said : â we have created smart wireless solutions so you do nât need to see the cables anymore
â many products can be charged at the same time , but you still have a beautiful wireless home
â technology industry analyst jeff kagan said it was a â very early time in the furniture business to blend wireless technology â
he told agence france-presse : â i expect every other furniture maker to jump on this same bandwagon
