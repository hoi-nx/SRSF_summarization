utah lawmakers have passed a bill that would make it the only state to allow firing squads for carrying out a death penalty if there is a shortage of execution drugs - some even claim the firing squad death is more humane
the passage of the bill by the state senate on tuesday comes as states struggle to obtain lethal injection drugs amid a nationwide shortage
the bill 's sponsor , paul ray rep. paul ray of clearfield , touted the measure as being a more humane form of execution
paul ray argued that a team of trained marksmen is faster and more humane than the drawn - out deaths that have occurred in botched lethal injections

firing squad executions are usually executed by five or so police officers with .30 - caliber winchester rifles in rapid succession aimed at the chest
the prisoner is then hooded and over their heart is placed a small circular target
in one of the rifles is a blank bullet so each gunman can believe they were not the one who fired a fatal shot

utah american civil liberties union representative anna brower said the organization is still holding out hope that gary herbert will not sign the bill
the legislation would make utah ' look backwards and backwoods , ' she said
the measure narrowly passed the house in february , where additional lawmakers had to be called in to break a tie vote
but it made it through the state senate on an 18 - 10 vote with no debate on tuesday
four paul ray joined democrats in opposing the bill
salt lake city democrat gene davis was the only one to speak
he said he was voting against the bill because it ' only puts another alternative on the table ' instead of doing away with executions altogether
paul ray said he did n't expect much debate on the proposal because it seemed many lawmakers had made up their mind about the idea from the start
more humane ? : paul ray paul ray says the aim of his firing squad bill is to give utah an option as states struggle to obtain lethal injection drugs amid a nationwide shortage and is actually more humane a few were persuaded to support it once they learned utah law already calls for the state to revert to the firing squad if a court ever declares lethal injection unconstitutional , he said
