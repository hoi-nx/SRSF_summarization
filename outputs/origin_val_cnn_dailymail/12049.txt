as the firm explained : â there is no bloatware , no hooks to carriers , and no leaky data
â it puts privacy in the hands of you and your [ business ] , without any sacrifices
â for the blackphone 2 , this software has been upgraded to version 1.1 , designed to separate work apps from personal ones through the use of multiple profiles on the same device
if the phone is locked , a business can remotely lock and wipe just the enterprise profile while letting the owner take control of the private profile
internet access is carried out through a virtual private network ( vpn ) that sends and receives data in a way designed to keep it hidden

â public awareness of the erosion of privacy has never been higher , â zimmermann , co-founder of silent circle told mailonline at this year âs event in barcelona
â there is a rising tide of news reports of the catastrophic loss of privacy , take sony pictures or the gemalto hack of sim keys in recent weeks
there are almost daily incidents of company âs who âve had their company data leaked
â never before have people been aware of the excesses of pervasive surveillance from major governments

â a lot of android phones are tied into google who want to learn a lot about what you do
â so there are a lot of things that you do that help them track your behaviours , but on the other hand they give you features for that
â or take another example , facebook
people love the features on facebook â but people give up their privacy in order to benefit from the features
that âs built into facebook âs business model
if you âre not paying for the product , you are the product
â although the company touts the benefits of the device there is the possibility handsets such as blackphone will be used by criminals to hide their activity
addressing these concerns , mr zimmermann said : â bonnie and clyde , the famous bank robbers , almost a hundred years ago , revolutionised bank robbery by using cars to get away from the scene of the crime
â police floated the idea that cars should be required to have smaller petrol tanks
any new technology can be used by criminals to make their criminal activity work better for them
â blackphone âs managing director , toby weir-jones told mailonline : â the availability of a tool does not create the intent for mischief
' if you âre a bad guy , the fact [ blackphone ] is making cryptography usable does nât mean you âre going to take that a step further ; you 're not going to become bad because of that knowledge either
