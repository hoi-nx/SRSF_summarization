he confirmed dr magnanti told him she was a prostitute â but said details of her books were exaggerated or deliberately altered to protect individuals she knew
â i have read the books and i âm familiar with n , who is based on me , â he said
â i know n is an amalgam of characters and that there are things the character said that i never said and events he attended that i was at
' there are also things i said and places where i was that are attributed to other people
â he said that magnanti did confess to him that she was a prostitute and he is astonished at the suggestion that she was not
â she told me she was a prostitute and i believe that , â nick says
â of course , i have no proof one way or another , because obviously i was nât there when she did it and i never lived with her
' but she did nât throw money around , not that i could see â she was nât exactly turning up at the pub in a bentley
â nick , who has had no contact with magnanti for six years , said he believes the books are fiction with a basis in reality
â characters in the book are based on people
there is truth in it , but where the line is of who is real , who is not , i ca nât tell you
time , place and context are all mixed up
â n is said to have had a threesome , but i always say if i was supposed to have had half as much fun as n , it would be great
