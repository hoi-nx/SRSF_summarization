photographer souvik kundu , 35 , from mumbai witnessed the tigress nuzzling the spotted deer fawn like one of her cubs the joyful cat was seen jumping next to the deer , patting it and even carrying it in her mouth like a cub the expectation among the crowd was that the feline would swiftly kill the deer and devour it souvik kundu , 35 , from mumbai entitled photographs of the event , the benevolent queen , due to the tiger 's gentle nature
he added : ' i 'm still not sure why the tigress did not prey on the little deer when the chance presented and acted so unnaturally
' one probable explanation is the tigress was in search for a mate and her urge for motherhood temporarily overcame predatory instinct
play with me ! the tigress instead just wants to play with the baby deer and kept patting it with its paws souvik kundu said it was possible the tigress confused the fawn with her own offspring ' as a result she had confused the fawn for her own offspring
