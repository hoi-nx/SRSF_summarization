the word ' lunatic ' itself was derived from the latin word for moon ' luna , ' as many were convinced that the celestial body could cause disease and strange behaviour
and it 's a theory that persists today , with many people believing that a full moon is more likely to coincide with hectic periods in hospitals or in birth wards
but dr jean-luc margot , a professor of planetary astronomy at the university of california , has carried out a study that proves that the concept is essentially rubbish
a researcher from the university of california says that claims the moon causes illnesses are rubbish
dr jean-luc margot said that when life is hectic on the day of a full moon , many people remember the association because it confirms their belief - but they do not remember when nothing in particular happens on such a day his research was carried out to illustrate how intelligent and otherwise reasonable people develop strong beliefs that are not aligned with reality
' the absence of a lunar influence on human affairs has been demonstrated in the areas of automobile accidents , hospital admissions , surgery outcomes , cancer survival rates , menstruation , births , birth complications , depression , violent behaviour , and even criminal activity ' , dr jean-luc margot writes
even though a 40 - year - old ucla study demonstrated that the timing of births does not correlate in any way with the lunar cycle , the belief in a lunar effect has persisted
a full moon is when it is on the opposite side of earth from the sun. this means its entire surface is lit up by the sun , making it especially bright
a new moon is when it is in the same direction as the sun , so its ' far side ' is lit , and it can barely be seen in earth 's sky
on average , the moon is 239,000 miles ( 384,000km ) from earth and takes 27 days , seven hours , 43 minutes and 11.6 seconds to complete one orbit
a 2004 study in a nursing journal , for example , suggested that the full moon influenced the number of hospital admissions in a medical unit in barcelona , spain
but dr jean-luc margot identified multiple flaws in the data collection and analysis of the 2004 research
by re-analysing the data , he showed that the number of admissions was unrelated to the lunar cycle
' the moon is innocent , ' dr jean-luc margot said
dr jean-luc margot cited what scientists refer to as the ' confirmation bias ' - people 's tendency to interpret information in a way that confirms their beliefs and ignore data that contradict them
when life is hectic on the day of a full moon , many people remember the association because it confirms their belief
but hectic days that do not correspond with a full moon are promptly ignored and forgotten because they do not reinforce the belief
the moon is even blamed when things get crazy at hospital emergency rooms ( stock image shown ) or birth wards
' some nurses ascribe the apparent chaos to the moon , but dozens of studies show that the belief is unfounded , ' said dr jean-luc margot , a ucla professor of planetary astronomy dr jean-luc margot said the societal costs of flawed beliefs can be enormous
in just one current example , the recent measles outbreak appears to have been triggered by parents ' questionable beliefs about the safety of the measles vaccine
' vaccines are widely and correctly regarded as one of the greatest public health achievements , yet vaccine - preventable diseases are killing people because of beliefs that are out of step with scientific facts , ' dr jean-luc margot said
a willingness to engage in evidence - based reasoning and admit that one 's beliefs may be incorrect will produce a more accurate view of the world and result in better decision - making , he said
' perhaps we can start by correcting our delusions about the moon , and work from there , ' dr jean-luc margot added
the study was published online by the journal nursing research .
