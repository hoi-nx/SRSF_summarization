an unseasonably warm winter has left parts of alaska 's iditarod trail without snow , exposing grass and gravel and forcing the famous dogsled race to move 225 miles north
opening ceremonies in the iditarod kick off saturday in anchorage
when the race begins monday , mushers will cross the starting line in fairbanks instead of willow , the traditional starting point
it 's the second time in the race 's 43 - year history that the starting point has moved from willow to fairbanks because of weather - related issues , an iditarod spokesperson said
the first time was in 2003
while cities across the northeastern united states have seen record snowfall this winter , alaska received less snow than usual
anchorage collected only 20 inches of snow this season , compared with a seasonal average of 60 inches
race organizers made the unanimous decision in february to move the race after determining that conditions were worse than last year in critical areas , and " therefore not safe enough for the upcoming race , " iditarod chief executive hooley said in a press release
while snow has fallen east of the alaska range over the past couple of weeks , other parts of the trail did not get much or any of it , hooley told cnn affiliate ktva-tv in february
the racing course spans a 1,000 - mile trail across the arctic tundra , ending in nome
the race usually takes 10 days to finish , although dallas seavey finished the race in 2014 in a record time of eight days , 13 hours , four seconds , and 19 minutes
the lack of snow could be attributed to a highly amplified jet stream that brought warm air from the pacific to the region , said meteorologist dave snider with the national weather service in anchorage
" it 's the same weather pattern that brought the east coast such snowy and cold weather this season
alaska was simply on the warmer side of this weather pattern , " he said
warm sea surface temperatures along the alaska coastline are another reason for milder conditions , he added .
