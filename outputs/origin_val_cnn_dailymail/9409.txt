u.s. president obama said on monday that iran should commit to a verifiable freeze of at least 10 years on its nuclear activity for a landmark atomic deal to be reached , but said the odds were still against sealing a final agreement
in an interview with reuters at the white house , obama said that a rift over israeli prime minister netanyahu 's planned speech to congress opposing the iran deal on tuesday was a distraction that would not be ' permanently destructive ' to u.s. israeli ties
but he said there was a ' substantial disagreement ' between his administration and the israeli government over how to achieve their shared goal of preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
he said iran must halt their nuclear work earlier on monday in a speech on monday to the aipac ( aipac ) netanyahu warned that a nuclear deal could threaten israeli 's survival ' if , in fact , iran is willing to agree to double - digit years of keeping their program where it is right now and , in fact , rolling back elements of it that currently exist ... if we 've got that , and we 've got a way of verifying that , there 's no other steps we can take that would give us such assurance that they do n't have a nuclear weapon , ' he said
the u.s. goal is to make sure ' there 's at least a year between us seeing them try to get a nuclear weapon and them actually being able to obtain one , ' obama said
israeli fears that obama 's iran diplomacy , with an end - of - march deadline for a framework nuclear agreement , will still allow its arch - foe to develop an atom bomb
tehran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons
netanyahu has spoken scathingly about a possible deal , saying negotiators appear to have given up on a pledge to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
he says a nuclear - armed iran would pose an existential threat to the jewish state
obama sought to downplay the long - term damage from the row over netanyahu 's speech to congress , saying the rift was not personal and that he would meet the israeli leader again if he wins israeli 's march 17 election
' this is not a personal issue
i think that it is important for every country in its relationship with the u.s. to recognize that the u.s. has a process of making policy , ' obama said
but obama said netanyahu had been wrong before with his opposition to a 2013 interim deal with iran
israeli fears that obama 's iran diplomacy , with an end - of - march deadline for a framework nuclear agreement , will still allow its arch - foe to develop an atom bomb ' netanyahu made all sorts of claims
this was going to be a terrible deal
this was going to result in iran getting 50 billion dollars worth of relief
iran would not abide by the agreement
none of that has come true
' it has turned out that in fact , during this period we 've seen iran not advance its program
in many ways , it 's rolled back elements of its program
' the white house last week denied a report that the u.s. and iran were exploring a possible 10 - year deal that would initially freeze iran 's nuclear program but gradually allow it to increase activities that could enable it to produce nuclear arms in the last years of the agreement
in a speech on monday to the american israel public affairs committee ( aipac ) , the largest u.s. pro-israel lobby , netanyahu again warned that a nuclear deal could threaten israeli 's survival while insisting the u.s. - israeli relationship was ' stronger than ever
' asked about the prospects for a final deal with iran , which has a june 30 deadline , obama said that a key doubt was whether iran would agree to rigorous inspection demands and the low levels of uranium enrichment capability they would have to maintain
' but if they do agree to it , it would be far more effective in controlling their nuclear program than any military action we could take , any military action israeli could take and far more effective than sanctions will be , ' obama said
a comprehensive nuclear deal is seen as crucial to reducing the risk of a wider middle east war , at a time when iran is deeply involved in conflicts in syria and iraq .
