, march of 2015 two women , both , curiously , named " sally kohn , " recline and sip their drinks at they stare at the blue - green water , occasionally checking their addictive mobile devices for new emails , conversing about the third season of " house of cards " and the political mess in washington
they 're both bold progressives and democrats more by default than enthusiasm
the two sallys are debating whether sen. elizabeth warren should respond to the calls from the boston globe and others for her to enter the 2016 race , challenging likely frontrunner hillary clinton
sally " idealistic " kohn desperately and impatiently wants the world to be a fairer and more just place and thinks progress toward that goal could immeasurably be helped by a bold leader articulating and pushing for big ideas at the top of the national and global political hierarchy
this sally kohn is wearing a skimpy bikini
sally " pragmatic " kohn wants the world to be better too , but she 's all - too - aware of how progressive idealists are chewed up , spit out and drowned out by party politics
she is conscious that barack obama was n't even that progressive and knows how much more centrist he became in the first six years of his presidency
this sally kohn is skeptical of how much politics can be changed from the inside as well as how much politics these days can change the world , especially given entrenched partisanship
she is wearing swim trunks , a long - sleeve uv protective t - shirt and two hats
sally ( idealistic ) kohn : elizabeth warren is like the obi-wan kenobi of american politics today -- she 's our only hope
there 's no one else speaking as sharply and powerfully about inequality and economic populism
[ she takes a sip of her piÃ±a colada
] sally ( pragmatic ) kohn : i could n't agree more
which is exactly why we should n't waste warren on a dead - end presidential campaign
[ she gulps her margarita
] sally i. kohn : first of all , you do n't know it 's a dead end
barack obama was the underdog in 2008 and look what happened
plus , warren is much more popular at this point now than he was then
sally p. kohn : yeah , but in the latest cnn democrats primary poll , warren trails hillary clinton by 52 points
sally i. kohn : those are national polls
primaries are run state - by - state
and in a different poll , democrats primary voters in iowa and in new hampshire favored warren over clinton , so ...
sally p. kohn : in fairness , that poll was run by warren backers
and anyway , nationwide 79 % of democrats have a favorable view of clinton
just 37 % have a favorable view of warren
sally i. kohn : because 63 % do n't know her yet
that 's why she needs to run
sally p. kohn : but be honest , the path to her winning is hard to see
sure , barack obama did it once , but do you really think the clinton machine will allow itself to be defeated twice ? sally i. kohn : ah , and that 's reason two why warren should run -- because even if she ca n't win , she will help shape the political debate and push hillary clinton to the left , especially around economic justice issues
sally p. kohn : maybe , but then in four or eight years when warren would really have a shot at the presidency , she 'll be a mitt romney-esque already - ran , not a bright shiny new candidate
sally i. kohn : all the more reason to run now
now is our nation 's moment , crawling out of the economic crisis , still riddled with unprecedented economic inequality , we do n't need elizabeth warren to be president in four years or eight years or 16
sally p. kohn : i agree that warren is transformational and has the bold vision we need right now
and is n't that exactly why she should n't run ? national big money political campaigns are where good ideas go to die
sally i. kohn : maybe elizabeth warren can be the candidate to change all that , the candidate for the people , not the political process -- who even appeals to and unites independent and conservative voters who know the economy is ridiculously rigged for the rich and want government to stop aiding and abetting injustice
[ they both laugh uproariously at the suggestion that politics could ever be about people , not big money
] sally p. kohn : what i will say is that now is definitely the moment for a woman president ! and hillary clinton 's the one with the best shot
plus , for all her coziness with wall street and hawkish foreign policy , she 's still a bajillion times better than any of the republican options
heck , they have congress for a few months and ca n't even govern themselves out of a paper bag
and if hillary clinton might not do as much as we 'd like to fix economic inequality , let 's be clear -- republicans would just make it worse , like they did before
which is what really worries me about warren
there 's a reason they 're called " spoiler candidates
" i do n't want her to spoil the democrats ' chance to elect a woman this election
sally i. kohn : but no , that 's exactly why she has to run -- to make the party stronger , to make hillary clinton less economically centrist and quick on the military trigger
we need a bold progressive candidate we can rally behind in the primaries
and if warren wins , great
her vision also appeals to the broad majority of working people
and if she does n't win the primaries , still great -- we 've sent a clear message to hillary clinton and forced her to be more populist
sally p. kohn : maybe ... or maybe warren runs and wastes all her political capital , making too many compromises to be a viable candidate and losing her pedestal as an irreverent outsider and then being defeated anyway , so she 's diminished in some of the power and leverage she had before , too
she 's a great leader now , right now , as is
the magnifying glass of a national campaign could expose her imperfections or even burn her up in the sun. ... [ she reaches for the suntan lotion
] sally i. kohn : ... or it could magnify her reach and impact
[ she , too , reaches for the suntan lotion
] sally p. kohn : maybe we just see things too differently
[ they both stare down at their drinks and take another sip
] sally p. kohn : hey , my margarita is half - empty
sally i. kohn : oh , my piÃ±a colada is half - full
sally p. kohn : either way , we both need more , eh ?
