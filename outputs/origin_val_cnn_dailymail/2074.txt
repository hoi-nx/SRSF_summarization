it 's an argument that has plagued most households at least once , but now the age - old question of whether toilet paper should sit under or over the roll has finally been solved
how ? by a 124 - year - old patent from 22 december 1891 which clearly illustrates an ' over ' arrangement for toilet paper
writer owen williams discovered the toilet paper patent online , and wasted no time in sharing his new - found information with his 8,000 followers on twitter
the in - depth patent created by new york businessman seth wheeler clearly shows an ' over ' arrangement the patent was created by the inventor of perforated toilet paper sheets , new york business man seth wheeler
seth wheeler , who was also the owner of the albany perforated wrapping sheet company , undoubtedly innovated the way toilet paper is created and used in this way
included in the patent , are seth wheeler 's declarations on his new product : ' be it known that i , seth wheeler , of the city and county of albany , and state of new york , have invented certain new and useful improvements in toilet-paper rolls
' although there 's no specific mention of the ' over ' arrangement of the toilet paper , the diagram is a solid confirmation of the correct use
and it 's not just the over-under toilet paper debate that gets homemakers agitated ; it 's the state of the entire bathroom
other key things to consider ? cleanliness
etiquette expert william hanson said as well as making sure toilet rolls sit ' over ' , other bathroom tidiness is important : â i very much judge a house , and the house owner , by the state of their guest bathroom
â i would question the hygiene of the person 's kitchen if the loo was nât spotless upon arrival
finally , the age - old argument about which way a toilet roll should sit in a bathroom has been resolved â my own facilities for guests are half bathroom , half temple
â there âs no streaky chrome , or chipped wooden loo seats for heaven - knows what germs to fester
â if a guest does nât come out the lavatory and comment on its condition then i feel i have failed as a host ; so many over-worry about their food , spending hours faffing with reproducing some stack , tower or jus they saw in an over-priced nouvelle cuisine joint , when really they should have spent the time having a whizz round with the harpic
