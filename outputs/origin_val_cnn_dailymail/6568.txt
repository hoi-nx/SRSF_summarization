a businessman who was wrongly issued with a Â£ 15,000 phone bill by vodafone only managed to get it cancelled by staging a three - hour sit - in at the firm 's headquarters
edward martin was sent the enormous invoice after the mobile phone company put him on a new tariff , but after eight hours on the phone he was unable to get them to admit their mistake
eventually , he was forced to go and camp outside the multinational firm 's headquarters - and they were so desperate to make him go away that they caved in and cancelled the bill
victory : edward martin managed to get a Â£ 15,000 phone bill cancelled by protesting at vodafone 's head office mr edward martin , 52 , who runs a clothing business in tiverton , devon , said that his troubles started when he was put on a new package and told his bill would be recalculated
vodafone then sent him a series of inflated bills adding up to Â£ 14,949.41 - without explaining why he suddenly had to pay more
' i have been a vodafone customer for 21 years with no trouble , ' he said
' but in december they called me to say they had made a mistake and they would recalculate my bill
' but they never called me back and never let me know in writing what my new tariff was
all they want is for me to pay up but i 'm not going to because they have made a mistake , not me
' i have n't used any more text or data than i did before i went into the exeter store to get a new deal
i really do n't understand what has changed
' proactive : mr edward martin had been unable to resolve the situation by phoning customer services he repeatedly tried to phone the company to discuss the error , but was unable to rectify the situation
' i must have spent eight hours on the phone to them being transferred to india , then johannesburg , then onto egypt and back to south africa , ' mr edward martin said
' on one occasion i waited 27 minutes to speak with someone who told me they would call me back but they never did
that 's just basic disregard for their customers
' the businessman finally decided to take drastic action , and yesterday he drove two hours from his home to the firm 's head office in newbury , berkshire
staff there initially said it would take three days to resolve the problem - but when mr edward martin refused to leave the premises , they dealt with his issue immediately
hq : vodafone 's global headquarters are situated in newbury , berkshire , two hours from mr edward martin 's home he said : ' all seven car parks were full so i parked at the very front of the building , ignoring protestations from the security guys , and marched into reception
' i was directed to the retail shop in the foyer - the shop staff were apparently highly trained in " problem resolution "
' the techie guy i spoke to made calls to various teams and one hour later appeared to tell me it would be sorted on friday
' i said this was unacceptable and i feared they were just giving me the run - around like they 've been doing for the past four months
' i thought nothing would be resolved by friday so i told him i would wait there until then
he told me i could not do that so i sat firmly on a chair and told him to call security
' he disappeared to the office and one hour later the headquarters store assistant manager appeared and told me that the whole bill would be cleared immediately
' about 15 minutes later i was on my way with a letter confirming that my overcharge had been cleared and a copy of my correct contract
' they have apologised and have launched an investigation , but they could have done a lot of damage to other people and businesses
' a vodafone spokesman said that an ' internal communication error ' was to blame for mr edward martin 's enormous bill , and confirmed it has now been wiped clean .
