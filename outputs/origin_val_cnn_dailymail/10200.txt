another motorist witnessed the carnage and immediately turned back to help poor sophie
â witnesses saw hannah speed into maryhill road , with his badly dented car being â driven erratically â before he crashed into a taxi

â both the taxi driver and his passengers noticed he was under the influence of some substance
