next year 's olympic games in rio de janeiro could be a stinker ... because of severe pollution in the city 's filthy waterways
athletes have complained of the stench while practising at the sailing venue in the city , with sailors saying they have had to dodge everything from dead animals and discarded sofas to plastic bags
it is estimated that around 60 % of the city 's sewage is untreated and dumped into the city 's waterways which will flow into venues for sailing , rowing and distance swimming at the olympic games

officials face a race against time to now have it cleaned up for the olympic games next year rubbish : tyres , office seats and televisions are amongst just some of the junk that is washed up in the bay garbage : between approximately 80 and 100 tonnes of garbage are washed into the bay every day , including household waste and raw sewage guanabara bay , one of the iconic locations of rio , is still blighted by sewage , industrial pollution and illegal dumping
several olympic games sailors have complained it is the dirtiest place they have ever trained or competed in
nick thompson , one of britain 's top sailors , said recently : ' water quality is my biggest personal concern
if you are sick during the olympic games , it 's game over
' ahead of next year 's games , he plans to take ' probiotic supplements and fish oil to strengthen the gut ' as he bids to avoid illness
and stephen park , british sailing team 's manager , said recently : ' the sailors are on various supplements to mitigate against it , but we ca n't do anything about the water quality '
it has been estimated that between approximately 80 and 100 tonnes of garbage are washed into the bay every day - but the government only manage to remove around 400 tonnes per month
in february , thousands of dead fish were found floating in the waters of the bay
and in december , a drug - resistant ' super bacteria ' normally found in hospitals was also discovered in the water around the bay
in total , 15 cities share the bay 's shoreline and it is estimated that the waste of eight million people is still being untreated as it flows into the water , producing over 18,000 litres of sewage per second
