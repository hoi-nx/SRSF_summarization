an attempt to emulate denman by winning next season âs hennessy is on the agenda for cheltenham gold cup winner coneygree
the first novice to win the feature race of the festival since captain christy in 1974 was on saturday feted as friends and well - wishers gathered at the oxfordshire stable of trainer mark bradstock and wife sara in the village of letcombe bassett , which once housed five - time cheltenham gold cup hero golden miller
friday âs victory for a small stable of 10 horses was a heart - warming end to a festival dominated by the big guns from britain and ireland
2015 cheltenham gold cup winner coneygree could race at newbury on november 28 nico de boinville kisses the cheltenham gold cup following coneygree 's length and a half victory the eight - year - old , who was ridden by conditional jockey nico de boinville , will not run again this season and sara bradstock , daughter of the late amateur rider , broadcaster and journalist , lord oaksey , believes coneygree âs similarity to denman means a crack at the newbury race on november 28 is feasible challenge
coneygree won the chase at the track last month on his final prep race for the cheltenham gold cup
his family also have history in the race , with older brother carruthers winning the 2011 hennessy
sara said : â we might consider the betfair chase and the king george , for sure
the world is our oyster now but , depending on what the handicapper does , we might try to win the hennessy off top weight
â we know he likes newbury and he seems to have a lot of similarities with denman
â de boinville ( left ) and trainer mark bradstock are all smiles with the 2015 cheltenham gold cup trophy the paul nicholls - trained denman , the 2008 cheltenham gold cup winner , won the hennessy twice in 2007 and 2009
on the latter occasion , he defied a bha handicap mark of 174 when carrying 11st 12lb
chief handicapper phil smith intends rating coneygree 171 , the highest for a novice this century and 1lb higher than given to willie mullins â vautour after his spectacular jlt novices â chase win
meanwhile , hopes of a family double within 24 hours were dashed when heavy ground at uttoxeter prompted carruthers to be withdrawn from the midlands national , which was won by irish raider goonyella
the ap mccoy - ridden 5 - 2 favourite , catching on , fell at the seventh fence
de boinville and coneygree clear a fence on their way to victory at the cheltenham gold cup
