dog owners have been warned that their animals could be at risk from a popular brand of pet food which is at the centre of a multi-million - pound lawsuit
purina beneful is accused of making dogs violently ill , causing seizures , kidney failure , sudden weight loss and even death
distraught pet owners across north america are now suing nestle , the brand âs owner , for $ 5million ( Â£ 3.3million ) over the allegedly unsafe dry dog food - which can also be bought in the uk
he believes it led to his beloved dog 's premature death terrifying ordeal : rex devoured the product in august 2013 and then suddenly started having a seizure the company strongly denies the allegations , calling the lawsuit â baseless â , although thousands of dog owners have complained about the effect of the food on their pets
they claim the dry food product contains toxic chemicals including propylene glycol , which can be used as an anti-freeze , and mycotoxin
all of the customers involved in the class - action lawsuit , which was filed last month in california , are from the us or canada
however , purina beneful is also available in uk - four varieties of the brand âs dry food are listed for sale on amazon.co.uk , and it can also be bought from other leading pet food retailers online
pet owners who are worried about their animals becoming ill as a result of their diet should consult a vet in order to determine whether there is any risk

it is found in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products , but regulations of its use differ between the us and the eu
in october , for example , fireball cinnamon whiskey was pulled from the shelves across european because it contained the substance , as it was in breach of european regulations
however it remained on the shelves in the us
in the us , the chemical is ' generally recognised as safe ' by the food and drug administration , and fireball cinnamon whiskey claims up to 50 grams per kilogram can be used , though it states it uses far less in its drink
popylene glycol is also found in automotive and aircraft anti-freeze , for its ability to lower the freezing point of water
the substance is also released alongside nicotine when smoking e-cigarettes

julie hyde , 39 , of sandwich , illinois , said her six - year - old pitbull called bossy was as â healthy as a horse â before she started eating the food
