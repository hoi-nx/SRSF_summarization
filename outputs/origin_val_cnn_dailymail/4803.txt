cindy ( pictured ) is a fan of running and hiking as well as pilates and dance classes essential to her toned appearance is a twice - weekly weights routine designed â to hit the major muscle groups : legs , bum , abs , back , chest , triceps , biceps and shoulders â , she says
what to try : the single arm row is a good way to tone upper arms
you will need a bench or dining chair and a dumb - bell or bottle of water
stand sideways to the bench with left side nearest to it and place your left knee and left hand on the seat
keep your back straight and body â square â to the floor
holding the weight in your right hand , allow it to hang at arm âs length so that it is in line with the shoulder
then pull the weight up , keeping elbow close to the body , until it is level with your back
lower the weight to the start position and repeat 12 - 15 times before changing sides .
