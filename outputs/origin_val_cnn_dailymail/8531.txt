they might have thousands of pounds to spend on the best products and make - up artists at their beck and call but sometimes celebrities still slip up when it comes to their slap
this week kylie jenner showed up to a nip and fab event sporting a two - toned chest , which appeared to be the result of badly applied contouring bronzer , leaving her with an unfortunate tide mark around her breasts
but the 17 - year - old is not alone as stars like angelina jolie , drew barrymore and kim have all had very public make - up mishaps
she happily posed away while photographers snapped the bronzing boo - boo , yet the youngest of the kim clan is not the first celeb to fail prey to a make - up malfunction
in fact her sister kim , the ultimate queen of contouring , recently had a bit of a fail herself
while kim showcased her dramatic new platinum ' do in paris during fashion week , she had paid less attention to her make - up and stepped out with a brown line running down her nose which had n't been blended properly
darkening the centre of the nose and highlighting the sides is a make - up artist 's trick for making the feature look thin and straight
the 34 - year - old is well known for her love of highlighter and deep contouring which excentuates her cheekbones
whilst out and about for paris fashion week kim , who usually has perfect make - up , was spotted with a dodgy looking brown stripe going down her nose other stars such as angelina jolie have also previously had maquillage ' mares
the actress was photographed at the premiere of the normal heart , to support husband brad who produced the flick , with pale white powder in patches on her face
experts guessed that her make - up artist had been liberal with the translucent powder which mattifies skin without adding colour to it
however the product - which works well in photoshoots when the light can be controlled - is less forgiving on the red carpet
with so many flashbulbs going off , the light reflects off one of main ingredients in the powder , silica
angelina jolie is one of the most famous stars to have suffered for a make up malfunction , she was once seen covered in white powder that had n't been rubbed in properly clearly angelina jolie 's husband brad did not see fit to tell angelina jolie that she was suffering from a make up malfunction as the pair attended a screening of the normal heart but angelina jolie is far from the only celebrity to be coated in the face powder only to find it looks like she 's been flour - bombed in photos
at the 2003 premiere of charlie 's angels , drew barrymore looked as though she was trying a geisha - inspired avant garde look
the former child star had so much white powder around her eyes she seemed to be wearing a white mask
drew barrymore looked a fright at the 2003 london premiere of charlie 's angels : full throttle nicole kidman sported white powder on her nose and under her eyes , possibly a result of using powder intended for hd film , not a camera flash at the nine film premiere in new york city in 2009 and the usually pristine - looking nicole kidman experienced a similar problem at the 2009 premiere of nine in new york city
the australian star had white patches beneath her eyes and a smear on the end of her nose that looked as though she 'd just done some rather messy baking
eva longoria revealed her own penchant for translucent powder on a night out with entourage actor kevin connolly in 2011
while her bronzed cheeks glowed , beneath her perfectly applied smoky eyes , the desperate housewives star sported a thick line of white powder , making her look like adam ant
eva longoria displayed white powder under her eyes as she left a sushi restaurant in hollywood with kevin connolly in 2011 jessica biel sported a touch of white powder on her nose at a film premiere in new york city in 2010 melissa joan hart sported a huge white smear across her forehead and chalky remnants around her eyes and nostrils at a film premiere in los angeles in november 2013 actress ashley judd is n't immune from a bad make - up job , pictured in new york city in 2011 meanwhile , it 's not just us celebs who seem to put their make - up on in the dark
tv presenter claudia winkleman fell prey to an attack of the eyeliner at the gq awards in 2013 when her smudged look went really wrong
the strictly star is known for her distinctive sixties - inspired style with a heavy blunt fringe , strong eyeliner , bronzed skin and pale lips
however , at the event it looked as though she 'd applied her eye make - up in the car on the way to the show with liner so smeared it was streaked well below her lash line
jennifer aniston wisely sticks to natural make - up to enhance her year - round tan , piercing blue eyes and tawny long , layered hair
but at a screening of call me crazy in los angeles in 2013 , she was left with marks from a cupping treatment , which she attempted to disguise with liberal applications of powder
the result was that rather than a series of marks from the treatment that uses suction cups on the skin , there were discs of bronzer all over her back instead
at the gq awards in 2013 claudia winkleman turned heads for all the wrong reasons with her bizarre smokey eyed make up jennifer aniston tried to use make - up to cover - up the remnants of a cupping treatment , but the foundation only made the circles look worse at the los angeles screening of call me crazy in 2013 but for every unintentional make - up mishap celebrities have worn perfectly - applied - but badly judged - lipstick , powder and paint
gossip girl leighton meester stepped out looking vampish in purple eyeshadow that had been painted around her eye sockets , and almost into her hairline
while america 's next top model judge tyra banks is famous for inventing the ' smize ' ( smiling with your eyes ) at a new york city party in 2012 she took it too far - liberally painting black shadow across both lids
her garish pink lips did nothing to improve the look either
while many everyday women admit to applying their make - up on the move , it seems celebrities are guilty of the same grooming crime
leighton meester wore garish purple eyeshadow made worse with red lips at a new york city event in 2009 tyra banks looked like she had done her make - up in the dark with her thick black eyeshadow and neon pink lips at a ball in new york city in 2012
