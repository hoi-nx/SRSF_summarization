it is one of nature âs great ocean explorers , a giant creature that swims 13,000 miles in a year and can live to the age of 100
but rather than roaming the seven seas , this 34 - stone leatherback sea turtle is undergoing treatment in a us aquarium after it swallowed a floating plastic bag
the leatherback , nicknamed nicknamed yawkey , was found dangerously ill on a remote beach in south carolina
eating plastic could cause a build - up of gas in the digestive tract , making the turtle buoyant and washing it to shore
the incident is a stark illustration of the damage humans are doing to the environment by dumping millions of tons of plastic rubbish into our oceans
recent studies estimate 8million tons of bags , bottles , toys and other rubbish ends up in the seas each year â affecting up to 400 different marine species , many of them endangered
the daily mail has been campaigning since 2008 for tougher action to reduce plastic bag waste
a major victory in the banish the bags campaign came in june last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in england
the charge , which will be introduced by october , is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to Â£ 100million a year for good causes
the aquarium hopes to release nicknamed yawkey soon because leatherbacks do not cope well in captivity wildlife experts rescued the rare leatherback from a beach on saturday
thorvalson , a turtle expert at the south carolina aquarium sea turtle hospital in charleston , said it took five people to haul the giant beast from the beach
they rode in a 4x4 truck through mud and marshland to get to the leatherback , before using a winch to get it on to the vehicle
there were few signs of external injury to the beast , leading conservationists to conclude it had probably swallowed a plastic bag
â leatherbacks feed primarily on jellyfish so it is very possible that plastics â such as bags that look like jellyfish â could be causing a gastro - intestinal issue , â mrs thorvalson added
leatherbacks , the biggest of all the sea turtles , swim in six of the seven oceans , roaming up to 13,000 miles a year in their search for food and nesting sites
the leatherback turtle âs dark blue shell is leathery to the touch â giving it its name
the animal is officially endangered , with global populations of nesting females having dropped from 115,000 in 1980 to as few as 34,000 in recent years
nicknamed yawkey has responded well to antibiotics and other treatment , and the aquarium hopes to release it in the next few days .
