a hiker has revealed the toll a 2,650 - mile trek had on his body by snapping a selfie mile - by - mile
andy davidhazy , 47 , from texas , embarked on the mighty pacific crest trail in 2013 and spent five - and - a - half months zigzagging his way from mexico to canada
during his journey he lost 50lbs as he walked his way through five pairs of shoes
his complexion also got all the more rugged as he experienced undulating temperatures , weather , and terrain
this week , after compiling all of his selfies together , he released time - lapse video of his expedition with the footage offering a fascinating glimpse into the grueling challenge he embraced
but as the miles go on , the stubble begins to grow and andy davidhazy 's face gets increasingly gaunter
at one point he appears with a full beard and in another shot he seems to have a touch of sunburn
the selfies also reveal several of davidhazy 's must - have items
in almost all of the images a water bottle appears attached to his rucksack strap
in hotter climates , the hat and sunglasses come out and in rainier climates an anorak comes into play
in some scenes other trekkers are seen lurking in the background but for the most - part andy davidhazy appears alone
in a bid to keep his sanity , it appears andy davidhazy listened to music as in several selfies headphones are seen plugged into his ears
andy davidhazy said that he actually completed the pacific crest trail in two stages as snow prevented him from doing it in one go
he stopped at mile 2,424 and took a detour leading him back around to a trailhead
