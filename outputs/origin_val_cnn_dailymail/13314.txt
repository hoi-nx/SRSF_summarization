sigma alpha epsilon is under fire for a video showing party - bound fraternity members singing a racist chant
sigma alpha epsilon 's national chapter suspended the students , but university of oklahoma president david boren took it a step further , saying the university 's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done
the news is shocking , but it 's not the first time sigma alpha epsilon has faced controversy
sigma alpha epsilon was founded march 9 , 1856 , at the university of alabama , five years before the american civil war , according to the fraternity website
when the war began , the group had fewer than 400 members , of which " 369 went to war for the confederate states and seven for the union army , " the website says
the fraternity now boasts more than 200,000 living alumni , along with about 15,000 undergraduates populating 219 chapters and 20 " colonies " seeking full membership at universities
sigma alpha epsilon has had to work hard to change recently after a string of member deaths , many blamed on the hazing of new recruits , sigma alpha epsilon national president cohen wrote in a message on the fraternity 's website
the fraternity 's website lists more than 130 chapters cited or suspended for " health and safety incidents " since 2010
at least 30 of the incidents involved hazing , and dozens more involved alcohol
however , the list is missing numerous incidents from recent months
among them , according to various media outlets : yale banned the saes from campus activities last month after members allegedly tried to interfere with a sexual misconduct investigation connected to an initiation rite
stanford in december suspended sigma alpha epsilon housing privileges after finding sorority members attending a fraternity function were subjected to graphic sexual content
and johns hopkins in november suspended the fraternity for underage drinking
" the media has labeled us as the ' nation 's deadliest fraternity , ' " cohen said
in 2011 , for example , a student died while being coerced into excessive alcohol consumption , according to a lawsuit
sigma alpha epsilon 's previous insurer dumped the fraternity
" as a result , we are paying lloyd 's of london the highest insurance rates in the greek - letter world , " cohen said
universities have turned down sigma alpha epsilon 's attempts to open new chapters , and the fraternity had to close 12 in 18 months over hazing incidents .
