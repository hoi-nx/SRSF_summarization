move over usher and chris brown , because there 's a new nimble - toed dancing phenomenon in town
and he goes by the name of ronaldo
primarily known throughout the globe for his dazzling footwork on the pitch , the real madrid star swapped his football boots for some dancing shoes whilst promoting his new ronaldo footwear range
picking up a box of his personally branded kicks , the portugal captain looks ( relatively ) at home as he tears up the stage with some , frankly , mesmerising moves - much like he does regularly at the santiago bernabeu
ronaldo struts his stuff on the dance floor in an advertisement for his new footwear range 2014 ballon d'or winner ronaldo pulls out a moonwalk whilst fully suited and booted it goes without saying that we have all grown to love his twinkletoed genius on the turf , but this advert may take some getting used to
having recently split from long - term girlfriend irina shayk , there 's no knowing what sort of damage the 2014 ballon d'or winner will cause on the dance floor with moves like these
however , it has n't been plain sailing all the way for ronaldo 's big launch after sponsors nike , who pay him around Â£ 5.5m a year , recently forced their client to withdraw a line of trainers from his new collection in the belief that it competed directly with one of their own
the real madrid star is known for his nimble feet on the pitch , but ditched the boots to get his groove on according to reports in portugal , ronaldo would have needed nike âs prior approval and that was not forthcoming when they became aware of the potential conflict of interests
on a more positive note the rich list reported on thursday that the - 30 - year - old is now the wealthiest footballer in the world with a personal fortune of Â£ 152m - some Â£ 7m more than his rival lionel messi
maybe the mini argentine needs to start dusting off his tango steps if he is to get back on level terms with his loyal adversary
it would certainly make for interesting viewing
the former manchester united winger appears to do some break dancing in the ronaldo footwear ad
