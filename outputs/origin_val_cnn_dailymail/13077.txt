hey , nature , thanks for reminding us that you are not to be played with
unless you are an adorable australia quokka
we would play with them all day long
from battling water creatures to lions opening car doors , animals have taken center stage on social media
and this is not your typical animal kingdom

there is even a live stream
according to mashable , digital media producer savard was working on a video for the science department at middlebury college in vermont on monday when he put a gopro in a waterproof case inside an octopus tank
the octopus grabbed it , took some selfies and then snapped a shot of savard
which , of course , brings to mind the epic battle last month between an octopus and crab on an australia beach
this octopus at the seattle aquarium decided enough was enough last month and tried to escape its tank
land creatures are not to be outdone , however
a video from 2014 gained attention this week , showing a lion opening the car door of a family driving through a safari park in south africa
as someone in the car says , " oh , my gosh , i did n't know they could do that
" we are still giggling at the # weaselpecker phenomenon : a photo of a weasel hitching a lift on the back of a flying woodpecker
the memes , people , the memes ! finally , our beloved quokkas , a type of rodent , are the new stars of instagram as folks in australia clamor for selfies .
