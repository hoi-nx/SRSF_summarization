we have been here before , of course â a breathless liverpool win over manchester city secured by the brilliant right foot of philippe coutinho
that was last april and we all know what happened next
this time , the liverpool charge is locked on a different target
last season , despite their slaying of manchester city at anfield , they could not secure the premier league title and it remains to be seen if this tilt at the top four ends more happily
if it does , this will be looked upon as a pivotal day

no doubt feeling thursday night âs europa league exit in their minds and legs , rodgers â team faced a fresher manchester city side hungry to close the gap on chelsea at the top
still , though , liverpool won , still they managed to take another step towards hauling in manchester united and arsenal in the places above them
this really was a remarkable effort , perhaps one of the most significant of rodgers â reign
for manchester city , questions remain
manager manuel pellegrini still can not find a way to secure the centre of the field in games such as this
sky sports pundits gary neville and jamie carragher described manchester city âs lack of control in that area as â embarrassing â
that may be overstating it but manchester city continue to be undone the same way in too many big games
last season they got away with it but this time round they may not
having said that , it took a heck of a goal to win this
philippe coutinho was the game âs star player
rarely has zabaleta on the manchester city right had such an uncomfortable time
the goal , though , was something else
a right - foot shot from the angle of the box , it was so perfect in angle and trajectory that hart , though he had plenty of time to see it , had absolutely no chance of stopping it
it came out of nothing
the game had fallen into a fallow period with 15 minutes to go
manuel pellegrini had sent on an extra midfield player in an attempt to close the game down and a contest that had been open for an hour had become scratchy
perhaps philippe coutinho sensed the mood
that is what the best players do
perhaps he knew that if he did nât take the occasion by the lapels and shake two extra points from it , nobody else would
he had been a pest earlier , too
manchester city had started the brighter of the sides and could have taken the lead when yaya toure chipped a cute ball over the top for zabaleta to volley over
jordan henderson continues to impress in the liverpool midfield and he curled home the opening goal against manchester city jordan henderson 's shot flies towards manchester city goalkeeper hart who attempts to position himself to make the save hart attempts to fling his right hand across his body to stop the shot but must realise jordan henderson 's effort will evade his grasp jordan henderson is mobbed by his liverpool team - mates and anfield boss rodgers after his effort beat hart all ends up ten minutes in , though , liverpool suddenly clicked and philippe coutinho was at the heart of it
first he played lallana through a gaping hole between vincent kompany and eliaquim mangala , only for the midfielder to shoot weakly at hart
then , moments later , lallana lashed the ball into the net from an angle , only to be ruled offside
pressure was mounting and it was nât long before liverpool were ahead
fernandinho sold kompany short with a pass in midfield and when the belgian could not catch philippe coutinho , the ball was funnelled forwards to jordan henderson
the england man moved the ball out of his feet and curled it past hart with his right instep from 20 yards
it was a lovely goal and the celebrations by the liverpool bench said everything for its importance
for a while , liverpool were at their waspish best and , as a result , manchester city rocked
liverpool were not in front for long as edin dzeko finished off a delightful team passing move to bring parity to the anfield clash edin dzeko celebrates his strike with his team - mates who played an instrumental part in the build up to manchester city 's equaliser aguero fires in a shot under pressure from liverpool midfielder lallana as both sides looked to edge in front sergio aguero did race through to strike a post but at the other end alberto moreno wasted one chance and sterling â once again playing as a centre forward â ran on to a philippe coutinho pass to mug toure and slide a cross-shot wide
at 1 - 0 , liverpool were in the ascendancy
manchester city , though , looked dangerous when they moved forwards and after philippe coutinho had erred for once by presenting a clearance to zabaleta in the 26th minute , the visitors moved through the gears , enabling edin dzeko to run on to aguero âs neat through pass and beat simon mignolet with his right foot
for a while , this was a contest that crackled with energy and attacking threat
philippe coutinho was liverpool âs go - to man throughout while , for manchester city , silva was equally dangerous
the spaniard enjoyed himself at anfield last season and was prominent once again here
lallana screwed a chance wide late in the first half following lazar markovic âs lovely chip , while aguero and sterling missed opportunities at the start of the second period that they perhaps should have taken
beyond philippe coutinho âs goal , manchester city did raise themselves a little
silva slashed a chance wide after a buccaneering yaya toure run while aguero did likewise
at the kop end , meanwhile , daniel sturridge ran clear but could not convert
at full - time , it felt a significant result
but , to repeat , we have been here before
liverpool boss rodgers ca n't hide his joy at the final whistle as liverpool edged out manchester city to ignite their top - four hopes as rodgers celebrates liverpool 's victory , manchester city boss manuel pellegrini ( right ) looks dejected as his side 's title hopes take a hit hart , beaten by two cracking strikes , looks dejected ( left ) and is consoled by his england team - mate and liverpool midfielder jordan henderson lallana fires a shot across hart but the in - form midfielder ca n't find the target from a narrow angle balotelli and daniel sturridge warm up on the sidelines as they watched their side take on manchester city balotelli looks less than happy as he sits among the liverpool substitutes during his side 's victory at anfield yaya toure and his brother kolo played against each other for the first time when the latter came on for liverpool in the second half
