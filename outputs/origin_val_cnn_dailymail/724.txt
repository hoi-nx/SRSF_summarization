drivers across north america be warned - there 's an ' unmanned ' car on the road
a driverless car is currently on a cross-country road trip to test the state - of - the - art technology that allows a driver to sit back and relax with no hands on the wheel
delphi automotive launched the first coast - to - coast test of a driverless car on sunday , starting at the golden gate bridge in san francisco
for the next week , the specially rigged audi sq5 suv will be headed on a 3,500 mile journey to new york
two people will be in the car at all times to take over the controls in emergencies - or more often , construction zones
delphi automotive , one of the largest suppliers of automotive electronics and safety systems , is using the long journey in the audi crossover to acquire 2.3 terabytes data from a sophisticated array of cameras , radar and lidar - a laser mapping technology
the delphi automotive drive kicked off march 22 near san francisco 's golden gate bridge , with plans to wind up in new york just before the annual auto show opens there on april 3
during the coast - to - coast journey in the audi , at least two delphi automotive engineers will be aboard , including one behind the wheel
the venture informed all of the states it will pass through about its unmanned car , and all of them agreed to let the vehicle travel on their roads
the car comes with 20 sensors including four short - range radars , three vision - based cameras , six lidars , a localization system and a driver assistance program
the michigan - based firm also wants to test and demonstrate its wireless and active safety systems
delphi automotive 's demonstration underscores growing interest and investments by automakers and suppliers in self - driving cars , some of which could be production - ready by 2020
jeff owens , delphi automotive 's chief technology officer , sees the automated driver assistance systems in the audi as building blocks on the road to fully self - driving cars in the next decade
delphi automotive has been working on automated cars since 1999 , when it split from gm , according to ars technica
google , which has also been working on self - driving cars , has made public statements about having such a vehicle available in five years
the tech giant has been testing out its vehicles around its mountain view , california , campus
tesla motors , the electric car brainchild of elon musk , also announced last week that new software out this summer will let cars be largely automatic on the highway
smart car : the audi is decked out with a range of sensors ( pictured ) that include our short - range radars , three vision - based cameras and six lidars , a laser mapping technology making improvements : delphi automotive , one of the largest suppliers of automotive electronics and safety systems , is using the long journey in the audi crossover to acquire data from a sophisticated array of cameras and radars the audi heading to new york will be able to stop and proceed at four - way stops and find the best way to get around cyclists , according to delphi automotive
it can also navigate complicated procedures such as merging on to the highway
though commuters may be dreaming of kicking back on the way to work , owens said , ' our view is that the driver is going to be in the seat for a long time ' in case of emergency situations
during the coast - to - coast journey , one of two engineers aboard will be behind the wheel
delphi automotive will now test such functions as traffic jam assist , automated highway pilot with lane change and automated parking and valet
all of those systems are expected to be introduced in production cars over the next two to three years
the car had previously been tested on the streets of las vegas during the ces 2015 conference and has been on road trips between the bay area and los angeles
video of the car 's steering wheel moving on its own can be seen on youtube
fully automated systems that may be phased in after 2020 could add about $ 5,000 to the cost of a car , estimates glen de vos , vice president of advanced and product engineering for delphi automotive 's electronics and safety division
car of the future ? development times for self - driving cars ( pictured ) vary , with google saying it could have one on the road in five years safety first : the firm also wants to test and demonstrate its active safety systems ( above ) designed to prevent crashes and keep the car in its lane the car and its potential human drivers will not travel at night or in difficult weather as they make their way to new york delphi automotive is providing some of the components and technology , including vehicle - to - vehicle connectivity , for gm 's super cruise automated driving system , which will debut in 2016 on the new cadillac ct6 sedan
during the cross-country trek , the vehicle will be challenged under a variety of driving conditions from changing weather and terrain to potential road hazards -- things that could never truly be tested in a lab. the audi will avoid harsh weather and not drive at night , according to pc mag. it will drive about eight hours a day
while states such as california are just beginning to allow testing of automated vehicles , all of the states the car will pass through are allowing the unmanned car on their roads
delphi automotive director john absmeier said that once the automation system is tested it will be applicable to any car model
an italian company took a driverless van 8,000 miles from europe to china in 2010 .
