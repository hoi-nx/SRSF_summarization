secret service agents will now have to wait 10 hours to drive government cars if they 've been drinking alcohol , according to an internal agency memo
the stricter policy comes weeks after a video surfaced showing two agents hitting a security barricade just outside a secured bomb - threat investigation scene at the house
the two agents have been accused of operating the government vehicle after drinking at a nearby bar
according to the memo , obtained by the washington post , any agents who violated the new policy could face ' disciplinary and adverse actions ' that included ' removal from employment '
the memo also reminded agents that they were responsible for ' conducting themselves in a manner that reflects the highest standards of the united states government '
this is n't the first time the agency 's drinking policy has changed after a public incident
special operations secret service agents are now prohibited from drinking alcohol within 12 hours of reporting for duty and 24 hours before the president arrives during an overseas trip
the changes were enacted after three agents tasked with protecting president obama in amsterdam were put on administrative leave when a night of drinking caused one agent to pass out in his hotel hallway
secret service director joseph p. clancy admitted before congress last week that some agents were turning to alcohol to deal with the job
' there 's an element within our agency that does cope with stresses ... by using alcohol , ' joseph clancy said , noting that the agency recently launched an initiative to address stress
' we 've got to find a way to help some of these people that are going toward alcohol as a coping mechanism
' joseph clancy revealed the new drinking policy during a congressional hearing regarding the march 4 incident

the house oversight committee showed the video from the washington metropolitan police department during the capitol hill hearing
joseph clancy said he only heard about the allegation that the two agents were intoxicated after an anonymous email began circulating within the agency - five days after the incident occurred
the email described the off - duty employees as ' both extremely intoxicated ' after another agent 's retirement party
the email then claims uniformed secret service officers at the scene were ' going to arrest both of them ' but were instructed not to by their commander
' a lot of people got this email , ' maryland elijah cummings rep. elijah cummings told joseph clancy
' but you did n't
' joseph clancy said it was ' unacceptable ' that he had been out of the loop

virginia bob goodlatte rep. bob goodlatte said that , although joseph clancy has ' taken many steps to begin to reform the secret service ' , congress believed it was ' clear that legislative action is needed '
