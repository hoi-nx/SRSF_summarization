zaur dadayev was originally reported to have confessed to the killing , but has now claimed this confession was made under torture and threat of death the only man to so far confess to the killing of russian opposition leader nemtsov has dramatically denied any guilt and claims his confession was forced under torture and threat of death
zaur dadayev was said to have admitted to the killing but he now claims he was told that by confessing , a friend he was with could go free
if he failed to confess he would be killed in a grenade explosion , a fate he alleged another suspect named shavanov met in recent days
five people have been detained in connection with nemtsov 's shooting on february 27
dadaev was the only one who , according to a judge , confessed to the killing , though in court he did n't admit guilt
he said : ' at the time of the arrest i was with a friend , my former subordinate ruslan
and they said that if i confessed , he would be freed
' otherwise the same thing would happen to me as to shavanov
' the official version is that shavanov killed himself with a grenade as police came to arrest him
he added he was not guilty and the judge did not allow him to speak , he told moskovskiy komsomolets newspaper
human rights experts who met zaur dadayev and other suspects in detention found ' traces of torture and beating ' on their bodies , it was reported
' we are carefully checking into this , ' said chairman of the moscow public monitoring commission , anton tsvetkov
' there are reasons that lead us to believe zaur dadayev confessed under torture , ' said andrei babushkin , a member of the kremlin 's human rights council
there were ' numerous wounds ' on the body of the suspect
earlier law enforcement sources claimed forensic tests ' give reasons to believe that zaur dadayev was the man who shot nemtsov '
however , the source admitted the murder weapon had not been found yet
nemtsov - a prominent putin foe - was gunned down close to the kremlin on 27 february as he walked home late at night with his ukrainian model girlfriend anna duritskaya
nemtsov was gunned down close to the kremlin last month as he walked home late at night with his girlfriend his body sits in a body - bag as authorities work at the scene of his killing in moscow last month more startling revelations to be reported today included claims nemtsov 's murder was ordered by a senior security official in chechen
the identity of the man - named only ruslan , and said to be a close relative of top political figures in the region - is known to putin and the fsb , but he has not been detained , reported novaya gazeta , russian 's leading investigative newspaper
the russian president has been told in addition that three other prominent liberal figures are on a chilling chechen ' hit list '
they are exiled mikhail khodorkovsky , a former oil tycoon who was jailed for a decade under putin but now says he has ambitions to become president ; alexei venediktov , respected editor of editorially independent ekho mosocw radio ; and glamorous ksenia sobchak , a tv presenter and opposition blogger , daughter of the president 's political mentor anatoly sobchak , former mayor of st petersburg
other media in russian today named him as ruslan geremeev
in sensational claims , the newspaper reported that the man who ordered 55 - year - old nemtsov 's murder is a highly decorated major in the same interior ministry unit called ' north ' in chechen in which alleged killer zaur dadayev served until recently
novaya gazeta said it did not name him because of the presumption of innocence , but admitted the alleged mastermind 's identity ' is known to dozens , if not hundreds , of members of the fsb and the investigation committee '
people walk past flowers left at the site where nemtsov was killed on the evening of february 27 nemtsov was a prominent anti-putin foe
pictured is his casket being carried at his funeral he is said to have been questioned by investigators on monday , though not detained
his uncle was named as suleiman geremeev , a senator for chechen in the russian upper house
another relative is russian mp adam delimkhanov , a close henchman of powerful chechen ruler ramzan kadryov , a key putin ally
' the head of state was informed about the details by the director of the fsb alexander bortnikov , ' reported novaya gazeta , which is part - owned by ex-soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and by alexander lebedev , proprietor of the independent titles and the london evening standard
several reports say the disclosures prevent a major challenge for putin , because he must allow the prosecution of a key figure from the security services professing total loyalty to him in chechen - or snub his moscow law enforcement cadres who have exposed the murder plot
for some time , there has been a power struggle between those under kadyrov 's command , and those at federal level in moscow , with claims the chechen have a free hand to conduct illegal operations .
