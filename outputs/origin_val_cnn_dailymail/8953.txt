now it âs not often that i can claim to be ahead of a fashion trend
but a few weeks ago i was invited to a photoshoot to give my verdict on a new range of suede clothing â apparently , the must - have fabric this season , as we experience a seventies revival
as someone who remembers the seventies all too clearly , and who boldly wore some of its more questionable offerings the first time round , i was interested to see how i felt about it now
i did nât know i was about to try out a garment that has since fuelled a major fashion debate and divided britain âs women , who , it seems , all have an opinion on that skirt , as it is now known
â yet when i spotted it a few weeks ago , it was just one of several suede garments hanging on a rail , so i had the chance to judge it in an unbiased and objective way
i did nât much like it
i found the suede stiff and heavy , and the colour and shape channelled the seventies cowgirl look a little too closely for comfort
some fashions are best left unrevisited and this length and shape of suede skirt seemed one of them
soon after that , all hell broke loose as various fashionistas were spotted wearing the skirt
it was photographed on the lithe and youthful hips of people who know a lot more about fashion than me â first alexa chung , then socialite olivia palermo at new york fashion week , both of whom obviously liked it enough to happily endorse it
vogue heralded it â pure ali macgraw chic â in reference to the star of the seventies film love story , and suddenly it was the next big thing
alexa chung ( pictured ) was spotted in the m&s skirt in february this year well , i can be as easily influenced as anyone , and a horrible guilt crept over me that i had nât spotted this as the wonder garment everyone else had
i wondered : should i rush out and grab one from m&s ? well , not much point , as it wo nât be on sale to us ordinary punters until april 10
so , should i trust my first feeling that it was nât for me ? after a bit of thought , i came full circle back to my original decision : i âm still not a fan
yesterday , daily mail columnist sarah vine was one of the first to shout â emperor âs new clothes ! â when she criticised m&s for its aggressive marketing of the skirt , which , she felt â correctly in my view â seemed to use a lot of energy that could have been better focused on producing affordable fashion that does nât follow any trend
â just because a couple of voguettes have given it their stamp of approval , we loyal m&s customers are meant to flock like good little style sheep to get our hands on one , too , â she said
â ca nât m&s see how patronising this is ? â for this suede skirt did nât work in the seventies and it does nât really work now
when i was young , most suede skirts and jackets were stiff , unyielding garments produced in a gingery tan colour that did nât flatter anyone â especially those of us with gingery , tan - coloured hair â and it often felt like wearing thick cardboard
sadly , this reincarnation gave me flashbacks
the unsuppleness and heavy feel of the suede may mean it will last for ages , but you âll know about it while you âre wearing it : the waistband is far from forgiving and i ca nât imagine it will give much across the hips when you sit down , making it stick out unattractively in front
i âm not crazy about the mid-calf length , either
unless you have the endless legs of a model , it âs hard to carry off
it would look better with boots , of course , but with spring already here i âm hoping those can be left in the wardrobe
and i ca nât see how the white stitching on hips and tummy can be flattering
sorry , m&s , i âm giving it just three out of five : wearable for a few outings , after which it would be confined to the back of my wardrobe , never to be worn again
a costly foray into a brief trend â something that , at my age , i have mostly learned to avoid
updated classic jane asher ( pictured ) loved this flattering suede dress from h&m , finding the whole outfit comfortable and well fitting , without the stiffness of some other suede garments wraparound suede dress , Â£ 199.99 , hm.com suede block - heeled sandals , Â£ 129 , reiss.com bangle , Â£ 39 , reiss.com button diamond ring , Â£ 210 , monicavinader.com my favourite : it âs an excellent price and a beautiful and flattering berry colour , which suits most skin tones
the suede is wonderfully supple and comfortable and fits well
it certainly does nât have the stiffness that some other suede garments have , and the just - above - the - knee length is elegant and suits the shape of the dress
who would have thought i âd want to be back in a wrap dress again ? i thought we were over those for some time
the fabric updates this classic look
i love it â especially the great price
5/5 should you fake it ? the suede culottes jane asher is sporting here did not get a good review with the stiff fabric and odd shape granting them a paltry 2/5 tweed top , Â£ 129 , baukjen.com suedette culottes , Â£ 24.99 , hm.com heels , Â£ 225 , russellandbromley.co.uk no ! no ! no ! culottes tend to look stiff and oddly shaped unless they âre made in a fluid fabric
these certainly do nât suit me , and i âm proving that here beyond any reasonable doubt
they cut off my legs at the least flattering part , the calves , and look more dickensian urchin than fashion - forward fabulous
the faux fabric does feel like the real thing , but i suspect that it might crease
if i wanted some suede trousers i âd save up for a better design
2/5 comfy and chic jane asher ( pictured ) says this suede top may be worth the Â£ 249 you 'd have to shell out to buy it
she found the item ' extremely chic and wearable ' , saying it would work with tight jeans or a smart skirt suede top , Â£ 249 , baukjen.com j. brand jeans , Â£ 180 , trilogystores.co.uk heels , Â£ 5 , everything5pounds.com jewelled necklace , Â£ 85 , stelladot.co.uk deceptively simple , this little suede top just might be a really good investment as it âs extremely chic and wearable , whether teamed with tight brand jeans or a smart skirt
i love the boxy on - trend cut and the sleeve length makes it suitable for any occasion , as well as being long enough to keep the spring chill off and hide any imperfections
this suede is so thin and soft it feels like silk , and i like the tunic slit at the top
4/5 make a splash another top scorer was this lilac suede dress
jane asher ( pictured ) says it fits beautifully , skimming fluidly over the body , with the colour adding to the classy look suede dress , Â£ 429 , baukjen.com blue necklace , Â£ 50 , stelladot.co.uk suede strappy sandals , Â£ 250 , lkbennett.com this fits so beautifully and skims fluidly over the body
yes , it costs a lot , but it really does look expensive and the lilac is stunning and classy
the suede has an almost silky feel
i adored wearing this , but the danger of ruining it with smudges would make me wary of splashing out the serious cash
remember that suede needs a lot more care than leather , tending to show rain spots and stains easily , and the soft top layer can wear off after a lot of use
it may be worth protecting expensive suede garments with a special spray , and they will also need expert cleaning
