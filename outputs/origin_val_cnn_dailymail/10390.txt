a travel writer and mother who embarked on a mammoth adventure around the world to battle the ' inner emptiness ' she felt after giving birth to her son says her exploration gave her the opportunity to connect with something larger than herself , as she wrestled with the question of what it means to be a mom
leigh ann , from boone , north carolina , visited a variety of far - off and remote locations during a two - year period , which began shortly after her son âs first birthday , returning home in between each trip in order to spend time with her child and her husband
and in her memoir phenomenal : a hesitant adventurer âs search for wonder in the natural world , which was published on tuesday , the mother - of - one chronicles every aspect of the physical and emotional journey , which , she explains , she began in order to experience the world 's natural phenomena as a part of a spiritual quest to find herself after her son archer , now five , was born
leigh ann , who has witnessed hawaii âs still - burning volcanoes , venezuela 's intense lightning and sweden 's aurora borealis - among her many adventures - says the birth of her son in 2009 was as ' awe - inducing and fantastical ' as the natural wonders she describes in her book
but she notes that no one could have prepared her for how she would feel when she was ' thrown into this very visceral experience ' of being a new mom
leigh ann struggled with sleep deprivation , as well as her sense of self , during the first year of archer 's life
she was only sleeping for three - hour stretches and she refused to allow anyone outside of her immediate family to watch her son for the first 14 months of his life - and even then she would only leave archer 's side for a few hours at a time
' you know the saying : " it takes a village to raise a child ? " i was nât letting the village in , ' she recalls
adventure time : the 37 - year - old travel writer ( r ) posed with her sled guide ( l ) in sweden for this photo natural wonder : during her trip to sweden , leigh ann saw the aurora borealis , or the northern lights and it was n't just her physical ailments that sent caused leigh ann to question her identity as a mother
' i had a year where i was convinced that i was never going to leave my house again , [ that ] i was never going to sleep again [ and that ] i was never going to write again , ' she says
' i was very confused and i was unsure how my life was going to be
â leigh ann , who first began creating a list of the natural wonders she wanted to experience after watching the fantastical migration of the monarch butterfly in mexico in 2007 , before the birth of her son , says she vowed to visit the places she had dreamed of - even if it took her a decade
' i had a crazy idea ... and when i started to pursue it , things started to happen and doors started opening , ' she says
a few months after archer 's first birthday , leigh ann embarked on her first trip , when she traveled to puerto rico to visit the island 's bioluminescent bays , which contain millions of micro-organisms , or dinoflagellates , that glow
life - changing moment : after seeing the migration of millions of monarch butterflies in mexico ( pictured ) , leigh ann started keeping a list of natural phenomena she wanted to experience african safari : the author saw a group of zebras during her trek to tanzania leign ann notes that was n't in the position financially to embark on these travels and they seemed very much like a ' pipe dream ' when she wrote her book proposal
' when i look back on those years , i can not believe that i did that , ' she says
' i can not believe that i juggled it , that i fought so hard for the time to do it
' leigh ann , who , in addition to planning her travels , was also teaching creative writing , while raising her son , said her quest had once seemed ' impossible ' but soon began to take a life of its own
her story : leigh ann 's memoir was published on tuesday the writer explains that during her two year journey she never left her son for more than two weeks , and adds that her husband would travel with her when he could
as for any impending danger , leigh ann says she was more nervous about traveling around the bustling streets of caracas , venezuela , than witnessing the south american country 's fearsome lightning storms , because cities make her uncomfortable
' we all have things that make us nervous , ' she says , before adding : ' you are more likely to be killed by a coconut falling from a tree than a shark bite
' leigh ann believes that her journey ' would be talked about in different ways ' if it were written by a father opposed to a mother â and admits that some people were shocked to learn that her husband was so supportive of her personal journey
' i remember distinctly in hawaii i had a woman say to me : " can you believe that her husband is letting her do this ? " ' she adds that , as a travel writer , visiting those far off locations and writing about her experience was also work for her , rather than just a series of carefree jaunts to exotic locations
' can you imagine someone going to a business conference and having someone say : " oh , i ca n't believe that your husband let you come here ? " ' she asks
leigh ann recalls other people saying things like , ' can you believe her son is home with her husband for a whole week ? â despite the fact that few people would likely ever question a child being left with his or her mother
she says people mostly had an issue with her doing something for her emotional and spiritual health , noting that ' it 's not something that we value in our culture '
' it was a story that i needed to live out , ' she says .
