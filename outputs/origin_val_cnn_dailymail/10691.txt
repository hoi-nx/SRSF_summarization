her boyfriend âs dreary taste in furnishings is said to be the spark that first set chrissie rucker off in pursuit of all things white
faced with the fusty brown and burgundy upholstery in his flat in fulham , west london , she rushed to the shops to find replacements in more neutral tones , but struggled when it came to buying good quality bed linen in the purest of whites
she did nât know it at the time , of course , but that day in 1993 marked the moment chrissie rucker began to dream of setting up a shop selling everything in white
her business sells everything from Â£ 20 scented candles to Â£ 200 cashmere jumpers , and while she has branched out to shades such as â biscuit marl â and â cloud grey â , chrissie rucker remains obsessed with all things pale
her white revolution has seen sales soaring at her 53 high street stores â even the queen has sent out her ladies - in - waiting to buy bedspreads â and has spread across the atlantic where she launched a u.s. website last year
latest figures show that the mother - of - four âs company made pre-tax profits of Â£ 6.5 million last year â an increase of 38 per cent
her position on the sunday times rich list has climbed steeply from 427th to 326th
she and her husband âs combined wealth is estimated at Â£ 295 million
aside from the money pouring into company coffers , chrissie rucker owns three stunning properties , all decorated from roof to floor in her trademark sweeping white interiors
there âs a Â£ 12.5 million 17th - century manor house in buckinghamshire , set in 51 acres of parkland , a Â£ 4 million townhouse in west london âs fashionable holland park and what is widely regarded to be the finest property in the swiss alps , haus alpina , a luxury chalet with full - time staff which chrissie rucker rents out for a staggering Â£ 26,000 a week
chrissie rucker , pictured at her buckinghamshire home , realised she had found a gap in the market when she was looking to decorate her future husband 's house all in white even at chrissie rucker âs main residence , the country mansion , the only flashes of colour you âll see are the bright pony rosettes awarded to her horse - mad daughters
all in all , it âs a rather surprising state of affairs for a woman who disappointed her parents by leaving school at 16 with six o - levels and signing up at the lucie clayton finishing school which promised to prepare girls for marriage , society and â the season â
however , it was not long before chrissie rucker decided she wanted to do something more interesting with her life than flutter her eyelashes at eligible young bachelors on the west london social circuit
indeed , the statuesque blonde âs path to fortune is rather more colourful than her dazzling white shops might suggest
belinda christian rucker , as she was named by her parents , was born in 1968 into an illustrious military family â her maternal grandfather , sir harold pyman , was commander - in - chief of allied forces in europe and a recipient of the knight grand cross and distinguished service order
the daughter of commodity broker , patrick rucker , chrissie rucker , as she was known , grew up in kent and attended Â£ 5,275 - a - term combe bank school in kent
her parents divorced , and aged seven , she and her younger sister , jo , went with their mother rosemary , a horse breeder , to live with their new step - father , estate agent jeremy calcutt
those days , she recalled , were happy but chaotic
â my mother was really only interested in her horses , â she said , â so the stables were immaculate , the house a tip. â chrissie rucker 's husband , nick wheeler ( pictured ) , set up his shirt company , charles tyrwhitt , in 1986 while a geography student at bristol university it was all a far cry from the vision chrissie rucker would later create of domestic interiors as a haven of white and light
her early ambitions lay in fashion
while at lucy clayton she studied dressmaking and design
but as a teenager in west london in the late eighties , chrissie rucker seemed intent on immersing herself in a â sloane ranger â lifestyle
in 1987 , she was a debutante at the savoy hotel âs berkeley ball , where she and fellow socialite and fashion journalist plum sykes were among a select bunch of girls chosen by judges including hairdresser vidal sassoon and fashion designer jean muir to appear in the berkeley dress show
even at chrissie rucker and nick 's home in buckinghamshire ( pictured ) you will see only flashes of colour , mainly in the bright pony rosettes awarded to their horse - mad daughters wedding dress designer anneliese sharpe , who was also on the judging panel , recalls that even among the â incredibly beautiful , leggy â girls who paraded in front of her , desperate to be picked , 18 - year - old chrissie rucker stood out
cannily , she used her introduction to sharpe to ask for work experience
â chrissie rucker used to come every day , â says sharp
â she was completely different from the other debutantes
she was incredibly hard - working with no airs and graces
â however , chrissie rucker decided that life as a designer was not what she wanted after all
she began work at conde nast , the owner of several glossy magazines including vogue and tatler , first as a receptionist , then as a fashion assistant
she enrolled on a journalism course , later describing it as a â complete waste of time â , and flitted from there to clarins , where she worked as a pr girl
she was poached from there by harper & queen âs health and beauty editor gaudoin in 1991
gaudoin recalls : â she was so efficient and impressive , i said : â are you interested in coming to work for me ? â she dropped off her cv at 5am
i was so struck by her ability to be focused and unflappable that i hired her as my assistant
she has a great humility about her , which i find extraordinary , bearing in mind she is so successful
â by the time she met her future husband , chrissie rucker was still struggling to work out exactly what she wanted to do with her life
but although she fell in love with wheeler , she did not feel the same way about his taste in interiors
chrissie rucker ( pictured ) used a Â£ 6,000 legacy from her grandmother to launch the white company in march 1994 according to chrissie rucker herself : â i thought ; â this is my chance
i âll show him what excellent wife material i am
â so i went shopping and kitted it out â i bought white bed linen , white towels , white china , white napkins and white bathrobes
but i just found it impossible to buy plain white sheets on the high street
â the only place you could get them was in department stores and shopping there was a horrible experience
all the salesgirls would look at you snootily , as if to say : â you ca nât afford this
â â while chrissie rucker believed she had spotted a hole in the market , her husband - to - be was perfectly placed to advise her when it came to launching her own business
chrissie rucker ( pictured ) grew up in kent and attended Â£ 5,275 - a - term combe bank school before going on to the lucie clayton finishing school wheeler had set up his shirt company , charles tyrwhitt , in 1986 while a geography student at bristol university
â i do nât think i would have done it if it had nât been for nick , â chrissie rucker later claimed
â he guided me through the process , helped me write my first business plan
â she began by calling up west london department stores , pretending to be a journalist writing articles on homeware while ascertaining that up to 50 per cent of their sales involved white linen
she also quizzed prs , manufacturers and friends
chrissie rucker ( left ) was inspired to start the white company in 1993 after being faced with the fusty brown and burgundy upholstery of her future husband , nick 's ( right ) flat in fulham , west london â my mission was to bridge the gap between first - class designer quality and what was affordable without the big designer margins , â she has said
chrissie rucker used a Â£ 6,000 legacy from her grandmother to launch the white company in march 1994
wheeler gave her Â£ 5,000 in return for a 25 per cent stake , and she also received a Â£ 50 - a - week enterprise grant
she produced her first mail - order catalogue , a 12 - page leaflet , on a computer in wheeler âs attic , delivering her first orders in her sister jo âs mini metro
the company was an instant hit , turning over Â£ 258,000 in its first year , but chrissie rucker remained committed to hard graft , working 16 - hour days , right up until the birth of her first child
chrissie rucker is pictured here at home with her children ; ella , tom , bea and india , when they were younger since then , the white company has gone from strength to strength
in 2010 , chrissie rucker was made an mbe for services to the retail industry , attracting mirth among some palace officials because of the black outfit that she wore to receive the honour at windsor castle
she and her husband â together with their four children aged from ten to 18 â now reap the rewards of their entrepreneurial spirt
they almost split up when he failed to propose during a romantic holiday in thailand the year chrissie rucker launched her business
upon returning to the uk , a feisty chrissie rucker gave him his marching orders , storming into his office and returning his Â£ 5,000 investment in cash
in 2010 , chrissie rucker was made an mbe for services to the retail industry ( pictured ) attracting mirth among some palace officials thanks to her all black outfit a shell - shocked wheeler left the money on the roof of his sports car and drove off without it
when the couple did finally marry in 1995 , chrissie rucker gave him back one per cent of the company as a wedding gift
as a 99 per cent stake - holder , however , it is chrissie rucker who remains at the head of a retail empire which has revolutionised tastes in home furnishings , a woman who continues to live and breathe the colour that made her a multi-millionaire
â for me , white is timeless and always very relevant , â she insists
â wherever you live , whatever your style , white works
