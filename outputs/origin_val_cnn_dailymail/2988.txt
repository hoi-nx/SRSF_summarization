' it said israel ' should shoulder all its responsibilities towards the palestinian people in the occupied state of palestine as an occupation authority according to international law '
the decision is certain to provoke israel , which sees security coordination as vital to maintain calm in the west bank
palestinian security forces also require israel permission to send patrols into some areas of the west bank to preserve law and order
it is not clear if palestinian president mahmoud abbas will implement the resolution by the pcc

israel officials had no immediate comment on the pcc move

a partial view of the israel settlement of qadumim ( bottom ) and the palestinian village of jit ( above r ) , in the israel - occupied west bank near nablus it added : ' the concept of a jewish state is rejected and also of a ( palestinian ) state with provisional borders is rejected
' any formula that will keep an israel military or settler presence on any part of the land of the state of palestine is rejected
' the palestinian submitted a un security council resolution in december - which was voted down - calling for an end to israel 's occupation of the west bank within two years
in january , president mahmoud abbas sought membership in the international criminal court , paving the way for possible war crimes charges against israel

activists in mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement countered by enforcing a boycott of goods made by israel food companies
despite the tensions , security coordination between mahmoud abbas ' forces and israel troops has continued in the west bank .
