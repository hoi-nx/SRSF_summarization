a michigan couple has completed a quest to visit all 3,108 counties in the lower 48 states after driving around the country in a green 1999 dodge intrepid for almost nine years
jennifer and jonathan put the finish touch on their journey this week when they boarded a ferry to nantucket in their car , which has accumulated almost 540,000 miles
they can now navigate small towns and state highway systems without any help after they accumulated knowledge about how the country is set up , the couple told daily mail online
jennifer and jonathan , 32 and 31 , completed their journey to the lower 48 states ' 3,108 counties when they arrived in nantucket , their last county , with their green 1999 dodge intrepid they have preferred sticking to physical maps since their journey began in 2006 , though the riehls bought a gps device in 2012 to help out in the remote corners of the us where the streets are n't labelled
riehl , 32 , a research scientist at michigan technological university , and her husband , 31 , an engineering instructor at the institution , typically drove about 50,000 miles a year
jonathan , who does the majority of the driving while his wife navigates , hangs a map of their travels in his office and says that colleagues are ' genuinely baffled ' by the accomplishment
mr jonathan bought the car as a high school senior living in new jersey for $ 9,000
at the time , 2002 , it had 70,000 miles
the couple met in 2005 and have had their share of adventures since , including meeting a bear and running into nasty weather , according to the cape cod times
the car and both of its primary passengers have been to all 3,108 counties , and the vehicle is still using the same engine it had when it was bought despite many 16 - hour days on the road
they think a 15,000 - mile trip from new jersey to alaska to their home on michigan 's upper peninsula over 38 days in the summer of 2012 may have broken a record for the long distance speed in a car
first counties visited by the couple , which met in upstate new york , include many northeastern destinations where they visited friends
jonathan , who works with geographical information science computer programs , saw that they had visited a fair number of counties together and during childhood road trips
a move to nashville , tennessee , for two years , sparked the idea that they could actually hit all the counties
the contiguous 48 states have 3,108 counties , and the addition of alaska and hawaii brings the total to 3,143 the couple reached their final county in the lower 48 states on tuesday during their spring break trip

the couple has already visited some boroughs of alaska , but plans on finishing the state and starting on hawaii
jennifer 's mother lives in texas , but the travelers do n't take the direct interstate route when they go to visit
they have spent days going to the southern state by route of california or idaho , most recently picking up five counties they had missed in the idaho during previous journeys
their parents accompanied them on the final ferry leg into nantucket , ma , on tuesday
with academic schedules , the pair has gone to most of the thousands of counties during breaks from school , including winter holidays where they truck through snow
jonathan proposed to jennifer on a 2011 trip to manitoba , canada , where they have added roughly half of the provinces to their total in addition to three mexican states
however , their first hours as an engaged couple were spent driving south to winnepeg in blinding snow with jennifer keeping track of the road 's white line out of the car window and her fiance drove
the couple often taken the long route to friends ' and relatives ' houses , going from michigan to texas via california or idaho
the car , which jonathan bought in 2002 , still has the same engine the couple avoids the interstate and uses small and dirt roads when possible
above , jennifer stands in golden valley county , montana , in 2012 oscar voss of the nonprofit national extra miler club , a travel group where the riehls are members , says that the couple is likely the first to ever visit every county in the same car
the club lists 38 people who have ' bagged ' all 3,143 counties in the entire us , the first being ed dietz and arthur palmer in 1976
most of the people who have been to all the counties are over 60 , according to the club 's valerie naylor
the riehls said that all members of the club go around the country with different goals , such as visiting national parks or climbing to the highest points
jonathan and jennifer like to visit the county seat of each county if they can
jonathan is particularly interested in architecture and jennifer likes to hike all over the country
as a pair they have also visited motels in each of the 48 states but delaware and roughly 550 brewpubs during their travels , hearing stories from a variety of locals
jonathan , who is doing his doctoral research on urban sprawl , said that all of the best places are away from major highways
jennifer said that the trips ' give me a perspective about what places and life are like that you just do n't get from the interstate
' the pair began their journeys with trips around the northeast

after failing to drive through baxter state park in maine because of heavy snow , the couple reattempted to make their way through the forest again in june 2006 only to find that a bridge was completely out
the riehls were surprised when construction crews near the site were able to build a structure just for them so they could cross the river
in ohio they found a man going cross-country alongside a road where he was walking his dog and rolling a globe
they do n't play children 's car games and occasionally listen to xm radio , but spend most of their time in the car catching up on each other 's lives
' i guess we must still like each other , or else we would have gone insane by now , ' mrs riehl said
the travelers will end their spring break trip by driving to new jersey before heading back to michigan and working next week
who both work at michigan technological university , have been going to different counties together since 2006 and drive about 50,000 miles a year
