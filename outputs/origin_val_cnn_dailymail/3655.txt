arsenal boss arsene wenger is under no illusions about the potential repercussions of monday night âs visit to old trafford
any clash against united , particularly in the arsene wenger era , carries added value for the gunners
the fact that it is an fa cup quarter - final with a place at wembley at stake merely adds to the occasion
and for arsene wenger it âs a chance to land what could be a crucial psychological blow on louis van gaal âs side ahead of the tense season finale
walcott holds off nacho monreal as arsenal trained on sunday at their london colney training ground alex oxlade-chamberlain lets fly with a shot , as arsene wenger promised his team would attack united the gunners squad are put through their paces as they look to reach wembley for the third time in two years arsene wenger is confident his team can beat united by playing attacking football the fa cup is nât the only competition in which these two giants are going toe to toe
they are also battling for a champions league position , a race which is perhaps more pertinent to both clubs â long - term ambitions
there are no points at stake tonight but arsene wenger said : â it âs a big game , and every big win in a big game has an impact subconsciously in the belief of the team
â however , the reverse is also true
losing against united could plant a seed of doubt in arsenal âs quest to finish in the top four â and their poor recent record at old trafford does nât bode well
united have won nine out of their last 10 home games against the gunners
we should nât forget , though , that arsene wenger also has pleasant memories of the old trafford
he lists sylvain wiltord âs goal that clinched the title for arsenal at old trafford in 2002 as his favourite
and the frenchman insists his current crop of players can produce another win in united âs back yard on monday night
arsenal 's world cup winning playmaker mesut ozil has been in top form since returning from injury chilean forward alexis sanchez , who scored a brilliant goal in midweek against qpr , looks lively in training per mertesacker , whose place was in doubt before an injury to gabriel , gestures to his team - mates â i do nât believe our recent record at old trafford ( to be a factor )
when the team is less good , they lose
when the team is not as good , they lose , â said arsene wenger
â it does nât matter what shirt they wear , or what stadium they play in
it is down to quality
â if i âve learnt something in my life it âs that the performance on the day decides the outcome of the day , not where you play
â the fact that we can win away from home , that is important
if you have nât won away from home all season it âs more difficult
but we know we can do well away from home
â tomas rosicky attempts to control the ball as walcott , mertesacker and ramsey watch on indeed , their victory over manchester city at the etihad stadium earlier this season proved they can produce big away performances against english âs elite , and arsene wenger insists last season âs fa cup triumph has bolstered belief that his side can become english football âs top dogs once more
â yes , of course we want to dominate again , â said arsene wenger
â i think today you have more competitors and it will get worse with the seasons coming because you get more money in
that means even the smaller teams will be capable to buy the best players in europe
sylvain wiltord âs goal at old trafford in 2002 that clinched the league title for the gunners at old trafford â maybe the competition will become harder for everybody
winning the fa cup gave us energy because we had a few years without winning a trophy and so on that front it was vital
â this team has a good mentality because we had a slow start this season and every time we lost a big game you see how much the players are touched
â i think the mentality is very healthy , they want to do well and we will be focused on united
â once you get to the quarter - final you think that âs a good opportunity to win a trophy
you want to do it , but it âs at that stage where it âs conflicting always with the champions league
