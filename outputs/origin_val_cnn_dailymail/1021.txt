albert kelly scored two sensational 90 - metre solo tries to help hull kr shatter st helens ' 100 per cent record in super league
the australian half - back twice demonstrated exceptional pace to punish errors by the reigning champions to put the robins on their way to a 24 - 22 win and leave saints still looking for a first victory at craven park since 2008
rovers , who claimed the scalp of wigan last month , were good value for a third successive home win that rounded off a good day for the club after they earlier announced the notable acquisition of jamie peacock as football manager for 2016
albert kelly scored two sensational 90 - metre solo tries st helens , who trailed 24 - 12 with with five minutes to go , could have snatched a point had former hull kr co-captain burns been able to convert turner 's last - minute try but it would have been tough on the impressive robins
saints stay top of the table but they were a shadow of the side that beat warrington a week earlier and coach keiron cunningham must now pick them up for their good friday derby at the dw stadium
the champions were unfortunate to lose england hooker roby to injury but they made an ideal start when skipper wilkin , who began his professional career at craven park , re-gathered his own grubber kick to touch down and a goal from burns made it 6 - 0 after just three minutes
it was saints for the opening quarter but roby was held up over the line and albert kelly twice punished their casual play to put his side in front
the former gold coast titans scrum - half pounced on wilkin 's kick for his first long - range try and then picked off burns ' pass to outsprint the saints cover for his second
mantellato converted both to put the robins into a 12 - 6 lead but the champions were back level on 26 minutes when the ball was fed back from wilkin 's hoisted kick and atelea vea got makinson over at the corner
burns landed the difficult conversion but saints were forced to re-organise their team six minutes from half - time when roby was forced from the field after taking a head knock
lance hohaia demonstrated his versatility by switching from full - back , where he began as third choice in the absence of jonny lomax and paul wellens , to hooker , with makinson going to full - back
rovers had a try disallowed when slow - motion replays indicated a knock - on by hooker lunt after he re-gathered terry campese 's kick but when st helens winger swift again demonstrated his fallibility under the high ball his opposite number ken sio struck with the home side 's third try two minutes before the break
the momentum was clearly with the robins and saints were forced to survive a torrid time in the third quarter
mantellato was wide with a penalty attempt and then had a try disallowed after producing a flying finish at the corner only for slow - motion replays to reveal he was in touch
albert kelly could have doubled his try tally following breaks by lunt and kris welham but rovers could not apply the finishing touches , and they had to settle for two successful mantellato penalties to edge them 20 - 12 ahead
hull kr thought they had sealed it when full - back kieran dixon went over for a fourth try on 64 minutes but saints staged a tremendous late fightback which caused some anxious moments for chris chester 's men
forward louie mccarthy-scarsbrook went over on 75 minutes - burns ' third goal cut the deficit to six points - and turner took a return pass from swift to go over four minutes later .
