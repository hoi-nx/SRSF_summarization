the controversy took a further twist this weekend when victims of savile denounced comparisons of the support shown to clarkson to the widespread protection offered to the dead paedophile presenter as ' upsetting ' and ' totally offensive '
clarkson was suspended by the bbc last week after allegedly shouting at top gear producer tymon ( pictured ) a senior figure at the bbc was reported as suggesting clarkson is able to behave as he wishes because of his celebrated position and support from powerful friends , including prime minister david cameron
the mail on sunday revealed the bbc chief compared the support for clarkson to the way sex offender savile was defended
the reported comments drew a furious response from victims of the former radio 1 dj. liz dux , a lawyer from slater and gordon , which is representing 169 of savile 's alleged victims , said such comparisons upset victims
she said : ' many of savile 's victims find a direct parallel between these issues to be upsetting and highly inappropriate
' one victim said that while both have celebrity status , to suggest other similarities is totally offensive
' nevertheless , they want the lessons from savile learned , whereby fame and celebrity must never be an excuse to overlook wrongdoing
' the bbc boss also added it was ' common knowledge ' that clarkson has ' personal issues ' , saying they would advise him to take one of two courses of action - ' to try to play it down - or i would go into rehab and show the world i am trying to change '
a friend of clarkson said the presenter had called bbc bosses to apologise over the fracas in an attempt to draw a line under the matter
writing in the sunday times , aa gill said the investigation into the row was ' preposterous and ponderous ' , and praised him as hard - working
a lawyer for mr tymon said his client ' intends to await the outcome of the bbc investigation and will make no comment until that investigation is complete ' .
