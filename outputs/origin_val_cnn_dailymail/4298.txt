a woman who claims to have captured paranormal activity on camera says he is being haunted by the ghost of her dead brother with whom she had a troubled relationship
donna ayres , 33 , says she has moved house five times in order to try and escape the spirit , but it has followed her each time
the mother - of - four , from burnley , lancashire , says she has been left with bruises from the ghoul , and on one occasion was pinned down to the bed
in another video taken by ms donna ayres a spoon begins moving around on her kitchen counter ( pictured ) the spoon appears to be dragged around by some unseen force before standing up on its end and beginning to spin around on its tip she even claims to have captured some of the hauntings on film , including levitating spoons , light fixtures swinging from the ceiling , and a ouija board flying across the room
ms donna ayres , who lives with partner jason heys , 45 , said the disturbances began happening in 2009 around the time her brother paul passed away
she said : ' ever since my brother died strange things have occurred in every house i âve lived in , it âs been a living hell
among the spooky happenings that ms donna ayres has recorded is a light fixture swinging from the ceiling ' probably the worst time was when i was pinned to the bed , i âll never forget it - it was very traumatic
' i believe this is happening because death has always followed me , but i have strong suspicions the spirit could be my brother , who died when i was younger
' we had a very troubled relationship , perhaps that âs why he âs come back to haunt me
' ms donna ayres said she began trying to capture the ghost 's movements on film with her camera phone after people began doubting her story
however she now believes she has angered the spirit after the spooky happenings have become more common
she added : ' the paranormal activity first started in 2009 when i began to hear bangs at night , and then scratches appeared on the wall
' since these first encounters i 've had nothing but rampant paranormal activity in every house i 've lived in , i 'm just at the end of my tether
' i have even woke up with bruises some mornings , despite not being in contact with anyone
' it 's hard to get the footage as sometimes the paranormal activity is too quick to film , but i think i 've done well to catch what i have with a basic camera phone
the mother - of - four , who lives with partner jason heys , 45 , says she has moved house five times in order to escape the ghost , but says it is following her from property to property ms donna ayres said she began recording the incidents ( which included a levitating spoon ) to convince people of her story , but now fears she may have angered the spirit ' given the rocky relationship with my brother , i genuinely believe this ghost is haunting me , not just the house which i live in , which is the most terrifying thing
' the videos have sparked a furious debate on social media , with a swathe of paranormal investigators offering to conduct a thorough paranormal investigation into the disturbances
according to sefton paranormal investigators , if the video footage is genuine , this type of paranormal phenomenon would be classified as a poltergeist - a supernatural being often blamed for physical disturbances
ms donna ayres believes the poltergeist could be brother paul ( pictured ) who died in 2009
she described their relationship as ' fraught '
