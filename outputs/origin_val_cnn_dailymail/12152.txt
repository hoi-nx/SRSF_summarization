when walter isaacson 's biography of jobs came out in october 2011 -- less than three weeks after jobs ' death -- it crystallized many popularly held perceptions of the apple co-founder
yes , jobs was brilliant
and yes , jobs also could be a bastard
walter isaacson 's book contained numerous examples of jobs ' cruel behavior , such as verbally abusing employees whose work did n't meet his exacting standards
now a new book is presenting a kinder , gentler portrait of the mercurial tech exec. " becoming jobs , " by schlender and rick tetzeli , seeks to humanize jobs through interviews with those who knew him in the latter , wildly successful phases of his career , when some of his rough edges had softened
the book , which went on sale tuesday , has created a strange irony
unlike walter isaacson 's book , it 's an unauthorized bio , one that was not given jobs ' blessing before he died
and yet apple , mindful of jobs ' legacy , has clearly endorsed this new vision of their former ceo over the walter isaacson version
" i thought the walter isaacson book did him a tremendous disservice
it was just a rehash of a bunch of stuff that had already been written , and focused on small parts of his personality , " says current apple ceo tim cook in the new book
" you get the feeling that ( jobs 's ) a greedy , selfish egomaniac
it did n't capture the person
the person i read about there is somebody i would never have wanted to work with over all this time
" other apple execs also have heaped praise on " becoming jobs " while criticizing walter isaacson 's bestseller
" best portrayal is about to be released - becoming jobs ( book )
well done and first to get it right , " tweeted eddy cue , apple 's chief of software , last week
and jony ive , apple 's head of design , said in a new yorker profile last month , " my regard ( for walter isaacson 's book ) could n't be any lower
" walter isaacson , for his part , told the new york times recently that he tried to present a balanced view of jobs : " my book is very favorable and honest , with no anonymous slings , " he said
although jobs ' life and career have been well chronicled , the new book contains some fresh tidbits : -- in 2009 , when jobs was dying of cancer , tim cook offered his boss a piece of his liver but jobs refused , saying , " no , i 'll never let you do that
" -- what was likely the last movie jobs watched before his death was an odd choice : " remember the titans , " the sentimental disney drama about a racially integrated high school football team in 1971
" i was so surprised he wanted to watch that movie , " tim cook recalled
" i was like , ' are you sure ? ' jobs was not interested in sports at all
" -- and jobs ' famous commencement speech at stanford university in 2005 almost got derailed before it started
a police officer turned him and his family away from the campus , saying the parking lot was full , and expressed skepticism that the scruffy jobs , wearing his usual jeans and black t - shirt , was really the event 's keynote speaker
raves from apple aside , early reviews of " becoming jobs " have been mixed
" ' becoming jobs ' offers a more rounded portrait of the man not only because it does n't lean as heavily on its interviews or stretch for historical weight like walter isaacson 's book , but because it brings in schlender 's personal interactions with the apple co-founder , " wrote wright for the next web
" but the closeness of schlender 's connection with jobs is also problematic , " added wright , saying " ... there 's a sense of seeking to explain away bad behavior
" " while the book never attempts to portray jobs as a saint , it provides ample evidence to suggest that the brash , perpetually impatient young millionaire learned how to control his worst tendencies , eventually becoming a loving father and respected mentor , " wrote jeremy horwitz in 9 to 5 mac. " like other good books that have been written about jobs , it does n't provide the definitive story of his life , but instead adds some new and interesting details that are worth considering alongside what was previously known
