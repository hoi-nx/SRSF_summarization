a lesbian couple have spent Â£ 13,000 having danish semen and fertility treatment shipped to their british home so their child will look like a viking
kelly and anna , both 34 , have chosen to buy sperm from danish because they want their child to have blonde hair and blue eyes and because british sperm ' does n't cut the mustard '
the married couple , from camberley , surrey , used kelly 's eggs for the insemination after receiving Â£ 300 - a - time vials of danish sperm in the post and later successfully conceived via ivf
anna and kelly cooke ( right ) , from surrey , have chosen to buy sperm from danish because they want their child to have blonde hair and blue eyes just like them and because british sperm ' does n't cut the mustard ' the married couple used kelly 's eggs for the insemination after receiving Â£ 300 - a - time vials of danish sperm in the post
anna is now pregnant and they are expecting their baby in late july anna put herself forward to carry the child so that they both had an input into the pregnancy and , after a heart - breaking miscarriage , she is now five months pregnant
kelly , a buildings manager , said : ' danish sperm is the best in the world and such high quality
' british sperm is more than double the price and just does n't cut the mustard
' at least with a dane we knew our baby would be attractive and blonde like us
' i suppose he would look a bit like a viking , but we want our son to look like us
' the pair , who got legally married in february , ordered their danish semen from cryos international - the world 's largest sperm bank which has a motto of : â congratulations , it âs a viking â
however , after inseminating anna with four vials of danish sperm , she had still not fallen pregnant so they forked out Â£ 5,000 for a round of ivf treatment
the couple said they chose to go to danish to buy the sperm because they wanted their child to look like them - blonde with blue eyes
both women are naturally blonde , although anna dyes her hair dark brown anna ( left ) put herself forward to carry the child so that they both had an input into the pregnancy and , after a heart - breaking miscarriage , she is now five months pregnant
the pair are delighted with the results of ivf anna shows of her baby bump ( left ) while partner kelly ( centre ) and a friend look on

they said they are ' so pleased ' they finally have a baby on the way that worked but she miscarried , so they spent another Â£ 5,000 on ivf and have so far bought ten vials of dutch sperm
anna is due to give birth on july 23 but the couple want to keep the sex of their fair - haired baby secret for the time being
anna , a chef , who dyes her hair brown , said : ' we are just so pleased that after spending Â£ 13,000 we finally have a little one on the way
' it does n't matter that we have rinsed our savings and scrimped and saved for years to get where we are
' her partner added : ' with my eggs and anna carrying the baby , he or she really is ours and we could n't be happier
' the couple are eagerly awaiting the arrival of their little one , but have chosen to keep the sex a secret for now kelly and anna are among thousands of british women who are flocking to danish to buy foreign sperm danish sperm now accounts for a third of the total used by british fertility clinics
women from all over the world are choosing to go scandinavian when they need a sperm donor , with shortages of homegrown sperm and better service cited as the main reasons for doing so
according to dr pacey , a fertility expert at the university of sheffield , people prefer going abroad because of a lack of british sperm donors
he said : ' we do n't have enough donors in the british to meet the national need
we do n't have the clinic infrastructure sufficient to recruit enough donors - even when men want to donate
' often there simply is n't the size and scale within small nhs clinics to consider having a donor recruitment programme - plus if you 're not confident that sufficient men are going to ring up and become sperm donors , the economics of it simply are n't going to work
' danish clinic cryos international â which is the world 's largest sperm bank â is also popular because of its customer service , according to experts
laura witjens , ceo of the national gamete donation trust , said : ' it 's much easier for a british clinic to order sperm from danish which is fed - exed the next day than to try and recruit their own donors and all the hassle that goes with them
' the danish model is customer service driven
it knows how to deal well with customers , it has a good website , and that 's what we could do in the british as well - it 's not rocket science
' choice : danish 's sperm banks , among them cryos , deploy excellent customer service to help boost sales dr pacey added : ' danish is geographically close to the british
i think there 's some sort of philosophical and intellectual bond that we have with danish
' most women flocking to danish for sperm are lesbians or single women in their 30s and 40s who do not see why a lack of partner should be a barrier to motherhood
it is only in the past few years that there has been a ' viking invasion ' of british , due to changes in the law that banned anonymous sperm donation in british , leading to a rapid decline in donors
a british sperm donor has to be prepared for the fact that any resulting child will have the right to trace them at the age of 18
however , danish sperm donors are n't anonymous and the detail given about the donor is extensive , which is part of the attraction
with a british sperm donor , you get a number and choice of hair colour , while danish sperm donors offer detail you can imagine including family background , job description , education and pictures of the man as a baby or child
one expert said : ' donors write personal messages about why they are a donor
you even get to hear their voice
' the cryos clinic has been running for 25 years and boasts 30,000 babies born worldwide
but a viking baby does n't come cheap , with danish sperm bought over the internet and delivered to an address in british costing Â£ 460 .
