the names of two missouri police commanders who resigned from their positions in the ferguson police department over racist emails have been released amid the u.s. doj 's investigation into the police department
sgt. mudd and capt. henke resigned thursday and city court clerk mary ann twitty was fired wednesday
it is unclear whether the three were recipients or senders of the ' racially biased ' emails included in the 102 - page civil rights report released wednesday by the doj accusing the department of illegal practices targeting african - americans
twitty is seen in an undated photograph smiling as wilson , the ferguson police officer who gunned down brown , an unarmed , american - american teen , has his arm around her
the two are seen appearing joyful among colleagues and friends , including ferguson mayor james knowles
' mudd is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a new orleans woman was paid by ' crimestoppers ' to terminate her pregnancy
the doj highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless , appearingly tribal , women dancing , with the caption ' michelle obama 's high school reunion
' the report states that the emails illustrate racial , ethnic , or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the doj 's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week
in fact , the report states , there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails , instead , the emails were forwarded along to others
* the list above is highlighted emails found in the doj 's 102 - page report on the ferguson police department
the investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts
officials say that at least one of the email recipients was among city leaders who met with doj officials to discuss the investigation , the dispatch reports
the report also adds that evidence found shows not only racial bias , ' but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case
' the doj 's civil rights investigation into the st. louis suburb of 21,000 came after wilson fatally shot the unarmed black teen on aug. 9 , an action that sparked nationwide protests and cast ferguson 's mostly white police force in a negative light
a grand jury did not indict wilson for killing 18 - year - old brown
though the doj found no grounds to prosecute wilson , the case did spark suspicions into the department 's practices
u.s. attorney general holder called the doj 's report ' searing , ' saying the investigation found the ferguson community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be ' disproportionately harmful to american residents
' ' this investigation found a community that was deeply polarized , ' holder said
' a community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents
' a community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue
' ferguson mayor james knowles said friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the doj , reuters reports
the mayor said the city has been carrying a surplus of nearly $ 5 million to handle expenses related to the reform
justice : the doj 's civil rights investigation into the st. louis suburb of 21,000 came after a white ferguson police officer , wilson ( right ) fatally shot an unarmed black teen , brown ( left ) on aug. 9 protests : the grand jury 's decision not to indict the ferguson police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast ferguson 's mostly white police force in a negative light james knowles said that while the doj did highlight many things in the report that must be addressed , there are also things that are an ' over reach
' james knowles did not comment on whether police chief tom jackson would step down , reuters reports , amid calls for the chief to do so by some community and civil rights leaders
the report highlighted the department 's practices saying the city 's focus on revenue greatly impacts the police department 's approach to law enforcement and the role of ferguson 's municipal court
the report states : ' the ferguson municpal court handles most charges brought by the ferguson police department , and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice , or protecting the rights of the accused , but of maximizing revenue
' the department also exhibited evidence of racial stereotyping , the report states
several ferguson officials told the doj that american residents exhibit a lack of ' personal responsibility ' which causes the group to experience harm
however , the doj found that though some people lack personal responsibility , -- including officers within the police department -- the reason american in the city experience ' disproportionate ' harm is the result of the department 's many ' systematic deficiencies
' * the list above is highlighted evidence found in the doj 's 102 - page investigation into the ferguson police department based on the department 's findings and research ferguson police department : the report found that some practices of the ferguson police department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the fourth amendment the report highlighted the fact that african - americans make ' extraordinary ' efforts to pay off overly expensive tickets for often minor , unfairly charged violations
court records and emails show that while african - americans struggled to pay the expensive tickets , city officials including the municipal judge , the court clerk , and department supervisors helped their friends , colleagues , and even themselves in eliminating tickets , fees , fines , and citations
the report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help
the clerk responded : ' your ticket of $ 200 has magically disappeared ! the report does not mention twitty by name when referring to the ' court clerk
' but in capitalizing ' court clerk , ' the report appears to refer to the head clerk -- who , the report noted , is white
the report found that some practices of the ferguson police department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the fourth amendment , which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause .
