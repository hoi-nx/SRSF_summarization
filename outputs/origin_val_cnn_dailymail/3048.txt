it is almost a full month now since the despised old regime at rangers was routed in the battle for control of ibrox
but the influence of ex-chief executive llambias continues to be felt in the blue room as the new board of directors stumble across a series of strategically - placed landmines
one particularly nasty surprise exploded into the public domain on tuesday as it emerged the price of promotion to the premiership for rangers will include an extra Â£ 500,000 payable to mike ashley
newcastle owner mike ashley will be laughing all the way to the bank if rangers win promotion mike ashley will receive payment for the loan of five newcastle players including haris vuckic ( centre ) , gael bigirimana ( left ) and streete that sizeable sum is in return for mike ashley loaning the ibrox club five of his newcastle players ; four of whom turned out to be either injured , ill or unfit
of course , the long - suffering rangers fans have grown wearily accustomed to their club being treated with contempt while ruthless businessman mike ashley lines his pockets
the support have witnessed the newcastle owner âs placemen sell the naming rights to their beloved ibrox for just Â£ 1 â albeit mike ashley subsequently gave up those rights amid a backlash from the rank and file
they then watched in disbelief as a deal was sanctioned with the billionaire âs sports direct firm that sees just 75 pence of every Â£ 10 spent on rangers merchandise going to the club
but tuesday 's revelation in the club âs latest accounts is perhaps the most depressing example of the callous regard in which the outgoing board viewed the ibrox club
in a scenario that âs being viewed at rangers as â vindictive , it âs believed that rangers â own medical staff were overruled by llambias when they insisted on medicals for the five loan rangers
had that happened , rangers would have found streete and shane ferguson were in no state to play while kevin mbabu was patently unfit
streete duly limped off 45 minutes into his debut after llambias had ordered caretaker manager kenny mcdowall to start him
proper testing would also have shown that gael bigirimana was ill , with a condition that had already been diagnosed by medics at newcastle
haris vuckic has been the only player loaned from newcastle that has been a success at ibrox 20 - year - old defender streete suffered an injury in his one and only first - team appearance for rangers of the five loan rangers , midfielder haris vuckic has been the sole success - but campaigning rangers fan houston says the situation jars when he recalls the sale of star player lewis to brentford in january
â that was done on the pretext they were protecting the future of rangers , â said houston of the sons of struth supporters group
â but i believe they only got Â£ 250,000 for lewis and then they shell out Â£ 500,000 for five loan players
â lewis would add more to the team than haris vuckic
and i would rather have lewis at ibrox on a permanent basis â increasing his value â than all five newcastle loan players , even if they were all fit
â new rangers chairman murray recently held up the decision by llambias and his then finance director , the sports direct executive barry leach , to spend Â£ 300,000 on an egm - when it was clear the old board was finished â as examples of the financial madness that has plagued rangers since liquidation
and yet another landmine was stumbled upon as it emerged auditors deloitte had informed the previous board of their intention to resign last june
defensive midfielder gael bigirimana has been ruled out of action for rangers with a mystery illness not only did the previous board fail to announce this , or seek a replacement , they inexplicably included the reappointment of deloitte on their resolution notice in november for the following month âs agm
â it âs just another example of the deplorable mismanagement at rangers , or of people burying their heads in the sand , â said houston
â the resolution was passed in december but deloitte were long gone as auditors
â as rangers revealed losses after tax of Â£ 2.89million for the six - month period to 31 december 2014 , the accounts reiterated two emphasis of matter warnings outlined in full - year accounts signed off by deloitte relating to the company âs ability to trade as a going concern
but new chairman murray confirmed sportsmail âs exclusive that the club is planning a rights issue in the summer to raise funds - believed to be Â£ 10m â to sustain the club in the medium and long term
in his statement , murray said the club would become â self - sustaining â and â free from the kind of funding crises that have plagued rangers in recent years
â he vowed that , under the new board , the ibrox club would be back competing at the top level at home and in european by 2022 - in time for the 50th anniversary of the club âs 1972 european cup winners â cup triumph in barcelona
stuart mccall is a ' strong candidate ' to extend his position as rangers boss beyond the end of the season describing interim boss stuart mccall as a â strong candidate â for the permanent position , murray called on fans to back his board by investing in season tickets
he said : â the vision is to focus on the next seven years so that by 2022 , the club âs 150th anniversary and the 50th anniversary of barcelona , we , rangers , will be back at the very top
â over the next few years the finance we are putting in place now will provide the infrastructure and personnel at murray park to make sure rangers are competing and winning in scotland âs top flight as well as stepping back into the european arenas again
â then for the three or four years after that all our efforts will be directed towards making rangers stronger and european regulars as our 150th year approaches
that year should be one of celebration
â a massive rebuild is required at every level and in every department of this huge club of ours and we can not and will not shy away from those tasks
â after years of mismanagement we need patience and support
we must never forget what has happened to our club in the last four years
the new board will ensure that it never happens again
this is our club , we have taken ownership of it and with our 2022 vision we will not fail
