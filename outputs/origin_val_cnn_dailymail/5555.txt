the equality and human rights commission , chaired by baroness onora o'neill , said the human rights act has ' proved its value ' tory mps reacted angrily last night after a supposedly impartial Â£ 19million - a - year taxpayer - funded quango tore into the party âs plans to reform human rights law
despite there being under two months to the election , the equality and human rights commission piled into the political debate over the future of labour âs human rights act
in a statement posted on the commission âs website , backed by a letter to mps , it claimed that changes â to human rights laws that would water down the protections we all enjoy , would be â regressive â and undermine great britain âs reputation as a global leader that can challenge human rights abuses abroad â
the quango also declared the human rights act a success , saying it had â consistently proved its value â
this is despite the way it has been repeatedly used by foreign criminals and terrorists to avoid deportation
the tories have a manifesto commitment to scrap the human rights act and replace it with a uk bill of rights
justice secretary chris grayling also plans to give great britain âs supreme court the final say over human rights cases â not the echr in strasbourg
but senior tory figures view the commission âs intervention as a nakedly political act
as a quango , in receipt of Â£ 18.7million of public money last year , it is supposed to remain outside the political fray
government sources said it had not even got its facts right
in the letter to mps , it said : â uk courts do not have to follow the judgements of the strasbourg court
our courts only need to take account of such judgements â
but a senior government source said : â for a start , it is plain wrong to claim that our courts are not bound by decisions made by echr in strasbourg
â this taxpayer - funded quango of labour âs creation is deliberately trying to play politics on the eve of an election
â tory mp michael ellis , part of the home affairs select committee , said : â this is grossly improper so close to an election from a quango which receives millions of pounds of taxpayers â money
tory mps blasted the online statement , calling it a nakedly political act , which had got its facts wrong
the post said uk courts were not bound by the echr ( pictured ) , when in fact they are ' this country was protecting human rights when many members of the eu were under dictatorships and well before labour âs human rights act , which has only served to create extra tiers of bureaucracy , legal costs , delays and an imbalance of justice
â fellow tory mp dominic raab said : â the commission âs intervention shows just how politicised this self - serving quango has become
â their blanket opposition to any re-balancing of our skewed human rights law ignores the concerns expressed by countless senior uk judges , and displays an arrogant contempt for the basic principle of democratic accountability we âve lost in this area
â the commission was established by labour in 2006 â to protect and promote equality and human rights in great britain â
in 2011 , home secretary theresa may decided to scale back its powers drastically after a report found the commission had â struggled â to do its job , while providing low - quality work and poor value for money
equality and human rights commission chief executive mark hammond said : â we are at a crossroads for human rights
one path risks undermining and diminishing our influence and status as a global leader in human rights and civil liberties
â the other will safeguard our reputation for fairness and moral authority when confronting human rights abuses abroad
