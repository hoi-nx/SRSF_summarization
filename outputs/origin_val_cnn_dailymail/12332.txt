i met gissendaner in january 2010 in a nondescript classroom at metro state prison for women in atlanta
she arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four atlanta seminaries
since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement , gissendaner was particularly eager to share community with others , if only one morning a week
and she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the bible and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her devotional life
that image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who gissendaner is â who she has become : someone full of contagious joy and gratitude , open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry
gissendaner 's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband , doug gissendaner
a pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult , yet compassionate , conversations that urged her toward courageous self - reflection
this same pastor has been visiting gissendaner for almost 16 years
her commitment to gissendaner , along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns , provided steady , ongoing love that fostered change
so by the time i met gissendaner in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation
she was , in the words of the apostle paul , a " new creation " ( 2 cor. 5:17 )
in the theology program , gissendaner found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on christian faith could be a gift to the wider church " on the outside , " as well as in prison
by studying historical and contemporary christian thinkers , gissendaner became part of the conversations that make the christian tradition dynamic
she asked honest questions about her relationship to god , others and the world
she read scripture and grappled with centuries - old theological questions
she discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work
" from the start of the theology class i felt this hunger , " she said in her 2011 graduation speech
" i became so hungry for theology , and what all the classes had to offer ; you could call me a glutton
" one of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students holistically , not only as thinkers , but also as human beings wrestling with some of life 's most urgent questions
my relationship with gissendaner had this quality from the start
but it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison
in her graduation speech , gissendaner described this moment : " there came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- i was pulled from the courses
i was taken from my theological community
being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down
" since i could n't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me
still , this was far from being ideal because now i had to have class and community through a gate
it was hard ... but i pushed on
i pushed on because of that hunger
that gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me
but that gate could n't keep out the knowledge that i was so hungry for , nor friendship and community
and it sure could n't keep out god
" this change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one - on - one conversation every friday
we continued to read theological texts together , including a book by then - archbishop of canterbury williams
williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories , " the ruins of the past , " and building from them here and now
restoration , williams writes , " is going back to the memories of the painful , humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to christ [ who ] comes to repair the devastation
" i sat with gissendaner as she went back over some of her own painful memories , took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done
indeed , the power of these moments -- when gissendaner looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins , when we spoke of god 's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever
gissendaner embraced what bonhoeffer , a german pastor - theologian and nazi resister , calls " costly grace
" for bonhoeffer , " cheap grace " is seeking god 's forgiveness as a " cover - up for one 's sins , for which one has no remorse and ... even less desire to be set free
" in contrast , costly grace requires rigorously following jesus in a way that leads to continuous , visible transformation , what the new testament calls the fruits of redemption
the fruits of gissendaner 's redemption are now well - documented : reconciliation with her children , ministry to inmates full of despair , counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others
on the night gissendaner thought would be her last , she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates , urging them not to worry about her , but to be encouraged
most poignant for gissendaner are the writings of german theologian moltmann , who is widely known as the " theologian of hope " and with whom gissendaner began corresponding in 2010
moltmann shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave
rather , hope makes manifest the kingdom of god now -- god 's intended social order " on earth as it is in heaven " ( matt. 6:10 )
biblical hope " revolutionizes and transforms the present
" it is the hope of the psalmist who " looks for the goodness of god in this life " ( ps 27:13 )
in the words of gissendaner 's favorite scripture , it is a hope that proclaims : " i shall not die but live , and declare the works of the lord " ( ps 118:17 )
in gissendaner 's own words : " the theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that , despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head , i still possess the ability to prove that i am human
labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things
but no matter the label attached to me , i have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact ... even prison can not erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me , or anyone
" many people have asked me in recent days how i have been transformed by my friendship with gissendaner and by gissendaner 's journey of hope
while i struggle to find adequate words , what i do know is that gissendaner 's story pushes the logic of christian faith to its outermost limits
it pushes christians to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance , forgiveness , redemption and hope
indeed , even professional theologians and life - long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make
today , gissendaner 's life hangs in the balance
the state of georgia on monday issued a last - minute postponement of her execution , citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her
the department of corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete
while gov. nathan deal does not have the formal power to commute gissendaner 's sentence to life in prison , i join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation , including more than 500 from georgia , who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save gissendaner 's life and to speak out publicly against her execution
i call on all people of good will to reach out to gov. deal and to georgia state legislators to demand a more just , merciful , and accountable system of justice -- for gissendaner and for all
as theologian richard amesbury wrote , " if the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected , then none of us is without hope
" we need to hear gissendaner proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of god are real .
