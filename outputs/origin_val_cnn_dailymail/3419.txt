depay ( right ) , in action on sunday night against ajax , is attracting interest from the premier league the 21 - year - old forward has scored 21 goals in 31 appearances for psv so far this season louis van gaal is interested in the player , who he called up to the holland squad for the world cup in brazil ' tottenham were willing to offer â¬ 20m for depay , ' he told dutch broadcaster nos. ' we decided to keep hold of him , but he has the option to leave after this season
' depay and psv colleague georginio wijnaldum are expected to attract a number of high - profile suitors , with the latter being eyed up by paris saint-germain

' depay ( left ) celebrates with international team - mate arjen robben during holland 's game with chile in 2014 depay turned down a move to tottenham last summer , but could leave for england in the next window depay is familiar with current man united manager louis van gaal due to their time spent together with holland , and reports in the summer stated that the player 's decision to stay with psv was heavily influenced by van gaal
therefore , depay 's decision on which club to choose if he does leave psv may be swayed by van gaal and man united , who also have depay 's international team - mate daley blind in their ranks
the forward has scored 21 goals in 31 appearances in all competitions this season .
