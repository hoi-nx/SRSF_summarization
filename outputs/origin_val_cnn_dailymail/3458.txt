' eight - year - old sarah was abducted by paedophile roy whiting as she played with older brothers luke and lee and younger sister charlotte in a field outside her grandparents ' rural home in kingston gorse , west sussex in july 2000
michael payne and his then wife sara made a series of heart - rending appeals for her safe return , but her body was discovered 16 days later in a shallow grave just a few miles away
roy whiting was sentenced to life behind bars in january 2001 , and is held at hmp wakefield , dubbed the monster mansion due to the number of high risk sex offenders imprisoned there
it later emerged that whiting was already on the sex offenders register after abducting and sexually attacking another eight - year - old
her brutal death remains one of britain 's highest profile child murders and led to the introduction of sarah 's law following a lengthy campaign by her mother
the rule allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend , or a neighbour , who has contact with a child , has a history of child sex offending
sarah 's father , michael , died aged 45 last october after a long battle with alcoholism
her mother was awarded an mbe in 2008 for her campaign work .
