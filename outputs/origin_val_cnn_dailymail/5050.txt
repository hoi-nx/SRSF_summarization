with their exit from the fa cup against arsenal , manchester united 's attention now rests solely on their premier league campaign
supporters wo n't expect louis van gaal to be winning any silverware this season , but a top four finish is a must for a club that invested heavily in the summer

with liverpool just a point behind manchester united in the league , and tottenham a further two points behind them , van gaal knows he ca n't afford to slip up
his record against the top six , though , is not especially encouraging
a fortuitous win at arsenal and comfortable victory against an out - of - form liverpool are the only notable moments
monday 's fa cup tie proves the gunners will be no pushover and liverpool are unbeaten in the league since their loss at old trafford in 2014
