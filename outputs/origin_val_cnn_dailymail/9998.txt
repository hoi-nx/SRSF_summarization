every mp in the country is to get a brand new ipad after the general election , costing the tax payer Â£ 1million
the house of commons commission claimed that offering all 650 ministers a new laptop or ipads air 2 , would actually save money
liberal democrat thurso , who represents the commission in the chamber , said moving away from apple 's products would be too expensive
caught in the act : tory mp mills was caught playing candy crush on his taxpayer - funded ipads last december but shadow cabinet office minister chi onwurah criticised the decision to lock mps into the apple operating system and told computerworld uk she would have preferred a ' device agnostic ' policy
' as we saw with mills and candy crush , mps will be using the games , and the itunes and other features on the ipads , ' she added
' locking some of the most powerful people in the country into a platform that most of my constituents ca n't afford seems like a mistake
and that 's without mentioning the tax avoidance issue
i 'm pushing for a device independent digital platform for parliament
' liberal democrat thurso claimed a move away from apple 's operating system would incur more costs apple ipads have been used across parliament since a pilot scheme was launched in 2012
currently 209 mps have taxpayer - funded tablets with the understanding they use them for working while on the move in parliament
but last december a tory mp was caught playing a game on his ipads for more than two hours during a meeting
mills escaped punishment after he admitted having a â game or two â of candy crush and promised not to do it again
mr mills , the mp for amber valley in derbyshire , was supposed to be listening to experts give evidence at a meeting of the commons work and pensions committee
he had initially said he would merely â try â not to be diverted by the game again , but yesterday afternoon in a statement he said : â i guarantee it will not happen again
in 2013 , the house of commons commission agreed to a recommendation from the administration committee that ' a tablet and a laptop should be the first pieces of equipment offered to all members after the 2015 election '
the house of commons commission assessed a range of tablets with prices ranging from Â£ 100 to Â£ 600 and where they decided on the ipad air 2
the cost of supplying the new ipads would be Â£ 200,000 a year over the life of the next parliament
mr thurso said the decision to buy the new gadgets was to avoid spending more money on training staff to use non-apple systems and to reduce hard copy printing in favour of online publication which was already saving more than Â£ 3 million annually
the house of commons commission said that buying the 650 mps an ipad air 2 each , worth Â£ 499 , will save money ' having been in use across parliament since 2012 , ipads are integrated with current business processes and infrastructure , ' he said
' a move away from the apple operating system ( ios ) at this time would incur costs to change these processes
' members are able to access the intranet and intranet hosted services via their ipads , they are able to access and annotate committee papers and can download a number of office apps to access any content held within office 365
' there would be a significant change to move existing members to a different tablet operating system
any departure from ios would require re-training for the current members using ios and new training to be developed for the remaining 441 members and all relevant pict support staff
