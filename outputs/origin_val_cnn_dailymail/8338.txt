a man at his wit 's end after inexplicably piling on 150lbs in just a year has finally had his medical mystery solved after being diagnosed with cushing 's disease - a rare form of brain tumor
trotman , a father - of - two in his thirties from new york 's staten island , underwent a series of tests by doctors who could n't figure out his mysterious symptoms - major weight gain concentrated only to his upper body , as well as skin problems and crippling fatigue - but it was a medical intern who solved the riddle when he noticed unusual tell - tale stretch marks on his arms
luckily for mr trotman , who told today he had never been ' skinny ' , but never been ' overweight ' before got sick , surgery to remove the mass was successful , and doctors expect him to make a full recovery within a year
he was 180lbs when he was 18 , but after his illness took hold , he rocketed up to 366lbs
cushing 's disease is caused by a tumor on the pituitary gland , located at the base of the brain
it triggers excess levels of the steroid cortisol to be released in the body
symptoms include upper body obesity , a swollen face , acne , skin bruising and purple stretch marks
untreated , cushing 's disease can be fatal , but the prognosis is good if the growth is surgically removed in time
the disease affects fewer than 50,000 people in the u.s. each year
' i doubled , like , i got a whole person on me , ' he said
' it was just specific places ; my stomach , under my arms , my back of my neck , my face , the bottom of my back
' my legs stayed the same for a long time
' despite running and lifting weights , he continued to expand , and was soon so tired all the time that even chewing left him out of breath
unbeknownst to mr trotman , the tumor on his pituitary gland was causing his brain to produce vast amounts of a natural steroid called cortisol
mr trotman went to new york 's lennox hill hospital after he started experiencing double vision , but a slew of tests got doctors nowhere
it was a medical intern who one day noticed his unusual stretch marks and suggested he could be suffering from cushing 's disease , which affects fewer than 50,000 people in the u.s. each year , and is fatal unless treated in time
