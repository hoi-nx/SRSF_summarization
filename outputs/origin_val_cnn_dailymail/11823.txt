balotelli has scored just one premier league goal this season - and cryptically revealed on wednesday that ' someone does n't like me '
and his agent raiola says rodgers is asking more of him than any other manager has done in a career that has seen him work under the likes of jose mourinho and roberto mancini
balotelli has spent a fair amount of time on the bench after finding it tough to meet expectations liverpool manager rodgers asks balotelli to track back , something he has never been asked to do ' right now , i think balotelli has a very interesting development for his career , ' raiola said
' he has found a coach who asks of him things that had never been requested of him until now , including the discipline of running without the ball
but raiola sees the challenge issued to balotelli as a positive - despite the expectation that he will be cast off by the anfield club in the summer
' this allows him to grow as a person and as a football player , ' raiola told rmc
' he 'll come out even stronger
' balotelli is again expected to start on the bench when liverpool face blackburn rovers in their fa cup quarter - final on sunday
