sports star : hayes , a sophomore forward for the wisconsin badgers , confidentially sat down to attend a press conference at the staples center in los angeles with two fellow players caught on camera : but failing to realize the mic was running , the sportsman whispered to his teammate ' god she 's beautiful ' after spotting 43 - year - old bollman ( left ) - a stenographer for asap sports did you hear that ? as the audience started to snigger , hayes quickly realized he 'd been heard as the audience started to snigger , hayes quickly realized he 'd been heard
' did you hear that ? ' he quipped to the crowd before cradling his head in his hands
' alright we 'll open it up to questions ! ' the announcer then said through laughter , in a bid to move things on
bollman , who is from riverside , california , has apparently been approached by media outlets after being singled out by hayes
indeed , the brunette 's daughter sophia , who is a singer , tweeted : ' i 've been working to get out there for years and my mom gets called beautiful by a basketball player and extra is calling ... like what ? ' red - faced : hayes cradled his head in his hands in embarrassment joker : hayes , who grew up in toledo , ohio , has caused quite a raucous on the microphone recently , testing stenographers with trick words such as ' cattywampus ' , ' antidisestablishmentarianism ' and ' soliloquy ' when she 's not writing up sports news , bollman works as a real estate agent
it appears the blunder has also expanded hayes ' fanbase
many commenters have deemed his slip - up ' cute ' and ' endearing '
