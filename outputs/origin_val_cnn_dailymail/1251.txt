â when the bus pulled up i went to get on after a few people and , like i usually do , i folded up my cane and showed the driver my card , â megan johnston told daily mail australia
megan johnston , from wellington , in new zealand , was shocked when a bus driver refused to believe she was blind despite showing him her concessions bus pass and cane the bus pass , issued by nz bus , clearly states â blind person â on it
â it just gets me a dollar off my fare which i thought i may as well use , â megan johnston said
as she handed over her $ 2 fare the driver refused to take her money as she explained the pass simply gets her a concession fare
â he said â yeah but you are not blind are you ? â and started laughing , â megan johnston said
â i said â are you kidding me â and he said â well how did you get on the bus , you can obviously see things â , â she recalled
megan johnston âs hereditary condition , retinitis pigmentosa , means her eyesight is approximately 170 degrees worse than a person with perfect eyesight and leaves her with no peripheral vision
shocked by his assumption that she was lying about being blind , megan johnston told the bus driver she has â five per cent vision â and he responded : â that âs not actually blind is it
â megan johnston 's bus pass , issued by nz bus , clearly states ' blind person ' on it but the driver simply laughed at her the 28 - year - old has a degenerative eye disease that has left her with just five per cent vision â i was really shocked
i took my money and got off the bus â¦ i should be able to get on the bus without being questioned , â megan johnston said
â i was just devastated
i was on my way into town to meet a friend and it âs taken a long time for me to be confident using my cane and be not judged
â upset and in tears , megan johnston fired off a message on twitter to the bus company and was told to call their generic customer service line
â i said â hey your bus driver just laughed at me and said i was nât blind despite having a cane and a card â
they gave me the general metlink number
â when megan johnston rang the company in tears she was told they would get back to her in two to three weeks
since her story was first published in the dominion post , the go wellington bus company has been in touch to apologise
megan johnston , a talented artist who drew the above illustration of herself , uses a walking cane to assist her in getting around with her extreme tunnel vision retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited , degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment and often blindness
it dramatically effects peripheral vision and is often described as extreme tunnel vision
the degeneration is progressive and has no known cure
but megan johnston believes there needs to be more awareness around the fact there are varying degrees of blindness
â i am constantly confronted by people who think blindness is black and white
but there is a big variation , â megan johnston explained
megan johnston has had her cane for around a year and a half and it is nât known at what rate , or if , her eyesight will continue to deteriorate
â i have nât been on a bus since then and i definitely do nât feel comfortable
i also have a card for half price taxi fares so i feel more comfortable using that now , â she said
since becoming legally blind megan johnston , a talented artist and designer , has battled with not only her difficulty in seeing what âs around her but also people âs perceptions of her disability
â i âve always had artistic tendencies but people find it hard to deal with because it âs such a visual thing
it took her a long time before she began feeling confident enough to use her cane ( pictured ) in public â the fact of the matter is i do have intact middle vision and it âs there and fine and it âs more than i need to draw illustrations
it also means i can work from home and do nât have to go out , â she said
megan johnston inherited her retinitis pigmentosa , which can not be cured , from her father and is considered legally blind
in an article she wrote for the website on the left , megan johnston described how â getting around in public became increasingly hard a few years ago â
â i was constantly getting in people âs way
people were in a hurry and were huffing and puffing and occasionally swearing at me
they were nât to know , but it made me feel horrible
if i bumped into just one person , it would rattle me and ruin my entire day , â she wrote
the illustrator reasoned : â blindness comes in many , many forms and just because we ca nât see one thing , it does nât mean we ca nât see another
