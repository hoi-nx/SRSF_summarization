brown has spoken for the first time about â one of the worst experiences of my life â â missing out on a precious england cap
the 29 - year - old full - back returns against scotand on saturday , a month after being knocked unconscious 12 minutes into england âs victory over italy
brown missed the defeat by ireland after experiencing headaches while attempting to complete strict return - to - play protocols
brown is ready to return to england 's starting xv after missing the ireland defeat two weeks ago brown was knocked unconscious just 12 minutes into the win over italy and was ruled out for two weeks the england full back was treated on the pitch but could not continue as stuart lancaster 's side won 47 - 17 after agonising about owning up to his symptoms , knowing it would see him miss the trip to dublin , he reluctantly alerted team doctors about his concussion
â pulling out is one of the worst things i âve ever had to go through in my whole life , â brown said
â as a sportsman everything you work towards is pulling on your country âs jersey and representing everyone in the country
â i went to see the doctor about 8.30 in the morning â i usually get up about 7.30 to 8 â and during that time i was sat in my room thinking should i try the next stage , should i carry on ? i âve trained through headaches before so i could definitely have trained on and seen how it went
brown is back in training and ready to play against scotland at twickenham on saturday brown is supporting the rfu 's latest concussion awareness initiative after missing the ireland game â but it would nât have been good preparation for the team or me having that in the back of my mind
and obviously there âs the serious implications of the dangers and the risks involved
â the way i am , stubborn , desperate to play for my country , i probably would have ( hidden symptoms in the past )
but we âre all aware of it now and the example has been set by the england medical team and the coaching staff here for everyone else to see
â brown , who wins his 36th cap on saturday , watched england âs defeat at home with his fiancee eliza
â i was fuming , he said
â i was nât happy at all
unfortunately , my fiancee had to go through it with me , poor lady
it was nât something i want to be doing too regularly , sat in my lounge , on the edge of my sofa , screaming at the tv ! â the england star admitted it was a bitter blow to be absent for the game in dublin , but he had to be honest
