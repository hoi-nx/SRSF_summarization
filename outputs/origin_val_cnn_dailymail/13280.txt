a bill that would allow utah to use firing squads to execute some death - row prisoners passed in the state senate on tuesday
the measure , which passed 18 to 10 , will be sent to gov. herbert , who has not said whether he will sign it into law or veto the bill
herbert released a statement on the legislation , which would add death by firing squad as an option in a state that uses lethal injection
" our statute is clear that lethal injection is the method by which ( an execution ) will happen
we have no intent to change that , " he said
the law would give the state the option to use a five - member squad in cases where the drugs necessary for lethal injection are n't available 30 days before the date set for the execution
" our state , as is the case with states around the country , is finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the substances required to perform a lethal injection
we are dedicated to pursuing all reasonable and legal options to obtain those substances to make sure that , when required , we are in a position to carry out this very serious sentence by lethal injection , " the governor said
eight people are on utah 's death row
utah banned death by firing squad in 2004 , though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death
the last execution by firing squad was in 2010 , and it was also the most recent execution in utah
a utah firing squad also executed gary gilmore in 1977 , the first death by capital punishment after the u.s. supreme court reinstated the death penalty the prior year
in recent years , states have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions
texas nearly out of execution drug the european manufacturers of pentobarbital , an anesthetic , explicitly banned u.s. prisons from using its drug in executions
some states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three - drug cocktail
in april , oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three - drug cocktail in an execution that went awry
clayton lockett , a convicted rapist and murderer , writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered
it took 43 minutes for him to die
last week , georgia postponed an execution because the drugs appeared " cloudy
" the state also indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures , officials said
