it is one of the most important rules of the road , always stop and look before pulling out at a junction
but this motorcyclist cut it a little too close as his bike crept out onto a main road , straight into the path of a speeding lorry
the terrifying footage , captured by a dashboard camera in khabarovsk , russia , shows the moment the man 's bike is swept away under the wheels of the lorry â but the rider miraculously escapes with his life
the moped rider looks tentative from the start of the clip as he eventually makes his way to the front of the queue of cars captured at the start of the clip , the man on the moped appears to attempt braking as he reaches the junction but seems to lose control and move forward further than expected
the car , recording the footage from behind the bike , shows the moment it jumps forward , straight into the path of the oncoming lorry
hitting the lorry âs back wheels , the bike is pulled away from underneath its rider as his head is thrown back violently by the impact
suddenly the moped rider appears to lose control and speeds up , crashing into the side of the moving lorry the moped âs top box is also hurled down the road by the lorry and more worryingly so is the man âs helmet , which becomes detached during the crash
as the bike lands mangled in front of the first car waiting at the junction , fuel begins leaking from it and onto the road
remarkably however the man almost immediately appears from the wreckage and jogs back to the side road
the impact from the crash with the lorry forces the man 's head backwards and throws the moped down the road his t - shirt appears to be ripped and he throws himself down onto the floor as a pedestrian approaches him to see if he is okay
the filmmaker reverses his car and the man â who writhes on the floor , seemingly more in shock than pain â comes back into the shot
according to the video uploaded online , the man was lucky to escape the accident with only scratches
the man 's head is thrown back violently by the impact of the crash and his helmet later becomes detached the top box on the back of the moped is thrown down the road along with the bike itself after it collides with the lorry
