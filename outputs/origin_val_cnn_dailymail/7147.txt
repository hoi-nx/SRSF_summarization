â if you look at his plans for the next parliament , as the independent obr say , the cuts in public spending under the george osborne plan are more severe in the next three years than in the last five
â his desire to get to an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts in the next three years to our police , our defence forces than we 've seen in the last few years

he 's going to end up either cutting our national health service or raising vat
