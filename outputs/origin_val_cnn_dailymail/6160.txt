it 's a shame but it 's always like hat
' i would absolutely urge all those youngsters in the squad , such as raheem sterling and kane , to watch and learn off rooney from this day onwards
' they are extremely lucky to be on the same training pitch as this guy and they must make the most of it
it will be a real waste if they do not
' they must try to copy him
in terms of his dedication and the way he plays
i would also say this to the young lads at manchester united
rooney heads in the opening goal past lithuania goalkeeper arlauskis at wembley rooney heads the ball past arlauskis to give england the lead in friday 's euro 2016 qualifier ' to play well for six months or a season in football is nothing
to do so for over a decade like rooney is extraordinary
i know what it takes and it is n't easy
' trust me , people talk about him outside of this country
in spain and france , he is appreciated as a top , top player
' meanwhile , rooney has admitted that the excitement generated by kane , who scored just 79 seconds after coming on as a substitute in the 4 - 0 win over lithuania , reminds him of his early games for england at the age of 17
rooney was a teenage sensation for england twelve years ago and caused even more of a stir when he starred in england âs 2 - 0 win over turkey in 2003
rooney said : â there was one stage in the game , after his [ kane 's ] goal , where he ran down the left and took a few players on which reminded me of that

â it 's incredible really
you can feel the excitement around the country
you could tell when he came on everyone wanted him to come on and even he himself did n't think he 'd score so quick , but we are all delighted for him
' he 's an exciting player
when you speak to him you can see he is a level headed guy and i am sure he has good people around him so will be able to cope with it
rooney starred on his england debut against turkey in 2003 , at the age of 17 rooney ( centre ) said kane 's debut reminded him of his early games for his country â there are things i could say to advise him but i think there are things you have to learn on your own , which i am sure he will do in the next year or two
' he is obviously a little bit older than i was and a bit wiser as i was 16 or 17 when i came in
but he is level headed and can cope
â i think people try to help you but it is best to learn on your own
when you are a young lad you do make mistakes and you have to learn from them because it will make you a better player
