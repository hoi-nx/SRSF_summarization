an america saga of redemption and recovery unfolded in dramatic style at the wgc-cadillac championship at doral on sunday
wearing red was holmes , who has recovered so hearteningly from two bouts of gruelling brain surgery four years ago
wearing blue was dustin johnson , the party boy who took a six - month leave of absence to mend his wild ways
in the end it was the man hell - bent on his redemptive mission who came out on top as dustin johnson closed with a final round 69 to win by one from holmes , who had begun the final round with a five shot lead
dustin johnson ( right ) celebrates with his caddie austin johnson on the eighteenth hole at doral dustin johnson proudly holds the wgc-cadillac championship trophy following his victory on sunday ' it means everything to win again , ' said dustin johnson , who admitted his break was due to issues with alcohol and was competing in just his fifth event on his return
' it has been a tough road but a lot of good has come out of it and i feel great now
this has to be the best win of my career
' dustin johnson has long had a reputation as one of america 's most gifted talents but was in danger of throwing it all away
now he looks a reformed character
the latest world rankings out on monday are likely to show him up to 6th and he ' s quite capable of giving rory mcilroy a run for his money at the top
masters champion bubba watson led briefly but paid for a bad stretch of three bogeys in four holes from the 11th and finished third
dustin johnson went the other way , playing his last 11 holes so artfully that he completed the sequence in a telling three under par. it was hard not to feel sorry for holmes
he had opened the tournament with a 62 that was so good it might well stand as the round of the year
but he blew his chances with a terrible start that saw his five shot lead dwindle to nothing before the first 90 minutes of play was completed
dustin johnson celebrates his birdie on the 15th hole during the final round of action on sunday as for rory mcilroy , his troubles with the plethora of water hazards continued right to the end , as he put not only his drive on the 18th into the water , but his third shot as well
before the start of his final round , donald trump , preposterous owner of this overrated venue , had presented rory mcilroy with the three iron he had tossed infamously into the water on friday , after it was retrieved by a scuba diver
rory mcilroy took it out of his bag once on sunday - to play that third shot at the last
thanks a lot , donald , he must have been thinking
rory mcilroy shaped up to throw the offending implement into the water once more , but this time kept hold of it
it was a moment of light relief at the end of a seriously trying week for the world number one
bubba watson led briefly but paid for a bad stretch of three bogeys in four holes from the 11th at least he finished off with a more typical example of his artistry
through the back of the green and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple bogey seven or still worse , rory mcilroy chipped the ball in for a six
even so , it rather undid the good work he displayed earlier , and meant he signed for a 71
he still finished in the top ten , though
all those missed putts and shots into the water , and still only a handful of players beat him
' it was certainly an adventurous week and the game 's just not quite there , ' he admitted
' i 'm pretty disappointed with the way i played overall
but there were signs of improvement
' he will look to build on those during a two day trip to augusta national , beginning on monday
he will play just one more tournament â the arnold palmer invitational next week â before his historic tilt at a career grand slam at the masters next month
rory mcilroy plays a shot on the second hold during a disappointing final day of action for the world no 1 round of the day came from england 's danny willett , who shot 68 to finish tied 12th
this was a fine confidence boost for the 27 - year - old yorkshireman ahead of his first appearance at the masters
' i 'm obviously very pleased , ' he said
' it 's a tough course and the set - up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week , i 'd have bitten your hand off if you 'd offered me that on thursday
when you 're playing with the top 50 you know they 're not going to give you anything , but i 'm feeling more comfortable all the time playing at this level
' how far can he go ? one area of concern remains a chronic back injury that has caused him to withdraw from plenty of tournaments over the years and one this year already
' i 'm taking painkillers and managing it , ' he said
' i 'm going to stay over here through the masters because flying back and forth is no good for it
there 's no point worrying about it , i 've just got to get on with it
' he is doing that all right .
