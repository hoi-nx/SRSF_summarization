ali , 30 , stabbed his 27 - year old partner kausar during a row at their home in rochdale , greater manchester , after she made it clear she wanted to enrol at college to study english
greater manchester crown court heard how he grabbed a knife and , in front of his own mother , stabbed his wife more than a dozen times as he refused to accept that she wanted to gain a ' degree of independence '
following the attack on september 29 last year , ali fled the scene and ms kausar was left lying in a pool of the blood on the floor
she was later flown to hospital where doctors carried out two emergency operations to heal stab wounds to her neck , collarbone , abdomen , ribs and a severed artery which caused her to lose one third of her body 's blood
ali has now pleaded guilty to attempted murder and has been jailed for 14 years by the judge who called him a ' dangerous man '
the court heard how the incident unfolded after ms kausar returned home from the jobcentre and told her husband that she had been advised to enrol at college to improve her english
he told his mother , who was living with the couple at the property , that he was not going to allow his wife to join the course , and an argument ensued
the couple had known each other for 16 years and married in pakistan in 2005 before moving to the uk together in 2008
mark kellet , prosecuting , said : ' when the defendant and kausar were upstairs in their bedroom , he became angry and started shouting and slapped her across the head
she asked for her mobile phone so she could contact her sister or the police , but he refused to return it
' she left the house to walk to her sister 's address but was followed by the defendant
she asked for help from a bystander but the defendant apologised and they returned home
once they had returned home they sat in the kitchen with the defendant 's mother
' kausar told the defendant if he were to behave in a similar manner again , she would leave him
' he became angry and punched her , knocking her to the floor
he picked up a knife from a kitchen drawer and repeatedly stabbed her
' she described it as " the way he stabbed me , it was like dying "
she begged him to stop , which he did , before running from the house
' ali 's mother provided a statement to the court which said the pair had been abusive towards each other and ali had stabbed his wife when she ran at him
when ms kausar was taken to hospital , x-rays revealed she had blood within her chest , which had to be drained , and that she was bleeding from an artery
she also had further stab wounds to her liver , colon and pancreas
she has since started to recover from her injuries but is still undergoing surgical treatment and has a constant pain in her left shoulder
she said the incident had changed her life significantly and that she had even even contemplated self - harm as a result of the attack
ali stabbed his wife after becoming angry at their home in rochdale , greater manchester ( pictured ) , when she told him she wanted to enrol at college to learn english
he left her for dead after the attack and fled the scene the court heard how ali handed himself in to police the day after the attack
the judge was also told how he was convicted in 2009 for his part in a burglary in which he and an accomplice forced their way into a family home , gagged a 40 - year - old woman and threatened her and her baby with a screwdriver
ian harris , defending , said : ' his family have told me that when they visited the defendant he has been in tears when he has discussed what he did
' a letter he has written may be starting to point towards maturity which clearly has n't been demonstrated hitherto
he has set out how deeply sorry and remorseful he is for his actions towards his wife and family
' it is a case of loss of temper
an intent to kill formed in the heat of the moment
the incident itself would have taken a matter of seconds
' passing sentence , judge david stockdale qc told ali : ' there was an argument between you , triggered , it seems , by her express wish to attend a college course to improve her english
' that wish was , in my judgement , a wish for a degree of independence on her part , which you would not tolerate
' your desire to dominate and control her , it seems to me , lies at the heart of the dreadful events which were to follow
' the attack was sustained and repeated
there was extensive life - threatening internal injuries
you took a lethal bladed weapon and used it repeatedly on a defenceless woman - your own wife in her own home
' you are , in my judgement , a dangerous man
i am unhesitatingly of the opinion there is a significant risk of serious harm from future offences committed by you
' following the sentencing , detective sergeant louise ashurst described the attempted murder as ' one of the most brutal and horrific attacks i have experienced as a detective
' she said : ' the injuries she suffered were so severe that the first officer on the scene thought she was dead , her defensive injuries showed that he stabbed her with such force that the knife went right through her hand , breaking her forefinger
' it was only after the officer felt for her pulse , that he realised she was still alive and even then it was touch and go , with the victim undergoing life - threatening surgery and several harrowing weeks in intensive care
' but the victim was strong and brave , and i hope this sentence goes some way to helping her overcome what has happened
