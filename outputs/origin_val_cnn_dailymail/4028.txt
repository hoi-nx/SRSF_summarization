a store clerk manged to foil an armed robber with just the swat of his hand
the workers , who was behind the counter at the ok food store in houston , texas early thursday morning , got the shock of his life when a young man pulled a gun on him and demanded money as he opened the register
rather than hand over the bills however , the clerk , who is not being identified , started hitting at the man 's gun repeatedly , sending him and his accomplice running from the store
then , a minute later , his friend leaves the car and joins him in the store
when the clerk then opens up the cash register to make the sale , the gun comes out
rather than hand over the money the sore clerk began swatting at the gun the clerk swatted at the gun repeatedly , and no shots were fired the men then flee to their car and leave the clerk then begins hitting the gun and throwing what appears to be coins at the men
the two soon flee , without ever firing , and , with a third man , jump in the car and speed off , this as the clerk chases them with what may be a gun
police are still searching for the men .
