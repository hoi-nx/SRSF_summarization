a woman who says she was conned out of Â£ 50,000 by her senegal husband in a immigration marriage scam wants to help other women avoid the same fate
kim , 58 , from dover , has been calling for the government to take action since her husband laye walked out on her after obtaining his british citizenship
she alleges that laye had been in the british illegally and she now believes he was already married to at least two other women
kim appeared on today 's this morning to share her story of how she was ' duped by a love rat ' kim , pictured with laye , believes he married her to gain her assets and british citizenship kim , a music producer was 49 when she first met laye , then 43 , in a london nightclub in 2007
she said there was an ' instant attraction ' and their romance had a ' normal progression to a full - on relationship '
he told her he was a widower supporting three young children in senegal
kim said she had no reason not to believe him as he even had his wife 's death certificate to prove it
' he said he was a religious man so could n't live with me if we were n't married
he told me he did n't believe in polygamy and did n't do affairs
' he told me his wife had died and his children were being cared for by relatives and he had paperwork to prove it , ' she told presenters phillip and amanda holden on today 's this morning
kim , who was unable to have children after an ectopic pregnancy left her infertile , said the prospect of having a ready - made family with laye was a dream come true
she said : ' when we married , i thought his children would come and live with us
' one of the attractions for me was that i could n't have children
i was thrilled to be marrying a man with three lovely children , they were the apple of my eye
i spoke to them on the phone and sent them presents , they were my life
' i even bought a five bedroom house in dover where we could live as a family
' kim and laye married at kingston registry office in june 2008
' i was the happiest woman in the world thinking i had a family and it all came crashing down , ' kim said
the music producer told presenters phillip and amanda holden , left , that she had no reason to believe laye was still married as he showed her his wife 's death certificate ' i found out he 'd had an affair and he said it was because he was missing his children
i gave him a second chance but then found all these other layers of lies and secrets
' it was all thanks to facebook that i discovered his real story
' using the social network site , kim said she discovered laye had n't lied about the death of his first wife , with whom he had one child
but he had gone on to marry another woman in africa with whom he had his two other children
she found evidence he had then married a dutch woman and possibly another english woman - and appeared to have ripped them off in similar circumstances to his dealings with her
she also found facebook messages from laye to other women he was targeting on dating websites
at the end of her interview , phillip pointed out charges have not been made against laye since he left kim
following kim 's allegations , police have begun an investigation into laye for bigamy , fraud and associated crimes
but it is unclear if he is still in british
kim remains adamant he is a ' love rat ' who has left her poorer and broken - hearted
kim is now working with immigration marriage fraud uk to stop others suffering her fate on this morning she said she knows people will think she 's a fool for being taken in but she said she had done lots of checks away to ensure laye was who he said he was
' i do n't have imbecile on my forehead , ' she said
' i had checked his paperwork and it had gone through lawyers , embassies and the registry office
i had met him in the british
' kim is now working with immigration marriage fraud uk to force government policy change .
