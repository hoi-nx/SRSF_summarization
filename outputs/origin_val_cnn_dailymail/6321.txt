scotland 's long - term plan to abolish the airport passenger duty tax completely could significantly harm england 's already suffering smaller airports , revealed a report from mps
a report from the house of commons transport committee said the success of the uk 's smaller airports are being held back by the existence of the apd , one of the world 's heftiest departure taxes
the mps said that northern ireland was suffering in terms of jobs , growth and connectivity as aviation taxes were higher than in the republic of ireland
and when apd is charged at both ends of a trip the tax ' incentivises airlines and passengers to fly from airports located in other eu member states ' , said the mp 's report
the scottish government 's plans to abolish the airport passenger duty could harm england 's airports the scottish government wants to reduce apd by 50 per cent in the next term of the scottish parliament and eventually get rid of it altogether in a bid to win the country 's airports a ' competitive advantage '
however , there is no such commitment to axing apd in the rest of the uk , despite a decision by the chancellor to abolish apd payments on children 's tickets back in december
a spokesman for the campaign a fair tax on flying , d'alfonso , welcomed the report and called on the rest of the uk to follow scotland 's lead
' we welcome the committee 's report highlighting the detrimental effect that apd has on smaller airports , and the committee 's recognition that a lower level of apd in scotland will have a negative effect on the rest of the uk , ' mr d'alfonso said
' with uk passengers currently paying one of the highest rates of tax on flying anywhere in the world , it is not surprising that the scottish government is committed to cutting this damaging tax
however , a cut in apd in scotland needs to be matched by a cut in apd across the rest of the uk , so that no part of the country is disadvantaged in any way
' a report from the house of commons transport committee said the success of the uk 's smaller airports are being held back by the departure tax , which is one of the largest in the world the report warned that if apd is scrapped in scotland - the wheels are already in motion with the tax being devolved to holyrood - ' airports in england would be subject to a similar competitive disadvantage to that currently experienced in northern ireland '
Â£ 26 per ticket to european Â£ 69 per ticket to us , canada , north and west africa Â£ 97 per ticket to australia , singapore and indonesia the abolition of the tax at holyrood would bring Â£ 1billion into the economy by 2020 along with almost 4,000 jobs , according to a report commissioned by edinburgh airport
plans to exempt children from apd , announced in the autumn statement of 2014 , was ' a marginal change which did nothing for business travellers and little for smaller airports ' , the report added
the committee said : ' we found that apd is the principal threat to the smaller airports sector
' apd can not be amended to support people , businesses and regional economies because of the operation of european competition law , while proposals to devolve it to the regions would serve only to spread a patchwork of market distortions across the uk
' the report covered around 40 smaller airports ranging in size from newcastle , which handled 4.4 million passengers in 2013 , to lydd in kent which handled 1,000 launching the report today the committee 's chairwoman louise ellman said : ' smaller airports drive economic growth
but the smaller airports sector - which is vital to people and businesses in the regions - is limited by apd
transport ministers must stand up for smaller airports and make the case to the treasury that apd squeezes jobs , growth and connectivity
' she added : ' the whole country should share the economic benefits of expanded airport capacity
but that will only happen if new capacity includes new domestic flights to airports outside london
' the department for transport needs to take a proactive approach and ensure that the regions are connected
' scotland 's transport minister derek mackay told bbc radio scotland 's good morning scotland programme found validation in the report and said they would do what was best for their airports
' it does somewhat validate what we 've been saying - that reducing air passenger duty would create economic growth in terms of more routes and sustain the lines that we have at the moment , ' he said
' that 's why airports and the airlines have called within scotland for the power to be transferred to us so that we can be more adept
scotland 's transport minister derek mackay said did n't mind that ' other parts of the uk may well be nervous but if we have the power then we 'll use it to put scotland at a competitive advantage ' ' some other parts of the uk may well be nervous but if we have the power then we 'll use it to put scotland at a competitive advantage

airport operators association chief executive darren caplan said : ' the past few years have been tough for many of our smaller members
' reducing apd is the single biggest thing that could enable airports to attract new routes and increase their passenger numbers
apd is the highest aviation tax in the world and is increasingly putting the uk at a disadvantage
' a department for transport spokesman said : ' regional airports make a vital contribution to the uk economy by boosting local jobs and providing important domestic and international connectivity
we want to help these airports thrive as part of our long - term economic plan , which is why we launched the regional air connectivity fund to support more new air routes
' we are now assessing bids from airports and airlines for this funding and will soon announce a short list of routes , with a final announcement over the summer
' we welcome the publication of the committee 's report on smaller airports and we will study their conclusions carefully before responding in due course
