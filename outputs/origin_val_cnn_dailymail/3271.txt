guptill became the first man to score a double hundred in a cricket world cup knockout match and propelled co-hosts new zealand into the semi-finals as they sealed a 143 - run win against west indies
the 28 - year - old batsman was dropped in the first over before going on to score 237 from 163 balls â including 24 fours and 11 sixes , one of which found the roof of wellington âs westpac stadium in the final over
the record - breaking innings â the second highest one - day international score of all time behind indian rohit sharma âs 264 â helped his side to 393 - 6
guptill celebrates after scoring his double century during new zealand 's win over the west indies â i âm still not really sure what happened , â said guptill
â i am incredibly proud of what we achieved today and hopefully moving forward we can win another game and then another one after that
â the fact guptill was the first new zealander to pass 200 in a odi was not really a surprise
he scored 189 not out against england in 2013 and said , looking back at that innings , he felt he could have achieved the mark then
â i did muck around in the middle overs of that innings but i would nât take it back at all , â added guptill
â to set the record and then break it again is pretty amazing and i just have to try to do it again i guess
â the batsman recorded the second highest one - day international score in the sports history with 237 in reply , west indies were all out for 250 in 30.3 overs , with trent boult claiming four for 44 to become the leading wicket - taker in the tournament
new zealand will face south africa in the semi-finals while australia play india in the other match
it could have been so different , though , had marlon samuels held a catch just three balls in which would have sent guptill back to the pavilion
guptill also survived two lbw shouts but new zealand captain brendon mccullum had less luck at the other end as he fell for 12 runs
guptill was given a standing ovation following his impressive innings in the cricket world cup clash
