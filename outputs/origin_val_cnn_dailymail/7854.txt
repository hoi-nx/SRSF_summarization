it does n't get more australian than that ! cars have been brought to a hasty halt after a unique animal crossing of a hopping kind
a group of over 20 kangaroos have made a quick dash across the craigieburn east road in victoria on thursday morning
at 10.50 am on thursday , many cars were brought to a hasty halt as over 20 kangaroos crossed the highway the swarm executed perfect timing with the cars able to safely slow down and watch the group the video shows the troop hopping across the busy road in single file and jumping over a barbed - wire fence to make it to the land on the other side
all caught on a driver 's dash cam , some of the animals are seen to be doing flips over the fence and disappearing into the long grass
luckily all other cars slow to a halt on the 100km/hr road to wait for the group to safely cross , with all cautiously driving off after the encounter
with no clear ' kangaroo crossing ' signage the confrontation could have been potentially dangerous
kangaroo crossings are more dangerous at night as the animals become blinded by vehicle head lights some of the kangaroos can be seen performing expert flips over the barbed wire fence and disappear into the grass the crossing took place at 10.50 am on a thursday and there were clearly not too many vehicles on the usually busy road
the craigieburn east road is 45 minutes north of melbourne and the driver was on his way to work
in the day , our hopping friends are more likely to make a safer crossing by choosing their moments to dash more wisely
however in the evenings , when they are most active , they are easily collected as they become blinded by the headlights of cars .
