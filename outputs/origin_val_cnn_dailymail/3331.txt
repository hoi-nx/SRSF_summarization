england take on afghanistan on friday morning looking to finish a dismal world cup campgain on a rare positive note
defeats to new zealand , australia , sri lanka and , most embarrassingly , bangladesh , have seen peter moores ' side crash out of the competition at the first side
but the england coach will hope his team can at least show some spirit against minnows afghanistan , to avoid going home having only beaten scotland all tournament
like england , their opponents have only picked up one win in the tournament and will be going home after this match , but for afghanistan a win against scotland was all they could have reasonably hoped to achieve
beating england would be a major scalp , and raise even more questions about captain eoin morgan 's side
realistically , england should be hoping for a dominant win , which might help salvage some confidence even if it comes too late to enable progress in the tournament
but with confidence levels as low as they can be , there is a chance of a defeat which would be even more shocking than monday 's failure against bangladesh .
