just a few months ago , coquelin was on the verge of being allowed to leave arsenal , having made little more than a fringe impact on the club 's first team
a loan at championship side charlton saw him play five games in the second tier this november and december , before arsene wenger recalled him following an injury to club captain mikel arteta
coquelin was expected to be cover for mathieu flamini , and his first three games saw him play a total of 13 minutes , coming off the bench late in the game on all three occasions
coquelin has become a key member of the arsenal first team after almost being allowed to leave statistically the frenchman is the leading defensive player in the premier league since his return to arsenal coquelin 's stint in the first team has earned him a new long - term contract with the gunners but an injury to mathieu flamini has handed the 23 - year - old frenchman his chance , and coquelin has emerged as a real talent , and a crucial part of arsenal 's recent good form
in fact , based on statistics alone , coquelin is unquestionably the best defensive player in the premier league since he returned to the club
since his first start , in arsenal 's 2 - 1 win over west ham on december 28 , the holding midfielder has shown terrific reading of the game and positional sense , making more successful interceptions than any other premier league player
coquelin has also brought a degree of steel to the famously lightweight arsenal midfield , topping the charts for duels won
arsene wenger admitted he had expected to release coquelin at the end of the season coquelin has gone from being a reserve to a player that may be encouraged to play even though he 's injured coquelin almost went on loan to qpr at the beginning of the season but the deal collapsed late on in fact , the frenchman midfielder has dominated the premier league in personal battles , his 97 duels won an astonishing 21 more than any other player
when it comes to tackling the gunners ' academy product is only second in the list , four behind manchester city full back pablo zabaleta , but he is still comfortably ahead of the next best midfielder , brazilian fernandinho
as a result , arsenal have lost just twice in the league since the turn of the year , and have climbed to third in the premier league table , leaving some fans to ask whether coquelin is the player the gunners have been missing since the departure of gilberto silva
certainly he is not yet the finished article , as shown in an unconvincing display against monaco in the champions league
the frenchman midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot mathieu flamini in the pecking order arsenal have been linked with christoph kramer ( left ) and lars bender but might feel coquelin is enough coquelin played five games on loan at charlton this season but has returned to be a first team regular but arsene wenger , so long linked with a string of defensive midfielders - the most recent lists including lars bender , christoph kramer ad morgan schneiderlin - seems to think that coquelin has a future at the club , offering him a new long - term contract last month
whether he holds onto his place when mikel arteta returns , or can hold off competition from those potential summer signings , remains to be seen
but what is certain is that arsenal have , statistically at least , found themselves the premier league 's leading defensive player on current form .
