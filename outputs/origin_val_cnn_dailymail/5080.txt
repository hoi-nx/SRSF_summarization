pension firms will be forced to reveal to customers if they are offering rip - off retirement deals , the financial watchdog announced yesterday
companies will have to advertise what rival firms are offering and how much more retirees could earn if they switched to a different provider
they will have to do this every time they send a customer a quote for an annuity â when a pension pot is turned into a fixed income for life
the fca ( fca ) said that using a â simple quote comparison â would expose bad - value contracts
under new rules to be introduced in the uk next year , firms will have to advertise what deals rival firms are offering and how much more retirees could earn if they switched to a different provider ( file picture , posed ) in a victory for money mail , the radical shake - up will force firms to â make it clear to consumers how their quote compares relative to other providers â
the fca said this would â prompt customers to consider the benefits of shopping around and switching â
from next month , pensioners will no longer have to buy an annuity with their pension pot and can withdraw all or part of it
however , many are expected to still opt for one because they want the security of a fixed income during retirement
fca director christopher woolard said : â the retirement income market is set for the biggest change in a generation
we want to ensure it is fit for purpose
â experts said the new rules â to be introduced next year â will prevent swathes of pensioners blindly accepting a poor - value annuity offered by their pension provider
andrew tully , of retirement firm mgm advantage , said : â pensioners are locked into poor - value annuities because they are not encouraged to shop around
if providing details of what rivals are offering provokes someone to look at alternatives , that has got to be positive
â the fca ( fca ) said that using a â simple quote comparison â would expose bad - value contracts and the new regulations would â prompt customers to consider the benefits of shopping around ' other measures unveiled by the fca includes cutting back on jargon - filled documents â in some cases as long as 22 pages â an issue money mail has highlighted
the watchdog said it would also consider whether savers should be sent a simple statement outlining how much money they have saved and what type of pension they have
known as a pension passport , it would make it easier to switch to a better deal
since money mail campaigned on the issue it has won the backing of pensions minister steve webb
the treasury is now conducting trials at several pension companies before the regulator considers making it compulsory .
