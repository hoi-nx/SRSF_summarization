arsenal crashed out of the champions league at the last 16 stage for the fifth time in succession after falling agonizingly short in monaco
the premier league side recorded a 2 - 0 victory on the night but went out on away goals after the tie finished level at 3 - 3 on aggregate
monaco , which won 3 - 1 in the first leg , was overwhelmed for much of the contest and was fortunate to escape without being dumped out of the competition
olivier giroud 's first half strike and aaron ramsey 's 79th minute effort ensured a tense finale but the visiting side was unable to find a winner
no team had ever overcome a two - goal first leg deficit away from home in the champions league and progressed -- but arsenal 's first half display gave it hope
olivier giroud , who has often been criticized this season for failing to take his chances , lashed in from close range with nine minutes of the first half remaining
aaron ramsey , a substitute , drove the ball into the net after theo walcott 's effort had struck the post and monaco 's defenders hesitated
olivier giroud had a chance late on to cap a dramatic fightback but his effort was saved on the line
