how on earth has wenger escaped criticism for yet another failure in europe ? they won on the night â fine
they went out on away goals â sure , it could n't have been closer
but they lost to monaco â arguably the worst side to make it through the group stage
aaron ramsey 's goal against monaco was not enough to prevent arsenal going out of the champions league arsenal players look dejected after losing the 3 - 1 at home to the french side in the first leg of the last - 16 tie monaco defender aymen abdennour celebrates his team 's shock victory at the emirates last month arsenal manager wenger appears to have escaped criticism for yet another failure in europe failing to win the group has been wenger 's massive error in recent seasons
that 's why they 've faced the european giants early and failed to make the quarter - finals
and yet again , despite being in a group with two no - hopers â galatasaray and anderlecht , and a borussia dortmund side that spent the first half of the season hovering in and around the relegation zone in the bundesliga â arsenal failed to top their group
but they got that stroke of luck everyone says you need if you are going to win the champions league
they were paired with monaco , a team defensively sound but offensively weak
i 'm going to keep this simple : arsenal have better players than monaco
so surely an experienced manager , well versed in french football and champions league football , especially familiar with his opponents â a club he once managed â with a squad featuring two arguably world - class players in mesut ozil and alexis sanchez , not even wenger could mess this one up ? wenger failed even with world - class talent like mesut ozil ( pictured ) and alexis sanchez in his arsenal side arsenal boss wenger looks on and sinks into his seat during arsenal 's shock defeat by monaco monaco are effective , but they are a basic side
in other words , it should n't take a tactical genius to work out how to beat them
they got into the champions league thanks to the quality of james rodriguez and radamel falcao ( before his injury ) , but they have since lost those star players
and yet wenger failed to do this
for the fifth season running arsenal failed to make the quarter - finals of the champions league
damage done in the first leg , and mertesacker said their mentality was n't right
therefore the manager has to take the blame for sending his players out with the wrong mentality
last season , mertesacker said arsenal ' gave 10 per cent less mentally ' when they were beaten by napoli to miss out on top spot in the group
wenger culpable for not preparing his players properly yet again
his preparation of his own team is poor
his ability to out - coach opponents is poor
and still there are people who think he is the right man to manage arsenal
some even have the audacity to cling on to that well - worn myth that he had every right not to win big trophies while arsenal paid for the stadium
hard to believe gullible gooners fell for that one
the income and assets from day one at the new stadium meant arsenal could always compete
unfortunately wenger misjudged the impact of financial fair play , another mistake he made
the case for wenger 's defence is getting weaker and weaker
per mertesacker admitted arsenal 's mentality was n't right as arsenal failed to reach the quarter - finals sure , three other english clubs failed in the champions league this season
man city might change their manager because of it
that 's a man who won the title last season
chelsea know that they have a manager who has already won the champions league twice before , so his track record is proven
but we all know that if he persistently fails to get to the quarter - finals of the champions league , jose mourinho wo n't last at the bridge
and at liverpool brendan rodgers went into his first ever champions league campaign shorn of luis suarez and the injured daniel sturridge
he was a rookie and he made big mistakes
wenger is making equally huge mistakes despite all his years of european experience
so many people are sitting around wringing their hands about why english clubs fail in europe
no wonder we fail when a club as huge as arsenal trusts a proven european failure with its champions league ambitions , and then does nothing when he fails time after time
man city were eliminated from the champions league by barcelona and could now change their boss david luiz celebrates scoring for psg against chelsea while blues boss jose mourinho shows his frustration he 's the only manager to reach three different european finals and lose them all â cup winners ' cup with monaco , uefa cup and champions league with arsenal
wenger 's 17 straight seasons in the champions league are an embarrassment when you consider he has only reached one final , and two semi-finals in that time
is there anyone else who could do better ? there really are people stupid enough to ask that question
if you want a young manager who will be bold and brave in the face of bigger - spending more illustrious opponents then go for the youthful energy of diego simeone or jurgen klopp
both have won domestic titles in recent seasons when they could have done what wenger does every year and wave the white flag because he ca n't handle what he calls the ' financial doping ' of the likes of man city and chelsea
if you want proven winners , then wenger 's Â£ 8m - a - year salary will surely tempt the quality of pep guardiola or carlo ancelotti
wenger 's Â£ 8m - a - year salary would surely tempt carlo ancelotti ( left ) and pep guardiola to north london why is it that a juggernaut of a club like arsenal sticks with a manager who regularly fails when it comes to the big moments ? are they content to miss out ? finishing second was n't good enough for thierry henry , remember ? so he left the stinking , sinking ship to go and finish first with barcelona
that was a long , long time ago of course , but still the fallen emirates empire remains ruined
the failure to win the champions league will always be a huge scabby wart on wenger 's record
but wenger is n't bigger than arsenal
he 's guilty of failing in europe with arsenal and making a massive contribution to the diminishing reputation of english clubs in european competition
being knocked out by monaco should be the final straw for wenger
it would be for any other manager of one of europe 's elite clubs .
