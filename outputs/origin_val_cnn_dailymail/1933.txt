einstein may have been a genius , but even he could get it wrong sometimes
in the 1920s and 1930s , einstein said he could n't back the strange theory that the measurement of a particle actually affects its location
now a team of scientists from japan and australia have proven that this ' spooky action at a distance ' takes place in a photon

pictured on the right is professor wiseman according to quantum mechanics , a single particle can be described by a wave function
it can be spreads over large distances , but is never detected in two or more places
this is because physicists believe the universe behaves like a little probability wave
particles are in many places at once , each with some probability
this means if an electron was fired through two slits at a screen , it would go through both of them
but if you set up a pair of cameras to monitor the slit , the wave function collapses
as a result it only goes through on of the slits , rather than both
professor wiseman at griffiths university , who worked with the university of tokyo , made measurements to show what einstein did not believe to be real - namely the non-local collapse of a particle 's ' wave function '
according to quantum mechanics , a single particle can be described by a wave function that spreads over large distances , but is never detected in two or more places
this phenomenon is explained in quantum theory by what einstein disparaged in 1927 as ' spooky action at a distance
' this is the instantaneous collapse of the wave function to wherever the particle is detected
it happens because physicists believe the universe behaves like a little probability wave
particles are in many places at once , each with some probability
this means if an electron was fired through two slits at a screen , it would go through both of them
but if you set up a pair of cameras to monitor the slit , the wave function collapses
as a result it only goes through on of the slits , rather than both
einstein did n't believe the phenomenon existed because it violates the theory of relativity which states that the speed of light is a limit on how fast any information can travel
almost 90 years later , by splitting a single photon between two laboratories , scientists have used homodyne detectors - which measure wave - like properties - to show the collapse of the wave function is a real effect
according to live science , the paradox was resolved years later , when experiments showed that even though the interaction between two quantum particles happens faster than light , it is impossible use it to send information
by splitting a single photon between two laboratories , scientists have used homodyne detectors - which measure wave - like properties - to show the collapse of the wave function is a real effect the report adds that while other experiments have shown entanglement with two particles , the new study entangles a photon with itself
this phenomenon is the strongest yet proof of the entanglement of a single particle , an unusual form of quantum entanglement that is being increasingly explored for quantum communication and computation
' einstein never accepted orthodox quantum mechanics and the original basis of his contention was this single - particle argument , ' said professor wiseman
' this is why it is important to demonstrate non-local wave function collapse with a single particle
' einstein 's view was that the detection of the particle only ever at one point could be much better explained by the hypothesis that the particle is only ever at one point , without invoking the instantaneous collapse of the wave function to nothing at all other points
' however , rather than simply detecting the presence or absence of the particle , we used homodyne measurements enabling one party to make different measurements and the other , using quantum tomography , to test the effect of those choices
' ' through these different measurements , you see the wave function collapse in different ways , thus proving its existence and showing that einstein was wrong
