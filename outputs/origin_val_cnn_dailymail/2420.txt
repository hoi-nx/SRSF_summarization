musk has revealed two key software updates for the tesla model s sedan that he claims will end ' range anxiety '
the first is a ' range assurance ' app that communicates with tesla 's supercharger network , warning drivers if they are about to run out of power , and pointing them to the nearest supercharger
the second is a trip planner , which will combine the supercharger network with the network of tesla model s cars to improve long - distance journeys for drivers
it will also warn drivers if battery power is low before they drive beyond an area where they can charge tesla 's updated software will map out the best route to a driver 's destination based on the location of charging stations
it will also warn drivers if battery power is low before they drive beyond an area where they can charge via a trip planner app. the update will also add several safety features , including automatic emergency braking and blind spot detection
in the future , the tesla model s fleet will also have auto - steering and the ability to summon a car to any location
' this makes it effectively impossible for a driver to run out of range unintentionally ' , said musk
' you 'll have to confirm you want to , actually
' the tesla model s is already able to estimate how much charge a driver has left in their battery
it can also tell the driver where they are from the nearest supercharger
superchargers are free connectors that charge tesla model s in minutes
there are currently 403 supercharger stations with 2,219 superchargers around the world
the latest update combines these two features , to provide more accurate warnings
its built - in trip planner , meanwhile , will be more advanced , using real - time data such as wind speed and elevation
the announcement follows musk 's cryptic tweet over the weekend , in which he hinted at the 6.2 software update that will be available later this month
the separate range assurance feature should be available in the u.s. , europe , and most of china within the next 12 months
other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the tesla model s , which should be available in the next three months
' we can basically go between san francisco and seattle without the driver doing anything , ' musk said
other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the tesla model s , which should be available in the next three months
the technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel , acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway
the car will be able to sense its surroundings the technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel , acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway
in the future , the company will also give driver 's the ability to summon their car to any location
the tesla model s will also get automatic emergency braking and side collision warnings with the new update
the updates today addresses one of the biggest concerns for owners of electric cars ; that their battery could run out at any moment , leaving them stranded with no recharging station nearby
so - called ' range anxiety ' is a fear that has apparently plagued some owners of tesla 's tesla model s vehicle
the tesla model s is already able to estimate how much charge a driver has left in their battery
it can also tell the driver where they are from the nearest supercharger
the latest update combines these two features , to provide more accurate warnings musk ( left ) said that owners should expect such important software updates to be delivered to their tesla model s once every three or four months
on the right is a preview of what the trip planner will look like in a survey for consumer reports in 2012 , 77 per cent of respondents said limited range was their biggest concern with electric cars
the official range of the tesla model s at the moment is up to 310 miles ( 500km ) , which is apparently not enough to quell range anxiety for some drivers
running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past
earlier this month ford unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining , it bases its predictions on your unique driving style
the myford mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house
the app was announced at mobile world congress in barcelona and currently works with a selection of ford 's electric and hybrid cars
cnn noted that , last year , tesla upgraded its tesla roadster electric car , increasing its range from 245 to 400 miles ( 395 to 645km ) on a single charge
this was via a lithium battery pack upgrade and , at the time , musk tellingly tweeted : ' should mention that a battery pack upgrade is not coming soon for the tesla model s , but it obviously * will * happen long - term
' musk has since deleted that tweet - perhaps in anticipation of today 's announcement
tesla regularly updates drivers ' software for free over the air
in january , for instance , an update increased the speed of the top - of - the - line p85d via use of ' insane mode ' - enabling the car to go 0 to 60mph ( 97km/h ) in 3.2 seconds , compared to the usual 5.9 seconds
' we 've designed the tesla model s to be basically a computer on a wheels , ' musk said
' we view in the same way you view updating your phone and your laptop
' musk added that owners should expect such important software updates to be delivered to their tesla model s once every three or four months
the announcement follows musk 's cryptic tweet over the weekend , in which he hinted at the 6.2 software update that will be available later this month
