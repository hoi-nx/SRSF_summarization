an ohio couple are pleading with authorities not to take their 41 - year - old toothless black bear archie away from them
jeffrey and gillium failed to apply for a permit on time to keep the caged animal on their property outside of akron and now the ohio department of agriculture say they are going to confiscate archie
the gillium 's have launched a change.org petition to drum up support and to date have garnered more than 5,500 signatures
legal fight : archie the 41 - year - old bear is at the center of a legal tug - of - war between his owners and the ohio department of agriculture home : archie the bear has lived with jeffrey and gillium for the past 35 - years but could be taken away from them because of red tape indeed , animal rights group renegade 's run have come out in favor of the gillium 's keeping the bear and said that to take archie away is not in his best interests
however , the ohio state authorities have told cbs news that they will deny the tardy permit submitted by the couple because it was entered on february 27 , one year after the supposed deadline
they also claim the gillium 's have failed to ever properly register archie and have the bear microchipped
despite this , it was hoped that archie would be given special dispensation and allowed to live out his days with his owners on their 2.6 acre rural and secluded farm near to lodi , which is 30 miles away from akron
owner : jeffrey gillium squats near archie 's cage where his toothless black bear is caged on his ohio farm mother : debra gillium has been campaigning for the past 18 months to keep archie from being confiscated from her support for archie : one of the thousands who have signed up to support the old bear protest the ohio department of agriculture the couple have said that they have had the bear for 35 - years and never had one incident and their attorney has said the couple will build a new cage for him
if they do not get a new permit for archie the department of agriculture will most likely take him away in the next month
the gillium 's have filed a civil complaint and claimed they were not notified about the new rules which came into place when a suicidal owner released dozens of tigers and lions from his ohio farm in 2011
the state has said that the law is the law and they ca n't approve any new permits for anyone who did n't apply before january 1 2014
a hearing is scheduled april 9 .
