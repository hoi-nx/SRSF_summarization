thiago silva 's path to redemption took a mere 12 minutes
for that short period of time the brazilian must have been panicking that his needless error had cost his psg side a place in the last eight of the european champions league
his handball had gifted english premier league leaders chelsea a 2 - 1 aggregate advantage in extra time , but this was one tale that would be adorned with a thiago silva lining
seconds after being denied by a world class save from courtois , thiago silva looped a header into the net to send psg through on away goals
not only did he save himself from a barrage of criticism , he also got colleague zlatan ibrahimovic out of jail too
the maverick swede striker 's dismissal after 31 minutes made psg 's passage into the quarterfinals all the more remarkable , as it battled the best team in england with 10 men for an energy - sapping 90 minutes
cahill looked to have ended psg 's resistance with a 81st minute goal before former chelsea defender luiz equalized with four minutes left
eden hazard converted from the spot in extra time after thiago silva 's misdemeanor before the 30 - year - old popped up at the death to make amends and avenge psg 's defeat at the same stage by chelsea last season
" we played a great game , " luiz told sky sports
" it was amazing tonight , the spirit , the players gave everything
when we lost zlatan ibrahimovic we said we had to keep it simple and keep the ball
" it 's amazing for the club and the city
we tried to win the game even with one less man
we have a long way to go to win the european champions league and we keep our feet on the floor
" the first tie ended 1 - 1 in paris three weeks ago but most of the headlines related to an ugly incident of racism on the city 's metro system
a group of supporters , apparently chelsea fans , were caught on camera appearing to prevent a black man from boarding a train before chanting : " we 're racist and that 's the way we like it
" the uk 's metropolitan police announced on wednesday that it had summoned five men to appear in court later in march , while chelsea has vowed to ban for life any of its fans that are found guilty
the club extended an invitation to the man who was the the subject of the abuse , known as souleymane s , but the 33 - year - old refused
the opening stages were tense and feisty , just as they were in the french capital during the first leg , but the match in london ignited after a flashpoint just past the half hour mark
zlatan ibrahimovic , so often the hero for psg , turned villain after being dismissed for a forceful tackle on chelsea 's brazilian playmaker oscar
the home side surrounded referee kuipers who duly produced a red card -- the fourth of the swede 's often controversial career in the european champions league
but replays suggested the 33 - year - old was perhaps unfortunate to see red , having tried to pull out of the tackle at the last second
despite having a man advantage , chelsea struggled to create clear cut openings as psg defended resolutely
kuipers was in the spotlight again as the half came to a close -- a mazy run from striker costa ended when he was felled by psg 's uruguayan forward cavani
the referee took a long look at the incident but decided to wave play on , much to the chagrin of chelsea 's players and manager mourinho
mourinho 's travails continued after the break as the blues toiled in its attempts to open up a determined psg rearguard
a half chance for cahill came and went before the visitors came to the fore
first cavani played in maxwell , whose ball across the face of goal was begging to be tapped in , before the uruguayan had a chance to tilt the tie firmly in his side 's favor
played in on goal by argentinian pastore , cavani rounded chelsea goalkeeper courtois but could only glance a shot off the near post from a tight angle
pastore then got into the area after neat approach play and , though he got a powerful low shot away , courtois was equal to it and palmed it clear
chelsea began to reassert its dominance as psg tired
substitute ramires weaved into the area and was denied by a fine save at his near post by salvatore sirigu
from the resulting corner a miskick from costa presented the ball at the feet of england defender cahill , who lashed home from 12 yards out
but chelsea were unable to hold out
luiz , who won the european champions league with chelsea during a three - year stint at the club , had been booed throughout the game for a running battle with costa
and he rose highest to power a header into the net and make the tie level on aggregate with just four minutes remaining
psg began the extra half hour in sluggish fashion and were punished when thiago silva needlessly handled a looping cross into the area as he went up to challenge substitute kurt zouma for the ball
belgium international eden hazard duly tucked the penalty away , to restore chelsea 's lead and ensure the tie would not go to penalties
courtois was forced to make a world class save from thiago silva , as the brazilian desperately tried to make amends for his handball
but despite that warning , thiago silva netted with a fine header from the very next corner , looping a brilliant header over the goalkeeper from 14 yards out
after the game mourinho admitted psg had " clearly " been the better side : " our performance was not good enough , " he told sky sports
" we had the game in our hands twice but i think psg were stronger than us and coped better with the pressure of the game
" german champions bayern munich cemented its place in the last eight with a comprehensive 7 - 0 dismantling of shakhtar donetsk
after a 0 - 0 draw in the first leg in ukraine , shakhtar donetsk 's task became an uphill one inside four minutes when olexandr kucher was dismissed for bringing down gã¶tze inside the penalty area
muller tucked home the resulting penalty , and bayern munich subsequently laid siege to shakhtar donetsk 's goal
lewandowski nodded rafinha 's cross against the post before pep guardiola 's side doubled its advantage just after the half hour mark
defender jerome boateng had the simple task of tapping home from point blank range after former dortmund striker lewandowski 's effort had been saved
bayern munich ran riot after the break , france international franck ribery grabbing the third with a fine low finish after a powerful run into the area
muller grabbed a second moments later before holger badstuber made it five with a thumping header
lewandowski finally got on the score sheet before gã¶tze completed the rout .
