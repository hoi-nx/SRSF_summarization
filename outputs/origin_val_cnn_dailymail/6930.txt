fifa president sepp blatter has delivered a considerable snub to the bbc by turning down the opportunity to join a televised debate with his three challengers before the election in zurich on may 29
sepp blatter was always expected to refuse the request , put to him in a letter from the bbc and sky , for an hour - long debate with prince ali of jordan , luis figo and michael van praag about their plans for leading fifa
the event would have been hosted by top broadcasters from the two networks and given equal prominence to each candidate
fifa president sepp blatter speaks to journalists after the ifab meeting in belfast last month fifa presidential hopeful luis figo takes notes during the conmebol ordinary congress on march 4 but rather than give a courteous answer by letter to the prominent tv stations , sepp blatter relayed the curt reply â thanks but no thanks â via one of his flunkeys in a telephone call
this did nât impress the bbc , who have been fifa partners as world cup rights - holders since proper live coverage started in 1966
sepp blatter âs three challengers replied by letter that they would be happy to participate
but the whole project depended on sepp blatter and he is not even prepared to outline his reasons for not taking part , let alone have his make - up applied for the tv cameras â in front of which he would have by far the most to lose
far better for sepp blatter is to fast - track fifa goal programme funding to african countries , where he enjoys mass voting support
