wales ' chances of lifting the six nations trophy could hinge on the fitness battle being waged by video italy captain parisse
gatland âs men need a thumping victory over the italian on saturday to have a chance of overhauling england and ireland , who both boast superior points differences
but welsh hopes took a knock with news that parisse , who limped off against france on sunday , has been cleared of any serious damage to his right foot following an mri scan in the italian capital and hopes to recover for thursday âs team announcement
parisse revealed on twitter that the soft - tissue injury is â less severe than expected â and he could still feature alongside prop martin castrogiovanni , who is understood to have been recalled to the squad after suffering a serious dog bite on his nose three weeks ago
today he tweeted an image of his foot in an ice bath in a bid to get fit for the clash
parisse limped off during video italy 's defeat by france in rome at the weekend if parisse plays he will be a major factor in wales ' attempts to win the six nations video italy v france - extended highlights the veteran italy pair have 221 tests between them and their experience could be a major obstacle to welsh ambitions of securing the necessary landslide victory at the stadio olimpico
wales kept themselves in contention for the title with a classic defensive display against ireland on saturday but , with the race likely to be decided by points difference , focus must now shift towards attack
if the trophy is going to head back to cardiff , then gatland âs side must burst open the floodgates of the river tiber and better the scoring record of both england and ireland
having topped the tackle count at the millennium stadium with â according to the welsh camp â a record - breaking 38 hits , charteris is hoping to keep his place in the second row
his side are up first in a triple - bill of fixtures and , with kick - offs staggered throughout the day , the 32 - year - old has already decided how to kill the time as other results unfold
wales beat ireland 23 - 16 at the millennium stadium to force themselves into title contention gatland knows his team need a large victory to overhaul england and ireland â we âll have to find some good italian wine , â joked charteris
â first , you have to try to win the game
if you look any further than winning the game by a point then you become unstuck
â that has happened in the past and as soon as you do that , you are disrespecting the opposition
if we can win , it gives us a chance
â we saw just how good a team they are when they won in scotland
i know a few of the boys so it will be a really tough game
â in an ideal scenario , gatland would have had the option to keep the same starting xv that beat ireland
but the kiwi will be without tight - head prop samson lee , who was sent to london yesterday to seek specialist advice on a potentially world cup - threatening achilles injury
the front - row problems have been compounded by doubts over richard hibbard and gethin jenkins â prompting call - ups for exeter âs tomas francis and saracens â rhys gill , but not adam jones
gatland 's wales side have a +12 points difference , 25 behind england and 21 adrift of ireland jonathan davies and dan biggar share a joke during a wales training session the 34 - year - old british lion has hinted that he could be drawn out of retirement , however welsh forwards coach mcbryde insists the onus is on the player to reverse his decision
â we would be open to a call from him , â said mcbryde
â it was his decision to hang up his boots on the international front
i still have his number , but there âs no need to call him at the moment
as far as i âm concerned , he âs announced his retirement and , until he changes his mind , at the moment we have enough strength in depth
â mcbryde moved to allay concerns over jamie roberts after the 28 - year - old was brought off with a head injury against ireland
the racing metro centre has been a mainstay throughout the competition but , in scott williams , wales have attack - minded cover that could exploit italian weaknesses in the final quarter
â we have seen so far that up until the 60 - minute mark italy have been in the game and competing , â said mcbryde
â they will be hugely disappointed with their performance against france and i am sure they will be looking to finish on a high , so that makes them more dangerous
we are dealing with a wounded animal
â saturday was a hugely physical test and some of the players â reactions following that match reflected the intensity
â the fact they have come out of that match on top makes the bruises feel that little less painful
the spirit is good and , by still being in the hunt for the title , everyone has come in with an appetite and an edge to build on the momentum
