every new mum is desperate to show off her little ones - and this lioness is no different , even if that means having to put up with becoming a climbing frame for an afternoon
the proud mother was spotted playing with her six young cubs in the masai mara , in kenya , by french photographers laurent renaud and dominique haution
however , should they get too rowdy , it is only too clear who is boss - as the pictures clearly show
' it was a beautiful and touching moment , ' ms dominiqye haution revealed
' the whole family were extraordinarily cute
mum was definitely showing off her new cubs
' normally , lionesses will hide their children away from predators
but she was so proud , carrying them out into the open in her mouth for us to see
' you could see how happy she was when the cubs were climbing all over her
' it just shows that even the biggest beasts can show love
' indeed , the photos captured the youngsters clambering across the predator - who does n't bat an eyelid
roar : the cubs may still be tiny , but there is already a hint of the lions they will grow up to be friendly : but in other shots , the cubs look so sweet they could be household pets victory : but being the winner is still important - as this cub seems to be learning control : however , the cubs were left in no doubt of who was in charge when push came to shove ms dominiqye haution believes the cubs are around six weeks old , which presented a difficulty when trying to photograph them all
she said : ' there were about six in total , but they were running around all over the place so it was hard to capture them all
' they are so adorable though
big family : the photographers believe there may have been as many as six cubs , but it was hard to tell serene : this little cub seems remarkably calm about being bitten by its sibling happy : ' it is hard to believe that they grow up into be king of the jungle when they look as cute as they do in these photos , ' said photographer dominiqye haution ' it is hard to believe that they grow up into be king of the jungle when they look as cute as they do in these photos
' they were playing just like kittens the way they were playing with each other
' a couple of the cubs looked like they had their arms around one another
