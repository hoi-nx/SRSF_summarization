isis militants in northern syria released 19 assyrian christian hostages on sunday , according to abdelrahman , the chief of the london - based syrian observatory
abdelrahman has a network of activists on the ground in syria
on saturday , the observatory -- citing an assyrian christians commander -- said that isis planned to release 29 assyrian christian hostages
isis captured at least 220 assyrian christians , all christians , on february 23 during an attack on the villages around the town of tal tamer in the northern syria province of al-hasakah
the syria observatory said saturday that a self - proclaimed isis court ordered the release , citing an assyrian christians commander
the " court " told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped assyrian christians has yet to be decided by isis sharia jurists
the syria observatory said its information indicates isis has taken the hostages to the mount abdelaziz area , southwest of tal tamer
the founder of the assyrian human rights network , edward , puts the number of assyrian christians hostages at more than 262
edward is based in sweden but has family in the area that was attacked , and says his information is from the network 's team on the ground
the number of hostages has climbed steadily , from an initial estimate of between 70 and 100 people seized on monday to 150 as of wednesday , with women , children and the elderly among them
the number of people executed by the terrorist group has also climbed steadily
since the declaration of its " caliphate " last june , isis has killed 1,969 people , the syria observatory said saturday
nearly two - thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians
six were children and eight were women , the group said
of the rest , 95 were fighters from the al qaeda - affiliated rebel group al-nusra front , the syria observatory said , and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces
isis also executed 125 of its own members for " exceeding the limits in religion , " the syria observatory said
" we in syrian observatory believe that the real number of people that had been killed by ( isis ) is higher than the number documented by syrian observatory because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the ( isis ) jails , loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-shaitaat tribe , ( and ) dozens of kurds who have still been missing " since isis attacked the syria town of kobani in september
