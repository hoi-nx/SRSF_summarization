an unusual nexus of mining interests , relief work in haitian , and a former america first family is raising new ethics questions that could affect clinton 's presidential ambitions
bill clinton 's brother , tony rodham , was a board member of a north carolina mining company that enjoyed prime access to haitian gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by former president bill clinton through the clinton foundation
another board member of the firm , vcs , was former haitian prime minister jean-max bellerive , who co-chaired the charitable interim haiti recovery commission with mr. bill clinton
the revelation , smacking of cronyism and back - room government dealing , is part of a forthcoming book by government accountability institute founder peter schweizer , whose work exposing the investment ' insider trading ' habits of members of congress caused national outrage in 2011 even though the practice was legal
at the time vcs 's ' gold exploitation permit ' was awarded , according to a press release from the company , it was one of only two firms to get one
the haitian government had n't issued such a permit in more than 50 years
tony rodham , brother of former secretary of state clinton , sat on the board of a company that landed a gold mining deal in haitian after bill and clinton directed millions into post-earthquake relief breitbart news first reported on the investigative nonfiction book 's coming release
the january 2010 haitian earthquake killed more than 100,000 people and affected more than 3 million
that disaster was followed nine months later by a cholera epidemic of historic proportions
the clinton foundation raised at least $ 36 million to help , according to its website
the obama administration pledged $ 3.6 billion
' much of the america assistance is provided by the u.s. agency for international development , ' a department of the state department that mrs. clinton led at the time , according to the department 's website
tony rodham 's company got its gold mining rights in december 2012 , according to the vcs press release
peter schweizer 's publisher , harpercollins , said in a press release thursday that it ' reveals how the clintons went from " dead broke " on leaving the white house to being millionaires , describing in detail the way in which the clintons habitually blur the lines between politics , philanthropy , and business
' the clintons ' family philanthropy came under fire in february for admitting it had accepted money directly from foreign governments including the united arab emirates , saudi arabia and oman
some of those donations came while mrs. clinton was the america secretary of state
breitbart reported that the terms of tony rodham 's gold windfall upset members of haitian 's senate : the government 's royalties under the deal were pegged at just 2.5 per cent , half the customary rate
and vcs mining has an option to renew the terms for 25 years
harpercollins executive editor adam bellow , son of the famed novelist bellow , said in a statement that in peter schweizer 's book , he ' coins a new term to describe the unique way in which bill and clinton tend to mingle their political , personal and philanthropic interests
' he calls it ' the clinton blur
' ' peter schweizer âs exhaustively researched book raises serious questions about the sources of the clintons ' sudden wealth , their ethical judgment , and clinton 's fitness for high public office , ' bellow added
mrs. clinton was america 's first lady and a america shuhenator before losing the democratic presidential nomination to obama in 2008 and joining his administration the following year
in addition to howls from the political right about her foundation 's role in attracting donors from among countries with whom she negotiated â $ 500,000 of the clinton foundation 's haitian donations came from the algerian government , for example â she is under fire for using a private email address run on her own server , during her years at the state department
she never had a ' state.gov ' address
instead she ran her professional and personal emails through her own internet domain , ' clintonemails.com , ' creating ethical and possibly legal issues because of the possibility that the state department has not archived all her messages
close : bill clinton greeted haitian president michel martelly warmly when she arrived for the indutrial ribbon cutting in 2012 bill clinton got an additional black eye this week with the revelation that gration , who served as america 's ambassador to kenya for 13 months of her tenure , was ousted after he did somethign similar
when gration took over the nairobi embassy , according to a 2012 inspector general report , he insisted on the installation of a private , commercial internet connection in the bathroom attached to his office so he could communicate with the outside world beyond the reach of the state department
the federal records act requires employees of executive branch agencies to keep their emails and make them available for permanent retention
the law originally did not explicitly apply to electronic communications ; congress updated it after mrs. clinton left her job as america 's top diplomat
stories about government higher - ups using private email addresses for government work are nothing new
one obama administration official , former environmental protection agency administrator lisa jackson , used an email address with fictitious name attached â ' richard windsor
' but bill clinton is widely expected to announce a run for the white house next month , putting her conduct under an unforgiving microscope
members of congress typically have private email addresses , something that 's not prohibited under federal law for officials in the government 's legislative branch
federal law does , however , prohibit them from using their taxpayer - funded ' mail.house.gov ' or ' senate.gov ' addresses for fundraising and other political activity .
