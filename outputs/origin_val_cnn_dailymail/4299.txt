allowing council tenants to buy their homes was one of the â greatest conservative ideas of the last century â , david cameron said last night
the prime minister pledged to â keep backing â margaret thatcher âs flagship right to buy policy , and said its critics were hypocrites because they were usually homeowners themselves
his comments follow speculation that the tories want to extend the policy , perhaps by including 2.5million housing association tenants
harsh words : david cameron has pledged to â keep backing â the right to buy policy , and said its critics were hypocrites because they were usually homeowners themselves work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith also wants to reward social housing tenants who hold down a job for a year or more with an automatic stake in their properties
in a pre-election rally in essex , mr david cameron said that only his party could be trusted to safeguard the green belt because he is a â country man â
and he claimed that a labour government would result in higher borrowing costs ; pushing up mortgage cost for families by an extra Â£ 1,000 a year
last night a poll found that the parliament conservatives have taken the lead over labour â and that voters believe britain would be burdened with more debt if ed miliband wins office
polling from lord ashcroft , a former conservative deputy chairman , found that the parliament conservatives had opened up a two - point lead over labour
in a pre-election rally in essex , mr david cameron said that only his party could be trusted to safeguard the green belt because he is a â country man â it also found three times as many people believe a labour government will result in more borrowing and debt than if mr david cameron remained in office
speaking at a property firm in colchester yesterday , the prime minister said : â we will give more people the chance to own their home by backing the right to buy , and more security for those who rent
â right to buy is one of the greatest conservative ideas of the last century â because it âs about pure , undiluted aspiration
â as conservatives we do nât believe that people âs circumstances need to be stuck in one place forever
if you âre out of work â you do nât have to stay out of work
â if you âre in poverty â you do nât have to stay in poverty
if you had a difficult start in life â you do nât have to repeat the same patterns you were born into
all these things can be overcome with the right opportunities
â and that is what right to buy is about â people âs hard work taking them from being tenants in their home to owners of their home
â he added that critics of right were invariably homeowners themselves
â whatever some social commentators say , people do have a deep desire to own a place of their own , â he said
â and it âs interesting â often the people who criticise right to buy , who think it âs unnecessary , are speaking from the comfort and security of a home that they own
rally : david cameron applauds a speaker as he prepares to deliver a speech setting out the conservative 's sixth manifesto theme at thinkbdw in colchester â as conservatives we do nât think it âs one rule for us and one rule for them
we want to give everyone the chance of owning their own home
â so we extended right to buy
thirty - three thousand more people have become homeowners this way , and our conservative commitment for the next parliament is to keep on backing this scheme
â mr david cameron also pledged to protect the green belt if the parliament conservatives win the next election â saying he wanted his children to walk on unspoilt countryside such as the north downs
building must take place on brownfield land as a priority , he said , but he acknowledged that building could not be restricted to such land
he said britain is on target to build 200,000 homes a year by 2017 â bearing labour âs target by three years
â when it comes to our green belt , i have been clear , â he said
â the line remains scored in the sand â that land is precious
i am a country man
â put simply : the green belt is protected with us
and it is not just green belt that concerns people but green fields
â the prime minister also said that a future conservative government will â keep mortgage rates low â so that homeowners can â go to bed with real peace of mind â
pledging that maintaining low borrowing costs would be the first priority of the tories â housing policy , he attributed the britain âs historically low interest rates of 0.5 per cent to his government âs deficit reduction programme
he said labour âs plan to borrow for investment would result in higher borrowing costs for home owners
â and do you know what that could cost people ? just a one per cent rise in market rates would add Â£ 1,000 to the average mortgage bill
â britain âs home owners can not afford that
so in the next parliament conservatives would see through our long - term economic plan , clear the deficit , run a budget surplus by 2018 , and help keep mortgage rates low
