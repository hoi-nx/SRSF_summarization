teenage rebellion is a subject that strikes fear into the hearts of any parent
how to handle your growing child when they simply wo n't behave - at home or at school - and what to do when they wo n't communicate or worse , descend into a barrage of blistering abuse when they do speak
one of the country 's leading headteachers says parents fearing their offspring are heading off the rails can remedy many situations , however volatile , if they simply work more closely with the child 's school
dame sally coates , pictured at her home in twickenham , west london , said parents need to strike a balance between being too strict and too soft with their children dame sally coates has been widely praised for her no - nonsense approach to discipline and for turning around burlington danes school in white city , west london ( pictured ) dame sally coates , who turned around burlington danes school in white city , west london , and has been widely praised for her no - nonsense approach to discipline , says parents are often too quick to get into a battle with the school when a child misbehaves
' parents and schools must support each other
if a child is rude at home and gets into trouble at school , frequently they 'll go home and complain that a teacher is picking on them , ' she tells femail
' so the parent , to win over a bad relationship at home , will take the position of the child and attack the school
' i âve seen this happen so many times and it âs the worst thing to do
' dame sally coates has spent 40 years working in challenging schools and is currently director of the education charity united learning 's southern academies
during her time as head of some of west london 's toughest schools , sally coates says she was always adamant on seeing parents alone if there was a problem : ' parents should work with the school
if you 're worried about your child , meet with the school without them there
' if you work together then you âre much more likely to be successful than if you use the school as a way of getting back into the good books with your child
' with four children of her own and three step - children with husband serge , sally coates has , during some of the most demanding periods of her career , juggled teenagers at home and teenagers at work and appreciates young people do n't come with a manual
' there are thousands of programmes on television about how to cook , but there are hardly any about how to be a good parent
it 's important to strike a balance between being too strict and too soft
sally coates , pictured with her husband serge cefia , has four children of her own and three step - children schools must share responsibility when things go wrong too , she adds : ' teachers and heads work with thousands of teenagers , whereas parents just deal with one or two
' people go into parenthood with no advice or training
getting it right is not easy
' in the past , i âve put students on report at home to ensure that their behaviour with their family is as good as their behaviour at school
' we âve also looked after confiscated games consoles on behalf of parents until after the exam period is over
' teenage rebellion comes in many forms with modern parents fearing the dangers associated with issues such as social media and religious fundamentalism alongside the classic teen angst issues of drugs , alcohol and underage sex
so how can you tell if your teenager is just being a normal adolescent or slipping into something more worrying ? dame sally coates with her husband serge cefia ( far right ) and two of her sons , nathan ( second right ) and theo ( third right ) at their home in twickenham , west london ' red flag signs might be that a child becomes withdrawn or secretive but the only real guide is to use your common sense
' sally coates , who has just published a new book , headstrong  , on school leadership says the importance of good parenting in early childhood should n't be underestimated
do n't try and resolve issues during a heated argument : it 's better to wait until you 're both feeling calm
have conversations about your relationship and areas of conflict
do nât take the bait : when they answer back , it âs ok to ignore it sometimes
never cite their friends or other siblings as being better than them
give more praise than criticism 4 )
avoid false threats : do nât threaten things that you âre not going to carry out
try and have fun : make time to do nice things , something that you both like doing ' make sure that young children have boundaries
giving in is the easiest option but should be resisted
understand that teenagers are going to be quite difficult
work through problems with them rather than taking them on head - on
' pupils were asked to call their female teachers not as ' miss ' but ' madam ' - the proper equivalent of ' sir ' and those students turning up even a few seconds later than the morning bell would be issued with a same - day detention
' the primary responsibility of a school is academic success , but there are plenty of other things that matter too
' a lot of the softer things that we teach in schools like manners and presentation skills are really important
' at burlington danes school , we expected students to stand up on the bus for an older person , and to walk along pavements without taking up the whole space
schools can and should train students for this
' and there is responsibility too , she says , when it comes to preparing young people for the world of work
' students should know how to shake hands , how to dress for interviews , how to be confident without being overbearing and how to write a cv
' has the superhead 's own family life suffered from such a stellar career ? ' i âm very good at prioritising my time , very organised , but sometimes things do have to give
sally coates , who has just published a new book , headstrong  , on school leadership says the importance of good parenting in early childhood should n't be underestimated ' my children might say that sometimes i was nât at the school gates enough to pick them up
you just hope that you instill the right values to turn out nice people who can fulfill their potential - whatever that may be - and have self esteem and confidence
' and the key to work / life balance in her experience ? ' delegation is critical : surrounding yourself with great people at work
i âve been fortunate with energy and good health
