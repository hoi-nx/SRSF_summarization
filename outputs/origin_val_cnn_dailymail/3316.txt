brazil legend pele has praised his country 's current star neymar as ' an excellent young player ' but says he will never replace him as the footballing ' king ' even if he matches his goalscoring record
neymar has scored 42 international goals despite only turning 23 last month , and pele 's brazilian record of 77 strikes is well within his sights with a long career at the top still ahead of him
but the 74 - year - old brazilian icon feels that even if the young pretender can match his incredible feat , he will still not be considered in the same class as him
brazil legend pele says that even if neymar matches his goalscoring record he still wo n't be the ' king ' neymar has 42 international goals at the age of just 23 and could easily catch pele if he keeps up that rate ' i think to be the new king , the new pele , is impossible , ' he said of neymar
' my mother and my father closed the machine
i think he 's a good player , an excellent young player and he 's going to be a big star , no doubt
' brazil face france on wednesday night in paris and pele feels that despite their humiliation at the last tournament on home territory , brazil can prove to be an international force again ahead of the 2018 world cup in russia
' i think to be the new king , the new pele , is impossible , ' pele said of his young pretender in the national team neymar leads the ball away from dani carvajal as barcelona won el clasico against real madrid on sunday when asked whether brazil , being led once again by head coach dunga , could win the title in russia in three years time , pele said : ' i hope so
' i think with dunga , ( he ) has a different style to felipe ( scolari ) , more defensive , but i believe in dunga
he could make a good national team
' brazilian coach dunga has pele 's backing , with the legendary forward saying he could win the world cup
