it might be one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar but some of the arrivals at cheltenham festival today appeared to have dressed for the club rather than the parade ring
although rural staples such as tweed , fur and hunter wellies were present and correct , other race goers opted to take advantage of the bright gloucestershire sunshine and stepped out in wool mini skirts , worn with knee - length boots
print also proved a hit , with one brave lady choosing a cheerful ensemble comprised of a leopard print bag combined with a matching coat , boots and tights , while another opted for head - to - toe zebra print
warm coats in an array of colourful hues proved particularly popular , with feather - festooned millinery used to ramp up the glamour along with opulent fur cuffs and collars
blue appears to be an early contender in the racing season style stakes , with scores of ladies opting for the colour in a whole range of shades , from cornflower to cobalt
whatever the colour , the vast majority appeared cheerful as they arrived to see the action on day one of what is one of the most prestigious events on the british racing calendar
joining them was the first royal guest of the season , zara tindall , who cut a glamorous figure in a dark blue wool coat created especially for the royal by designer paul costelloe , a matching hat and oversized sunglasses
tomorrow will see the 33 - year - old joined at the cheltenham festival by her aunt , the duchess of cornwall , who has long been a racing enthusiast and is due to present a prize to the winner of the queen mother champion chase

ap mccoy also featured in the first day 's racing at cheltenham festival and piloted the hotly - tipped jezki , a dark bay six - year - old gelding , in the stan james champion hurdle this afternoon
unfortunately for ap mccoy , the race was taken by hot favourite faugheen , with the irish six - year - old battling home to give jockey ruby walsh his third winner of the day
off the course , most of the entertainment came from gloucestershire 's increasingly fashionable style set , who had pulled out all the stops on a very sunny day one
with most eschewing skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and comfortable patent leather boots , the race meeting is usually a masterclass in country chic , complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or two

while fancy dress does creep in on st patrick 's thursday , gloucestershire 's most fashionable tend to opt for a glamorous take on rural , with oversized sunglasses , pearl necklaces and twinkling diamond stud earrings deployed to up the fashion ante
fur is a recurring motif , as are hats that take inspiration from rural life
like the stylish effort unveiled by zara tindall on day one of the 2014 event , many come festooned with pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a perennial favourite
male racegoers are n't immune from the pull of country style either , with most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy blazer and artfully knotted tie

today - champion hurdle horse : faugheen odds : 11/10 he 's called faugheen the machine for a reason and it 's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on tuesday , despite the impressive field
worth a flutter : faugheen , pictured here on the gallops yesterday , is a popular choice among punters betting on the champion hurdle usual jockey , ruby walsh , is yet to decide his mount for the race , with stablemate and dual champion hurdle winner hurricane fly also lining up , but with fingers pointing towards faugheen it 's just another reason to back him
wednesday - queen mother champion chase horse : dodging bullets odds : 4/1 all eyes might be on sprinter sacre and sire de grugy , but dodging bullets has easily had the most impressive route to this year 's cheltenham festival , and although a short price the clarence house chase winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting
thursday : ladbrokes world hurdle horse : saphir du saphir du rheu odds : 9/2 paul nicholls ' stranglehold at the top of the world hurdle betting has tightened again following rock on ruby 's withdrawal
it 's going to be very hard to pick which of the stablemates will be sent off as favourite , but with saphir du rheu back over hurdles it can only be a good thing
veteran : ap mccoy makes his way into the cheltenham festival for the very last time as a jockey he gallops and jumps well , and his cleeve hurdle win shows he can do it at cheltenham festival friday-gold cup horse : carlingford lough odds : 10/1 it 's impossible to not back ap mccoy 's last ever ride in the gold cup - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20 - time champion jockey
there 's still doubts whether favourite silviniaco conti can finally make it third time lucky at cheltenham festival , but for the old romantics there 's only one man that can win this year 's gold cup , and it 's ap mccoy
