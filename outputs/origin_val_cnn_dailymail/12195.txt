nineteen - year - old tony robinson was not armed when a madison , wisconsin , police officer fatally shot him , police chief koval said saturday
" we have to be clear about this , " koval said
that 's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators , the public , to accept , to understand ... why deadly force had to be used
" the officer who killed tony robinson , 12 - year department veteran kenny , had used deadly force before , shooting and killing a man in 2007 , the chief said
kenny was exonerated of any wrongdoing and even received a commendation , the chief said , adding that the incident was " concluded to be a suicide by cop " situation
tony robinson was shot after allegedly assaulting kenny , who was responding friday evening to a reported disturbance at a madison residence , koval said
afterward , protesters in this university town took to the streets and converged on city hall , chanting " black lives matter
" koval called for calm , while acknowledging the protests are reminiscent of those that followed the deaths of black men in ferguson , missouri , and staten island , new york , after confrontations with police
police described tony robinson as african-american
" in light of so much things that have happened not just across the country , but in our own community , it 's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile , emotional and upsetting , " the police chief told cnn affiliate wkow
" and we understand that
that 's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances
we would urge , obviously , that everyone exercise restraint
" koval said he visited the home of tony robinson 's mother late friday night and met tony robinson 's grandparents outside the house
they talked and prayed , the chief said , but they advised him to put off visiting tony robinson 's mother " based on the dynamics " of the situation
" i could n't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences , " he said
" nineteen years old is too young
" tony robinson 's mother , andrea irwin , told cnn affiliate wkow that she did n't understand what happened
" my son has never been a violent person , never , " she said
" to die in such a violent way baffles me
" irwin said tony robinson served as a father figure to her other children
" he was our caretaker and so gentle , " she said
the incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars , koval said
dispatchers identified him as tony robinson , according to 911 audio obtained by wkow
a little later the dispatcher says , " apparently tony robinson hit one of his friends , um no weapons seen
" about four minutes later , the dispatcher says , " i got another call for the same suspect at [ the same address ]
he tried to strangle another patron
" about 30 seconds later , an unidentified officer says , " shots fired , shots fired
" when kenny went to the apartment , he heard some commotion and forced his way in , koval said
" once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer , " koval said
after that , according to the chief , " the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject
" backup officers and others at the scene performed cpr on the young man , who later died at the hospital
kenny suffered a blow to the head , but is being treated and will be released , koval said
kenny has been placed on administrative leave with pay
koval said he 's not sure what tony robinson was doing at the house in the first place
" his relationship to the home is unclear to me , although there were certainly familiar acquaintances
this was not a random place
" in a statement saturday , state attorney general schimel said he " can only imagine the heartbreak " of tony robinson 's parents and added he 's " concerned for the officer ... who , i imagine , is experiencing great trauma as well
" " they are all in my thoughts and prayers , " schimel said
under wisconsin law , officer - involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency , in this case the dci
once dci completes the investigation , the report will go to the local district attorney , koval said
some are demanding answers sooner rather than later
on friday night , dozens of demonstrators came out to the area around the apartment , which police had blocked off
a group also moved toward city hall before dispersing early saturday
" who do we trust ? " some called out , prompting the response , " no one ! " and in another refrain , they chanted , " black lives matter
" the protesters ' sentiments were echoed online , where some adopted the # willystreet hashtag in reference to williamson street , where the shooting happened
" praying for madison tonight , " wrote one activist
" stand up , sit in , walk out - until u get answers
and until there are no more hashtag eulogies
" mayor soglin spoke to the raw feelings , calling what happened " an enormous tragedy
" " we 've got a family that 's really hurting , " soglin said , according to wkow
" and we 've got a city and neighborhood that 's feeling pretty well hurt itself
" some of the protesters were members of the young , gifted and black coalition that was formed last summer after the michael brown shooting in ferguson
the group wants more reactive policing in african - american neighborhoods , said group member brandi grayson
she said madison police park on street corners in african - american neighborhoods and wait for something to happen , which leads to residents being hassled
that does n't happen in white neighborhoods , she said
she said young , gifted and black will be working with church groups on sunday and will hold more rallies tuesday and wednesday
