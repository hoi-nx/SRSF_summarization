the young young royals have been ordered to change their personal email addresses amid growing fears that they are being targeted by online hackers
harry , kate and william , as well as beatrice and eugenie , have been told to make the urgent changes after security officials detected a new threat of corporate and government snooping â most probably coming from russia â aimed at the young royals
the younger members of the royal family are seen as particularly vulnerable because of their use of social media
and the espionage risk is being taken so seriously that prince harry is believed to have also been told he must close down his facebook page
i 'm told the threat has been picked up over the past five weeks and comes from hackers looking to expose state secrets and details of multi-million - pound deals , as well as royal gossip
it is thought that snoops are offering huge rewards to anyone who can manage to hack into the royal accounts
the young young royals have all been warned that just one careless or unguarded remark could be enough to jeopardise lucrative contracts

' the warning has apparently come as quite the shock to the young young royals , who â perhaps naively â had ' no idea ' they could be a target
a threat from closer to home was exposed last year , when clive goodman , former royal editor at the now defunct news of the world admitted in court to hacking the phones of william , kate and harry almost 200 times
and when harry was in afghanistan , elaborate security precautions had to be put in place so he could communicate with his then girlfriend cressida bonas while he was away
harry , known as captain wales at work , had a specially encrypted ' batphone ' so he could call her without being overheard during his second , 20 - week tour that ended in january 2013
security issues aside , some of harry 's close friends will be joking that there 's another reason behind the change in address
in typical laddish style , his previous account included the figures ' 69 ' â a suggestive allusion to a sexual position and a sure - fire way to raise a few eyebrows
