a spacex rocket carrying the world âs first all - electric communications satellites successfully launched this morning
the huge 22 - story tall booster took off from cape canaveral in florida at 3.50am gmt this morning ( 10.50pm est yesterday ) , the third flight in less than two months for spacex
on this occasion , though , spacex made no attempt to land the rocket again on a floating barge , as they had done previously
it is seen here over the skyline of downtown cocoa beach in a two minute time exposure of the launch on top of the rocket were a pair of satellites built by boeing and owned by paris - based eutelsat communications and bermuda - based abs ( abs )
the satellites are unique in that they are powered solely by ion propulsion , as opposed to chemical propellant that is usually favoured
this has the benefit of making the much lighter , as they do nât need to carry fuel with them
â the value of electrical propulsion is that it allows the satellite operator to need much less fuel than when the satellite has chemical propulsion , â eutelsat chief executive michel de rosen said in an interview before launch
without the fuel they would normally need - hydrazine - the satellites each weighed less than 5,000lbs ( 2,270kg ) , whereas normally they would have weighed more than 8,000lbs ( 3,630kg ) without an ion propulsion system
this also meant both satellites could be carried by spacex âs medium - sized spacex rocket â had they been laden with fuel , only one could have been taken to orbit on this launch
this also brought the cost of the launch down - eutelsat and abs paid around Â£ 20 million ( $ 30 million ) each to place their satellites on the rocket , as a single launch costs about Â£ 40 million ( $ 60 million )
however , as ion propulsion - also known as solar electric propulsion - is much weaker than chemical propulsion , it will take them months rather than weeks to reach their desired geostationary orbit
â you can have a much lighter satellite , so that , in theory , the cost of your launch is much reduced
â the lighter of the two satellites , abs 3a , will reach its destination by the end of august , while the eutelsat 115 west b spacecraft will take a few weeks longer
in space , the two satellites were released one by one in opposite directions , so as to avoid a collision
once in their desired orbits , about 22,300 miles ( 35,800km ) above earth , they will be able to remain operational for at least two decades
to get there , they will use what is called a â supersynchronous transfer orbit â , which involves performing a large elliptical â loop â around earth to reach this relatively distant location
once they reach their orbits , they will remain in one position over a particular part of the world , providing coverage to certain areas
specifically , the abs 3a satellite will connect the americas , europe , africa and the middle east
the eutelsat 115 west b satellite , meanwhile , will provide coverage from alaska and canada to south america
eutelsat 's spacecraft will become part of a 35 - member network providing a range of mobile , internet , video and other communications services
the new satellite expands the company 's reach into the americas
abs , which currently has six satellites , will position its new spacecraft to also serve customers in europe , africa and the middle east
the companies are partnering for a second pair of satellites that are due to launch aboard another spacex rocket later this year
spacex also flies cargo missions to the international space station for nasa and is working on an upgraded spaceship to fly astronauts as well
the next spacex launch , which will take a communications satellite for tukemenistan into orbit , is currently scheduled for 21 march 2015
on top of the rocket ( shown ) were a pair of satellites built by boeing and owned by paris - based eutelsat communications and bermuda - based abs ( abs )
the satellites are unique in that they are powered solely by ion propulsion , as opposed to chemical propellant that is usually favoured the rocket flies through brevard county skies in this view from melbourne after its liftoff from cape canaveral
without chemical fuel the weight of the satellites was drastically reduced , allowing both to be launched on the same rocket rather than costly separate launches
in space , the two satellites were released one by one in opposite directions , so as to avoid a collision the vine above shows the moment the first of the two satellites - abs 3a - was released into orbit the two satellites are seen here before launch
abs 3a is on the top , and the eutelsat 115 west b is on the bottom of the payload
the latter was slightly heavier to support the weight of the former
