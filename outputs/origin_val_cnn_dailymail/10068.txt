a medieval man , who may have been a knight , died from injuries sustained from jousting , marks on his skeleton suggest
the remains were found at hereford cathedral and show signs of injury to the right shoulder as well as fractured ribs
experts said the wounds are all consistent with injuries that are sustained through tourney or jousting
did he ride in shining armour ? a medieval man who is believed to be a knight , may have died from injuries sustained from jousting , marks found on this skeleton ( pictured ) suggest jousting involved two or more knights on horseback fighting with lances and was used in medieval times to practice battle skills and settle disputes
archaeologists were excavating the remains at the heritage lottery - funded project between 2009 and 2011 â but investigations are still ongoing into some of the more unusual skeletons , including that of the knight
they have all been uncovered at the hereford cathedral , which was built in the early 12th century and forms a norman centre piece to the historic city of hereford cathedral on the banks of the river wye
the knight was laid to rest in a partial stone lined burial , which was popular in the area between 1100 and 1300 â the late medieval period
the skeleton has many fractures to the ribs and right shoulder , some of which have healed and others have not , indicating they were caused on numerous occasions
the bones were found at hereford cathedral and show signs of injury to the right shoulder as well as fractured ribs ( pictured far left ) which experts say are consistent with jousting the knight suffered an unusual twisting break to his left lower leg , so perhaps suffered a blow to his right torso and came off his horse while his left foot remained in the stirrup , causing his leg to twist
a modern recreation of a joust is pictured archaeologists were excavating the remains at the heritage lottery - funded project at hereford cathedral ( marked on the map ) between 2009 and 2011 â but investigations are still ongoing into some of the more unusual skeletons , including that of the knight they suggest that the man did not recover from the wounds when he died , aged approximately 45
there is even a chance that his injuries may have caused his demise
the knight suffered an unusual twisting break to his left lower leg , so perhaps suffered a blow to his right torso and came off his horse while his left foot remained in the stirrup , causing his leg to twist
this is another injury that is consistent with jousting , according to experts at headland archaeology , based in edinburgh
jousting began with the emergence of the knights as warriors in the 10th century
tournaments were organised as a way for them to practice their horsemanship and lance skills
a frenchman called godfrey de preuilly is said to have arranged the first tournament in 1066,lordsandladies.org reported
after the normans conquered the english at the battle of hastings , they divided up land among themselves and set up the medieval feudal system , in which everyone owed allegiance to the king and also the nobles
andy boucher , said : ' ... there is a considerable amount of evidence suggesting this man was involved in some form of violent activity and the locations of his injuries do match quite closely what might be expected from taking part in mock battles
' a 13th century manuscript depicting a joust is shown nobles provided trained knights to fight for the king and tournaments were devised so they could practice their skills in vicious mock battles
these took the form of a line of knights facing each other on horseback in full armour , who began the ' lance charge '
the dangerous gatherings were banned by henry ii to prevent injuries to valuable fighters
but his son , richard i , relaxed the rules and granted licenses to hold jousting tournaments
the original tournaments saw large numbers of knights fighting as individuals or teams , on horse and foot
the fights were treated as real battles â some resulted in death and some losers were ransomed
but in 1292 , a new rule decreed that weapons should be blunted and the ' lance of peace ' with a decorative tip was rolled out
sometimes disputes were settled by jousting and the victor was seen to have god on his side and was therefore not guilty
in tudor times , jousting was merged with magnificent pageants and state occasions , such as for the marriage of king henry viii and anne boleyn , and they were still popular during elizabeth i 's reign
the sport declined with the invention of the musket in 1520 and became a form of entertainment only
the knight was laid to rest in a partial stone lined burial , which was popular in the area between 1100 and 1300 â the early medieval period
experts believe that the man had not recovered from his latest wounds when he died , at approximately 45 years old archaeologists were excavating the remains at hereford cathedral ( stock image ) between 2009 and 2011 â but investigations are still ongoing into some of the more unusual skeletons , including that of the knight the skeleton has many fractures to the ribs ( pictured ) and right shoulder , some of which have healed and others have not , indicating they were caused on numerous occasions andy boucher who managed the post excavation work , said : ' obviously we can never be sure how people came about their wounds , but in this case there is a considerable amount of evidence suggesting this man was involved in some form of violent activity and the locations of his injuries do match quite closely what might be expected from taking part in mock battles
â the fact that he was still doing this after he was 45 suggests he must have been very tough '
analysis of the knight âs teeth suggest he had been brought up in normandy and moved to hereford cathedral in later life
some 700 individuals were unearthed at the site , offering glimpses of life , disease , accident and injury from the norman conquest until victorian times
among the remains are one of a leper and a mysterious lady with a severed hand , leading some archaeologists to hypothesise she may have been a thief .
