a major republican donor said thursday he had heard an anti-semitic remark made by gop chairman against the state auditor who later killed himself believing he was being targeted for his religion
david humphreys released a signed affidavit saying state gop chairman john hancock mentioned november 24 , when he was still a party consultant , that missouri auditor schweich was jewish
' the meaning i took from mr. john hancock 's statement and tone of his comments was clear : he ( schweich ) is jewish â in case you did n't know â and that being jewish is a negative attribute for schweich 's gubernatorial race , ' david humphreys affirmed in the affidavit
auditor schweich ( left ) committed suicide believing himself to be target of anti-semitic smear campaign , which a top republican donor said gop chairman john hancock ( right ) joined in on david humphreys is the first person to publicly attest to hearing such comments from john hancock
john hancock said thursday that he had met with humpheys at the businessman 's joplin office to discuss republican fundraising efforts , but he denied saying anything about schweich 's religion
' it did n't happen , ' john hancock said
mouton , a republican insider who is acquainted with both john hancock and david humphreys , said he also was at the nov. 24 meeting
his recollection backs up john hancock 's account
' i did not hear him say anything about schweich being jewish , ' mouton told the associated press schweich fatally shot himself february 26 at his home in the st. louis suburb of clayton , just a month after declaring his candidacy for the republican nomination for governor
the shooting occurred minutes after schweich told an associated press reporter that he was ready to go public with allegations that john hancock had made anti-semitic remarks about him
schweich had jewish ancestry but attended an episcopal
affirmed : david humphreys , ceo of building products company tamko , says he heard john hancock make a remark about schweich 's background that implied a negative view of his jewish roots former us senator john danforth , an episcopal minister who was schweich 's friend and political mentor , delivered the eulogy at schweich 's funeral
he suggested his friend had been driven to suicide by political bullying and an anti-semitic whispering campaign
john danforth said thursday that he asked david humphreys to come forward with his account , because john hancock has denied making such remarks
he said the republican state committee should oust john hancock from the chairmanship
' the brand of the republican in missouri has been badly damaged , and it 's very important to set the record clear , ' john danforth said
' i think it 's important for republican to dissociate themselves from what has happened in the campaign against schweich
' john hancock has said previously that he had mistakenly believed schweich was jewish and , although he had no specific recollection of doing so , has said it 's possible he might have mentioned that in an off - handed way while talking to prospective donors
john hancock said he learned the truth about schweich 's religion during a pair of conversations november 14 with john danforth and schweich , and he said he certainly never mentioned schweich was jewish after that
' i did meet with david humphreys on november 24 , ' as john hancock was running for gop chairman , he said
but ' i would not have said schweich was jewish at that meeting , because i knew that he was n't at that point
' john hancock said he also met with david humphreys on september 12 , as he was raising money for a catholic voter registration effort
he said it 's possible he may have mentioned schweich was jewish during that meeting but he has no recollection of doing so
john hancock said he has no plans to step down as party chairman , a post to which he was elected on feb. 21 while pledging to improve the party 's fundraising
david humphreys , who had given generously to schweich and various republican causes , said he has no intention of giving money to john hancock for any reason
at the time of his death , schweich was campaigning for governor against republican hanaway , a former missouri house speaker and us attorney
john hancock had done political research for hanaway 's campaign , but john hancock said his efforts were focused on the likely democratic gubernatorial candidate , attorney general chris koster , not on schweich .
