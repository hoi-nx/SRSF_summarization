an aspiring singer who made it to boot camp on x factor has become the first short - haired finalist in the england pageant
jade bagged first place in her regional competition when she beat off long - locked competitors to take home the title of miss surrey
and now the 24 - year - old wants to demonstrate to other young women that you do n't have to be ' perfect ' to win a pageant
jade is the first dark - short - haired contestant to earn a place in the england finals jade wowed the judges at the regional contest , her first ever pageant , in a dark blue satin dress as a she shared the tale of how she delivered her sister younger sister in her family 's front room
before jade earned her place in the england final there had only ever been one other shorter - haired competitor , but even she had a traditional look
jade says : ' there was a short - haired contestant in 2009 with blonde hair but hers was shoulder length and that was considered short
mine is cropped so is much shorter
' jade says that for her winning was especially important after the short - haired miss jamaica lost out to the long haired miss columbia at last year 's miss universe final
jade took home the crown at the miss surrey finals which was her first ever beauty pageant jade wants to demonstrate to other potential contestants that you do n't have to conform to win ' everyone was so shocked that short hair would get in the way of winning
so i am pleased that more short - haired women are being recognised in beauty pageants now
' i want to prove that long hair is n't the only beautiful hairstyle
' jade , who works as a coordinator receptionist has a history of charity work which she says helped her find her way into beauty pageants
' i 'm really into charity work and i wanted to expand that so pageanting was the perfect fit
it was jade 's love of charity work that helped her find her way into pageanting , she now works with beauty with a purpose , a miss world charity ' it was researching pageanting online that i found beauty with a purpose ( the miss world charity ) and that 's what got me into the pageanting scene
' with her cropped hair and undercut jade does n't exactly fit the pageanting stereotype , however jade says that her alternative looks have helped her secure modelling jobs in the past that led to her success at the miss surrey contest
' i worked as a gothic model when i was younger
you are always offered cash or the pictures from the shoot and i always picked the pictures so that i was able to build up my portfolio
' jade says that by winning a beauty pageant she hopes to show other women that you do n't have to conform to a stereotype to win or even enter a contest
jade also hopes to further her singing career having appeared on last year 's x factor ' i want to use the way i look to promote diversity and i want to inspire other girls and show them that you do n't have to be stick thin to enter
there are no rules , anyone can enter
i did and i won
' i believe all women are beautiful in their own way and that they should not feel the need to look the same just to fit in
' jade added that many young women are unaware that there are no requirements to enter a pageant and she believes that is down to bad stereotypes
' a lot people think that beauty pageants are old - fashioned because they have this perception of a traditional looking girl , but it 's not the pageants that are old - fashioned , it 's the public 's perception
' jade 's hair helped to set her apart from her more traditional looking competitors but rather than rely on a salon for her perfect crop , jade looks to her own mother , sara
' my mum is the only person allowed to cut my hair i never go to salons
i have had my cropped hair for about six years , and will probably always have it
' short hair suits my body and face shape and i will not grow it or put extensions in so that i look the same as other contestants
' when it comes to beauty inspiration jade looks to fellow short - haired celebrities
' my idol is grace jones i think she shows how glamorous you can be with short hair but i also love halle berry
i 've always wanted to be in a bond film so she is a real inspiration
' jade is certainly ambitious and as well as aiming for gold at the england finals in september the 24 - year - old hopes to progress in her singing career having reached the boot camp stages of x factor last year
' i never take on a permanent job i only ever do temporary work
i 'm a singer and i sing a lot so if a job comes up for me i do n't want to be restricted by a full - time job , ' she says .
