' both of her comments were deleted and she is now blocked from commenting or liking any post on the page
' i think banning and blocking people who are questioning , asking questions and discussing comments that are genuine and polite is dangerous because it creates an environment where one person controls what information is visible , ' daria said
' evans has blocked many health professionals and professional bodies from his page
these are people who unlike him have extensive training , clinical experience and access to scientific evidence about health , ' she said
' i would think their skills would be respected by someone who wants to improve societies health
