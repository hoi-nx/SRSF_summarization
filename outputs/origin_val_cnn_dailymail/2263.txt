with the expansion of the european championships from 16 to 24 teams for 2016 , there has never been a better opportunity for all four of the home nations to qualify for a big tournament
and after the fifth round of qualifiers this weekend , all have a strong chance of making it to france next summer
at the half - way point in the qualification campaign , we look at the story so far and assess the chances of each making it
wales the story so far wales have enjoyed an excellent start to their campaign , with three wins and two draws putting them top of group b the reformatting of the competition means that the top two from each group advance automatically to france 2016 , while the third - placed side enter the play - offs
bale celebrates after scoring a late free - kick in wales ' 2 - 1 win over andorra wales started sluggishly , requiring a late bale free - kick to spare them from embarrassment against minnows andorra , before earning a credible goalless draw at home to bosnia-herzegovina , who played at the world cup in brazil
goals from david cotterill and hal robson-kanu saw off cyprus before a 0 - 0 draw away to belgium , on paper the strongest team in the group
on saturday , they went top following a 3 - 0 win against 10 - man israel
arsenal 's aaron ramsey put them ahead on the stroke of half - time before the sending off , and two bale strikes made absolutely sure after the break
results : andorra 1 wales 2 ; wales 0 bosnia-herzegovina 0 ; wales 2 cyprus 1 ; belgium 0 wales 0 ; israel 0 wales 3 aaron ramsey celebrates his opening goal in the 3 - 0 win over israel at the weekend wales are currently two points ahead of israel in group b though they have played one game more when did they last reach a major tournament ? you have to go all the way back to 1958 , when wales reached the world cup in sweden , to find their one and only finals appearance
they came close to reaching euro 2004 , but lost to russia in a play - off
what 's still to come ? much now rests on their match with belgium , who are currently third , in cardiff on june 12
if chris coleman 's team can get something from that , they will be in a very strong position
september sees a visit to cyprus and a home return with israel , before the campaign concludes with a tricky trip to bosnia-herzegovina and a final home game with andorra
from here , there really is little excuse not to make it but wales have come close before , only to agonisingly miss out
fixtures : june 12 - wales vs belgium ; september 3 - cyprus vs wales ; september 6 - wales vs israel ; october 10 - bosnia-herzegovina vs wales ; october 13 - wales vs andorra bale was on target twice in haifa as wales lifted themselves top of qualifying group b scotland the story so far it was a case of hardest match first for the scots , who mounted some stiff resistance away to world champions germany and even drew level through ikechi anya before succumbing 2 - 1
a nervy 1 - 0 win over georgia at hampden park followed before a fine performance earned a 2 - 2 draw in poland
scotland actually led in warsaw after goals from shaun maloney and steven naismith but were pegged back
but two wins from two home games - 1 - 0 against the republic of ireland and 6 - 1 against gibraltar on sunday - have left gordon strachan 's side third , good enough for a play - off spot as it stands but just a point off the lead
results : germany 2 scotland 1 ; scotland 1 georgia 0 ; poland 2 scotland 2 ; scotland 1 republic of ireland 0 ; scotland 6 gibraltar 1 ikechi anya celebrates his goal to pull the scots level in their opening match with germany in dortmund shaun maloney fired home the winning goal at celtic park as the republic of ireland were beaten 1 - 0 scotland are currently third in group d - enough to secure a place in the play - offs as it stands when did they last reach a major tournament ? in 1998 , scotland reached the world cup finals in france so a return there is very much on the cards
they have twice made the european championship finals previously , in 1992 and 1996
what 's still to come ? the next match , away to the republic of ireland in dublin is absolutely key
if they win , they will establish a five - point gap over them
if they lose , ireland will leapfrog them
scotland have an advantage in that their remaining games against the strongest sides , germany and poland , come at home
they must take maximum points from their away trips to georgia and gibraltar
but in the most competitive group of the lot , they have every chance of making it
fixtures : june 13 - republic of ireland vs scotland ; september 4 - georgia vs scotland ; september 7 - scotland vs germany ; october 8 - scotland vs poland ; october 11 - gibraltar vs scotland steven fletcher scored a hat - trick in scotland 's 6 - 1 rout of gibraltar at hampden park on sunday northern ireland the story so far it 's been an excellent campaign for northern ireland so far , with four wins out of five putting them second to romania in group f michael o'neill 's side have exceeded all expectations , starting off with a 2 - 1 win over hungary in budapest thanks to late goals from niall mcginn and lafferty
goals from gareth mcauley and lafferty saw off the faroe islands at home , before jamie ward and lafferty secured a 2 - 0 win in greece three days later
their only blip came in a 2 - 0 loss to romania , but more lafferty goals on sunday against finland saw them return to form
results : hungary 1 northern ireland 2 ; northern ireland 2 faroe islands 0 ; greece 0 northern ireland 2 ; romania 2 northern ireland 0 ; northern ireland 2 finland 0 lafferty celebrates after scoring in northern ireland 's 2 - 1 win over hungary in budapest gareth mcauley scores the first goal in northern ireland 's 2 - 0 win over the faroe islands in october northern ireland are just one point behind leaders romania in group f at the mid-way point when did they last reach a major tournament ? northern ireland have never made a european championship and the last of their three world cups was back in 1986
what 's still to come ? the top two in the group , northern ireland and romania meet next at windsor park
in september , it 's the faroe islands away and hungary at home
the campaign concludes with greece in belfast and a tip to play finland in helsinki
encouragingly for northern ireland , there is a gap of eight points between themselves and finland in fourth , so there really is little excuse not to make it into the top three from here
fixtures : june 13 - northern ireland vs romania ; september 4 - faroe islands vs northern ireland ; september 7 - northern ireland vs hungary ; october 8 - northern ireland vs greece ; october 11 - finland vs northern ireland lafferty scored twice as northern ireland beat finland 2 - 1 at windsor park on sunday england the story so far a perfect five from five for hodgson 's men , who are making qualification look like a breeze
they have a six - point lead over slovenia in second and it would take a real calamity not to make it through from here
two danny welbeck goals saw them to victory in switzerland back in september and that was followed by a predictable crushing of san marino
rooney curled home a free - kick winner in a tough game in estonia , before slovenia were beaten 3 - 1 at wembley , with rooney and danny welbeck ( 2 ) finding the net
friday night 's 4 - 0 win over lithuania made this england 's best start to a season ever , courtesy of goals from rooney , danny welbeck , raheem sterling and harry kane
results : switzerland 0 england 2 ; england 5 san marino 0 ; estonia 0 england 1 ; england 3 slovenia 1 ; england 4 lithuania 0 danny welbeck 's two goals against switzerland in basle got england off to the perfect start danny welbeck is the leading goalscorer in euro 2016 qualifying with six in five games england have made a perfect start to group e , with five wins out of five when did they last reach a major tournament ? regular qualifiers for both the world cup and european championships but normally falling well short of expectations
what 's still to come ? a victory away to slovenia in ljubljana in june should just about secure england 's place in the finals and , failing that , away trips to minnows san marino and lithuania , plus home meetings with switzerland and estonia should do it
hodgson 's men should really be aiming for a perfect record of 10 wins from 10
fixtures : june 14 - slovenia vs england ; september 5 - san marino vs england ; september 8 - england vs switzerland ; october 9 - england vs estonia ; october 12 - lithuania vs england debutant harry kane celebrates his maiden england goal in friday 's 4 - 0 win over lithuania
