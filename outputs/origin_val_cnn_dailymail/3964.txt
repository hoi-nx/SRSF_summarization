mccall has confirmed rangers are paying money for all five newcastle loanees - despite two of them being highly unlikely to ever appear for the ibrox club
mccall has inherited a bizarre situation created by the extraordinary mass deal chief executive llambias brokered on transfer deadline day early last month
llambias â a former managing director at st james â park â has since been ousted as a plc director and suspended from the football board at ibrox following the takeover by dave king and his allies
sturat mccall has revealed that rangers are paying some of the wages for the five players signed on loan from newcastle in the january window even though only one of them is available at the moment of the five players loaned from newcastle , only haris vuckic will again be available for sunday 's crunch championship encounter with hibernian after recovering from a calf knock
the only further first - team involvement has come from centre - back remie streete , who managed 44 minutes against raith last month before succumbing to a hamstring injury
youngster kevin , who has never played a senior game , is involved with rangers â under - 20 squad , but mccall revealed midfielder gael bigirimana has been ruled out for the season by an unspecified â medical condition â
the new ibrox boss is also highly sceptical about ever having northern ireland international shane ferguson available , as he recovers from a knee injury on tyneside
asked if the quintet were on rangers wage bill , mccall replied : â yes
the club is paying for them
â it âs understood the ibrox outfit only make a contribution to their newcastle wages , rather than paying the entire salary they earn at mike ashley âs club
mccall prepares the rangers players for sunday 's clash with hibernian even so , the fact so little value has been earned will outrage rangers fans
â biggi ( bigirimana ) has a medical condition that our consultant is dealing with , â said mccall
â but he wo nât play for us this season
â kevin is training and he has played two under - 20 games , but his match fitness is not up to what we would like at the moment
but he âs working hard , the kid
â shane ferguson has had a long - standing serious knee injury , i think he âs been out for four or five months
he had a minor setback a couple of weeks ago , so he wo nât be up with us for another couple of weeks
â by then he will have been out for five or six months so he âll likely need another six weeks to get him anywhere near being available
â so even though he might come up and train with us , depending on what level we can get him to , he looks a serious doubt to be involved
mccall faces the media on friday ahead of the crucial clash with second place hibernian â remie streete came and played the first game and pulled his hamstring , was out for a couple of weeks then came back and pulled his thigh
and he âs had an ear infection on top of that
â he âs two or three weeks again , working with the medical side of it
but again i do nât think remie streete has played lots of football over the past two years
so we did nât have guys coming in who were hitting the ground running , being ready to play
â mccall said enquiries about bigirimana âs condition would have to be directed to the medical staff
however , when pressed if it was something the 21 - year - old had contracted since moving to glasgow , he replied : â no. it âs a long - standing thing
â the current state of play begs the question as to whether rangers can simply send those not available back to newcastle
â i think that âs not for me , that âs for the hierarchy to sort out , â said mccall
â certainly two of them - biggi and shane ferguson - would be very doubtful , unless shane ferguson recovers very quickly from his long - term knee operation
â for kevin and remie , it âs just about getting some football in them
if they are ready to go then we will consider them
