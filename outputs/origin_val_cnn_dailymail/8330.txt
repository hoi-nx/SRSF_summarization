a teenager has become the first cancer patient in british to have a metal port fitted to his head so doctors can blast drugs directly at his brain tumour
james , 17 , had the titanium socket - which was created by a 3d printer - bolted to his skull after traditional treatments failed to halt his aggressive brain tumour
a ' plug ' is screwed into the port which allows chemotherapy drugs to be pumped into the tumour along four hair - thin catheters with pinpoint accuracy
james has now become the first british cancer sufferer to have be fitted with a ' skull socket ' the 17 - year - old had the titanium socket - which was created by a 3d printer - bolted to his skull after traditional treatments failed to halt his aggressive brain tumour james is one of only three cancer sufferers in the world to receive the risky treatment , called ' convection - enhanced delivery ' ( ceh ) , which has not even reached stage one trials
' the first thing that i thought was that i was going to be like robocop , ' he said
' but i actually do n't really notice it
' i can feel it when they connect it but once it has connected it is fine
' when they screw it in i can here a scrapping noise inside my head
' james , of taunton , somerset , was diagnosed with glioblastoma in january 2014 after complaining of migraines and stress
james underwent a 12 hour operation at frenchay hospital in bristrol in february to remove the tennis - ball sized tumour , leaving him with short - term memory loss and restricted use of the left side of his body a ' plug ' is screwed into the port which allows chemotherapy drugs to be pumped into the tumour along four hair - thin catheters with pinpoint accuracy he underwent a 12 hour operation at frenchay hospital in bristrol in february to remove the tennis - ball sized tumour , leaving him with short - term memory loss and restricted use of the left side of his body
although most of the tumour was cut out , it was attached to his thalamus in the centre of his brain and some could n't be removed safely
following the operation , he began oral chemotherapy , radiotherapy and was enrolled on a stage 2 drug test called avastin from a french pharmaceutical company
but none of the treatments worked and the tumour began to regrow , leaving the family with few choices
fortunately for the teen , he was then selected to take part in the ceh trials carried out by neurosurgeon professor steven gill at bristol royal hospital for children
a 3d titanium port was fitted to james ' head at southmead hospital , bristol , in late october with treatment beginning in november
he undergoes treatment for several hours over two days , after which he is discharged for six weeks before receiving another dose
the teen , pictured after the operation , is one of only three cancer sufferers in the world to receive the risky treatment , called ' convection - enhanced delivery ' ( ceh ) , which has not even reached stage one trials james ' father simon does not blame the nhs for not funding the treatment james has now received three doses of the chemotherapy - classed as one ' cycle ' of treatment - and will have a scan at the end of march to reveal how he has responded
the concept has been around for nearly a decade but can be dangerous and so had never been used to treat cancer and or had even reached stage one trials
as a result the nhs would not provide funding and the Â£ 36,000 cost of james ' treatment so far has been privately donated
james 's family has now set up the brain power trust , to help pay for his future treatment or that of others and have currently raised Â£ 8,000
his father simon willetts , 52 , said : ' his experience has given him a gift he can share - when you get through it , you 've got a unique story to inspire others
' ' he 's got a great sense of humour and everyone says he 's incredible , ' added his father , a salon owner
' he 's got strengths that i do n't know where they come from
' he 's teaching me all the time and his inner strength and spiritual calm have helped us all develop some qualities it takes a lifetime to learn
