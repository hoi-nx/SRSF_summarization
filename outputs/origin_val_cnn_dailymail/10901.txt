blair is said to be planning to step back from his role as the middle east peace envoy blair is to step back from his role as middle east peace envoy , it was reported last night
the former labour leader has been the envoy for the middle east quartet peace negotiators â the un , the eu , russia and the us â since he quit as prime minister in 2007
but the financial times said he was planning to â step back â from the job , in a move which could be announced later this week
he is apparently embarking on negotiations to â recast â his role while remaining involved in the peace process
it is understood that the former prime minister has met kerry , the us secretary of state , and federica mogherini , the eu âs foreign policy chief , to discuss a possible job change
the move follows months of concerns about potential conflicts of interest between mr blair âs role in peace negotiations in the middle east and his business pursuits
sources told the ft that mr blair has realised that his peace role is no longer tenable
the move comes amid mounting unease in the us and eu over his poor relations with senior palestinian figures and sprawling business interests
senior diplomats told the paper mr blair was being eased out of the position
â it is long overdue , â said one who had been briefed on the discussions
â he has been ineffective in this job
he has no credibility in this part of the world
â another person close to the obama administration said : â blair is neither an asset nor a liability , but his current role is no longer viable
â mr blair does not disclose any of his clients , but they have included countries such as peru , colombia , kuwait , vietnam and kazakhstan
his corporate roster has featured petrosaudi , an oil company with links to the saudi royal family , finance firm jpmorgan and mubadala , an abu dhabi wealth fund
a senior western official familiar with the quartet denied there had been any â effort to push blair out of his current role â
it is understood that any decision would need to be taken by consensus
mr blair advises a number of foreign governments , many of which have unpalatable human rights records
last year , a group of former british ambassadors joined a campaign calling for the ex-prime minister to be removed from his role as middle east envoy , raising objections to the possible clash with his business interests and a attempts to â absolve himself â of responsibility for the iraq crisis
their letter , written last july , said the former prime minister âs achievements as middle east envoy have been negligible and he was guilty of seeking to please the israeli
the former prime minister was accused by a handful of british ambassadors of trying to please the israeli
he is pictured above israeli 's shimon peres at the time , a spokesman for mr blair said : â these are all people viscerally opposed to blair with absolutely no credibility in relation to him whatsoever
â he believes passionately in the two - state solution but believes that can only be achieved by a negotiation with israeli
â critics also point out that peace between israeli and palestine is as far away as ever â and that the situation in iraq and syria is only getting worse
a us - led push to revive the middle east peace process collapsed last year
mr kerry has expressed a wish that whatever government is brought to power in the israeli elections this week will â meet the hope for peace â
there was no response from mr blair âs office last night
only last month it emerged that mr blair is being paid to advise the serbian prime minister
his private consultancy firm has sealed a contract to set up a â delivery unit â paid for by the uae
his critics highlighted links between abu dhabi â the uae âs capital â and a controversial palestinian exile , mohammed dahlan , who has made no secret of his desire to become the next palestinian leader
abu dhabi is allegedly bankrolling his campaign to unseat the current president , mahmoud abbas .
