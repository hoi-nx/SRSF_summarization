peter abetz , a wa state government mla , expanded on the remarks he made to a wa newspaper in an interview with daily mail australia
gay rights activist rodney croome said : ' peter abetz is reinforcing exactly the same myths and prejudices that the safe schools program is designed to challenge ' a former christian pastor and politician described an anti-bullying campaign as a ' gay lifestyle promotion program ' , in remarks blasted by gay rights activists
peter abetz , a wa state government backbencher - who first spoke to the wa - said he was concerned the safe schools coalition australia program would elevate lgbti children to ' celebrity ' status
' i do n't believe that any program should go into a school which actually elevates a subset of students - lgbti - to celebrity status and gives them special privileges which are not afforded to any other sub-group in the school , ' he told daily mail australia
mr peter abetz said ' no one ' should have to tolerate bullying but campaigns targeting gay , lesbian and transgender students could lead to more bullying in schools overall
he said being gay was ' not normal ' - as heterosexuals make up ' 90 to 95 per cent of the population on a ' distribution curve ' and just as ' skinny ' or ' obese ' people are not the majority
' just because it 's not the norm in the population does n't mean they should n't be respected and treated with dignity , ' he said
prominent gay rights advocate and tasmanian of the year rodney croome blasted mr peter abetz 's remarks
' peter abetz is reinforcing exactly the same myths , prejudices that the safe schools program is designed to challenge , ' he told daily mail australia
' homophobia and transphobia will not be tolerated
k thanks ' : this poster is one of several produced by the safe schools coalition australia in association with other organisations this poster here is among several downloadable from the safe schools coalition australia 's website ' a decade of large - scale studies in wa and overseas have confirmed that prejudice and bullying against young gay people increases their risk of alcohol and drug abuse , conflict with peers , early school leaving , and suicide
' ' the research also shows that one of the best ways to address this risk is to give teachers the skills and information they need to effectively challenge classroom prejudice and bullying
' the safe schools coalition australia program , which received a four - year , $ 8m grant from the federal government , supports ' gender diversity , intersex and sexual diversity ' in wa schools
the program will be implemented in wa from the middle of this year
sally richardson , the program 's national director , said in a statement : ' since the program 's official launch last june we have had a lot of interest and support from wa schools , young people and community organisations
' we are looking forward to supporting wa schools to be safer and more supportive for lgbti young people , teachers and families
' all students have the right to feel safe at school - only then can they achieve their very best
' mr peter abetz said the safe schools coalition australia ( which produces posters such as those above ) program would elevate gay , lesbian , transgender , intersex and bisexual children to ' celebrities ' at school
