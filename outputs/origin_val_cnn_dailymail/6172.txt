an idaho woman who is suspected of beating a hunter 's falcon to death with a beaded scarf after she saw it take down a duck is facing a misdemeanor charge that the pet 's owner thinks is too lenient
patti macdonald , 60 , of hauser , was charged with beating or harassing an animal after authorities say she fractured the skull of an eight - year - old falcon named hornet on january 7
hornet 's owner , dinger , said macdonald should be charged with killing a protected species
patti macdonald of hauser , idaho , was charged with beating or harassing an animal after she allegedly beat a hunter 's pet falcon ( example pictured ) to death with a beaded scarf in an effort to save a duck dinger ( seen with other falcon ) thinks macdonald 's misdemeanor charge was not harsh enough dinger , who was hunting with hornet at the time , was about 500 yards away when the bird of prey made a successful attack and landed with the duck
he said he was approaching the spot when he saw macdonald 's red jeep wrangler pull up
hornet flew away but appeared injured and dinger found him dead about an hour later , the coeur d'alene press reported
according to dinger , hornet had been with humans since the day he was hatched
he said : ' they do n't really know they are falcons
' that was probably a part of his undoing because you could walk up to him and he would n't fly or try to get away
' the duck ( example pictured ) also died
macdonald is facing up to six months in jail and a $ 5,000 fine dinger said it was tough to accept what happened because his bird was so young and falcons can live for about 30 years when they 're with humans
he said : ' i had planned for hornet to live longer than me
' walker , a regional conservation officer for the idaho fish and game department , said he received an anonymous call from a woman saying she tried to save a duck from a falcon
the phone system identified the caller as macdonald
walker wrote in a report : ' the woman later stated that she had been very upset about the duck being injured , but felt bad about injuring someone 's pet , because she ' beat the crap out of it really hard
' " kootenai county prosecutor barry mchugh said he reviewed walker 's report and determined the misdemeanor charge was appropriate
beating or harassing an animal is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $ 5,000 for a first - time offender
peregrine falcons were on the threatened and endangered species list , but they were removed by the fws in 1999
' there are between 2,000 and 3,000 breeding pairs of united states peregrine falcons in canada , mexico , and the united states
' according to the fws
it 's unclear if hornet was a peregrine .
