steve cotterill âs dapper cup final suit was ruined , drenched in the champagne poured over him by his elated players
but he did nât care one bit
â they can tip champagne over me any day of the week if we win , â laughed the thrilled city manager
after all , this is city âs season
they âre coasting to the league one title and , with a handsome piece of silverware already in the cabinet , the good times have returned to ashton gate
steve cotterill and kieran agard look delighted after winning the trophy and city could now clinch the double captain elliot ( centre ) lifts the johnstone 's paint trophy as his city team - mates celebrate mark little ( 2 ) bundles home the second goal after a goal mouth scrambled left him a clear goal to aim at the full back celebrates in front of the city fans after he doubled his side 's lead this was as straightforward as a wembley final gets
they lifted the johnstone 's paint trophy in front of 40,000 jubilant bristolians after goals from aden flint and mark little saw off walsall âs meek challenge
but this was merely a taste of things to come
with a 10 - point advantage over their nearest league challengers preston north end , city will surely also be lifting a trophy the next time they meet walsall , in the last game of the season on may 3
like so often during this campaign , they were in control from start to finish , showing the greater assurance in front of goal in a game of few chances
now comes the task of crossing the finish line and completing a double but it would take a collapse of spectacular proportions to deny them a return to the championship after two seasons away
â hopefully this can push us on to finish the season off , â said steve cotterill , who also enjoyed wembley success in the 1998 fa trophy final with hometown club cheltenham town
â the one thing they have experienced today is that 30 - 40 minutes of euphoria and it âs really important to feel that early in your career
â we have a fixation now â we just want to win the league
' aden flint ( left ) scores the opening goal for city during the johnstone 's paint trophy final the big centre half runs away to celebrate his opening goal at wembley for city the 50 - year - old appears to be on a mission to put the west country on the footballing map , saying the area had been starved of success
â they play a lot of rugby at school , so for the football teams to achieve success is good for the kids in the area , â he added in a cheeky dig at the real king of sports in the region
days like this will certainly help inspire the next generation of city fans
once the flames and pyrotechnics had faded at wembley , the favourites immediately seized control
their enormous following only had to wait 15 minutes for the breakthrough when aden flint outmuscled his marker to head home marlon pack âs corner at the back post
it seemed a second city goal would settle a game lacking in entertainment and it duly arrived six minutes after the break
freeman âs dancing feet worked space for a cross down the left and though goalkeeper richard oâdonnell blocked mark little âs initial header , the right back bundled home with his knee
both freeman and mark little were excellent , causing constant problems for the walsall back line
that moment was a fitting reward for their efforts
fans make thier way into the stadium prior to the cup final where city came away as winners derrick williams is joined by his team - mates and goalscorers aden flint , and mark little to pose for a photo elliot lifts the trophy high towards the city fans after comfortably winning the competition at wembley walsall were disappointing , but things might have turned out differently had frank fielding not turned jordan cook âs vicious cross on to the post moments after the second goal
â i just felt if we scored at any time it would have given us that lift , â said saddlers boss dean smith
â i âm proud of getting here but disappointed with the result
â for city , you sense , this success was merely an appetiser for greater glories to come
other things that caught me eye proof , from the championship , that referees can redeem themselves from cases of mistaken identity
when fulham captain shaun hutchinson handled on the line at huddersfield , official richard clark wrongly dismissed cauley woodrow
but after a consultation , he returned and made the correct decision
cameron jerome has been impressive all season but he excelled himself with an outrageous backheel finish during norwich âs 3 - 1 win over nottingham forest
that was the former stoke striker âs 19th goal of the campaign and helped alex neil âs team move within two points of the automatic promotion places .
