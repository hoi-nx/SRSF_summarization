sian , 51 , consulted her gp about an unusual freckle she found on her ankle as a redhead , 51 - year - old sian was used to having freckles â they âd covered her arms , face and chest since childhood
but in 2008 , she noticed a new freckle , darker than usual and larger â the size of a small fingernail â on her ankle
â i do nât have many freckles on my legs , so i noticed it straight away , â says sian , a mother of three and grandmother of five
â my gp told me it was nothing and not to worry about it
but , of course , i did
at the time , there was a campaign about the importance of early detection of skin cancer
every time i caught sight of the freckle , i would be reminded of how much i wanted to be around for my family
â however , instead of returning to her gp to ask for a hospital appointment , sian , from boston , lincolnshire , turned to her mobile phone for medical advice
â i âd recently got an iphone and was downloading the apps that were just becoming available , â she says
â one evening , i searched online for â large freckle â and found my way to a free app that claimed to be a mole evaluator that would identify at - risk moles
i thought : â why not ? what have i got to lose ? â â sian was ahead of the times
apps , short for applications â programs that can be downloaded to run on a smartphone â were few and far between in 2008
today , they âve become essential to most people âs lives
with 100,000 health apps available in british and more launching every week , the medical sector is a market leader â with apps to track calories consumed and kilometres jogged , give first aid advice , provide cognitive behavioural therapy for phobias and remind people to take medication
one in five health apps claims to support a diagnosis , as with sian âs mole app. one program turns your mobile phone into an electrocardiogram , tracking heart rhythms and emailing the results to a doctor , while others allow patients to record blood pressure or blood sugar
in 2013 , the global market for health apps was worth $ 2.4 billion , according to market research firm research2guidance â and this is predicted to rise to $ 26 billion by 2017
the nhs has launched the good health and symptom checker , and the use of apps in the health service is only set to increase
last week , it emerged that the nhs is now helping to launch apps to help people cope with depression
â we know people are more likely to make healthy choices if they can set their own goals , â says bradford gp dr shahid ali , professor of digital health at salford university
â and there âs evidence that with health apps , people are able to have a more grown - up relationship with their doctors and nurses
â a handful of gps have welcomed the technology to their practices
dr dhaliwal , a gp in walsall , west midlands , says three or four of the 40 or so patients he sees a day bring along their phones to provide information from an app. â they might have diabetes or high blood pressure , and we âll use the app to look at an updated graph of their latest tests to see how well they âre managing the condition
â but critics say apps need regulation before we encourage doctors â and patients â to use them
there are no rules to regulate health apps
and sian âs experience shows why this needs urgent attention
sian later downloaded a health app that said it would be able to identify at - risk moles ( file image ) the app sian had downloaded consisted of several pages of photos of abnormal moles
â i remember scrolling through them with a growing feeling of panic , â she says
â but when there was nothing that looked remotely like my freckle , i thought i was off the hook
the app confirmed what the doctor had told me , and i stopped worrying
â two years later , though , in summer 2010 , sian scratched her ankle on her staircase and the freckle started to bleed
yet still she did nât worry
â even when the scratch did nât heal properly , i did nât get alarmed
i thought it must be psoriasis , which i suffer from occasionally , â she says
a couple of months later , sian âs new gp caught sight of the messy spot , by then double the size , when she made a routine surgery visit
â he said , â that âs rather unsightly , why do nât i remove it ? â he made an appointment for me the same week , and later told me he knew straight away it was a skin cancer
â tests showed sian âs â freckle â was the most dangerous form of skin cancer â a malignant melanoma , which was at a stage where the cancer is liable to spread to the rest of the body
â i owe my life to that doctor and the fact that he noticed the spot while i was in his consulting room , â says sian
she was referred to hospital and , in january 2011 , had surgery to remove the tumour
â thankfully , there was no spread
the cancer had been caught , probably just in time
now , i have a slightly bumpy ankle and a 3 in scar
â sian says that there may have been a warning on the health app to check with a doctor â â but i did nât see it and , in the circumstances , i do nât think i would have taken any notice â
newer versions of mole - checking apps are more sophisticated , allowing users to photograph a mole and using mathematical formulas to check for skin cancer symptoms , such as asymmetry , irregular borders or varied colour
but they still miss two out of three melanomas , according to dermatologists at the university of pittsburgh medical centre in a study published in 2013 in the journal jama dermatology
the researchers reported this can give users â a false sense of security â
â this is very dangerous when a lesion can grow deeper and spread to other organs within a matter of months , â says lead researcher and skin cancer specialist dr laura ferris
and the fact that mole apps have been singled out in this way does not mean they are the only ones causing concern , says dr claudia pagliari , director of the ehealth interdisciplinary research group at edinburgh university
it was n't until two years later that sian ( pictured ) discovered that the mole was in fact the most dangerous form of skin cancer â reports of actual harm to consumers are still rare , but this could simply mean the potential for harm has nât yet translated into an actual event , â she says
but attempts by regulators in the u.s. to impose stricter controls have been unsuccessful
so while the manufacturers of mole detective , an app that claims to be able to â help to detect skin cancer earlier â ( and is downloadable in british ) has been fined by the u.s. federal trade commission for making misleading claims in its advertising , the app is still doing business as normal
so , how can you know which apps you should use ? there are guides that can be helpful , says dr dhaliwal
he recommends the nhs health apps library ( apps.nhs.uk ) â though it is limited to less than 100 , with a basic rating system
he also recommends myhealthapps.net , an independent website that lists hundreds of apps , with a â five heart â rating system based on reviews by patient groups , consumers and carers globally
nhs england is to unveil a system of awarding kitemarks to trusted health apps later this year
but this will be a tricky enterprise , says charles lowe , chair of the royal society of medicine telemedicine and e-health section
proportion of gps who use the internet to diagnose patients
â online commerce has found ways of approving apps very quickly as they come on the market , â he says
â health apps will have to be approved with the same urgency â in days or weeks , rather than months or years , as with new drugs
but there must nât be any compromise to safety or efficacy
â whether british doctors will welcome the e-health revolution â and their patients brandishing mobile phones in the consulting room â still remains to be seen
a recent survey of family doctors found eight in ten reported patients becoming more anxious as a result of using apps
dr martin scurr , good health âs gp , says apps â will never be a substitute for an appointment with the doctor â
â patients sometimes email me photographs , asking for an opinion , â he says
â it does nât work
they have to come into the surgery and be examined properly
â certainly , sian has been put off health apps
â obviously , my first gp got it wrong when he told me not to worry about my freckle , â she says
â but on top of that , the app gave me a false sense of security
â thank goodness i now have a good doctor
thanks to him , all should be well at my five - year check - up next month
but it was a close call
