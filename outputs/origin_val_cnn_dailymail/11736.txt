moments after last night 's tv contest came off air , labour 's election chief douglas alexander was briefing journalists on how well his man had done
without doubt ed miliband had won , he declared confidently
but he was cut off mid-sentence by news that the first poll was in , which told a different story
some 54 per cent of people thought cameron had triumphed , which is a slender win for the conservatives camp who have grown complacent about the idea that mr ed miliband 's dire personal ratings will stop his path to number 10
two snap polls after the tv election contest gave cameron the lead - but only just cameron and ed miliband were interviewed by paxman and questioned by an audience of voters as part of the first tv election contest of the campaign pollster icm said its snap verdict giving a narrow victory for mr cameron in the first of the leaders ' election broadcasts represented the company 's ' best guess ' of the nationwide response
in is survey for the guardian it found that 46 per cent felt that mr cameron had the best arguments , as against 44 per cent who said the same of mr ed miliband
the prime minister was judged marginally more convincing than the panel , by a difference of 48 per cent to 43 per cent
the icm panel also felt mr cameron better answered the questions he was asked , winning on this measure by 44 per cent to 37 per cent
in a boost for labour , 56 per cent of floating voters said they were more likely to vote labour , compared with 30 per cent more likely to vote conservatives
however , those in this section of the group were only a very small sub-set of the wider group
a separate yougov result found 51 per cent thought mr cameron won , with mr ed miliband on 49 per cent
the two men vying for the keys to number 10 on may 7 did not go head - to - head but instead appeared separately to be interviewed by paxman and questioned by an audience of voters
in an 18 - minute grilling , mr cameron was forced to defend not cutting immigration while putting up vat , questioned about the rise of food banks in britain and his failure to spell out where Â£ 12billion in welfare cuts will come from
paxman appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing prime minister cameron and he appeared taken aback when asked about the company he keeps , including a minister caught up in a tax scandal , a spin doctor jailed for phone hacking and being friends with jeremy clarkson , who was sacked from top gear after punching a colleague
but mr ed miliband faced a difficult ride time from both the studio audience and paxman about whether he is tough enough to lead the country
the labour leader insisted : ' am i tough enough ? hell , yes , i 'm tough enough
' the contest was played out on social media , with almost every tv - related tweet sent last night discussing the election contest
in a blog post , twitter cited kantar media analysis stating the debate made up 94.7 per cent of uk twitter conversation about tv over the evening , with more than 300,000 tweets sent by 10.15pm
there were more mentions of mr cameron than mr ed miliband but labour saw more mentions than the conservatives , while the moment that generated the most tweets came at the end of the debate as mr paxman asked the labour leader : ' are you ok , ed ? ' ukip leader farage and media mogul murdoch were among those whose eyes were glued to sky and channel 4 's much - anticipated question and answer session with cameron and ed miliband
the debate accounted for 94.7 per cent of uk twitter conversation about tv over the evening , with more than 300,000 tweets sent by 10.15pm when the labour leader declared he was tough enough to be prime minister by virtue of having stood up to mr murdoch , the news international owner tweeted : ' thanks for 2 mentions , ed miliband
only met once for all of 2 minutes when you embarrassed me with over the top flattery
' former apprentice and celebrity big brother star katie hopkins was not impressed with ed miliband either , tweeting : ' if this man is prime minister i will leave the uk
this man is not britain
this is russell brand in a chuffing suit
' and ann summer 's ceo jacqueline gold said : ' this is not the same labour that people voted for under tony blair
ed miliband is like kinnock without the personality
' but mr farage had a kind word for his labour counterpart , tweeting : ' ed miliband is showing more humour and courage than cameron ! battlefornumber10
' but he attacked mr ed miliband over europe and immigration and mocked mr cameron for being ' smarmy '
the south thanet parliamentary candidate said : ' his constant complimenting of audience for their questions is making cameron look rather smarmy and lacking in sincerity
' tony blair 's former spin doctor alastair campbell felt it was good night for mr ed miliband
he said : ' good night for ed , neutral for kay , bad for paxman , dire for dave
' others questioned mr paxman 's skills as an interviewer , with lord sugar boss lord sugar tweeting : ' i think ed miliband made mincemeat out of paxman
' piers morgan weighed in , tweeting : ' paxman eviscerated cameron with such masterful savagery ... that cameron won all the debate polls
' but match of the day host gary lineker backed the former newsnight anchor , saying : ' audience questions after paxman is like when spurs bring on soldado for harry kane
' as did bbc presenter andrew neil : ' paxo was superb tonight
but winging it towards end with ed miliband
seemed better prepared against cameron
' and he added : ' ed miliband was struggling at times but viewers will perhaps think he stood up better to paxo than the pm
