a new campaign on twitter that rallies against the current foodie trend of serving up meals in novelty dishes is gathering momentum
steaks laid out on slabs of slate , gooey puddings on planks of wood or even dinner on a gardening spade ... the backlash against domestic items being used as tableware is being spearheaded by @ wewantplates , a twitter account that is the brainchild of journalist ross mcginnes
in just a week , mr ross mcginnes , from west yorkshire , has already attracted some 5,000 followers with his series of witty ripostes to restaurants who have dared to inject a large portion of gimmick into their presentation of meals
' it was captioned , without irony , " that is a big meal ! " ' it was n't a big meal - he 'd fallen for all this style - over - content nonsense
i searched twitter for an account which would allow me to vent my spleen with like - minded people , but found nothing
' we want plates was born , and has already topped 5,000 followers
' diners rankled by the imagination of the restaurants they 've eaten in have been quick to send in shots of their own experiences , with bread and butter served in a flat cap , afternoon tea perfectly placed on a mini garden bench and a communal portion of spaghetti served straight on to the table top
started just a week ago , the twitter account , run by ross mcginnes from west yorkshire , has already attracted plenty of attention from disgruntled diners calling for a return to simple plates mamma mia ! this italian restaurant takes the words communal and table to the limit , with diners invited to tuck into a sharing portion of spaghetti and sauce on the bare surface a crate idea ? tartare sauce in a tiny watering can , peas in a plant pot and fish and chips in a wooden box and ( right ) a delicate starter is served atop a piece of stone no it is n't bedtime , yes , this is part of your dining experience
a surprised diner tucks into ' a yoghurt ice cream " brush " , mint - eucalyptus crÃ¨me " paste " and a gin and tonic ' at a restaurant in germany he adds : ' i âm certainly not looking to challenge any small businesses by â outing â them for their chopping boards or mini shopping trolleys of chips
the only ones that i âve named directly , or retweeted , are the bigger chains
i âm sure they can rise above it
' one chef willing to put his head above the parapet , michael wignall who runs the latymer at pennyhill park hotel in bagshot , surrey , said that diners would miss the inventive ideas if chefs returned to more simple tableware
' why do people want different clothing or cars ? why not all drive around in the same one ! after all , they all do the same job do n't they ? food is about the whole experience , we all like individuality and chefs are no different
' so how does mr ross mcginnes actually think restaurants should present their food ? with little fuss , it seems
' simple white plates and a well - pressed , clean table cloth
is that too much to ask ?
' food can look great in mason jars ( but is a pain in the @ rse to eat ) says ross mcginnes tea time with a difference : this deconstructed brew was served with milk in test tubes cheesy feet anyone ? brie balls served in sudded camper shoes might be one step too far looks sharp ! butter slivers served on a broken bathroom tile wo n't wash with wewantplates cosy crusts : switzerland likes to serve bread slippers in restaurants the chopping board where it all began : not a terribly big meal , just a ' normal - sized meal inexplicably served on a large piece of wood , ' tweeted ross mcginnes evergreen and always yum : the grain store in london 's king 's cross serves mushroom croquettes on bark
