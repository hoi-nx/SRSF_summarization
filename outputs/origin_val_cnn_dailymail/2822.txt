a voluptuous make - up artist who was targeted by bullies at school for having large breasts at a young age is hoping to become a poster girl for curvier women after reaching the finals of a competition that celebrates the fuller figure
danielle , 24 , was picked on by cruel classmates when she started developing breasts earlier than other girls
the young model , who lives in toddington , bedfordshire , was so ashamed of her 32dd figure that she covered up her figure by wearing unflattering clothes after bullies accused her of putting tissues down her bra to enhance her natural assets
' ' there were lots of jokes around school about me and if we were in a food technology class and the teacher said chicken fillets then people would look at me and snigger
' one of the jokes was ' how do you know when i 've got a cold ? because my boobs look smaller when all the tissues i stuff in my bra have gone
' now though , danielle is having the last laugh after beating thousands of other women from around the world to be chosen as a finalist for a plus - size lingerie company 's annual ' star in a bra ' competition
curvy kate makes swimwear and underwear for larger figures , striving to use ' relatable role models ' that ' promote a positive approach ' to body image
the company 's competition will see ten finalists invited to london for a photoshoot and makeover before a final public vote in april
and the overall winner will join the lingerie company 's line - up at their summer shoot and be awarded a year - long modelling contract
an inspirational figure in danielle 's life , her grandad victor galdes , passed away from cancer last year
a erstwhile note he wrote telling her : ' whatever happens in life , always remember to smile ' propelled her to enter the competition ' when i found out i was in the final i screamed a little bit - i 'm still in shock now , ' says danielle , who is single and lives with her parents
she decided to enter the competition after finding an inspirational note left behind by her granddad victor galdes , who passed away from cancer in september last year
danielle said : ' the past year has been particularly difficult because i lost my granddad due to cancer
' he was really inspirational and was a real character and if there was ever anything i wanted to do , he would say ' go for it '
' after he passed away we found a note in his holiday home in malta he had written when he realised how seriously ill he was
' it says ' whatever happens in life always remember to smile ' and that is what i decided to do
all about that bass ! danielle is hoping to become a role model for curvy girls danielle is finally comfortable in her own skin : ' as i got older i got more body confidence by realising things you think are important when you 're younger are n't any more
' ' as i got older i got more body confidence by realising things you think are important when you 're younger are n't any more
' i have become much more comfortable in my own skin and do n't feel like hiding myself away
' the thought of modelling has always been a distant dream and seemed an impossible with me being curvy and vertically challenged
' but i would love to join the campaign in celebrating and promoting beauty in women of all sizes and give others the confidence to love their shape too
' danielle will now battle against 24 other women from all over the world in a public vote which ends this week
alongside a modelling contract , the lucky winner will also get an all - expenses paid trip to the mediterranean for two , with Â£ 1,000 spending money thrown in .
