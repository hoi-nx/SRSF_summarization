he said : ' i was taken for a ride in the cruelest way possible
' i had only just lost my mum but hughes suddenly got more involved in my life and was arranging the funeral and everything
i am normally very cautious with money but she wormed her way in and virtually spent the lot
i went into the bank one day and when i could n't get any money , they told me there was lot of unusual spending habits and showed what was left
it knocked me for six
' i just did n't have a clue what she was up to
i thought we would have been sweethearts for life but it looks like ultimately she was only after me for my money
i feel like i 've been taken for a mug
' parker prosecuting said mr malcolm hibbert was not a wealthy man but even before the inheritance became available in march 2013 hughes had ' very quickly ' taken control of her boyfriend 's finances and set up an online bank account for him
in one day alone Â£ 1,300 was taken out of mr malcolm hibbert 's account
on the day the inheritance money was paid , hughes paid herself Â£ 5,760 followed by payments of Â£ 1,000 and Â£ 1,450
she also set up accounts with wonga , argos , littlewoods and next on the internet using his name and made purchases the couple went to blackpool six times as well as scarborough , the lake district and cornwall where they went to football matches , restaurants on railway trips and even and a speedboat jaunt
she would book the holidays then pay for them with his money after he asked her to action his bills for him
but hughes also used his cash to make card payments to william hill and took out loans with wonga to cover the transactions

mr parker said : ' mr malcolm hibbert is a man who had always lived with his parents
. his parents had always done his accounting and taken care of his finances
he had always lived with his mother
his father died several years ... ' the defendant herself said he did n't have a clue of finances or computers
' he had little or no understanding of banking and how it worked because his mother had control in relation to his finances
in terms of monies , he had somewhere between Â£ 10,000 - 15,000 of his own money in savings other than the inheritance that he received , held in various accounts
she claims said she was never told to not spend the money - and would show him receipts after withdrawing from the cash point
she also said mr malcolm hibbert would ask her to marry him on a daily basis ' she did n't consider her actions dishonest and said he would probably have let her take the money if she asked
this was more than just a breach of trust because of his vulnerability he was heavily dependant on her , the degree of trust was higher
' the money went missing between january 2013 to july 2013 before hughes was arrested
she admitted that she had dealt with his financial matters and bills and said that the transactions were both for her sole use and for their joint use
but she claims said she was never told not to spend the money - and would show him receipts after withdrawing from the cash point
she also said mr malcolm hibbert would ask her to marry him on a daily basis
in a victim impact statement mr malcolm hibbert said he felt ' frightened ' and often had trouble sleeping and would ' sit around the house for days end , crying on a daily basis '
he added that he had been grateful when hughes had helped him after his mother 's death but as a result of what happened felt ' hurt and betrayed '
he no longer enjoyed life and was struggling to focus on anything else and had made him ' sink further into his shell '
santander have since refunded him all the money
hughes , from lancaster , who showed no emotion in court , admitted theft and fraud
she had previous convictions for chequebook fraud and served a nine month prison sentence in 1993
in mitigation defence lawyer anthony parkinson said hughes had ' significant gambling issues ' and said her habit began during a previous relationship as ' some sort of escapism from that daily life '
he added : ' these offences would not have been committed had that money not been readily available
this gambling problem has always been in her life and was the whole motivation
essentially she does n't have Â£ 2 to rub together , she never did
she is not a lady who lived a lavish lifestyle
she is remorseful and bitterly regrets her actions
' passing sentence the judge mr recorder stephen riordan qc told hughes : ' whether or not you knew that inheritance was coming i do not know
' but you began plundering his bank account on a regular basis even before the inheritance arrived in his account
he trusted you to look after his affairs for him and you knew perfectly well he was not ever going to check on what you were doing
' i have little doubt if it had not been discovered you would have gone on plundering his account until it was empty
the affect on him was devastating
he 'd had no effective relationship for many years if at all , naturally enough he became dependent on you
you have let him down
' you have mercilessly stolen from him over a period of time
