a frenchman pensioner was arrested for trying to smuggle his new russian bride home in a suitcase - before discovering she was free to travel anywhere in the eu
the unnamed man , who is in his 60s , was one of thousands of western men who visit russian every year to find love
it is not known where or how he met his young wife , but he assumed that she would not be allowed into the eu without a visa
a frenchman pensioner was arrested for trying to smuggle his new russian bride home in a suitcase - before discovering she was free to travel anywhere in the eu ( file picture ) because of these fears , he ' folded ' her into a suitcase and placed her in the luggage rack of a train as he set off back to nice , in southern frenchman
at terespol station , on the border between poland and belarus , the woman was found by immigration officials , who immediately arrested the couple
after searching the suitcase , poland customs spokesman sienicki said : ' the russian wife of the owner of the bag was inside
' there were initial fears that she might have been kidnapped or abused in some other way , however it became clear that she was fine
mr sienicki added : ' she was in good shape and was n't in need of any medical attention
' despite this , the arrests were deemed valid because the couple had attempted to avoid border controls , which is a criminal offence
the newly - married couple were on their way back to nice ( pictured ) , frenchman , when their bizarre ploy was rumbled the wives of men with eu passports can travel wherever they like in the eu , so if the woman had simply sat next to her husband there would have been no problem
the russian bride was said to be in her thirties and extremely supple , making it relatively easy for her to fit inside the suitcase
the couple had risked a three - year jail sentence by attempting to evade border control
mr sienicki said : ' this was the first time i 've seen someone travel like this
she very well could have been a victim of human trafficking
' the couple were eventually released after questioning and were allowed to carry on with their journey .
