there is also a possibility that kane , a regular in gareth southgate âs under 21 squad , will be selected for the european championship starting on june 17
â playing for england at under 21 level is more important than a friendly in australia and i would be hypocritical if i did nât give that answer , â said roy hodgson
â this business about being tired â he âs played quite a lot of games but he âs not played any more than wayne , jordan henderson , joe hart , gary cahill and lots of other players
â if he needs a rest there âs a great opportunity when the season ends , before our under 21s get together
you ca nât expect me to say , â oh no , i understand he will play in australia and be resting when the under 21s pitch up â

â there are a lot of great players there and i have nât had time to think about what âs happened but i âm enjoying every minute and want it to continue
â beyond the kane situation , roy hodgson had to attend to some general housekeeping at wembley on thursday , such as the knockout blow phil bardsley seemed to land on his pal wayne at the captain âs cheshire home last month
roy hodgson said he had no view on the incident , which was revealed last weekend in a sunday newspaper

â whether they found it a worthwhile exercise , i do nât know
if it âs not , then it âs an awful lot of work to do for nothing
