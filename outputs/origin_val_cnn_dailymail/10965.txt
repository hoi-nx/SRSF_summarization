a park ranger in south china has caught an enormous china salamander that is the world 's largest living amphibian and is known as the ' living fossil ' because it has remained unchanged for 170million years
the man , named only as mr xiao , was shocked to find the rare giant salamander swimming in the water and later released it back into the wild , reported the people 's daily online
although it is one of the world 's oldest species â dating back more than 170 million years â there are few surviving populations of giant salamander left in the wild
its appearance has barely changed since the jurassic period
after keeping it in a temporary tank , mr xiao released the creature back into the river , watched by a crowd of fascinated tourists
the giant salamander is listed as ' critically endangered ' on the iucn ( iucn ) red list and a protected species in china
prize catch : mr xiao shows off his discovery , the first of its kind to be found in the area fine specimen : the china giant salamander is the world âs largest living amphibian and has been known to grow up to 1.8m long despite its status as an endangered species , it is still regarded a delicacy among china 's super rich
the salamander population has declined drastically over the last 30 years due to poaching and destruction of its habitat
earlier this year china officials were investigated for reportedly eating a giant salamander at a luxury banquet in shenzhen
a recent government crackdown means that anyone found to be eating endangered species could receive a jail sentence of up to ten years

30 years ago the giant salamander was relatively common it is believed by some that the salamander has anti-ageing benefits , although there is no scientific evidence to support this
the giant salamander holds a treasured place in china mythology and is called ' wa wa yu ' - or ' baby fish ' - in china because its distress call sounds like the cry of a baby
in the past the amphibian could grow to more than 1.8 metres in length and over 50 kilograms in weight , but due to wild harvesting most salamanders today are much smaller .
