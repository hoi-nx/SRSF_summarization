dr astro teller , director of google 's secret x lab , has described google glass as the ' poster child ' for privacy issues - but insisted we 'll ' be seeing a lot more ' of the technology very soon
speaking at south by southwest interactive festival in austin , texas , on tuesday , the 44 - year - old defended the headset by saying it just used cameras that were already in existence
he also slammed the way people use google [ x ] to highlight privacy concerns
the claims were made at south by southwest interactive festival in austin , texas , on tuesday speaking to dailymail.com after the talk , dr astro teller also gave a rare glimpse into the workings of google [ x ] , and made a rallying call for diversity in every industry
' google glass did not move the needle , ' he explained
' it was literally a rounding error on the number of cameras in your life
' the ' smart glasses ' , which act as a computer screen in front of your eyes , sparked furious debate when they were rolled out to the general public - which dr astro teller concedes was a mistake
in a bid to get feedback on the first prototype , ' we did things which encouraged people to think of this as a finished product '
project wing 's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m ( 4.9ft ) and have four electrically - driven propellers
the total weight , including the package to be delivered , is approximately 10kg ( 22lb )
the aircraft itself accounts for the bulk of that at 8.5kg ( 18.7lb )
the hybrid ' tail sitter ' design has wings for fast forward flight , and rotors for hovering for delivery and vertical take - off and landing
dual mode operation gives the self - flying vehicle some of the benefits of both planes and helicopters
it can take off or land without a runway , and can hold its position hovering in one spot to gently drop packages
packages are stored in the drone 's ' belly ' then dropped on a string before being gently lowered to the ground
at the end of the tether , there 's a little bundle of electronics the team call the ' egg , ' which detects that the package has hit the ground , detaches from the delivery , and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle
and though it has disappeared from the market for further testing , he assured dailymail.com ' you 'll be seeing a lot more of google glass very soon
' another source of controversy is the self - driving car , with fears that technical glitches - even by accident - could pose as a significant safety hazard
laughing , dr astro teller dismissed that theory
' people text when they 're meant to actually be driving
so imagine what they do when they think the car 's got it under control
' the assumption that humans can be a reliable back - up for the system is a total fallacy
' for now , the focus is on project wing , autonomous drones which could deliver products across a city within minutes
dr astro teller revealed the firm will make a major announcement on project wing 's progress later this year

' among the current crop of experiments , dubbed ' moonshots ' , is the self - driving car , a giant kite - style wind turbine that hangs from a string , autonomous drones , and project loon , which aims to bring internet signal to the four billion unconnected people in the world using balloons
dr astro teller , the so - called captain of moonshots , told south by southwest interactive festival that the company has had to fly in helicopters to every end of the earth - from the arctic circle to the south pacific - to retrieve balloons which exploded during initial experiments for project loon
' we designed our early balloons to fail , ' he said
a moonshot is something akin to jfk 's mission to get a man on the moon by 1961 , dr astro teller explained
' but what was not ideal was going to pick them up
' and in their desperation to speed up the manufacturing process of the 60 - foot balloons , they even tested the engineers ' socks to see which made them more agile and therefore more efficient
' we got the techies to wear thin cotton socks and do a line dance , ' he laughed
' then we got them to put on the fluffy socks and line dance again â¦ now they all wear fluffy socks
' a moonshot is something akin to jfk 's mission to get a man on the moon by 1961 , dr astro teller explained
it has to tackle a problem that improves the state of the world , have a key technical obstacle that needs to be solved , and be environmentally friendly and efficient
and no idea is off limits - if it fits the criteria
' you 'd be surprised the number of people that come up to me and say ' let 's get rid of corruption ! ' , ' he said
' i say , ' yeah sure but that 's not a moonshot '
' the key component , dr astro teller declared , is diversity in the company
' people throw around the word ' diversity ' like it 's a tip at a restaurant
' but really , having people who have different mental perspectives is what 's important
' if you want to explore things you have n't explored , having people who look just like you and think just like you is not the best way
' google has built and tested self flying drones designed to deliver packages
called project wing , it is being developed at x , the company 's secret research lab , which is also developing its self - driving car
