a court in ivory coast has sentenced former first lady simone gbagbo to 20 years in prison , the official aip news agency said
simone gbagbo was convicted monday for her role in carrying out crimes against humanity following post-election violence in 2010 which left more than 3,000 people dead
her husband , former president laurent gbagbo , is in the custody of the hague - based icc awaiting trial over similar charges
the charges stem from the aftermath of simone gbagbo 's husband 's election defeat in 2010
laurent gbagbo , then the incumbent president , refused to step down after ouattara was declared the winner of the election
the standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of the two sides , leaving thousands dead
in 2012 , the icc issued a warrant against her , alleging that as a member of the president 's inner circle , his wife was an " indirect co-perpetrator
" she attended meetings where plans were discussed and carried out to persecute ouattara supporters , according to the warrant
her husband surrendered to the icc in december of that year , and is currently awaiting trial at the hague on crimes against humanity for the civil unrest and deaths
both have denied the charges
but ivory coast refused to transfer simone gbago , saying it would try her in a domestic court instead
on monday , it did
