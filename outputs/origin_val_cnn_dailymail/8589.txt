as death - defying stunts go , hurling yourself off a 60 - foot high platform on the back of the horse into just 12 feet of water must surely be up there with one of the most insane
but back in 1920s atlantic city , launching a horse off a platform almost twice the height of a 10 metre olympic diving board was a daily occurrence
what 's more , the ability to do it well could win you fame
diving horse arrived on the pier in the 1920s , having become a fixture of travelling circuses previously
it would go on to become the star attraction at steel pier , with crowds gathering to marvel at the dangerous feat as the horse flew off the end of 40 and 60 foot platforms
french , who dove horses from 1928 until 1935 , throwing herself off the platform two to six times a day , told the new york times in 2008 : ' we were the stars of the boardwalk
' everybody had to see the diving horse
that was what everybody remembered
' we were a class act
' glamorous : the rider would don a swimming costume before jumping the horse off the platform safe : those who dove horses maintain it was safe - with only a few broken bones a year well - kept : horse diver french said the animals ' lived the life of riley ' and it was not cruel mrs french 's sister sonora webster carver was arguably the best - known of the horse divers , whose story was immortalized in the 1991 disney film wild hearts ca n't be broken
she took her first dive aged just 15 , in 1923 , and became one of the best in the business
but in 1931 , her career could have come to a premature end , when she was blinded after a knock to the head which detached her retinas
ms sonora webster carver was not about to stop , however : she dove horses for another 11 years , while unable to see
fame : the best - known horse diver was sonora webster carver , who had a disney film made about her life history : amazingly , you could still see horse diving as recently as 1978 the trick to surviving the falls , according to those in the know , was to tuck your head down one side as the horse plunged towards the water below
it is claimed the riders only suffered a few broken bones each year , while mrs french told the new york times the horses were so well looked after they ' lived the life of riley '
however , despite animal protection officers were concerned about the act , it continued until 1978 - when the pier had fallen into such a state of disrepair it had to be shut .
