one of britain âs swankiest casinos has come up with a revolutionary way of getting round the smoking ban â by putting gaming tables on its new roof garden
the multi-million - pound development at the hilton hotel in park lane , central london , will enable clients to enjoy a cigarette and gamble at the same time , and is expected to be particularly popular with wealthy clients who find the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces irksome
the move will see a return to the days of dr no , when sean connery as 007 meets the voluptuous sylvia trench at le cercle club , languidly puts a morland cigarette to his lips and introduces himself with the immortal line : â james bond
â the name 's james bond - james bond : sean connery , as 007 , lights up a cigarette in a casino in 1962 's dr no today , the suave spy would be liable for prosecution for breaking the smoking ban â the reason why a roof garden extension is being added to the hotel âs park lane casino for its aptly named â high rollers â
david mills , the hotel âs operations director , said : â many of our clients come from countries where smoking bans do not apply
we want to provide them with a relaxing and enjoyable experience
â gaming tables will be placed on the terrace so that roulette , blackjack , baccarat and three - card poker can be played under the stars , although westminster council has banned live and recorded music in case it disturbs nearby residents

â central london is a favoured destination for international gamblers , many of whom are from the middle east , and bets totalling millions of pounds are placed at casinos each night
earlier this year , mariam aziz , the former wife of the world âs richest man , the sultan of brunei , described in court how she went on â reckless gambling sprees â in mayfair
among the clubs visited were les ambassadeurs , aspinalls and rendezvous , and she confessed to blowing Â£ 500,000 in a single night
the park lane casino opened at the hilton last november , and membership costs Â£ 1,000 a year
the terrace on a new second - floor extension is due to open in april .
