yesterday , the mail published a poignant photograph of actress angelina 's family , showing how cancer has claimed the lives of many of her relatives , including her mother , aunt and grandmother
her mother , the actress marcheline bertrand , died of ovarian cancer at the age of 56 in 2007
her grandmother lois bertrand died of cancer aged 45 and her aunt debbie - her mother 's sister - lost her battle with the disease at 61
this strong family history comes from a mutation of the brca1 gene , which dramatically raises the risk of ovarian and breast cancer
this comes two years after a preventative double mastectomy because of her raised risk of breast cancer
but while many people know that a greater risk of developing these cancers can be inherited , what is less well known is that it 's not just down the female line ; the risk can be passed on from your father 's side of the family , too
catherine murley , a 44 - year - old commercial manager from rugby , inherited a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer from her father as result of a faulty brca1 gene
' i never knew you could inherit a breast and ovarian cancer gene from a male relative , ' she says
she only became aware of the faulty brca1 gene in her family tree last june , after suddenly hearing from her father mike , 68 , a retired teacher , after years of little contact
' i received a text from my dad saying : " can we talk ? " ' she says
her parents divorced when she was four and her mother brought her up with her sister sinead , 40 , and brother andrew , 39
' when i phoned my dad that evening , he explained that my cousin - his sister 's daughter - had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer , and the family had found out she had the inherited faulty brca1 gene , ' she says
catherine murley inherited the ovarian cancer gene from her father ' my aunt - her mother - had died of ovarian cancer when she was in her 40s
after my cousin was diagnosed at the age of 40 , the rest of that side of my dad 's family went for genetic testing
' that 's when my dad was found to be positive for the faulty gene
' catherine murley 's father was told this meant he had a raised risk of prostate cancer and male breast cancer , and a slightly higher chance of pancreatic cancer
he was concerned that the faulty gene could have been passed to his children
' i was aware of the brca1 connection because i had a close friend with it who died from breast cancer , ' says catherine murley
' but i assumed it was something related to women and did n't know it could be passed by men , too
' it 's a common misconception , says dr rosenthal , a gynaecological oncologist at university college london hospital
' unfortunately , many women and some doctors disregard the paternal side of the family
they do n't recognise the importance of a pattern of cancers on their father 's side , so denying themselves the opportunity for gene testing to clarify their level of risk
' we all inherit two copies of every gene - one from our mother and one from our father
so if either parent has a mutant copy , a child has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting it
assuming it 's just the mother 's line that you need to worry about is an understandable mistake , says dr rosenthal , as these genes tend to cause female cancers
' however , they are not passed down on the female sex chromosome , like some inherited diseases
men carry them just as easily as women , ' he says
' but women are more vulnerable to the effects
' while a faulty brca gene raises a man 's risk of prostate cancer to 10 to 25 per cent , they raise a woman 's risk of ovarian cancer to 15 to 45 per cent , and the risk of breast cancer to 45 to 90 per cent
' no one knows why the risk is higher in women , but it may relate to female hormones acting with the faulty gene to promote cancer , ' says dr rosenthal , who is also consultant gynaecologist at weymouth street hospital , london
he says it 's crucial people are aware of any history of cancer in their family
' men need to be careful not to disregard their mother 's side of the family in the same way women should not ignore their father 's side , ' he says
' if you 're in any doubt about the implications of a pattern of cancers in your family , discuss it with your gp
they can refer you for genetic testing
' after hearing the news from her father , catherine murley contacted her brother and sister , warning them they needed to be checked
her gp put her on a waiting list to have genetic testing
her father had waited almost ten months to be tested , but catherine murley did n't want to wait this long
' i was 43 , which felt quite old to find out you have faulty brca1 , ' she says
' the thought of it kept me awake at night
my fear was that i might already have cancer - i knew ovarian cancer was notoriously hard to diagnose
' it led to the commercial manager having ovaries and fallopian tubes removed and having a mastectomy symptoms include persistent pelvic and stomach pain , bloating and nausea after eating , as well as feeling full quicker
catherine murley paid Â£ 700 to have a test at a private screening clinic , which involved giving a blood sample
there are hundreds of different mutations of the brca1 gene , but as she knew which mutation she might have - as it would be the same one as her father - the laboratory was able to speed up its analysis
three weeks later , catherine murley went back with her husband martyn to be told her test results
' i had a bad feeling from the outset , ' says catherine murley
' but when the gene counsellor said i had the defective gene , i began to cry
i knew from that moment that my life was on a different path
i texted my dad and family straight away with my news
' catherine murley was told she was at equal risk of ovarian and breast cancer
but for reasons experts do not fully understand , in her family the mutant gene more commonly manifested itself as ovarian cancer in the female line and prostate cancer in men
women with a faulty brca1 gene can have annual mammograms to screen for breast cancer or have a preventative mastectomy
there is no reliable way to screen for ovarian cancer
catherine murley quickly decided what she wanted to do
' my close friend who had the faulty brca gene relied solely on annual breast screening
she did n't make it
i wanted to take away any risk of getting either cancer through surgery while i still could
' in september , she underwent keyhole surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes - the operation was performed by dr rosenthal
examination of the fallopian tubes revealed pre-cancerous cells
' i felt it confirmed that i had made the right decision in pushing to have surgery as soon as possible , ' says catherine murley
' no one could have said when the cells would have turned into something more serious
' two months later , she underwent a double mastectomy , with surgeons using tissue from her stomach to form new breasts
the breast tissue was found to be clear of cancerous cells
a report published a few months ago in the journal of the national cancer institute found more widespread genetic testing for cancer - causing mutations would save lives and reduce the amount spent on treating cancers
the eve appeal , the uk charity dedicated to gynaecological cancer research , is calling for all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer to be tested for faulty brca genes
chief executive athena lamnisos says it would increase experts ' understanding of these cancers and allow women to warn their family members , too
though her brother is still waiting for genetic testing , catherine murley 's sister heard shortly before christmas that she , too , has the defective gene
she will undergo the same surgery as catherine murley
' i have thanked my cousin for alerting us , ' says catherine murley
' i 've been able to take action to protect myself from cancer
