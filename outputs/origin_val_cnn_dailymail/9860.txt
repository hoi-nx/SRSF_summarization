this is the moment a pair of skydivers dramatically set fire to their petrol - soaked parachute canopies sending them plummeting to earth at 120 miles per hour
alex aimard and his friend petter jonsson leapt from a plane over eloy in arizona armed with a parachute doused in kerosene , a flare gun and a go pro camera
and after deploying their parachutes , the pair then pull out the guns during their descent to set fire to their canopies
alex aimard aims his flare gun at his petrol - soaked parachute after jumping out of a plane over the arizona the fire from the gun causes the parachute to ignite and causes a blaze in the mr alex aimard 's canopy with just seconds to react and release the now flaming parachutes before the fire travelled down cords to their bodies , the pair free themselves
but luckily they also have an emergency parachute , meaning they then glide safely to the ground
the pair , who are both experienced professional skydivers and base jumpers , had meticulously planned the dangerous stunt , which took place earlier this year
mr petter jonsson , from sweden , said : ' i was so focused on my task that i did n't have time to be scared or think about what could have gone wrong
' the fire then takes hold and starts to travel down the cords to their bodies meaning mr alex aimard has to quickly free themselves after being freed , mr alex aimard then deploys his emergency parachute so he can glide safely back to the ground while mr alex aimard , from france , added : ' petter jonsson jumped first so when i exited the plane i saw something that i will never forget - a big cloud of smoke made by the explosion of his chute
' it was like being part of a rambo movie for real
' the duo had been taking part in a two - week online project called living the dream , when they travelled to utah and arizona to perform the sky dives
the potentially deadly fire stunt took place on the last day of their trip
mr alex aimard explained : ' we struggled with the weather conditions and the project was on hold for a few days due to a strong wind , which gave us plenty of time for preparation
' when the wind finally slowed down , everything happened in a couple of hours
petter jonsson then attempts the stunt and shoots the kerosene soaked parachute with the flare gun with the parachute in flames , mr petter jonsson then starts plummeting to earth at more than 120mph but despite the dangerous stunt mr petter jonsson makes it safely back down to the ground thanks to his emergency parachute ' skydiving itself is not without danger and flying in a plane with two big buckets full of gas and two flare guns does n't decrease the risk
' you can imagine a lot of things going wrong but with fine tuned preparation there was no room for doubt or uncontrolled fear
' but despite the stunt receiving praise from fellow skydiving professionals , there was some online criticism
but mr alex aimard explained : ' globally the response was very positive , but we got a couple of messages complaining about the pollution and how immature it was to do that
' and i kind of agree , i guess this is why it was so much fun
