caspar berendsen , a private equity partner in city firm cinven , wants to build a children 's play room , tv room and sitting room underneath the home , as well as adding extra bedrooms
but neighbours , who are already enduring building works at two nearby properties , have branded the new plans ' inhumane ' , with one long - time resident saying he will move if the work is approved
vast : plans submitted by city financier caspar berendsen show he wants to add a children 's room , tv room , reception room and addition bedrooms to the already sprawling nine - bed , Â£ 11million home the home , in hampsted , was where galsworthy wrote much of forsyte saga , his epic series of novels and short stories for which he won literature 's highest honour

while there galsworthy added an extension to the already large property , giving it nine bedrooms

' he told the paper that residents had already endured years of noise from a nearby property belonging to former french footballer and arsenal star theirry henry
john gardiner , 69 , a tax barrister who lives next door to mr caspar berendsen , said he will consider leaving him home of 30 years if the works are approved by camden council
galsworthy was the son of a wealthy solicitor of the same name , and after graduating with a law degree from new college , oxford , he was called to the bar at lincoln 's inn in 1890

in 1904 he first used his own name when publishing novel the island pharisees , and in 1906 the first work of forsyte saga appeared , forsyte saga , which was harshly critical of his own upper middle - class background , and based party on his unhappy marriage to ada pearson
galsworthy then moved to hampsted , where he published the white monkey , the silver spoon , swan song , and interludes a silent wooing and a passerby , all of which form part of the forsyte saga , alongside plays and other writings
on forsyte change was the last volume in the saga , comprising a series of short stories , and was first published in 1930 , three years before his death in hampsted of a stroke
he won the nobel prize for literature in 1932 , and was praised as an author and dramatist ' of considerable technical skill ' , whose works helped drive social change
the forsyte saga was made into a hugly popular bbc tv series in the mid sixties , and was brought to life again in 2003 in a series starring damien lewis
history : the home featured in three works by john constable , including this , which was completed in 1922 galsworthy wrote the forsyte saga , a series of five novels and collection of short stories , between 1906 and 1930
it was made into a tv series in 1967 , and again in 2003 , starring damien lewis ( pictured ) explaining his plans for galsworthy 's house , mr caspar berendsen said : ' we believe we 've approached our planning proposals sympathetically to protect the history of our house and the surrounding area
' we circulated a detailed leaflet to our neighbours in advance of submitting our application , setting out our planning proposal including a summary of the engineers â reports addressing , we hope , some of the concerns that we had expected neighbours may understandably have
' we wish to create a family home for our five children which retains its historical significance in an area of london which we love
