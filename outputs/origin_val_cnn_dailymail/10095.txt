sneaky tactics used by airlines , banks and insurance companies to trick millions of customers into buying extra insurance could soon be outlawed
the city watchdog has said it wants to ban companies from â opt out â selling â where customers have to untick a box in the small print if they want to avoid buying an add - on insurance policy
in a damning report , the fca said many customers are being tricked into buying products they do not want or need
the fca said many customers are being tricked into buying products they do not want or need those that fall into the trap - whether they are buying a concert ticket or paying for car insurance - are more likely to buy inappropriate products , or receive poor value for money
the fca estimates the scam is costing customers more than Â£ 108 million a year in overpayments
the market for such products - including identity theft protection , home insurance and breakdown cover â is worth an estimated Â£ 1billion a year to the insurance industry
they are typically sold alongside insurance such as travel , car and home cover
but just under a fifth of customers are not even aware they have them , according to the fca
the sale of add - on products has already given rise to the payment protection insurance mis - selling scandal , where millions of customers were sold policies they did not want or need alongside loans or credit cards
high street banks and other lenders have paid out Â£ 18billion in compensation so far â making it the most expensive mis - selling scandal in uk history
the sneaky tactics are used by airlines and banks with products - including identity theft protection , home insurance and breakdown cover - typically sold alongside travel and car insurance and home cover christopher woolard , director of strategy and competition at the fca said : â this is about ensuring consumers can make the right decision on what add - on insurance they do or do nât need
forgetting to untick a box at the end of a purchase is not making an informed choice
â similar tactics are used by firms to barrage customers with junk mail and marketing
the ban would apply to add - on sales of all products alongside financial primary policies - meaning the insurance policy or loan that the customer intended to buy in the first place
paying out : the fca estimates the scam is costing customers more than Â£ 108 million a year in overpayments key examples include key cover sold alongside motor insurance , or protection cover when taking out a mortgage or credit card
the city watchdog also wants firms to inform customers about add - on policies earlier in the sales process â rather than just before they make the purchase - so they can make an informed choice and shop around
existing rules are already meant to protect customers who are buying an add - on financial policy alongside a non financial product such as a plane ticket
the sale of insurance add - ons is hugely lucrative , with insurance companies making bumper profits
according to a separate study by the competition and markets authority just 5pc of premiums collected from customers who take out personal injury insurance alongside motor insurance is paid out in claims
hugh savill , director of regulation at industry lobby group the association of british insurers said it supported the proposed ban
it said : â although the use of pre-ticked boxes is not widespread , these proposals will encourage all firms to make sure their customers are provided with appropriate information at an early stage
â the fca said it will consult with consumer groups and financial companies on the proposed changes until june 25 .
