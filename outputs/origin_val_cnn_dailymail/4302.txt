louis van gaal said recently that he does nât have a striker who can score 20 goals a season , but i think if you put wilson up there with rooney then you âd have two players who can reach those figures for you
' wilson made his first - team debut at the end of the 2013 - 14 season under former interim manager ryan giggs but has mainly been on the bench during van gaal 's time at the club
having sat on the bench again for sunday 's 3 - 0 win over tottenham hotspur , wilson was handed some playing time for the under 21s on monday and scored the opening goal in a 2 - 1 victory over everton
