i âm starting to think lallana might actually become a better version of gerrard
he âs certainly got all the qualities that make him the perfect replacement for the liverpool captain
i appreciate that jordan henderson is set to take over as skipper , but in terms of dynamism , energy and quality , lallana looks like the perfect replacement for gerrard the player
have a look at sunday âs victory over man city : lallana started the game as one of two no 10s behind raheem sterling ( rodgers â innovative approach as a coach should not be underestimated )
when lazar markovic went off , lallana went over to the right wing , and then when alberto moreno was substituted , lallana ended the game on the left wing
lallana ( centre ) gave an all - action display as liverpool impressively beat man city lallana chats with liverpool captain gerrard during training on monday he is truly two - footed â for that reason alone english football should treasure him
but he is also clearly capable of playing in different positions , and he can adapt midway through a game
those qualities are not readily available in most players and it takes me back to the champions league final of 2005 when gerrard ended up at right back
the very best not only play different positions , they excel in those positions as well
lallana still has to prove he can do it , as gerrard did , in a major final , but he proved it in a massive game on sunday
a simple five - minute chat about lallana with rodgers will have him purring
the liverpool manager will be using words and phrases like ' balance ' , ' clever ' , ' worker ' , ' technical ability ' , ' awareness ' , ' great character ' , ' looks after the ball '
bring up the subject of lallana and you could be there all day with rodgers
on sunday all the talk was of philippe coutinho , and understandably so
the brilliance of his goals alone in recent weeks makes him the hot topic and it âs great to see him add consistency to the undoubted quality
but lallana âs contribution should not go unnoticed
philippe coutinho ( 2nd right ) curled home liverpool 's winner late on in the premier league clash at anfield vice-captain jordan henderson ( right , front ) also scored a screamer for the reds on sunday one thing you might not know about lallana is that in rodgers â words , he is ' no shrinking violet '
he has bags of personality and character off the pitch as well as on it , and good leadership qualities â let âs not forget he was captain of southampton as they returned to re-establish themselves in the premier league
for liverpool âs system he is perfect
he has quality on the ball â did you see his cruyff turn in the centre circle against man city ? breathtaking stuff â he creates â he scores ( probably could score more ) â and he presses the ball
he was injured pre-season , so it was a slow start to his liverpool career and some supporters were too quick to judge
rodgers knew that opponents â approach to liverpool would be different this season , he knew he would need players to be clever on the ball , and lallana has that football intelligence
lallana - who played three positions against man city - shows his defensive qualities challenging sergio aguero he does nât get talked about too much , does he ? is that because he âs english ? probably
but rodgers told me this about lallana : ' he âs technically as good as any european player '
some might disagree , but it rams home the point that we do nât value his qualities highly enough in this country
in the feverish pace of the premier league , lallana still makes time for himself on the ball , and has that football intelligence and ability to make an impact on a game
yet somehow , if he is only on the bench for england later this month it wo nât be a surprise
and that âs a shame in my opinion
gerrard âs departure will still hurt liverpool fans , but i expect lallana to grow even more when the legend leaves
he âs one of the most underrated footballers in the premier league
lallana slides in to have an effort on the man city goal that went narrowly wide of the target
