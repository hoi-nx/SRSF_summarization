the saying ' always the bridesmaid , never the bride ' has certainly not rung true for one 35 - year - old mother - of - two
lynsey littlefield has been a bridesmaid an astonishing seven times - and tied the knot herself in 2007
the in - demand bridesmaid from brighton , east sussex , has been part of a wedding party so often she has joked about advertising her services as a ' bridesmaid for hire '
the start : lynsey littlefield pictured the first time she was a bridesmaid in 2000 at her brother 's wedding but helping so many friends and family plan their hen parties and wedding days has come at a cost - she 's spent a total of Â£ 7,000 attending other people 's weddings over the past 14 years , an average of around Â£ 400 a year
each time she 's walked with a friend or relative down the aisle she 's been at a different stage in her own love life
she 's been a 20 - something single bridesmaid , an engaged bridesmaid , a married bridesmaid , and a pregnant bridesmaid over the years
lynsey littlefield , who married daniel , 40 , in ibiza in 2007 , said all her experiences have made her one of the best bridesmaids to have
speaking to celebrate national bridesmaids ' day today , lynsey littlefield said : ' i feel that as a bridesmaid you definitely evolve and become better at it
now i am thinking i might hire my services out
' each time i help organise the hen party from an 80s ' - themed hen do to a strictly come dancing party
2005 was a busy year : lynsey littlefield was a bridesmaid at her sister 's wedding , left , and for close friend , nicky , right ' the average cost of each hen party i have organised is Â£ 290 â for food , entertainment and extras
' i worked out i had spent around Â£ 5,080 over the years attending hen parties â not including my own
' then there is the cost of the weddings
for each one i spend about Â£ 50 on the present , Â£ 70 on an outfit , Â£ 150 on travel and accommodation and if there is a paying bar an extra Â£ 50
i would say i spend around Â£ 200 per wedding
' but i do n't mind
i have to budget but i love watching people get married
' lynsey littlefield was first asked to be bridesmaid in 2000 when she celebrated her brother gary 's marriage to isabel

lynsey littlefield was pregnant in 2009 when she was a bridesmaid for her friend helen ' i was overjoyed when she announced her engagement and then asked me to be her bridesmaid
' both my sister and nicky had a hen weekend abroad and then in the uk â so there was a lot of planning on my part
' she had her own wedding in 2007 - with two bridesmaids
she was then a bridesmaid for friend kate , who was a mother - of - two in 2008 when she married jon
' kate and jon had two boys so the morning of the wedding was very different to my past bridesmaid experiences â it involved helping kate but also entertaining two lads , ' lynsey littlefield said
her friend helen 's wedding followed in 2009 when lynsey littlefield was pregnant
she said : ' in 2009 my best friend helen announced she would be getting married
i was overjoyed but also slightly worried as i was pregnant

i felt like i ran down the aisle and cried loads
but it was nice to be sober at a wedding
' ' then in 2010 my oldest friend hannah asked me to be her bridesmaid
i had n't long given birth so was n't feeling in the best shape
' i was a new mum so also adapting to motherhood
' nevertheless i took my role very seriously and attended dress shopping visits , there were quite a lot , and also organised a great hen weekend
' i was a really calm bridesmaid this time
