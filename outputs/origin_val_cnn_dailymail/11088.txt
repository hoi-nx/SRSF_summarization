kimmel said in an post-crash interview with popular speed 's weaver ' unfortunately for us the throttle hung , something we always check for , so it was just a freak accident
' kimmel told weaver ' i wish they would have [ outside ] walls here
personally , just so i would have had to put a clip on it instead of junking a race car that i only had 12 laps on
' because there are no outside walls around the slightly banked track , there was nothing to stop kimmel 's car as it drove off the half - mile track peril : kimmel 's car rolled at least once before finding the parking lot on the edge : kimmel 's car teetered on its side during the crash , as evidenced in this close - up still taken from footage of the accident health : kimmel has said he was sore from the accident but otherwise alright

i mean , i do n't know who 's not gon na be after that , but i do n't have a headache or anything like that
' drager , the president of arca racing series , told popular speed ' one of the things we do on a regular basis is understand the characteristics of a particular race track because you ca nât apply what works at the illinois state dirt fairgrounds and apply it to daytona or even mobile
' so understanding the nature of a facility with no concrete walls and understanding where the barriers are , we are certainly going to do a review of that
' drager told the website that the organization was happy both the driver safety compartment and kimmel were unharmed
debris : kimmel 's car was left totaled after the race wreckage : the car struck the trailer hitch of a pickup truck before coming to a stop
