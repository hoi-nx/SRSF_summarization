a missouri teenager sparked a massive online campaign to change his school 's strict dress code after he was left in tears when teachers told him to change out of the ' special ' ensemble that he wore on his birthday and questioned whether the effeminate look of the outfit meant he had ' gender issues '
morgan , 17 , was called into the office at lee 's summit north high school on friday morning , after turning up to class wearing ' jeans , a t - shirt and shoes , a shawl , a necklace , jewelry ... and a corset ' and was immediately told to remove the more flamboyant parts of his clothing , before being asked whether he had ' gender identity issues '
the news of the school 's reaction to his birthday outfit sparked fury among his friends and peers , many of whom took to social media to share their outrage at the situation , using the hashtag # clothinghasnogender in order to generate further interest
' morgan is gay but not a lot of people judge him for it ... there are a select few in the school , ' the high school student said
' ... it was his birthday and he had dressed up for his birthday
he wore jeans , a t - shirt and shoes
he also wore a shawl , a necklace , jewelry , he had his nails painted , he had a glove on and a corset
' he also put on make - up
' lizzie continues by stressing that this type of outfit is completely ' normal ' for morgan , and for his friends who know him well
' he was called down to the office and they told him - they asked him actually - if he had gender identity issues
they also said that it was a " distraction to the learning environment for the children " and they told him to take it off and he took it off
' speaking out : morgan 's story quickly turned his # clothinghasnogender campaign into a viral social media sensation
the teenager is pictured here speaking to a local news outlet in his hometown she adds : ' morgan was really upset , he was crying at the end of the day
i 've never seen him so hurt before , and i want to do something about it
the young girl goes on to explain that morgan received an overwhelming amount of support from his classmates , reading out several of the tweets posted by pupils at the school using the hashtag # clothinghasnogender
' i admire what morgan did today , he is such a brave soul and i fully stand behind him , ' one tweet read
another said : ' many students and faculty disagreed and have voiced their opinion that not allowing him to wear things that are allowed by the dress code is unfair and discriminatory
' and it seems that the viral campaign has already managed to make a change
earlier today morgan and his parents , cheri and jason , met with school administrators to discuss the incident and talk about what changes the school would be willing to make to its dress code to avoid any similar incidents from occurring in the future
ready for change : morgan and his parents , cheri and jason , met with teachers at the school ( pictured ) earlier today in order to try and make a positive change to its dress code excited : both cheri and jason ( pictured ) said that they felt very positive about the steps that the school are taking to try and change the situation ' i felt they heard us , we heard them
i 'm really excited about working with them in the future , ' cheri told local news channel kctv5
' the fact that what he was wearing did n't break policy , it was more on the ambiguous side of it 's distracting , ' morgan 's father jason added
the morgan family are now working on drafting up a new dress code policy in the hopes that the school 's administrators can get it approved by the school board
' i say just continue to be yourself , ' morgan said to kctv5 after meeting with the school
' it 's very important as long as you feel you are following the school policy , they can not take that away from you
' and whatever makes you feel comfortable is what everyone else needs to realize
