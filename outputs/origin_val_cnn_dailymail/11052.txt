controversial radio presenter laws has revealed he was abused by a paedophile in a public toilet when he was a child
laws , who recently came under fire for his tough on - air interview with a sex abuse victim , reducing the caller to tears , has admitted he was attacked in a public toilet in sydney when he was 10 or 11 years old
' i was a child
it was in a public lavatory at mosman oval
i did nât know the person
i ran , ' he told the australian
' i made it very clear that i did nât appreciate it
i would have shouted and yelled
laws criticised brian for not fighting the attacker off and called him a ' wet blanket '
but the radio veteran has defended his comments and said he did not think he had treated brian insensitively
the interview earlier this month stirred an outrage among listeners , with some calling for his resignation over the comments
but laws rebuked claims he had no sympathy for those who had been abused and said his reaction to brian 's story stemmed from how he had handled his own experience
brian called laws during his morning radio show on 2sm earlier this month and told him about his sexual abuse he said his attacker was someone he did not know and he was left disturbed by the abuse , adding he would have made it ' very clear ' he did not appreciate it by shouting and yelling
the broadcaster said his advice to brian would have been how he would have reacted in the same situation , describing it as ' tough love '
when contacted by daily mail australia , laws did not wish to comment further on the matter
the shock jock called the elderly man a ' wet blanket ' and suggested he should ' go to the pub and have a lemonade ' in a 10 - minute call , brian told laws about how he had been sexually abused on several occasions from the age of 11 to 14 live on sydney radio station 2sm
laws quipped and chuckled it ' took a little while for you to get around to talk about it '
brian then told laws he had in fact reported two instances to the police but he was told to ' go away and forget about it
no one would do anything about it '
it was at this stage , laws added insult to injury as he told brian that he should have fought the man off , as he himself had done when men had ' had a go ' at him when he was younger
' did you scream in fright ? did you yell out ' stop that you bastard ' ? did you lash out with your fists ? did you hit him ? ' laws asked
the call outraged people on social media who called for the radio presenter 's sacking after the call a meek sounding brian responded ' no , no probably not
' ' i do n't quite understand why you did n't lash out , you would have been a fairly big boy by that time
did n't you kick or yell or scream or hit ? ' laws continued to press the issue and said he should have told his family or his boss , who it turns out was responsible for several of the assaults
brian began to become audibly distressed at this stage when he explained he had no family support
. there was no such thing as ... family love , ' brian said
he explained that his abuse was a contributing factor to why he had no girlfriend , no romantic interests and very little human contact
laws then tried to salvage the conversation saying he should have felt better after speaking to him and getting it off his chest
brian responded he was ' sad more than anything '
laws then shockingly claimed the interview was a waste of ' both of their time
' former hey dad star sarah monahan wants brian to know that he is not alone and people do care brian continued to open up about his years spent in isolation after the attacks , trying to minimise human contact when laws thought it prudent to offer brian some more sound advice
' have you ever stopped and asked yourself , why do n't people like me ? but this is not the first time , laws has been met with controversy
in 2013 , he referred to women who dressed provocatively as ' rape bait ' ' you 're not the happiest soul , i do n't know that you 'd make people who are around you feel all that good
have you tried to brighten up a little ? difficult i know
' do you hear me ? but you 're not taking any notice
' you 've got to be responsible for your own activity
you must make the move , go and talk to somebody about it
' but do n't be down all the time , do n't be a wet blanket all the time
try and have a laugh
' go to the pub and have a lemonade for god 's sake
he was met with silence
' no ? well there 's not a lot more i can do , is there ? ' to wrap up the uncomfortable ten minute conversation laws asked brian to thank him for his time
' brian , could you say thank you ? ' the interview draws shocking parallels to a conversation laws had with a female caller in 2013 who had also experienced sexual abuse
laws blamed the victim and claimed that women who dressed provocatively were ' rape bait '
twitter has erupted in support for brian as listeners call for the so - called radio magnate to be sacked
sarah monahan , the former co-star of hey dad ! who was among actor robert hughes â child sex abuse victims , chimed into show support for brian and said she hopes he can see that there are people out there who do care
she added laws needs ' genuine help ' after listening to the insensitive call .
