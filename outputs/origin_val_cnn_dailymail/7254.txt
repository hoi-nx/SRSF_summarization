mackay signed troy deeney for watford so he knows exactly what the powerhouse striker can do
on tuesday night , he scored twice against mackay âs wigan for the second time this season to send watford top of the championship and a step nearer the premier league

â we âve got eight games to go and we âve got to win more than a couple of teams us , simple as that , â said mackay
â we knew that troy deeney would pose a real threat
that âs why i bought him ( for watford ) in the first place
he âs blossomed and he âs by far and away the best centre - forward in the division in my opinion
â despite the poor home form , wigan had won their last four away games to give themselves a chance of survival and they had several chances to take the lead
tommy hoban had to throw his body in the way of leon clarke âs goalbound effort , sheyi ojo blasted over when unmarked in a good position and marc-antoine fortune had two opportunities
troy deeney beats the challenge of wigan 's gaetan bong to score his side 's opening goal at the dw stadium boyce fells watford 's forestieri in the box to give away a penalty on a bad night for the hosts but the promotion chasers went ahead in the 54th minute with a goal that was the product of classy build - up play and a brutal finish
substitute forestieri âs clever pass gave guedioura the opportunity to swing a cross to the far post where troy deeney was charging in like an express train
the watford skipper powered through jason pearce to meet the ball and head the ball emphatically past al habsi
guedioura and matej vydra both went close with shots after that , and guedioura thought he had doubled watford âs lead when his deflected effort beat al habsi but boyce hooked the ball away to safety from under his own crossbar

watford boss slavisa jokanovic : â troy âs in a good moment and that âs good news for us
his first goal , the way he attacked the ball and scored , was great
â you have to be happy with our situation
the players believe in themselves and in their teammates
