lawsuit : the family of 13 - year - old mcmath are suing the hospital where she went brain dead after a routine surgery in december 2013 the family of a 13 - year - old girl who was declared brain - dead after her sleep apnea operation went awry filed a medical malpractice lawsuit on tuesday detailing the emotional , chaotic hospital drama that included a court battle over ending life support
mcmath 's family is seeking unspecified damages from ucsf benioff children 's hospital in oakland in the case filed in alameda county superior court
they claim the hospital botched mcmath 's operation on december 9 , 2013 ; did n't respond properly and promptly to dramatic signs of post-operative distress ; and badgered the family to end life support and donate mcmath 's organs , even though her heart kept beating
mcmath was declared brain - dead on december 12 , 2013 , after three different medical experts agreed the teen showed no brain activity
during a court fight , the hospital kept mcmath on life support long enough for the family to move her to an undisclosed facility in new jersey , which allows families to reject a declaration of brain death on religious grounds and lets patients remain connected to ventilators
she remains at the facility
the hospital declined to comment on the lawsuit
' our hearts go out to the mcmath family , ' hospital spokeswoman melinda krigel said
' it is our policy not to comment on pending litigation
' the lawsuit alleges that the hospital 's first misstep was recommending a ' complex and risky ' operation to cure mcmath 's sleep apnea rather than first trying a safer treatment
then , during the surgery , a doctor noted that mcmath had a condition that could result in post-operative bleeding but failed to notify nurses and others responsible for her care after surgery , the suit states
mcmath 's parents say they were given conflicting advice shortly after surgery when they reported their daughter was coughing up blood

one nurse gave them a suction device to clear blood from mcmath 's mouth , and another nurse told the parents not to suction the blood , according to the lawsuit
nurses and doctors are accused of failing to react quickly enough to the bleeding , which the lawsuit says led to mcmath going into cardiac arrest and suffering brain death
the family alleges that hospital administrators failed to explain what happened to mcmath , and that that dr. david duran , the hospital 's pediatric chief , slammed his fist on a table and said , '' what is it that you do n't understand ? she is dead , dead , dead , dead
