former u.s. rep. jackson will be released from a federal prison on thursday and will serve out the remainder of his term in a washington , dc , halfway house , former u.s. rep. kennedy told the associated press after visiting jackson behind bars
kennedy said he spoke with jackson at the minimum security federal prison camp in montgomery , alabama , where the son of the civil rights leader has been serving a 2 Â½ - year sentence after pleading guilty to illegally spending $ 750,000 in campaign funds on more than 3,000 personal items
the expenditures included fur capes , lavish interior decorations for his home and rock music memorabilia
jackson 's plea deal was arranged just two days after he was re-elected to represent his illinois congressional district
at the time republicans cried foul , noting that they would have had a chance to win hsi seat if news had emerged before election day
the bureau of prisons lists his final release date as sept. 20 , 2015
the disgraced lawmaker 's crime was officially described as wire and mail fraud , catch - all federal criminal categories frequently used as placeholders for financial corruption
his wife , sandra , was also sentenced to a year in prison in connection with the corruption scheme
she pleaded guilty to a single charge of filing a false tax return in an attempt to hide the fraud
court documents showed that sandra , a chicago city councilwoman when she was charged , had spent her husband 's campaign funds on vacations , electronics and furs
she was ordered to pay $ 22,000 in restitution , in addition to the $ 750,000 her husband had to pay back
the us marshals service seized all the items purchased illegally and auctioned everything to repay what they stole
also sold was their richly decorated washington , dc townhouse
the haul included one of the late singer michael jackson 's fedoras and a guitar reportedly signed by both michael jackson and rock star eddie van halen
in an unusual arrangement , a federal judge allowed mrs. jacqueline jackson to avoid reporting to prison until her husband 's release so that their children would not lose both parents at once
she will likely begin serving her sentence in september
