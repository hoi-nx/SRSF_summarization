kris boyd has insisted that even jose mourinho himself would have struggled to change rangers â fortunes if he were in charge at ibrox
after their dismal 1 - 1 draw at home to livingston on saturday , the govan club languish in third position in the championship table â 24 points behind runaway leaders hearts â and face an uphill task if they are to secure promotion via the end - of - season play - offs
however , kris boyd believes that with the club now on its third manager of a farcical season , the time has come for all those on the playing staff to give themselves a brutal reality check â before they end up costing yet another man his job
manager stuart mccall puts rangers , third in the championship , through their paces in training kris boyd said it would not matter if chelsea manager jose mourinho ( pictured ) was in charge at ibrox â we âre now on our third manager and it gets to the stage where you have to ask questions of the players , â said kris boyd , ahead of rangers â league meeting with alloa on tuesday night at ibrox
â it does nât matter if you were to go and bring in jose mourinho â he would still have the same players to deal with
â sometimes it can help when a new manager arrives and is looking at it from a different angle - a fresh eye
but , ultimately , it âs the same players going out on the pitch and if we âre being brutally honest , it âs us who need to get a grip
â we can sit and say we âve got international players in the dressing room but , at the end of the day , we have nât performed and two managers have lost their job because of that , so we need to start winning games of football
â it ca nât be all the manager âs fault
that âs why we need to look ourselves in the mirror and ask if we âve done enough
i can safely say that i do nât feel as if i have
and i âm willing to bet the majority - if not all the players - would say the same thing
kris boyd in action for rangers in their 1 - 1 draw with livingston on saturday â we have a period now until the end of the season where everyone on the playing staff needs to get a grip
you can blame all different aspects - but it âs only excuses
we have nât performed on the pitch and that âs the bottom line
â after admitting recently that his second spell at ibrox had been a failure on a personal level , with only three league goals to his name , kris boyd has certainly not tried to shy away from the grim reality surrounding the club
and he believes that due to their current malaise , the fear factor has now well and truly gone for any team visiting ibrox
he added : â i âve been in the situation myself when you turn up at ibrox or parkhead and you âre already beaten
they might have won 4 - 0 or 5 - 0 the week before and you look around you and think : â oh no â
â but that âs not the case any more
teams are coming with confidence and have seen that we âve been weak
previously , it was only european teams who did nât change their game for rangers - but teams now are nât worrying about us
â livingston came at the weekend and got the ball down and passed it crisply
they might have lost five games previously , but they probably looked at us as being weak and tried to get in our faces
