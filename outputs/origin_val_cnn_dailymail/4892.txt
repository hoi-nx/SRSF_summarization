shamima , amira , both 15 , and kadiza sultana , 16 , can be heard talking to an arabic interpreter about fake syria passports while laden with bags
the girls are said to have first arrived at istanbul airport before heading to the southern city of gaziantep close to the syria border
from there , they reportedly take a taxi to an arranged meeting point where they are greeted by the spy , named by turkish media as rashad
rashad can be heard saying ' come on sisters ... do n't forget anything
you will be there in an hour insh'allah , ' before the girls ' luggage is unloaded from the taxi and the trio are helped into a silver minivan
he speaks both english and arabic in the four minute - long video and his face is visible at several points
rashad then allegedly delivered the girls to isis and returns to turkish , where he is arrested , according to daily sabah
separate footage released by daily sabah appears to show rashad being taken into custody in sanliurfa near the syria border
one report said he was a syria who was working for the canadian intelligence service
another said that he was a dentist
turkish news agency dogan said rashad has been held in solitary confinement in a prison in sanliurfa province since being caught
citing his testimony to police , it said he had identified fighters he helped enter syria to an official at canadian 's embassy in jordan
' i have no intention of spying
my aim is to prevent terrorist activity , ' dogan quoted him as saying
rashad also allegedly told the agency he had accompanied at least 25 foreign fighters so far to gaziantep
he said : ' border commanders within islamic state instructed me where to drop these people
i drove them to gaziantep city centre in a cab and handed them over to others
' i do n't know how and from where they took them to syria

turkish foreign minister cavusoglu yesterday said the suspect worked for the intelligence agency of a country that is part of the u.s. - led coalition fighting isis
but he did not identify the country , saying only that it was not the u.s. or a member of the european union
canada 's office of the minister of public safety and emergency preparedness said : ' we are aware of these reports
' we do not comment on operational matters of national security
' the footage shows the girls walking with another man who is suspected of helping them cross into syria mr cavusoglu , who was interviewed on turkish channel a haber tv , said he had shared the information with his uk counterpart - foreign secretary phillip hammond
uk 's foreign office had no immediate comment and a spokesman for the metropolitan police said he had no information

before they went missing , the girls are believed to have communicated with 20 - year - old aqsa mahmood , a notorious jihadi who left glasgow for syria last year
the former medical student has become the online contact of choice for those wanting to travel to syria and marry a militant fighter
one of the girls , shamima , used her twitter account to try to contact her directly , asking for her to open a private line of communication
friends suspect the girls were in touch with mahmood and islamic state recruiters via their mobile phones in the weeks before christmas

the 15 - year - old student , the first to disappear from bethnal green academy in east london , has not been identified by the authorities
mark rowley , who has overall responsibility for police counter terrorism , said the three girls would not be arrested for terrorist offences if they returned to the uk
' we have no evidence in this case that any of the three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences , ' he said
over the weekend it also emerged that letters from scotland yard to the girls ' families â explaining that the pupils would be part of the inquiry into their friend 's disappearance â had been given to the schoolgirls rather than their parents
metropolitan police commissioner sir bernard hogan-howe admitted that ' with the benefit of hindsight ' officers should have communicated directly with the families
but he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology
however , the families refused to accept any responsibility for the teenagers ' actions when they appeared before a committee of mps earlier this week
instead , they spent spent more than an hour castigating police over what they claimed was a failure to inform of their children 's potential radicalisation
they were led by their lawyer tasnime akunjee , once the representative of a close associate of the woolwich killers , who repeatedly demanded an apology
he accused scotland yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in february and their close friend in december

however , senior figures , led by david cameron , insisted parents must take responsibility and play their part in stopping the spread of militant beliefs
' everyone has a role to play , ' said the prime minister
foreign secretary phillip hammond echoed the comments saying : ' parents have responsibilities , schools and community workers have responsibilities as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators
' at least 22 young women , the vast majority under the age of 20 , are feared to have travelled to syria from the uk over the past 12 months
