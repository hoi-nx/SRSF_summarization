the family of james mcnair , the comedian killed in the new jersey crash that also seriously injured tracy morgan , settled a wrongful death claim with wal-mart for a reported $ 10million sum
denita and jamel , james mcnair 's children , will split the payout awarded for the june 7 accident that saw a wal-mart 18-wheeler hit a limo carrying tracy morgan and his friend
their lawyer zaslow will take a $ 3million cut , according to court papers
he said the $ 10million settlement was a ' truly outstanding result , ' especially because james mcnair 's past income was not large enough for his children to ' project a significant lost - wage claim '
according to dnainfo , james mcnair , who was 62 at the time of his death , worked part - time at the salvation army when he was n't doing stand - up gigs
the settlement was originally announced in january but the sum was undisclosed
wal-mart feared publicizing the large payout would negatively impact the superstore 's business
but the amount was revealed in legal documents filed last month in westchester surrogate 's court
denita , 19 , wrote in an affidavit included in the filing that ' no amount of money could replace ' her father , but that the settlement ' greatly exceeds anything i imagined and i could not be more grateful
' when the settlement was first announced in january , zaslow said wal-mart had ' accepted their responsibility ' in the crash
' they caused extensive damage to this family and more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family , ' he said
' ultimately they did the right thing by the mcnairs
' he added , ' no amount of money can replace what they 've lost , but what they 've got will take care of them and allow them to move forward , and their father would be happy for that
' james mcnair was killed when the limo van he was traveling in was struck by an 18 - wheeler on the new jersey on june 7 zaslow wrote that he was ' able to convince wal-mart ' that the hefty settlement would outweigh potential losses the conglomerate would face with a highly publicizing lawsuit the settlement was originally announced in january but the sum was undisclosed
wal-mart feared publicizing the large payout would negatively impact the superstore 's business the settlement agreed between the james mcnair 's and wal-mart allowed the superstore to admit no liability for the crash
wal-mart spokeswoman buchanan said the company and the family worked closely to reach an agreement and that wal-mart was working toward settlements with others injured in the accident
' we know there is nothing we can do to change what happened to mr. james mcnair , ' buchanan said
' we will continue to work to conclude all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident and we 're committed to doing what 's right
