yemeni 's embattled president has fled the country by sea after houthi rebels advanced on the southern port city where he was taking refuge , captured his defence minister and seized the airport
hadi was initially smuggled out of aden just hours after the shiites rebels ' own tv station declared the capture of nearby strategic airbase and arrested the country 's defence minister
the air base is only 35 miles from aden , where hadi had established a temporary capital since fleeing yemeni 's houthi - controlled capital sanaa last month
u.s. and european troops were also based there while advising the government on how to tackle al-qaida militants in the country
just hours after hadi fled , the rebels who offered a $ 100,000 bounty for his capture carried out a wave of airstrikes targeting the presidential security forces guarding the palace

already , hadi has asked the u.n. to authorize a foreign military intervention in the country
the takeover of aden , the country 's economic hub , would mark the collapse of what is left of hadi 's grip on power
it would also open a new chapter in the houthi-saleh alliance and possibly pave the way for more infighting
aden was tense this morning , with schools , government offices , shops and restaurants largely closed
inside the few remaining opened cafes , men watched news of the assault on television
since the morning , there were conflicting reports on hadi 's whereabouts
witnesses said they saw a convoy of presidential vehicles leaving hadi 's palace on top of a hill overlooking the arabian sea
a second convoy was seen heading to the aden airport , where flights have been halted amid the houthi advance
military officials said militias and military units loyal to hadi had ' fragmented , ' speeding the rebel advance
they said the rebels were fighting hadi 's troops on five different fronts wednesday

they declined to say where that facility was located
all officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media
yemeni 's state tv , now controlled by the houthi , this morning made an offer of nearly $ 100,000 for hadi 's capture
that announcement came after defense minister major general mahmoud al-subaihi and his top aides were arrested in the southern city of lahj - where fighting with houthi forces is ongoing - and were subsequently transferred to sanaa
later , the rebels and saleh 's loyalists carried out three airstrikes targeting the aden palace presidential compound and hadi 's forces positioned there , officials said
no casualties were reported in the strikes , similar to ones carried out last week
speaking this morning , yemeni 's foreign minister yassin told dubai - based al-arabiya tv satellite news network that he officially made a request to the arab league to send a military force to intervene against the houthi

abdel-salam , a spokesman for the houthi , said their forces were not aiming to ' occupy ' the south
' they will be in aden in few hours , ' abdel-salam told the rebels ' satellite al-masirah news channel
earlier , al-masirah reported that the houthi and allied fighters had ' secured ' the al-annad air base , the country 's largest
it claimed the base had been looted by both al-qaida fighters and troops loyal to hadi
the reported houthi takeover of the base came after hours - long clashes between rival forces around the base
the u.s. recently evacuated some 100 soldiers , including special forces commandos , from the base after al-qaida briefly seized a nearby city
the base was crucial in the u.s. drone campaign against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , which washington considers to be the most dangerous offshoot of the terror group
and u.s. and european military advisers there also assisted hadi 's government in its fight against al-qaida 's branch , which holds territory in eastern yemeni and has claimed the attack on the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo in paris

the houthi seized the capital , sanaa , in september and have since been advancing south alongside forces loyal to saleh
yesterday houthi and their allies fired bullets and tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters in the city of taiz , known as the gateway to southern yemeni
six demonstrators were killed and scores more were wounded , officials said
the houthi also battled militias loyal to hadi in the city of al-dhalea adjacent to taiz
al-dhalea , yemeni 's third - largest city , is also the birthplace of its 2011 arab spring - inspired uprising that forced saleh to hand over power to hadi in a deal brokered by the u.n. and gulf countries
