every transfer window , clubs scramble to pick up the best bargains , often leaving fans brimming with excitement over the latest big - money import
but , seven months after last summer 's window swung shut , which of those deals have proved to be the worst value for money ? as we reach the business end of the season , sportsmail takes a look at which summer signings have promised so much but offered so little for their respective clubs
10 - fernando porto to manchester city one of two manchester city entries after a summer which saw manuel pellegrini âs side go backwards
fernando is one - paced , does nât impose himself on games and is a man out of his depth , particularly in the champions league
porto must âve laughed all the way to the bank when losing fernando and eliaqium mangala
any better than javi garcia ? sportsmail âs not so sure
brazilian midfielder fernando has struggled to make an impact at manchester city since his summer move fernando ( right ) looked out of his depth during manchester city 's champions league campaign sanchez plus chelsea duo fabregas and costa have all justified big money moves ... but who is your signing of the season ? 9 - lambert southampton to liverpool who knew that a striker who spent most of his career in the lower divisions probably was nât going to be cut out for life at anfield ? well , quite a few actually
but that did nât stop rodgers taking him from southampton for Â£ 4m last summer
perhaps at that price it was worth taking a punt on lambert but the former bristol rovers frontman has had no tangible effect on the side and been reduced to becoming a glorified lump up front in the final moments if liverpool are chasing a game
lambert 's dream move to liverpool has n't worked out the way he would have hoped lambert celebrates just his second premier league goal for liverpool against aston villa in january 8 - angel di maria real madrid to man united this list is all relative
if you pay Â£ 60m for one of the world âs superstars , there is a reasonable expectation that he wins you a few games ; but good performances of di maria âs can be counted on one hand and he has nât been able to get to grips with english football
louis van gaal has quite rightly persisted with the former real madrid man , although we have witnessed just why carlo ancelotti was nât overly fussed about him leaving the bernabeu
former real madrid star angel di maria ( right ) seems to have lost his way at man united di maria is shown a red card by referee michael oliver during man united 's 2 - 1 fa cup defeat by arsenal 7 - barry free agent to everton the epitome of everything that âs been wrong at everton during roberto martinez âs tricky second season in charge
on paper an excellent signing - particularly for free - but barry âs inability to drive forward from midfield has slowed everton down
they 're not the most patient lot at goodison park and he has been no stranger to the fans â ire
everton midfielder barry ( right ) has endured a tough season at goodison park barry is shown a red card for a late challenge on willian during chelsea 's 1 - 0 victory against everton 6 - mario balotelli ac milan to liverpool it just has nât worked , has it ? mario balotelli âs difficulties at anfield have actually shone quite the light on how well roberto mancini did in charge of the tempestuous striker at manchester city
the Â£ 16m fee sounded a snip at the time , but rodgers has nât been able to get anywhere near what âs required
the italian is a completely different player to that fearsome forward of euro 2012
mario balotelli has struggled for a first - team place after several poor performances for liverpool the italian striker has scored just four goals for liverpool since his summer move from ac milan 5 - mauro zarate velez sarsfield to west ham the prerequisite to any signing is that they âre capable of buying into whatever ethos that club âs manager has
in this case sam allardyce makes his players do a bit of running
mauro zarate does nât do running
he clearly has the ability required to be a success in the division - the argentine was hugely impressive on his debut away at crystal palace - but he does nât appear willing to work on his fitness
just ask queens park rangers , who contemplated sending the forward back to the west ham after landing him on loan in january
mauro zarate has made just 11 premier league appearances for west ham and queens park rangers the argentine forward was hugely impressive on his debut away at crystal palace last august 4 - radamel falcao monaco to man united ( loan ) remember the fuss that was made when man united swooped on deadline day for the colombian ? seems a long time ago now
it is absurd to think that van gaal could even contemplate making the loan move permanent at the end of the season
just four goals for a man heralded as one of the best finishers in the business has meant radamel falcao even got a run out for the under 21 side a few weeks ago
does not justify the astronomical wages man united pay him
colombian striker radamel falcao has endured a terrible season at old trafford , scoring just four goals red devils boss louis van gaal ( right ) looks likely to end radamel falcao 's loan spell at the end of the season 3 - rio ferdinand free agent to queens park rangers another one for the queens park rangers conveyor belt of wasted money
the club âs transfer policy of bringing in â experienced â professionals on high wages was perhaps unfortunate when they suffered relegation from the premier league two years ago , but this time it was downright foolish and has left them in serious financial trouble
even clint hill-he of crouching on his haunches fame - is preferred to rio ferdinand , who has looked anything but match fit and failed the basics
that tells the whole story , and this looks to being a desperately sad way to end a stellar career
rio ferdinand has n't been able to find his feet during a relegation battle with queens park rangers 2 - eliaquim mangala porto to manchester city abysmal
to think manchester city paid Â£ 32m for the central defender beggars belief , and heads will undoubtedly role from a recruitment point of view
has nât been helped by the continuing slide of vincent kompany , but eliaqium mangala is supposed to be a big imposing brute of an enforcer and there can be no excuses for a rank average first season in the premier league
eliaquim mangala ( left ) cost manuel pellegrini 's side Â£ 32million , but has failed to live up to the price rolando aarons beats eliaqium mangala for pace before scoring for newcastle against manchester city in october , 2014 1 - riviere monaco to newcastle he did nât come cheap , costing more than Â£ 5m from monaco , and for what ? poor misses , the inability to shake off markers and a source of constant frustration for supporters who want their team to attack with gumption
seventeen premier league games without a goal means riviere has the dubious honour of becoming sportsmail âs worst signing of the 2014 - 15 season
a special mention must go to siem de jong as well , who ca nât fulfill his duties as a professional footballer by virtue of never - ending injuries
but riviere pips the dutchman for some downright disgusting displays
riviere ( centre ) has been a source of frustration at st james ' park this season riviere 's only two newcastle goals came during the 3 - 2 capital one cup victory against crystal palace
