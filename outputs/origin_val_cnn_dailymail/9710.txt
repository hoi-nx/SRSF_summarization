opening statements in the trial of boston bombing suspect tsarnaev set for wednesday after two months of jury selection , a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates was seated tuesday for the federal death penalty trial of boston marathon bombing suspect tsarnaev
the all - white panel included 10 men and eight women , 12 of whom will vote on tsarnaev 's fate at the end of a trial expected to wrap up in june
six will serve as alternates
opening statements in the case are scheduled for wednesday
tsarnaev , 21 , faces 30 charges in connection with twin bombings at the finish line of the marathon april 15 , 2013
three people were killed and more than 260 were injured
he is also charged in the killing of a massachusetts institute of technology police officer days after the bombings
if the jury convicts tsarnaev , the trial will move on to a second phase to determine his punishment
the only two options available for the jury are life in prison or the death penalty
judge o'toole , prosecutors and tsarnaev 's lawyers questioned prospective jurors individually
many potential jurors were excused when they said they had already formed an opinion on tsarnaev 's guilt or were morally opposed to the death penalty
many others were dismissed because of personal connections to the bombings , including people who have friends or family who were near the finish line when the bombs went off or who knew first responders who treated victims
during the jury selection process , tsarnaev 's lawyers tried repeatedly to get the trial moved out of massachusetts , saying he could not find a fair and impartial jury because of the emotional impact the bombings had in the state
o'toole rejected three change - of - venue motions , saying the process of carefully questioning jurors to detect bias was successful in finding impartial jurors
the 1st u.s. circuit court of appeals twice refused to order the trial moved
the jury selection process began in early january when more than 1,350 potential jurors filled out questionnaires on their ties to the attack and their views on the death penalty
to be eligible to serve , candidates needed not to have formed a set opinion of tsarnaev 's guilt and to be willing to consider voting for execution if he was found guilty
tsarnaev 's lawyers last week asserted that the court had violated its own procedures about random selection , reordering jurors as they arrived in a way that reduced the number of black candidates questioned
tsarnaev 's attorneys on monday offered a possible glimpse into their strategy when they argued that they need to be able to discuss the defendant 's relationship with his older brother , tamerlan , early in the trial
they described 26 - year - old tamerlan , who died following a gun battle with police three days after the bombing , as the driving force behind the attack , saying that his younger brother participated out of submissiveness
