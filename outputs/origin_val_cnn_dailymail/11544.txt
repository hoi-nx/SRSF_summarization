an anonymous poster wrote : ' spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week
he stopped when he saw us laughing
' the post was republished on photo site imgur and quickly picked up more than 2000 comments of support for the mystery man 's moves
a gofundme account â intended to track down sean and offer to fly him to l.a. - is at $ 38,000 and climbing
organizers of that page say any money that does n't go do the dance party will go to an anti-bullying campaign
fairbanks said the original fat - shaming taunts about sean were ' disgusting bullying ' , but she said he is now basking in internet love
' there have been thousands and thousands of messages â it 's just been an outpouring of support and love and kindness
' sean has been been amazing
he says he 's been smiling and laughing all day and reading everybody 's messages
' cassandra fairbanks , 29 , who is originally from boston , massachusetts , says she herself has been ' overwhelmed ' by the flood of attention and is n't sure how many people will attend the party
outraged : the post was later screenshot and posted on imgur , where it attracted the attention of thousands of social media users , including cassandra fairbanks ( above ) , who said she was ' horrified ' by its ' cruel ' nature offer : cheryl burke will help the party atmosphere by tutoring sean in his moves success ! after launching a twitter campaign , the free thought project activist manage to locate sean within hours
above , sean posted a photo of himself holding up a sign reading : ' hi cass & twitter ( as requested ! ) ' formal invite : on thursday night , the hashtag # finddancingman went viral
ms fairbanks 's group even issued a formal , blue - colored invitation to the dance party to sean
part of it read : ' we want to see you dance freely ' it 's him ! at around the same time , ms fairbanks received a photo of a man who looked like the dancing man - and was wearing the same wristband - posing next to the team mascot of london soccer club arsenal ' it 's been a whirlwind , i 'm having trouble keeping up , ' she said
' it 's gone a little bit crazy , there 's a lot of people who want to get involved
' it 's really hard to say how many people are coming because i feel really swamped
' right now i have over 15,000 messages that i have n't been able to respond to
my email inbox is full , on twitter i 've been getting mentions every second from people saying they want to come to the party , so it 's really hard to gauge
' my facebook has also gone insane and people have even been emailing my boss , it 's a little overwhelming
' cassandra fairbanks says the organizers at the los angeles â a sports stadium with a huge 93,000 capacity â reached out to offer the space for sean 's party
and it 's thanks to their ' amazing ' support that things are beginning to come together , she said

' we also went to moby 's house today ( monday ) and met with him , and he 's been really helpful too , there 's a lot of people who have come together and have been beyond kind
' but cassandra fairbanks says it 's still not clear exactly how many people will come to the party
she had originally envisaged a vip ladies only party and expected to invite around 2,000 guests

' another said : ' help me and my 2,000 girlfriends ' star support : both pharrell williams and moby told dancing man not to be ashamed to dance as they posted their support for sean on twitter but the idea has since exploded and the numbers are more likely to hit the tens of thousands with both men and women now allowed
' this thing has grown beyond our simple gesture into something global and there 's just so many people who are touched and moved that i do n't want to exclude anyone , ' cassandra fairbanks said
' especially as there is so many people who have reached out expressing their interest in coming to dance
' despite the outpouring of support , cassandra fairbanks fears some people contacting her are wanting to get involved for the ' wrong reasons '
' i just wanted to make somebody smile , i did n't think it would turn in to this whole production , ' she said
' but it 's beautiful that it 's happening , i am so thankful to everybody and i 'm so thankful that people around the world are reaching out
' fairbanks said she spoke to sean yesterday and said he 's ' so thankful ' for the support
