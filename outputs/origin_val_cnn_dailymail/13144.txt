idaho wildlife officials have retrieved 2,000 dead snow geese that fell from the sky this week
the birds , whose carcasses were collected over the weekend , appear to have died of avian cholera , the idaho department of fish and game said tuesday
" the migratory birds were on the return leg of their migration from the southwestern u.s. and mexico to their breeding grounds on the northern coast of alaska , " said schmidt , a regional supervisor
they died near dubois , terreton and roberts -- all in the eastern part of the state
it 's unclear where the geese picked the bacteria from , but authorities are scrambling to ensure that other birds do n't feed on the carcasses and spread the disease
" the important thing is to quickly collect as many of the carcasses as possible , to prevent other birds from feeding on the infected birds , " schmidt said
" biologists observed about 20 eagles in the vicinity of some of the carcasses
because of a delayed incubation period it is uncertain where these eagles might be located , if and when the avian cholera affects them
" though the official lab results are not out , officials said the cause of death points to avian cholera
humans are not considered at high risk of getting the disease , according to u.s. health officials .
