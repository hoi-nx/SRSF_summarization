but when i had two young children i was tired all the time
i had pain in my knees often and just wanted to change things really
' i would have tried to avoid walking long distances or climbing stairs when i weighed my heaviest
it was difficult to play with the kids at times
people used to laugh at me and snigger and make comments about my size in public
it was nât nice and knocked my confidence
' there was one incident where somebody took a picture of me , laughing at me when we were out
it was n't even discreet
i did not feel comfortable eating in public because people looked at me and assumed i was always eating because of my size
' after joining weight watchers , she soon replaced a diet of takeaway pizzas and curry with healthier fruit and vegetable options
janine furr said she had severe confidence and health issues after piling on the pounds during her teens janine furr added : ' i lost weight gradually but each week i could see the scales going in the right direction and as the plan is so flexible , i could fit it around my life
i did nât want it to happen overnight as i knew i had to lose the weight in a healthy and sustainable way
' i love walking and swimming and i have more confidence
my life has transformed and i feel completely different
i can now run around after my three children and i âve introduced healthy food into our family meals too
' i âm now a bit of a clothes addict
it âs great not having to feel limited to the plus - size brands
