she 's a great - grandmother and 102 years old but that does n't stop margaret working out five days a week
incredibly the sydney woman was never keen on exercise in her youth - the only thing she did to keep fit was walking - but that all changed when she reached her 90s and broke her pelvis
now margaret enjoys the gym and exercise classes with her friends at the thomas holt sans souci gardens aged care facility , in sydney
margaret , 102 , could very well be australia 's fittest great grandmother after she completed 102 squats on her birthday this year she 's a great - grandmother but that does n't stop margaret working out five days a week incredibly margaret was never keen on exercise in her youth - the only thing she did to keep fit was walking - but that all changed when she reached her 90s and broke her pelvis and while some may like to take it easy on their birthday , margaret decided to complete her most impressive feat yet in celebration of her special day earlier this year
â last year my physio john said i 'm going to get you to do 102 squats for your birthday , i said ' you have to be joking ' , â margaret told the daily mail australia
â i 've never really exercised
when i was young i did the girl guides and all the activities that came with that , â she added
â but later it was mainly walking ; my eldest girl was about 15 or 16 before we had a car so we used to walk to the train station when we wanted to go somewhere
â physio john abd-mariam has been working with margaret , a mother of four daughters , for a number of years , and when they first met the 102 - year - old was not nearly as fit as she is now
one of her four daughters suzanne said her mother was never really into exercise when she was younger but she did enjoy riding horses in her leisure time - pictured here on horseback with her husband colin margaret initially took a bit of persuading to start exercising but once she started she did n't look back â initially we worked on basic standing balance exercises
she could manage about two minutes before fatiguing , â john told daily mail australia
a few years earlier margaret had broken her pelvis in three places , at the age of 93 , and needed to be rehabilitated after that
â through her regular attendance at the classes ( over 12 months ) , and her willingness to be encouraged to improve , she managed to increase to over 10 minutes of continuous standing exercises , â john continued
her daughter , suzane , said the improvement in her mother in recent years has been phenomenal her transformation is incredible as margaret had broken her pelvis in three places when she was 93 and needed rehabilitation from there john continued to encourage margaret to keep getting better
and in january 31 this year she completed over 102 squats â and all in the name of charity
â it was in late december last year that i initially suggested to margaret that she should do one squat for every year of her life ' , â john said
â i tried persuading margaret over several days , initially to no avail , however as margaret has such a lovely and selfless spirit i suggested that she could use the opportunity to raise money for a charity
â ( this was ) an idea which margaret jumped at , and with that motivating drive we are where we are today
' â at first i was going to do it for the children in the third world countries , â margaret revealed
â then i thought i 've been in the wildlife society ( of australia ) for about 15 years and i thought well â¦ i âll do it for them â
one of her four daughters suzanne said although her mother was never really into exercise , the improvement she has seen in her in recent years has been phenomenal
' one of the biggest differences we 've noticed is the emotional difference , ' suzanne told daily mail australia
' mum has a lot more of a positive outlook , she has always been positive ... ( but ) there 's definitely a difference in her contentment
the 102 - year - old has always loved being outdoors - especially with horses margaret 's fitness involves some singing , balance activities , weights , and a little bit of cardio ' she 's still very well mentally , she is very interested in politics and current affairs
' a few months on margaret now has some tough competition as her friend pauline sciberras , who is nearly 92 , has also joined in exercising with her , and is getting very good at her squats
â pauline sciberras , enid and i come up here straight after breakfast i do the pedals while we sing amazing grace , all things bright and beautiful , and onward , christian soldiers , â margaret said
â pauline sciberras has just lately started doing the squats , she can do about 100 but she does them quicker than me
she does about two or three to my one , but i go all the way down
' the exercise is making a big difference for margaret not only physically but also mentally who turned 102 on january 31 margaret was given a silver medal from the president of ireland , her home country , on her birthday the gym and exercise classes at the thomas holt sans souci gardens aged care facility where margaret lives have proved very popular â i love it ! ' pauline sciberras told the daily mail australia with great enthusiasm
â i would n't stay without it
â the women also revealed that since john has been running classes for the residents , which involve some singing , balance activities , weights , and a little bit of cardio , more and more people have been joining in
â sometimes we have six , sometimes we have nine
one time we even had ten people come , â margaret revealed
to this day margaret has raised over $ 5,000 for charity , which was donated to the marine sea turtle project in cairns , far north queensland
in margaret 's honour one of the sea turtles recently rescued in the area - believed to be over 80 years old - was named after her
she also received letters from the prime minister tony abbott , the governor general sir peter cosgrove and a silver medal from the president of ireland , her home country , on her birthday
as for what she might do for her 103rd birthday , margaret is n't sure
but john hinted that he might have something up his sleeve to help her celebrate the next milestone
