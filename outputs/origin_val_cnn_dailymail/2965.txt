a southwest airlines passenger boarded a plane only to receive an email telling him that his trip had been cancelled
bob woudstra paid $ 616 ( around Â£ 410 ) for a round trip from grand rapids to fort myers , in florida
on the day of his flight , the michigan businessman was dropped off at the airport , made it through security and successfully boarded the plane
a michigan man was told his flight was cancelled two hours after take off as the airline had no record of him but two hours into his flight , mr bob woudstra received an e-mail from the u.s carrier , notifying him of its no show policy
the airline told him that he was n't on the plane , so they cancelled his flight mr bob woudstra said , explaining that he had to buy a new return ticket for $ 456 ( around Â£ 304 )
he told mailonline travel : ' i think southwest airlines needs to prove to me i was n't on the plane , cause i have plenty of witnesses that dropped me off in grand rapids and picked me up at fort myers
' after returning home , he called the airline to demand a refund , but was told he 'd need to prove that he was onboard that flight
southwest airlines say there could have been an error at the gate , which caused the misunderstanding ' i ca n't believe that with security supposing to be so tight that i could fly on a plane and southwest airlines does n't even know i was on their plane
' southwest airlines does n't acknowledge that i was on the plane , they are just giving me , per southwest airlines " the benefit of the doubt "
' so that tells me they think i am lying , and gary the guy i was traveling with must not have been there either , even though his ticket shows up
' for all the harassment that this has caused southwest airlines needs to step up
' i think southwest airlines needs to prove to me i was n't on the plane , because i have plenty of witnesses that dropped me off in grand rapids and picked me up at fort myers
' southwest airlines is investigating the incident
a spokesperson said : ' although we still have n't determined exactly where an error occurred , we will make an exception to the no show policy and refund the price of the second ticket
' they went on to say that they are often contacted by passengers who have missed their flight and want a refund , but on this case the error may have been at the gate
mr bob woudstra is hoping for a full refund on both the tickets he bought .
