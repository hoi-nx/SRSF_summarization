cameron kicked off the tory election campaign yesterday with an intensely personal attack on ed and his â hopeless , sneering socialists â
the prime minister made a direct assault on the labour leader âs background , calling it the â same old condescending , bossy , interfering , we - know - best attitude of the hampstead socialist down the ages â
mr cameron âs withering reference to the north london borough associated with â champagne socialists â comes after mr ed was ridiculed last year for claiming in his party conference speech to have met ordinary voters on hampstead heath , a short walk from his Â£ 2.6million home
he told supporters at his party âs spring forum in manchester that the tory were â the real party of aspiration , of working people â the party that is with you , not against you is not that bunch of hypocritical , holier - than - thou , hopeless , sneering socialists â
he defended his approach , declaring : â some might say , â do nât make this personal , â but when it comes to who âs prime minister , the personal is national
â withering : prime minister claimed ' i know what this role needs â and i do nât think ed has it ' he added : â i know what this role needs â and frankly , i do nât think ed has it â , warning voters mr miliband would â be the one taking the make - or - break calls in the middle of the night â
speaking at the itv studios where coronation street was filmed , mr cameron also compared mr ed unfavourably to his predecessors , saying labour was â not the party of clement attlee , who built the nhs ... not the party of wilson and his â white heat of technology â ... not even the party of john smith , who believed so passionately in the dignity of work
â instead , he said , they â were the party whose new jerusalem is a load of dead - end lives and poverty handed down through the generations â
chancellor osborne also mocked mr ed , who , when asked last week by jeremy paxman whether he was tough enough to be pm , replied , â hell , yes
â osborne painted a picture of life under a government , describing it as : â hell â yes , indeed
â mr cameron also used the speech to promise that a future tory government would turn the nhs into a true seven - day service , with more hospitals providing top - level treatment at the weekend .
