wild cats could be introduced into the uk countryside for the first time in 1,300 years , it emerged yesterday
experts want to release lynx , which prey mainly on deer , into woodland in norfolk , cumbria and aberdeenshire as part of an ambitious â rewilding â scheme
although the animals would be introduced onto privately owned estates , the woodland would be unfenced , meaning the 70lb animals could roam free around the countryside
lynx could be introduced into the uk countryside for the first time in 1,300 years , it emerged yesterday scientists argue that introducing lynx will benefit the ecosystem , by helping control the 1million uk deer population , as well as boosting the tourist economy
but the move is controversial and likely to be opposed by farmers worried about the animals savaging their livestock and game birds
under the plan , devised by the lynx trust , four to six cats would be released at each site
around the size of a large dog and with powerful claws for climbing , they will be released into areas rich in deer and trees and each will wear a tracking device so their movements can be monitored
experts want to release lynx , which prey mainly on deer , into woodland in norfolk , cumbria and aberdeenshire as part of a â rewilding â scheme the lynx trust said it would be launching a public consultation this week , before applying to the government via natural england and snh ( snh ) for formal permission
paul oâdonoghue , a science adviser to the lynx trust , said : â the lynx is a magical animal that last roamed britain [ at least ] 1,300 years ago
â it is one of the most beautiful cats on the planet and its absence makes britain a poorer place
â but a spokesman for the national farmers â union said money could be better spent elsewhere
â we would be concerned about the reintroduction due to its high cost and failure risk , â he said
â we believe budgets are better focused on developing existing biodiversity
â while ron macdonald , policy director of snh , who would have to licence the reintroduction , said they also had concerns
â there are pluses and minuses to reintroducing any species , â he said
â lynx could help reduce deer numbers in scotland woodlands but some land - use organisations have concerns about the impact of a reintroduction on livestock
