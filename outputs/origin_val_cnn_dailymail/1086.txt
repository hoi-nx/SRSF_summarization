labour mp danczuk has confessed to watching pornography but insisted voters want politicians who ' live in the real world '
the husband of selfie - loving wife karen was spotted favouriting hard - core porn on twitter - but blamed it on a fault with his iphone
however , the 48 - year - old was unembarrassed about the gaffe
he stressed he does not use porn regularly , but insisted : ' i am a man of the world and it is part of life , many people do
' and wife wife karen urged people to watch porn , claiming it is ' healthy '
mr danczuk explained that he accidentally favourited a tweet linked to an account described as ' an 18 + erotic account for posting sexy pictures of sexy women '
the rochdale mp does not follow the account , which features dozens of pornographic pictures of women
giving a convoluted explanation for the gaffe , he told radio station key 2 in manchester : â this is genuinely true
it âs what you might call a technological accident
' i had put my iphone on charge using one of those uncertified chargers
i went on to twitter while it was plugged in
' and when i went on twitter it started jumping about
it started doing predictive text and moving around the screen everywhere
' before i knew it , and unbeknown to me , i had favorited a tweet which related to this porn site image
' he insisted that politicians should not be berated for viewing porn
' let âs be truthful about this
if i am being asked have i ever used porn , then the answer is yes
' i am a man of the world
i would nât deny that sort of thing
i think we should not be too sanctimonious about this
' i think there is far too much of that in politics and i think do nât put politicians on a pedestal
let âs just have real conversations about real issues
' the reality is politicians are under scrutiny and many others have been caught out on this
' mp 's wife wife karen took to twitter to urge people to watch porn , insisting it is ' healthy ' he pointed out that one of david cameron 's official accounts was found to be following a ' high class escort agency ' on twitter while fellow labour mp jack dromey like a tweet from ' some gay porn site '
it âs something that easily happens
we are under a lot of scrutiny , ' mr danczuk said
asked if he watches porn regularly , he replied : â not regularly but the point i am making is i am not going to come on this show and say i have nât
' i am a man of the world and it is part of life , many people do
let âs not be sanctimonious about it
wife karen , who has made a name for herself posting photos of her cleavage online , tweeted yesterday : ' anyone seriously offended by a bit of porn favouriting ? ? come on , if you 're not watching it yourself you really need to
' mr danczuk added : ' i have had a real laugh about it
it is not really a massive policy political issue is it ? i think the public get that
they want politicians who do live in the real world
' the mp , who has campaigned against child sexual exploitation , hit the headlines last week when he said in an interview in the new statesman that miliband was considered more of a ' toff ' by voters than david cameron
a constituent in rochdale flagged up the blunder by tweeting the mp , pictured above the interview was brought up by jeremy paxman during thursday 's live tv debate with mr miliband and david cameron
mr danczuk also clashed with controversial columnist hopkins on twitter over race relations
hopkins has criticised him for posting a picture of himself in rochdale next to a pakistani flag
she linked it to the child sex grooming scandal in the town , which led to jailing of a gang of asian men for 77 years in 2012
but mr danczuk accused her of spreading ' vitriol ' and of ' racist generalisation '
mrs dancuk , known as the queen of the selfies , is a former rochdale councillor who announced she was stepping down earlier this year to pursue other career opportunities , including media work
she became known for posting a series of racy images of herself on twitter and revealed in february she had been sexually abused as a child .
