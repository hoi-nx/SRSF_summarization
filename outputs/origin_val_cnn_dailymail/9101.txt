once again , the championship is proving to be the league with the most exciting promotion battle in europe and the stakes have never been higher
with just 10 games left , one point divides a top five of bournemouth , derby , watford , middlesbrough and norwich city , with brentford and ipswich only a result or two behind them
and with Â£ 150million awaiting those who reach the premier league , as well as a share of the new Â£ 5billion tv deal coming the following season , the difference between success and failure has never been greater
it âs going to be a case of who holds their nerve best , starting tomorrow as middlesbrough take on ipswich and norwich city face derby
