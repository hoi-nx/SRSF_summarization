millions more pensioners will be able to cash in their retirement deals under reforms to be announced this week
george osborne will use this week 's budget to grant the option to five million uk retirees stuck on rip - off annuity rates
attempting to woo the ' grey vote ' , he will extend to them the same freedoms that have already been offered to those approaching retirement
but the chancellor said it was ' patronising ' to suggest that allowing oaps to use retirement funds as bank accounts would see many blowing the money on expensive holidays or fast cars
he said yesterday : ' i just think that is a very patronising attitude to take towards people who have shown responsibility , saved through their lives , saved for a pension
by changing the law we are trusting people who have worked hard and saved hard all their lives
' mr george osborne 's policy will give those who have already taken out an annuity the right to cash it in for a lump sum from april next year
a crackdown on those who illegally dump waste , from discarded sofas to vast piles of rubble , is expected to be announced in the budget
the environment agency will get an extra Â£ 4.2million to pursue the perpetrators of â waste crime â and those who dodge landfill taxes , as well as cleaning up the damage caused
after being given Â£ 5million in last year âs budget the agency estimated it raised Â£ 16million of revenue
in one case , it tracked 6,000 tons of waste illegally accepted at a waste site at which those involved were seeking to evade Â£ 500,000 of landfill tax
with just weeks to go until the election , it is one of the flagship measures in a pre-election budget that mr george osborne yesterday said would feature ' no giveaways , no gimmicks '
other expected announcements include : - another rise in the income tax threshold to around Â£ 11,000
- a review of hated business taxes to boost small firms and high streets
- measures to create a so - called northern powerhouse , with high - speed links between liverpool and manchester
- fast - tracking the building of 45,000 new homes at 28 ' housing zones '
- a populist 2p cut in beer duty and another freeze in fuel duty
- a crackdown on tax avoidance , including a ' google tax ' on multinational firms that try to avoid paying dues in the uk
- a pre-pay travel card based on london 's oyster scheme to boost travel between major northern cities
the planned annuity reforms will give pensioners the same opportunity to access retirement funds as mr george osborne announced last year for those who had not already taken their pensions
annuities have become increasingly controversial amid plunging rates and poor - value products
removing restrictions will allow pensioners to either take the cash as a lump sum or place it in a so - called ' drawdown ' product to use the proceeds more gradually
mr george osborne 's policy will give those who have already taken out an annuity the right to cash it in for a lump sum from april next year mr george osborne will scrap punitive tax charges of up to 70 per cent for pensioners who want to sell their annuity income so they are taxed only at their marginal rate
the chancellor , appearing on the bbc 's andrew marr show with shadow chancellor ed balls , said : ' it 's all part of trusting people who have worked hard and saved hard all their lives
' he promised ' a budget for the long - term ' , saying the government has to continue ' making difficult decisions '
liberal dem pensions minister steve webb , who proposed the measure , said : ' as a liberal i believe that today 's pensioners should have the same freedoms as tomorrow 's pensioners to spend their hard earned savings as they wish
' huw evans , of the association of british insurers , warned of ' considerable complexities ' over the tax implications of cashing in annuities
andrew tully , of pensions firm mgm advantage , said the idea is ' full of pitfalls ' , and pensioners who were sold a poor - value annuity may be offered a poor - value cash lump sum
' two wrongs do not make a right , ' he said
mr george osborne promised ' a budget for the long - term ' , saying the government has to continue ' making difficult decisions ' richard lloyd , of consumer group which ? , said : ' pensioners who 've been ripped off in the past must be properly protected from a second rip - off if they decide to sell it
' joanne segars , of the national association of pension funds , also expressed concerns , saying : ' it 's clear to see how this fits with this government 's agenda for pensions but what is less clear is how savers will be protected
' steven cameron , of life insurance firm aegon , added : ' anyone turning future annuity income into cash is giving up a guaranteed flow of income â for their and possibly a partner 's future life
swapping this for a lump sum , calculated based on a range of factors , is undoubtedly a complex and risky decision and specialist advice would be essential
' the financial conduct authority said it would be in charge of introducing protections for consumers who sold their annuities
the watchdog is already overseeing the pension freedoms that have already been granted .
