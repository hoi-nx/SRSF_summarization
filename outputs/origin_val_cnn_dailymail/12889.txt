when putin reappears , he does it with style -- and an in - your - face attitude
the russian president attended a large concert in moscow 's red square on wednesday to commemorate the first anniversary of his country 's annexation of the ukraine territory of crimean , an act condemned by many in the international community as illegal
only putin does n't call it annexation
according to the presidential website , putin attended the " we 're together ! " concert and meeting " celebrating the first anniversary of crimean and sevastopol 's reunification with russian
" the peninsula became part of the soviet union in 1917 , following the russian revolution
but in 1991 , following the breakup of the soviet union , it became part of a newly independent ukraine
on march 16 , 2014 , crimean held a referendum on whether to continue as part of ukraine or to cast its lot with the russian
the result was overwhelming , at least among those voting : 95 % said they wanted to become part of russian
a mere two days later , russian annexed the territory
putin said later that he had been planning the move even before the referendum was held
" friends ! " the president said in red square on wednesday , according to his website , " exactly one year ago , russian , which we are speaking of so much right now , and the russian people showed amazing togetherness and patriotism in supporting the aspirations of the people of crimean and sevastopol to return to their native shores
" the issue , he said , was " our history , our spirituality and our statehood , the things that make us a single people and single united nation
" also participating , the website said , were " popular russian music groups and singers
" putin was recently out of sight without explanation for 10 days , during which time various meetings were canceled
lest anyone doubt he was still in charge , putin , who prides himself on his fitness , has been displaying a different form of muscle this week -- the military kind
he mobilized russian 's entire northern fleet in a military exercise that reportedly ranks among the largest since the breakup of the soviet union
nato reported that , on tuesday , estonian radar detected an unspecified number of aircraft over the baltic sea
nato sent jets to identify the planes and later reported that " the russian military aircraft " flew on into the airspace of the russian exclave of kaliningrad .
