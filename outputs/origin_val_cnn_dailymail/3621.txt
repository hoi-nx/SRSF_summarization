cameron has launched a searing personal attack on labour rival miliband 's plans to ' crawl up downing street on the coat - tails of the snp '
the prime minister accused the labour leader of heading a ' bunch or hypocritical , holier - than - thou , hopeless , sneering socialists ' - but admitted the general election is on a ' knife edge '
addressing activists at the conservative spring conference in manchester , the tory leader sought to cast the contest as a personal battle and suggested his counterpart ' has n't got it '
but he coupled his promise of better healthcare with a blistering personal attack on mr miliband , warning that the labour leader was not up to the demands of leading the country
' now five years in this job teaches you some things
i know what this role needs - and frankly , i do n't think miliband has it , ' he said
' some might say " do n't make this personal " , but when it comes to who 's prime minister , the personal is national
' the guy who forgot to mention the deficit could be the one in charge of our whole economy
' the man who is too weak to stand up to the trade unions at home could be the one facing down our enemies abroad
' the leader who thinks leadership is climbing aboard the latest bandwagon - he could be the one taking the make - or - break calls in the middle of the night
' the prime minister ( pictured with wife samantha ) said that under mr miliband , labour was no longer the party of working people , having betrayed its traditional values thumbs up : mr cameron delivered his first major rallying speech since mps left westminster for the campaign trail mr cameron said that only he or mr miliband could enter no 10 after may 7 - as he accused the labour leader of planning to ' crawl up downing street on the coat - tails of the snp '
he said that under mr miliband , labour was no longer the party of working people , having betrayed its traditional values
' the truth is that miliband 's labour is n't about liberating working people - it 's about telling you what to do , ' he said
' the same old condescending , bossy , interfering , we - know - best attitude of the hampstead socialist down the ages
' on the nhs , he acknowledged that gaining access to healthcare services outside normal working hours was ' too hard ' but pledged that would change under a tory government
' for years it 's been too hard to access the nhs out of hours
but illness does n't respect working hours
heart attacks , major accidents , babies - these things do n't just come from nine to five , ' he will say
mr cameron ( pictured arriving at the conference with wife samantha ) said that only he or mr miliband could enter no 10 after may 7 the tory leader sought to cast the contest as a personal battle and suggested miliband ( pictured at the launch of the labour general election campaign ) ' has n't got it ' ' and the truth is that you are actually more likely to die if you turn up at the hospital at the weekend
some of the resources are not up and running
the key decision - makers are n't always there
' with a future tory government , we would have a truly seven day nhs
' already millions more people can see a gp seven days a week , but by 2020 i want this for everyone with hospitals properly staffed , especially for urgent and emergency care , so that everyone will have access to the nhs services they need seven days a week by 2020 - the first country in the world to make this happen
' mr cameron delivered his first major rallying speech since mps left westminster for the campaign trail surrounded by giant posters featuring party slogans at the old granada studios
the tory have been on a drive to win back the voters in the north of nhs england it needs if it is to secure an overall majority on may 7
however the plan came under attack from doctors ' leaders who accuse the prime minister of ' shameless political game playing '
dr mark porter , who chairs the british medical association council , said the tory had not even committed the funds needed to maintain existing services
' the Â£ 2 billion extra funding that has been pledged falls far short of what is needed to deliver existing services , let alone fund additional care , ' he said
' the nhs is recovering from one of the worst winter crises on record , during which some hospitals were forced to close their doors because they could n't cope
' with existing services stretched to breaking point , a majority of hospitals facing crippling budget deficits and frontline staff under extreme pressure , the nhs needs far more than just words to deliver extra care

' before the pm took to the stage , chancellor george osborne pushed his vision of a ' northern powerhouse ' including considerably enhanced powers for local authorities in manchester , under an elected mayor
and he took the chance to twist mr miliband 's words from thursday 's televised election grilling into a barb at the expense of the opposition leader
' i was listening to miliband , with all that legendary statesmanship of his , saying " hell , yeah , i 'll be a leader " , ' he said
' i 'll tell you where that leads : a return to rising unemployment ; a return to rising debts ; a return to economic chaos
' hell ? yes indeed
' labour 's campaign vice chair lucy powell accused the conservatives of misleading voters , saying their spending plans would mean " extreme " cuts to the nhs
mr cameron 's speech was briefly interrupted by a heckle from audience member howson who said he shouted : ' you have betrayed this country on immigration and europe ' ' on the nhs , cameron misled people in 2010 and he 's misleading them again today , ' she said
' when he pledges seven - day - a - week care in the nhs , people will remember that he did exactly the same before the last election , only to break his word
after five years of the tories it 's harder to see your gp and a&es are in crisis
' a liberal democrats spokesman said that nhs england already had plans in place to move towards hospitals and gps being open seven days a week
' to keep this sustainable we need to back the nhs with more investment
only the liberal democrats have a credible plan to invest the Â£ 8 billion per year by 2020 that nhs bosses say is needed , ' the spokesman said
ukip health spokesman louise bours said : ' if the tories were serious about the nhs they would have brought these changes in over the last five years they have been in government , but instead they have degenerated the nhs beyond all recognition

afterwards , howson told reporters that he had shouted : ' you have betrayed this country on immigration and europe
' mr howson , from leek , staffordshire , explained he was a tory party member but had voted for ukip at the last general election and said he held mr cameron personally responsible for its rise because of ' a botched up in - out referendum '
he said : ' i think he ( cameron ) is a fudged leader
he has not addressed the most important issue that this country faces which is immigration and the relationship with the eu
' there is no hope of renegotiating free movement of people
we need to control our own borders
we need to leave the eu
