it 's thousands of years since mankind won dominance over nature , and we 're still pretty proud
but a top researcher says we 've been giving ourselves too much credit - because we were helped by our oldest friends
humans paired up with dogs as early as 40,000 bc , it is claimed , giving us such an advantage in hunting that it prompted the wipeout of our neanderthal rivals

a new theory claims humans teamed up with the ancestors of domestic dogs far earlier than was first thought left behind : while early humans hunted with wolves , their neanderthal rivals in europe continued using primitive tools without any help , according to anthropologist dr pat shipman ( artist 's impression ) the controversial theory has been put forward in a new book by leading anthropologist pat shipman of pennsylvania state university
she has challenged the common scientific view that wolves were only domesticated just over 10,000 years ago , after early humans had already asserted a strong foothold in europe
no match : the theory claims neanderthal ( model pictured ) were no match for the hunting technique instead , she said , humans began taming and breeding wolves - leading to the pets we know today - soon after they arrived on the continent from africa up to 70,000 years ago
at the time , our close genetic relatives the neanderthal were dominant in europe , fighting for survival as they hunted creatures such as woolly mammoths with primitive tools
but soon afterwards the rival species died out , leaving a clear path for the homo sapiens that make up today 's humans
strong rival theories of their demise include that neanderthal , just like woolly mammoths , were unable to cope with the changing climate of the last ice age or that humans were better hunters
dr pat shipman , however , told the observer : ' we formed an alliance with the wolf and that would have been the end for the neanderthal
' early wolf - dogs would have tracked and harassed animals like elk and bison and would have hounded them until they tired
then humans would have killed them with spears or bows and arrows
' this meant the dogs did not need to approach these large cornered animals to finish them off â often the most dangerous part of a hunt â while humans did nât have to expend energy in tracking and wearing down prey
dogs would have done that
' then we shared the meat
it was a win - win situation
' dr pat shipman 's theory , shared in her book the invaders : how humans and their dogs drove neanderthals to extinction , was partly inspired by early dog remains
crossing paths : wolves and woolly mammoths co-existed for millennia , but only wolves survived in the end close relation : a natural history museum employee examines a model of a neanderthal during an exhibition last year
neanderthals look similar to modern humans but were a distinct species with genetic differences she examined 33,000 - year - old fossils of dogs found in siberia and belgium , and looked at how the shapes of their jaws and skulls were different from wild wolves
although they were far more similar to wolves than the pets of today , there were clear signs of domestication , she said - including shorter snouts , densely - packed teeth and wider jaws
the theory is the latest in a long line about our prehistoric ancestors , many of which contradict each other
last year a study at the university of tã¼bingen in germany claimed early humans emigrated from africa far earlier than we first thought - and as many as 130,000 years ago
another study at the university of chicago said wolves began evolving into domestic dogs between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago , while a third study said dogs may not have evolved from wolves as we know them today at all .
