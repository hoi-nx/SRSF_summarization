two savvy parents have made more than $ 1 million in ad revenue from their family - friendly youtube videos , which feature footage of their children playing with toys such as thomas the tank engine
mark and rhea , who prefer not to share their last name , upload videos starring their five - year - old son hulyan , their three - year - old daughter maya and their five - month - old son marxlen to their popular youtube channel maya , which currently receives more than 3 million views daily
' in 2014 , our youtube income skyrocketed dramatically , ' mark told yahoo parents
' we 've made more than a million [ dollars ] between 2010 to 2014
they did n't begin sharing their money - making toy videos until three years later
the couple 's most popular video was made in 2013 and features hulyan buying a thomas & friends emergency searchlight set ; the eight - minute clip has thus far earned more than 15.5 million views
mark and rhea , who are projected to earn at least $ 1.5 million this year , have since quit their jobs running an employment agency in order to pursue their lucrative youtube careers full time
these days , they dedicate their time to filming , producing and sharing a minimum of two videos a day , which typically run for at least 15 minutes each
according to the duo , they 've made so much money from the ads that air before each clip that they were able to pay for their cars and their house in southern california in cash
they have even made enough to send all three of their children to college
completely focused : the couple 's son hulyan can be seen playing a computer game ancient artifacts : the five - year - old can be seen opening a toy set filled with dinosaurs and things do n't seem to be slowing down
during the week of march 6 , maya was ranked the 42nd most viewed youtube channel in the us , according to tubefilter , while a 20 minute video showing maya unboxing a thomas & friends sodor fix-it station , has already earned nearly 400,000 views since it was published last month
throughout the clip she and her father go through the toys various features while unwrapping each piece and putting them together
most of the children âs biggest fans appear to be young children who are around the same age as maya and her older brother hulyan â and share the same keen interest in their toys
' i love your videos they really cheer up my son , ' one parent wrote
another added : ' seriously though ! my son loves them too ! ' family fun : rhea held baby marxlen as hulyan and maya enjoyed a train ride dedicated dad : mark shared these photos of himself at the start of one of his popular videos mark and rhea , who go by ' ilovemaythang ' on their channel , moved from the phillippines to the us in 2000 and 2006 , respectively
their children 's love of toys , including thomas the tank engine , is what first inspired mark to make a channel dedicated to their home movies
but even mark , who has been making video blogs since the early 1990s , admits he could not have predicted just how lucrative the family hobby would become
' [ it ] exceeded my expectations , ' he told yahoo parents
' i knew and believed that it would become somehow successful , but more than three million views in a day is simply amazing
i 'm living a dream
' but their popularity should n't be that shocking - children 's toy reviews have quickly become some of youtube 's most - watched videos
according to industry experts , children who review new toys on youtube are wielding increasing influence over the industry because of their incredible viewing figures and ability to sell almost any toy around
marc rosenberg , a chicago - based toy consultant explained to the associated press last november : ' kids trust other kids more so than they would an adult
