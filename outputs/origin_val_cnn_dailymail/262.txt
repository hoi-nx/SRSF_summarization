an attorney for a former marine found guilty in the shooting deaths of u.s. sniper author kyle and another man has filed an appeal
routh was convicted of capital murder in the 2013 deaths of kyle and chad littlefield at a rural shooting range , after jurors rejected his insanity defense
prosecutors had n't sought the death penalty , so routh was sentenced to life in prison without parole
routh 's attorneys said after the february 24 verdict they would appeal
appeal : routh , 27 , is filing to appeal his capital murder charge after he was sentenced to life in jail killed : routh fatally shot kyle , left , and chad littlefield , right , with multiple bullets in an attack in 2013 j. warren st. john , one of routh 's attorneys , said the notice of appeal was filed on tuesday
st. john also filed a motion for a new trial , arguing the conviction and sentence were contrary to law and evidence
the case drew extra attention due to the film based on kyle 's memoir
routh , 27 , was emotionless as the jury read their verdict on tuesday night : that he had not been insane when he opened fire on kyle and chad littlefield in february 2013
they had taken him to a shooting range to help him settle back into society after he left the marine
after the verdict , chad littlefield 's brother - in - law , jerry richardson , turned to routh and said : ' you took the lives of two heroes , men that tried to be a friend to you
you became an u.s. disgrace
' as the chad littlefield family also spoke out on the today show on wednesday morning , jurors stepped forward to say they had ' no doubt ' that routh knew what he was doing at the time of the murders
heartbroken : the strain showed on taya 's face ahead of the guilty verdict on tuesday evening families : deby kyle , kyle 's mother ( right ) is seen leaving the courtroom after the verdict , alongside judy and don littlefield ( left ) , whose son chris was killed at the same time the verdict came as interest in kyle 's career as the u.s. military 's deadliest - ever sniper reached fever pitch thanks to oscar - nominated film about his life , ' american sniper '
ahead of the trial , routh 's lawyers had argued that the popularity of the movie , which grossed $ 300 million at the box office , would mean he could not get a fair trial
and speaking on good morning america on wednesday , the jurors admitted some of them had seen the movie - but insisted they had put that out of their minds when making their decision
' it gave me a better outlook on chris ' role as a marine , ' one of the jurors , barrett hutchinson , said
' but as far as the actions that took place on february 2 , chad was still in the picture and chad was not in that movie
' i took the fact that chris was a marine out of my mind and looked at him as a person , looked at chad as a person , looked at routh as a person and , you know , tried to make reasonable judgment
' an attorney representing kyle 's wife is arguing that a judge was mistaken in awarding a $ 1.8 million defamation verdict to former minnesota gov. ventura over the way he was portrayed in the book american sniper
in a brief filed wednesday in the 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals , taya kyle 's lawyer wrote that the verdict should be reversed and the court should rule in kyle 's favor
at minimum , attorney borger wrote , kyle should be granted a new trial
ventura , a former pro wrestler and former minnesota governor , sued kyle for defamation in 2012 after the best - selling author wrote in his book that he decked ventura at a california bar because the former governor made offensive comments about seals
ventura testified that he never made the statements and that the confrontation never happened
a federal jury sided with ventura last summer , awarding him $ 500,000 for damages and recommending $ 1.3 million for ' unjust enrichment , ' or how much money kyle improperly made from the claim
u.s. district judge richard kyle granted the unjust enrichment , finding it was ' reasonable and supported by a preponderance of the evidence
' but borger argued on appeal that the unjust enrichment award based on alleged defamatory speech is unprecedented and violates the first amendment
borger also argued that ventura did n't prove the account was either ' material falsity ' or ' actual malice , ' and as a result , he did n't meet the legal threshold for a defamation claim
borger said the judge also erred in giving instructions to the jury
' a properly instructed jury would not have rendered a verdict in ventura 's favor , ' borger wrote
kyle , a former seal regarded as the deadliest sniper in u.s. military history , was killed in 2013 at a texas shooting range
a former marine was convicted in his death last month
loved : taya kyle , pictured with her husband chris , paid tribute to him in an emotional facebook post on wednesday morning , just hours after a texas jury found his killer guilty of murder caught : routh is pictured in the back of a police car after he fled the scene of the murder in kyle 's truck before he was eventually caught
he claimed he shot the two men because he feared they would kill him confession : routh , pictured hours after the killings , confessed to the shootings almost immediately also on wednesday , chad littlefield 's family spoke out about the verdict
' it was an answered prayer , ' littlefield told the today show
' we 've waited a long time to hear that
we feel justice has been served
' routh 's brother - in - law added that he never once believed routh had been insane
routh 's attorneys had tried to prove he was in a psychotic state at the time of the killings
' it was all an act , ' jerry richardson said
' i taught him in high school and ... that 's just the way he was
he was still just opposite defiant , and he had nothing wrong in the mind except for the drug use
' chad 's father don remembered his son as a ' quiet man ' and ' a good listener ' who met kyle at their children 's soccer practices
the two men shared an interest in working out and helping veterans , don said
chad himself was not a veteran but wanted to help others
' chris served overseas and chad served when they came back , ' mrs littlefield explained
mr chad littlefield added : ' his motto was pass it forward
' kyle 's widow , taya kyle , testified in the trial but has not spoken out since the verdict
she was seen in the courtroom on tuesday but did not return when the decision was read .
