' opera , ' rooney said , before adding : ' only joking

' there was a slight sneer when it was suggested , tongue in cheek , that rooney would be asked to sing later in the hangout , something which did not materialise
rooney was asked who his favourite english footballer and hero was growing up
his answer was gascoigne , a player who also attracted tabloid attention for his off - field antics as much as his on - field displays
rooney added : ' i think he 's probably still to this day the greatest english player
for excitement and goals , he was my favourite player
