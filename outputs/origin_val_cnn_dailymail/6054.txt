' pavel pogrebnyak and norwood also hit the post for reading who were bidding to make their own bit of history by reaching the last four for the first time since 1927
and clarke 's men know they will probably never have a better chance than their replay against league one opposition which is scheduled for a week on monday at the madejski stadium

and the tone for a full - throttle but low - quality encounter was set in a robust opening minute as billy knott barged over jamie mackie and moments later nathaniel chalobah 's challenge left hanson stretched out on the deck

' i knew we were in the game from the first minute from the way we were challenging and getting the second balls
i knew we were determined to get them back to our place if that was the best we could do , and everyone was 100 per cent concentrated on that
