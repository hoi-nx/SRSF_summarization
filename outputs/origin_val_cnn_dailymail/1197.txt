one of the british twin sisters who have travelled to syria to become jihadi brides was caught looking at an extremist - linked image on her school computer six months before she fled the country , it has emerged
salma halane , 17 , downloaded a photograph of isis fighters in december 2013 , using a computer at connell sixth form college in manchester
when teachers found out , she told them she was trying to find her brother who had gone to syria
terror : salma halane , left , looked up an image of isis fighters online six months before she travelled to syria with her twin sister zahra , right six months later , salma halane and her twin sister zahra fled to the war - torn country , where they are believed to have married jihadist fighters from the bloodthirsty terror group
the isis - related photograph which salma halane viewed online was spotted by teachers when they were reviewing pupils ' internet usage
the school says that she was twice spoken to by staff about the picture , and advised to talk to her family about her worries over her brother , while teachers subsequently discussed the issue with her parents
however , staff did not tell the police of any concerns about the girl
after the twins disappeared in june last year , the school handed all their internet browsing records over to anti-terrorism investigators to help them track salma halane and zahra down
school : connell sixth form college discovered the image on one of its own computers jihad : this picture of female isis fighters was shared by salma halane on her twitter feed after she went to syria a spokesman for bright futures educational trust , which runs the college , said there was no reason not to believe salma halane 's explanation for why she was viewing the image
she added : ' as part of the college 's daily routine we review all internet browsing records
we promptly challenge students on anything that stands out during that review
' in december 2013 we discovered that salma halane had viewed an image on a mainstream news website in the hope of spotting her missing brother
our priority was her emotional wellbeing , and we recommended she speak to her mother about her concern for her brother and the college followed this up
' once it became clear that the girls had travelled to syria , we handed over all computer records to the ctu ( ctu )
these were reviewed and nothing was discovered that caused them concern
' training : another image sent out by salma halane appears to show women in burqas being taught how to shoot an education source told the manchester evening news that the school should have done more to intervene after they saw that salma halane had been looking at terror - related content online
' i have no doubt whatsoever that if someone at the college had followed this up with salma halane , she would still be in this country , ' the source said
' i think there should have been a real concern that she was becoming radicalised
' salma halane and zahra were among the first pupils at connell sixth form college , which opened as a state - funded free school in september 2013
the twin girls , from the manchester suburb of chorlton , had 28 gcses between them and were hoping to become doctors before they ran away to join isis
their parents tried to travel to syria to bring the girls back home , but were unable to persuade them to leave the war zone
a number of british schoolgirls are believed to have left the country to become jihadi brides - last month , three teenagers from east london abandoned their families and travelled to syria .
