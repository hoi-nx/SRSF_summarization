as enthusiasts patiently explain , motor racing is a team sport
we think it âs all about the best driver , true aficionados see beyond to unsung heroes in overalls glimpsed during pit stops and others who sit at drawing boards and laptop computers
the most committed formula one fans are never outraged by team orders and regard the constructors â championship as equally compelling
so why the fuss about mercedes ? if the rules state that a designer must be limited or regulated if he gets too good , what is the point in having a constructors â championship at all ? mercedes driver lewis hamilton celebrates his win at the season - opening race in melbourne , australia lewis hamilton and mercedes team - mate nico rosberg were in a class of their own as they dominated the race lewis hamilton , the reigning world champion , is the overwhelming favourite to defend his formula one crown give everyone the same car , forget teams and make formula one about drivers only
the problem is , who would then pay for all that expensive equipment to be ferried around the world ? one can hardly imagine lewis hamilton trundling his wheels off a ferry at cherbourg before making his way down to the monte carlo grand prix via the toll roads
yes , we may be in for a boring formula one season but not for the reason many imagine : the dominance of mercedes
this is shaping up as a dull one because the narrative is now set at one team being too good and lewis hamilton being the best only because he has the fastest car
critics then seek to devalue his achievements
naturally , the man with the fastest machine often wins â but not always
in the past 30 years , there have been four occasions when the top driver was nât in the top car and lewis hamilton is the only one to achieve that feat this century
red bull driver daniel ricciardo finished sixth at the first race of the season , one lap down on lewis hamilton christian horner oversaw red bulls dominance from 2010 - 2013 as they won four consecutive championships helmut marko , motorsport advisor of red bull , has speculated that his team could pull out of formula one video red bull threaten exit over ' boring ' rules in 2008 , lewis hamilton won the drivers â championship in a mclaren but ferrari took the constructors â title
before that , mika hakkinen ( 1999 ) , michael schumacher ( 1994 ) and alain prost ( 1986 ) also pulled it off
so when lewis hamilton said if everyone had the same car he would still be champion , he is probably right
formula one is nât like that , though
it âs a team game , and mercedes deserve their glory , too
helmut marko , motorsport advisor of red bull , has speculated that his team could pull out if mercedes are allowed to dominate and some are troubled by that threat â but what if mercedes walked instead ? what if , instead of losing the also - rans , the team with the best driver and the best car grew sick of the artificial manipulation , and withdrew ? red bull dominated for four years and each season changes were made to try to rein them in , but after one race ? that is a pathetic attitude
â just get your head down , work hard and try to sort it out , â was the advice from mercedes chief toto wolff and he is right
if this season is about lewis hamilton versus his team - mate nico rosberg , tough
last year , formula one risked a lottery by awarding random double points for the final grand prix
this is worse â a sport that seeks to put the brakes on excellence for the sake of mediocrity is not much of a sport at all .
