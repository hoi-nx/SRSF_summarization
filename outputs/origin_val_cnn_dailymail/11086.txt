mackay won all three scottish domestic honours with hearts in the 1950s and was a key part of tottenham ' famous 1961 double - winning team
he was named footballer of the year in both scotland and english , and also starred for derby , where he won the first division title as manager
' he was a fantastic player , ' ferguson said
' they talk about this great courage he had and i think that is unfair
i know he was the bravest man in the world but he was a fantastic footballer , he was skilful
' his personality , his intensity , his desire to win could make any team
and he proved that by going to derby and winning the league as a centre - back
' i thought it was a nice piece in the papers about how he said he did n't enjoy seeing that photograph of him and billy bremner portraying him as a bully
he said " i do n't like bullies "
' i think that was exactly what mackay was like
he was a humble person
humility is embraced by great people and i think mackay embraced that thoroughly

' he protected his modesty with the pride only a scotsman can do
' his record 's fantastic
it 's a privilege to speak here today and i think we have seen the passing of a truly great legend
' mackay won 22 caps for scotland and began his career with hearts in 1953
that is something to rankle with ferguson
' scotland was picked by a committee with their heads in the sand
the fact he has only 22 caps tells you [ that ] , ' he added
' twenty - two caps for a player as good as that
i could never understand that

he joined derby in 1968 and helped clough 's side win promotion to the first division the following year before taking up a player - manager role at swindon town in 1971
a year later mackay left to manage nottingham forest for a brief spell before succeeding clough as derby manager in 1973 , with the rams winning the first division title in 1975
ferguson recalled the only time he played against mackay
' i was playing for queen 's park reserves against hearts reserves at tynecastle and the great mackay was playing because he was coming back from a broken toe
' he tackled me and i thought " christ " , but in those days you had to get up no matter what
so i got up , had a look at that big barrel chest of his and he just said " are you all right , son ? "
' that was a great memory - the only time i played against mackay - and i 'll never forget it
