boyd scored a famous burnley winner as manchester city 's strongarm tactics backfired ahead of their big date in the nou camp
turf moor was bouncing as boyd lashed home a poor clearance from returning manchester city captain kompany after 61 minutes
and manuel pellegrini 's men â who sent on Â£ 50million substitutes bony and jovetic to try and salvage the game â were lucky to survive with 11 men after bad challenges from aguero and demichelis

host commentator what a potential season - defining moment burnley 's win could be tonight
the victory still sees the burnley in the relegation zone - but by only one point with sunderland looking over their shoulders ever - more
meanwhile the defeat for manchester city is damaging for their title hopes
a win for chelsea on sunday would see manuel pellegrini 's side trail by eight points with nine games remaining
manchester city now have to pick themselves up with a daunting trip to barcelona in the champions league on wednesday night
until next time , have a good evening ! and the referee brings a close to the match
relegation candidates burnley have stunned the champions manchester city ! boyd 's goal separates the two sides
cue pandemonium among the turf moor faithful
92 mins : burnley make their second defensive change of the match as ings is taken off for reid
the hosts are now playing without any recognised strikers
91 mins : oh wow , what a huge moment in the match
zabaleta charges into the burnley box and falls under the challenge of mee
on first inspection it looked a penalty and the replays suggest so too
however the referee decides otherwise and awards a free - kick to burnley as shackell is fouled by zabaleta during his tumble
the manchester city players are incensed
will that moment spell curtains for their title challenge ? there will be four minutes of injury time to be added on ... 86 mins : burnley make their first change of the match and it 's a defensive one as striker vokes is replaced by ward
lampard 's appearance is his 600th in the premier league
only ryan giggs has made more
82 mins : and that cross is yaya toure 's last piece of action as he is replaced by lampard
81 mins : what a chance that was for manchester city to equalise
navas cuts the ball back on the right flank to yaya toure
the latter whips in a devilish cross that finds the head of aguero at the back post
the argentina international can only head over from just outside the six - yard box though
the frustration grows for the visitors
manchester city are continuing to press for an equaliser but have yet to breach the burnley defence
as they push further forward gaps are starting to appear which burnley are beginning to exploit
the visitors have simply not been at it tonight , a huge credit must go to the burnley though
74 mins : manuel pellegrini makes his second change of the match as silva is replaced by jovetic
71 mins : two of burnley 's back four are now cautioned as duff sees yellow for a foul
66 mins : manchester city have just over 20 minutes plus added time to turnaround this scoreline
victory for manchester city would see them close the gap on chelsea to two - points ahead of their match against saints on sunday
a defeat means the blues could go eight points clear if they beat the saints
do the manchester city players want it enough ? 63 mins : manchester city react to conceding the opener by taking off the ineffectual dzeko and replacing him with bony
demichelis ' act of cynicism has been punished spectacularly by burnley
from the resulting free - kick trippier 's set piece is headed away by manchester city captain kompany
unfortunately for the defender his clearance falls straight to boyd who hits a sweet left - footed volley first time that arrows into the bottom corner
60 mins : demichelis swiftly follows mee into the referees book for a cynical challenge on ings
58 mins : we have our first booking of the match and it 's a harsh one as ben mee is cautioned for a challenge on navas
replays show it was a soft decision in comparison to some of the unpunished tackles that the manchester city players have dealt
55 mins : what a hit by boyd - he 's so unlucky
the scotland international hits a hook volley , with his weaker right foot , over his shoulder that narrowly goes past the post
that 's got the crowd engaged
51 mins : silva has just produced a collectors item - a bad touch
and at precisely the wrong time too
aguero does brilliantly to spin around a burnley defender on the halfway line and race clear
with silva in support he plays in the playmaker but his first touch forces him wide with heaton bearing down on him
that could , and probably should have been , 1 - 0 to the visitors
will the deadlock be broken in this stalemate ? a manchester city fan has just proposed to his burnley - supporting girlfriend on the pitch at half time
thankfully she said yes because it âs a long walk back to the touchline
that âs the best entertainment we âve had here so far
disappointing first half from the champions
surely they have nât got one eye on barcelona when there âs still something to play for in the title race
manchester city showed a few flashes towards the end of the first half but heaton has only had two saves to make , and fairly routine saves at that
and the referee has drawn a close to first half proceedings at turf moor
in truth it 's been a rather drab affair with no clear - cut chances yet created for either side
the hosts will be pleased with their display so far as they aim to avoid relegation , but manchester city know they have to improve if they are to keep their hopes alive of retaining the premier league title
42 mins : city are dominating possession now and the stats support that with 70 per cent of the ball in their favour
however , the key statistic is that it is still 0 - 0
can they make their dominance count ? 34 mins : the visitors are slowly starting to come into the game more
dzeko wriggles free inside in the burnley box but is tackled before he can shoot
the ball falls into the path of aguero who chooses to shoot rather the cross
the end product ? an effort well wide of goal
nevertheless a warning sign for the hosts
29 mins : it 's taken nearly half an hour but finally a keeper is forced into a save
heaton comes off his line well to deny dzeko from squeezing in a near post effort
from the resulting build - up the goalkeeper holds the ball well from an aguero strike
as the old saying goes , you wait ages for a bus and then two come along at once
26 mins : and that trend continues as edin dzeko drags an ambitious left - footed shot well wide of heaton 's goal
23 mins : the fans have little to cheer about so far and it 's hardly surprising
we 're approaching the midway point of the first half and neither side has managed a shot on target yet
15 mins : still no clear - cut chances created by either side
both goalkeepers have had yet to break sweat
10 mins : burnley right back trippier crosses a ball that hits clichy
the home fans roar for a penalty but replays clearly show the ball hits the left back in the chest
6 mins : as you would expect burnley came out of the traps strongly in the opening exchanges
city have weathered that ' mini-storm ' and are starting to express themselves
the match has started in lancashire
can burnley stun manchester city ? kick - off is imminent ... look away burnley fans ... city are unbeaten in their last six visits to turf moor in all competitions , winning the last five in a row and scoring 17 times in the last four
to make matters the visitors are unbeaten in their last 13 matches in all competitions against the burnley ( w8 d5 l0 )
records are there to be broken though ... in a close battle for the premier league title , december 28 2014 could be a date that haunts manchester city
leading 2 - 0 at half - time against burnley , manuel pellegrini 's side squander a two - goal lead to draw with sean dyche 's men
boyd scored straight after the break , turning home ings ' shot while in an offside position
then barnes reacted quickest in a crowded penalty area to smash home a loose ball to earn the visitors a draw
manuel pellegrini knows his side ca n't afford a repeat performance like that if they are to close the gap on league leaders chelsea
manchester city captain kompany returns to the starting line - up after being an unused substitute against leicester on 4 march
quartet zabaleta , clichy , fernandinho and edin dzeko also start as manuel pellegrini rings the changes
right so the burnley team news is and mike duff and vokes come in for keane and kightly in the only two changes for the burnley from the side that lost 2 - 0 at anfield against liverpool
manchester city xi : hart , zabaleta , kompany , demichelis , clichy , navas , fernandinho , yaya toure , silva , dzeko , aguero subs : caballero , mangala , sagna , nasri , lampard , bony , jovetic burnley xi : heaton , trippier , shackell , duff , mee ; barnes , arfield , jones , boyd ; ings , vokes subs : gilks , keane , reid , ward , jutkiewicz , wallace , kightly
