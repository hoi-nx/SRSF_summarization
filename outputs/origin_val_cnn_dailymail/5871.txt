obese women have a 40 per cent higher risk of developing at least seven types of cancer in their lifetime obese women have a 40 per cent higher risk of developing at least seven types of cancer in their lifetime , according to research
these weight - related cancers include bowel , post-menopausal breast , gallbladder , womb , kidney , pancreatic and oesophageal types
statistics released by cancer research uk show that obese women have around a one in four risk of developing a cancer linked to weight in their lifetime
in a group of 1,000 obese women , 274 will be diagnosed with a bodyweight - linked cancer in their lifetime , compared with 194 women diagnosed in a group of 1,000 healthy weight women
approximately a quarter of women are classified as obese and it is estimated that 18,000 women develop cancer as a result of being overweight or obese each year
there are different ways that obesity could increase the risk of cancer
one possibility is that it is linked to the production of hormones by fat cells â especially oestrogen which is thought to fuel the disease
around 12 per cent of postmenopausal breast cancers â a total of 5,269 women â are blamed on obesity
it is the highest number of cases linked to obesity because the cancer is so common
last year a study found women were at double the risk of getting the disease because of their weight compared with men
researchers said 8.2 per cent of all cancers in women in the uk were caused by being fat
the study found 4.4 per cent of all cancers in men were due to obesity
previous estimates claimed if uk continue to pile on the pounds , it will lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026
dr julie sharp of cancer research uk said : ' losing weight is n't easy , but you do n't have to join a gym and run miles every day or give up your favourite food
just making small changes that you can maintain in the long term can have a real impact
to get started , try getting off the bus a stop earlier and cutting down on fatty and sugary foods
a quarter of women are classified as obese and it is estimated that 18,000 women develop cancer as a result of being overweight or obese each year ' gradually build on these to achieve a healthier lifestyle that you can maintain
and find out about local services , which can provide help and support to make lifestyle changes
we know that our cancer risk depends on a combination of our genes , our environment and other aspects of our lives , many of which we can control â helping people understand how they can reduce their risk of developing cancer in the first place remains crucial in tackling the disease
' lifestyle changes â like not smoking , keeping a healthy weight , and cutting back on alcohol â are the big opportunities for us all to reduce our cancer risk
making these changes is not a guarantee against cancer , but it stacks the odds in our favour
' breast cancer patients can raise their chances of survival by exercising , a study has found
tumours grew more slowly when mice being treated for cancer had an exercise wheel in their cage
it means that in future , breast cancer patients could be prescribed exercise as part of their treatment
as cancers grow , the blood vessels supplying them with oxygen become thin and tangled , making it harder for drugs to reach the tumour
but when us researchers from the duke cancer institute in north carolina let mice with breast cancer run on wheels , their bloody supply improved
researcher dr mark dewhirst said : ' we were truly amazed by these findings
' macmillan cancer support has previously described exercise as a ' wonder drug ' .
