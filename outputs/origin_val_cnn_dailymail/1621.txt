these remarkable scans clearly reveal how smoking during pregnancy harms an unborn baby 's development
new ultrasound images show how babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy touch their mouths and faces much more than babies of non-smoking mothers
foetuses normally touch their mouths and faces much less the older and more developed they are
experts said the scans show how smoking during pregnancy can mean the development of the baby 's central nervous system is delayed
doctors have long urged pregnant women to give up cigarettes because they heighten the risk of premature birth , respiratory problems and even cot death
now researchers believe they can show the effects of smoking on babies in the womb - and use the images to encourage mothers who are struggling to give up
the foetus carried by the smoker touches its face and mouth much more , indicating its development is delayed as part of the study , dr reissland , of durham university , used 4 - d ultrasound scan images to record thousands of tiny movements in the womb
she monitored 20 mothers attending the james cook university hospital in middlesbrough , four of whom smoked an average of 14 cigarettes a day
after studying their scans at 24 , 28 , 32 and 36 weeks , she detected that foetuses whose mothers smoked continued to show significantly higher rates of mouth movement and self - touching than those carried by non-smokers
foetuses usually move their mouths and touch themselves less as they gain more control the closer they get to birth , she explained
the pilot study , which dr reissland hopes to expand with a bigger sample , found babies carried by smoking mothers may have delayed development of the central nervous system
dr reissland said : ' a larger study is needed to confirm these results and to investigate specific effects , including the interaction of maternal stress and smoking
' she believed that videos of the difference in pre-birth development could help mothers give up smoking
dr reissland , of durham university , said the ultrasound scans show unborn babies of mothers who smoke may have delayed development of their central nervous systems but she was against demonising mothers and called for more support for them to give up
currently , 12 per cent of pregnant women in the uk smoke but the rate is over 20 per cent in certain areas in the north east
all the babies in her study were born healthy , and were of normal size and weight
dr reissland , who has an expertise in studying foetal development , thanked the mothers who took part in her study , especially those who smoked
' i 'm really grateful , they did a good thing , ' she said
' these are special people and they overcame the stigma to help others
' co-author professor brian francis , of lancaster university , added : ' technology means we can now see what was previously hidden , revealing how smoking affects the development of the foetus in ways we did not realise
' this is yet further evidence of the negative effects of smoking in pregnancy
' the research was published in the journal acta paediatrica .
