labour and the scottish nationalists could form a â permanent alliance â at westminster , it is claimed today
despite mounting pressure on ed miliband to rule out any deal with the rampant snp , one labour strategist has floated the idea of an enduring â german - style â agreement with the party , according to the new statesman magazine
it was described as a â cdu - csu scenario â , mirroring a deal between angela merkel âs christian democrats with the csu in the german state of bavaria
despite mounting pressure on ed miliband to rule out any deal with the rampant snp ( spurred by a conservative poster , above ) , one labour strategist has reportedly floated the idea of a partnership the cdu does not stand candidates in bavaria in exchange for support in german âs bundestag from the csu
labour peer lord foulkes , a former mp in scotland , broke ranks last night to insist mr ed miliband should rule out any post-election deal
â labour mp and peer to whom i âve spoken thinks we should rule out any kind of deal with the snp
what are we waiting for ? â he demanded
a national poll last night found 61 per cent of voters would be unhappy with a power - sharing deal involving the snp
labour voters were marginally more sympathetic to the idea , with 44 per cent in favour of some sort of deal , the survey by former tories treasurer ashcroft found
while the snp has indicated it would not enter a formal coalition , it has suggested it would prop up a minority labour government in key commons votes in exchange for concessions
a labour source insisted the idea of a permanent deal that would mean the party withdrawing from scotland was â b * * * * * * * â

sally keeble , a junior minister under mr blair , announced yesterday that she would be turning down the money
she was mp for northampton north and is now trying to resurrect her political career after losing her seat in 2010 in the wake of the expenses scandal
it followed the decision by dundee east candidate lesley brennan to also reject the cash
mr campbell wrote on twitter : â to attention seeking candidates rejected tb money 1
he won more labour seats than anyone 2
do you want to win ? â labour activists responded angrily and praised the two women refusing the cash
labour said the money was being accepted on behalf of the whole party and indicated it was not for individual candidates to refuse .
