a teething baby can be hard work
so spare a thought for london zoo âs gorilla troop , whose latest addition is already showing off her first gnashers
three - month - old alika smiled for just long enough to let onlookers â including her mother mjukuu , 15 â catch a glimpse of two bottom teeth poking through
zookeeper daniel simmonds said : â until the last few days , mjukuu has been cradling alika in her arms and carrying her everywhere , but we âve now spotted her carefully placing alika on her back , so that she can move around more freely
the animal was born in december say cheese : alika reclines in her mother 's arm as she smiles for the camera
she is the only baby in the enclosure â this , along with alika getting her first teeth , is an exciting milestone for us , as it signals that she will soon be crawling and taking her first steps
â alika was born in december after spending eight and a half months in mother mjukuu 's womb
the female gorilla mated with kumbuka âs upon his arrival in 2013
their baby - whose name means ' most beautiful ' - is kumbuka 's first offspring and a special addition to the zoo 's gorilla enclosure
baby gorillas typically spend around two months on their mother 's body before they begin to move around on their own and eat solid food
alika will be reliant on her mother for around three years before feeling confident enough to act on her own
feeding time : mother mjukuu cradles the baby in the gorilla enclosure at london zoo
alika will spend a few months breastfeeding before being able to eat solid food snoozing : the new mother and her baby take a nap together with the rest of the gorillas out of sight keeping baby close by : mjukuu roams around the enclosure with baby alika tucked under her arm look at me : in a picture taken last month baby alika , with her hair still growing , looks lovingly at her mother first - time father kumbuka has , according to keepers , taken a back - seat approach to parenting , leaving most of the hard work to mjukuu
' mjukuu is a very attentive mother
throughout the day she 'll be looking at her hands , her feet , she 'll be cleaning them , she 'll be licking them
so she 's incredibly attentive , ' said glynn hennessy , gorilla keeper
' she 'll move her around depending on where she is on her body to be more comfortable
' whenever mum has something to eat you can see alika looking at it , she does the classic baby thing where she puts her fingers in her mouth and she 'll even try to go out and grab it
' the next steps will probably be where mum actually moves away , she 's able to grab some food if mum lets her and she 's able to eat some solid foods so maybe she 'll just come off of mum and starts moving around on her own
