mary-ann wood , 53 , has one leg which weighs two stone more than the other after cancer treatment a grandmother has spoken of the agony of living with a medical condition that means she has one leg two stone heavier than another
mary-ann wood 's left leg began to swell after treatment for cervical cancer 17 years ago , but it is now so huge that her calf has a circumference of almost 3ft
the 53 - year - old suffers from lymphoedema , a condition where the body 's plumbing goes haywire
this means fluid does n't drain properly , leaving her with a painfully swollen leg
mrs mary-ann wood is now unable to bend her leg , is barely able to walk , and doctors have said she will be completely immobile in less than a decade
despite this , she has been denied nhs funding for a liposuction operation to drain the fluid from her leg
she made the bid through her doctor , who agreed she would benefit from the treatment , which would cost the nhs Â£ 11,000
but after her case was assessed by a panel at her local clinical commissioning group ( clinical commissioning group ) , her application was denied as the clinical commissioning group said the evidence for the procedure 's effectiveness was ' poor '
she claims she has been given several reasons as to why she ca n't have the treatment , including it being a ' cosmetic procedure '
mrs mary-ann wood , of midhurst , west sussex , has been forced to give up her job working with special needs children while she continues to battle the nhs for the treatment
last month , she was rejected by the independent complaint advocacy on the grounds that her case is not ' exceptional enough ' , she said
mrs mary-ann wood said : ' my leg is huge and the surgeon told me the only option is to have the operation
' i 've had loads of different excuses for being rejected - they once even said it would be " cosmetic "
' i was also told that i was n't " exceptional enough " to get the op. it 's ridiculous
she added : ' i was told that my best bet of getting the operation is to move to an area where the nhs provides it - it 's a postcode lottery
' but i 've got two small grandchildren down the road i do n't want to up sticks
' mrs mary-ann wood 's condition developed because she had lymph nodes removed along with her cervix as part of a hysterectomy
her lymphatic system is no longer strong enough to drain her leg of the fluid causing the build - up
the lymphatic system is a filter network of tiny vessels which runs alongside the circulation and drains waste products from the blood normally , fluid drains from the lymph channels into the lymph nodes
these nodes act like filter stations that process the waste - the fluid itself goes back through the body into the circulation
however , if the lymphatic system is faulty - such as after cancer treatment - the fluid it would normally drain away accumulates in the tissue and the area swells up
the skin becomes like a soggy mattress , because there 's too much fluid in the tissue
mrs wood doctors calculated that her left leg was two stone heavier than her right leg using computer modelling
she said : ' the doctor knows how much the lymph fluid weighs so she measures my legs at 2cm intervals , works out the difference in size and puts it all into the computer and it calculates the difference in weight
' she must now wear a compression garment , which puts pressure on tissues to stop fluid build - up and encourage fluid to drain
the liposuction would not cure the condition but it would drain the excess fluid from her leg allowing her to walk normally again
mrs mary-ann wood 's left leg has swollen so much her calf now has a circumference of almost three feet
she is unable to bend it , leaving her barely able to walk
doctors have said she will be immobile within a decade she suffers from lymphoedema , a condition in which the body 's lymphatic system does n't drain fluid properly from the leg , causing fluid to accumulate in the tissue and the leg to swell up it would cost the nhs Â£ 11 , 000 , with a continuing cost of around Â£ 300 a year to remeasure her leg and create a new compression garment if there is a change in size
the liposuction would not cure the condition but it would drain the excess fluid from her leg allowing her to walk normally again
without the operation , mrs mary-ann wood must continue her daily struggle
she said : ' i get up in the morning and have a massage and put on compression garment - all that takes an hour
' then it 's very difficult to walk
it weighs nearly three stone more than it should because it 's filled with lymph fluid
lymphoedema is a condition where the lymphatic system â a filter network of tiny vessels which runs alongside the circulation and drains waste products from the blood â is nât working properly
normally , fluid drains from the lymph channels into the lymph nodes
these nodes act like filter stations that process the waste â the fluid itself goes back through the body into the circulation
however , if the lymphatic system is faulty , the fluid it would normally drain away accumulates in the tissue and the area swells up
the skin becomes like a soggy mattress , because there âs too much fluid in the tissue
limbs can swell to double their normal size and can be extremely painful
the condition is common in middle - aged women
' i ca n't walk any distance and when i do i use a stick
doctors said that by the time i 'm 60 i will be immobile
already i ca n't move that knee at all
' i do n't want to go down that road , that 's not what i want out of life , the only option for me is to fight
' her battle started in 2013 when massages began failing her and was told she needed the liposuction
her husband of 26 years alan wood , a 48 - year - old removal man , must assist her in her daily chores
a spokesperson at nhs coastal west sussex clinical commissioning group , said : ' we are very sorry to hear mrs mary-ann wood 's concerns , and we do understand the difficult situation that patients are in when they come to us for individual funding
' there are treatments and drugs that we do not routinely fund , but which we know , and understand , that patients and their families want to look into and explore as a possible solution to their medical needs
' to enable this , people are able to apply for individual funding through their clinicians
' decisions are not taken lightly , and cases are thoroughly considered by a panel of hospital consultants , gps and lay people
' the panel sought an independent review from specialist at guys and st thomas ' nhs foundation trust , and their report was considered alongside the submission from mrs mary-ann wood 's doctor
the clinical commissioning group spokesperson continued : ' the clinical commissioning group 's panel fully considered mrs mary-ann wood 's case , but found that the evidence of clinical effectiveness of the proposed treatment was poor
' we understand this is disappointing for mrs wood but without evidence that the treatment would be clinically effective , the panel could not approve the treatment
' now , mrs mary-ann wood is trying to raise Â£ 2,500 to get a machine to massage her leg but has so far raised just Â£ 220
