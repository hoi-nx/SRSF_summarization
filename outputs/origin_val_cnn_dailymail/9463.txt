a new study of the islamic state 's finances has revealed previous that estimates suggesting the terror group earns $ 2billion every year could be far too low
isis ' finance chief sheikh abu saad al-ansari - who operates from isis ' iraqi stronghold mosul - is understood to have recently approved the terror group 's first annual budget - revealing and estimated spend of $ 2 billion this year , plus a expected surplus of $ 250 million
the budget suggests isis ' annual income could be as much a quarter of a billion dollars more than experts previously suggested - with the bulk of the terror group 's revenue coming from oil sales , organ harvesting , ransom and extortion payments , and the looting and sale of ancient antiquities
if the revised figure is accurate , it means isis ' annual income now exceeds that of al qaeda - making the terror group lead by abu bakr al-baghdadi the wealthiest jihadi organisation in history
criminal : despite isis ' claims to be a devout religious organisation , the majority of their income is believed to come from illegal means - such as mafia - style extortion threats - and even drug and people smuggling the united states treasury 's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence , david s cohen , appeared to confirm that isis earns far more than previously estimated , according to middle east eye , by confirming that the terror group 's budget was more than $ 2 billion

according to the russian federal drug control service , isis has turned the ancient city of nineveh , adjacent to turkey borders , is a centre for its heroin trade , mme reports
. experts believe that roughly $ 1billion of isis ' income comes from the sale of heroin and that half the heroin on sale in europe has passed through the terrorists ' hands and helped to fill its coffers
power : if the revised figure is accurate , it means isis ' annual income now exceeds that of al qaeda - making the terror group lead by abu bakr al-baghdadi ( pictured ) the wealthiest jihadi organisation in history mailonline revealed last december that human organ traffiking is another way isis finances its activities
last month the un 's ambassador to iraqi , alhakim , claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near mosul

it is clear they are missing certain parts
' he also said a dozen doctors have been ' executed ' in mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting

last month it was revealed that militants fighting for isis in syrian are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men
looted from ancient buildings in isis strongholds , such as the group 's de facto capital city raqqa , the antiquities are up to 10,000 - years - old and can exchange hands for more than $ 1 million each
lucrative : isis has set up a specialist organ - smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts , livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market security : a syrian police officer patrols the ancient of palmyra to protect its ruins from looters and smugglers the most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy europe - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects , which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring lebanon and turkey
the trade in antiquities is one of isis ' primary sources of funding , along with oil and ransom payments , and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year
the finer points of isis trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the bbc
it revealed that isis militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control
if the smugglers decide not to buy the items , they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry , regardless of their historic significance
isis is believed to generate a total of several million pounds a day , with approximately Â£ 400,000 of that coming from the sale of oil
wealthiest jihadis in history : isis ' budget suggests the terror group 's annual income could be as much a quarter of a billion dollars more than experts previously suggested a further Â£ 250,00 comes from extortion and protection money paid by companies and individuals operating in areas under its control , while isis also makes money from farming , water services and electricity production
revenue obtained from ransoms paid by the families or governments of kidnapped individuals in less easy to calculate , but the price for release is usually millions of pounds
companies and lorry drivers are forced to pay road and import taxes to use roads in areas under isis ' control - with lorries charged Â£ 500 per journey , plus a further Â£ 250 tax for electronic good and Â£ 200 for food parcels
however one expected source of income is the looting of antiques from the many ancient religious sites in areas under its command
for example , one iraqi intelligence official claimed that isis earned Â£ 23 million in early 2014 alone by selling 800 items stolen from the ancient city of al-nabk near damascus .
