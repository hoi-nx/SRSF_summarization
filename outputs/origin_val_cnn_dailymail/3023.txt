the widow of a retired police officer who shot dead two of their daughters before turning the gun on himself will receive $ 500,000 in death benefits despite earlier fears she 'd be left penniless
former white plains officer hochman had filed new retirement papers removing his wife as beneficiary just 10 days before he carried out the killings in harrison , ny on february 21
it means that the state could recognize the original form - and it has indicated it will do so , the lawyer , roth , told the newspaper
but she will likely still receive a payout ' she would have been left with nothing had this happened two weeks later , ' he said
' they could have decided to accept the other form ... but this saves everyone years of litigation
' we appreciate the state stepping up and helping the family in this critical situation
' white plains officials have also indicated that the city will cover health insurance for dipietro-hochman , 50 , and her surviving 22 - year - old daughter , samantha , for 90 days , roth said
he added that he hopes they can come to a longer - term agreement over the health insurance
hochman , 52 , retired from the white plains force after 22 years on january 30
three weeks later , when his wife and their older daughter were in connecticut , he gunned down 17 - year - old alissa and 13 - year - old deanna with his 40 - caliber glock as they slept
murdered : he shot dead 17 - year - old alissa and 13 - year - old deanna ( pictured ) as well as the family 's three dogs before taking his life on february 21
he and his wife had spoken about separating before the deaths left behind : his wife , anamarie dipietro-hochman , second left , and their surviving daughter , 22 - year - old samantha , center , are pictured at funerals for the two slain teenagers he then killed their three dogs , typed out a suicide note on the computer and shot himself
mrs dipietro-hochman asked alissa 's teenage boyfriend to check the house because neither had been able to contact anyone there
he discovered hochman 's body in the garage
he called police who found the girls ' bodies
hochman , who had no known health or psychiatric problems , apparently carried out the killings after he and his wife had spoken about a possible separation weeks earlier
before the murders , mrs dipietro-hochman went to police to report a non-violent argument with her husband over an $ 80 cellphone bill because a friend had urged her to record such incidents
authorities said the suicide note , which was addressed to his wife and which included five or six pages of instructions on getting things in order , indicated that the killings were premeditated

police later found the bodies of the girls , who had been shot in their sleep interviews with people who knew him found no one had an inkling that ' mr. hoffman would have committed this heinous crime , ' said harrison police chief anthony marraccini last week
still , ' harrison police investigators discovered a suicide note at the residence indicating that the killings were premeditated by mr. hochman , ' he said
he added : ' it 's difficult , especially when you see two young girls , their lives have been ripped away , brutally murdered
you ca n't get any rationale for that ... the act is so incredibly bad
