strict rules released by broadcaster itv for thursday 's night 's event spell out in minute detail who will speak when , and for how long , with host julie etchingham trying to keep order
lots have been drawn to decide the order in which each leader will speak , including the opening and closing statements and giving one - minute answers to the four studio audience questions lots have been drawn to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak
the agreed line up behind the podiums will be , from left to right : natalie bennett ( green ) , clegg ( lib dem ) , farage ( ukip ) , miliband ( labour ) , leanne wood ( plaid cymru ) , nicola sturgeon ( snp ) and cameron ( tory )
names drawn out of a hat also helped to decide who will get to speak first , with ms natalie bennett opening proceedings and mr cameron having the final word by giving the last closing remarks
the two - hour live debate will be be screened from 8pm to 10pm on thursday night
each leader will give an opening statement to a studio audience of around 200 people

there will be just four ' substantial election questions ' covered during the night
each leader will then give a closing statement to the cameras , before the programme ends at 10pm
itv newsreader julie etchingham will be keeping keep order as moderator during the debate on thursday night the seven - way debate is a long way from the 2010 contest , when mr clegg and mr cameron went up against labour prime minister gordon brown mr cameron will speak last , enabling him to have the last word
he is likely to repeat his refrain that a vote for anything other than a tory majority will mean ' chaos '
producers insist that the leaders will not see the questions in advance and an ' experienced editorial panel ' will select them
polling company icm has chosen the ' politically - balanced ' audience , with around 20 per cent said to be undecided voters
during the entire two - hour programme there will be just one advert break , a highly unusual move for britain 's biggest commercial broadcaster
the live programme is the only debate involving all of the main leaders scheduled for the campaign , after months of protracted negotiations between broadcasters and the parties
ukip 's farage today unveiled an anti-immigration poster in dover ( left ) while plaid cymru leader leanne wood launched the party 's manifesto in cardiff mr clegg , who emerged as the surprise winner of the 2010 debates , today said he was spending less time preparing for the contest this time
' i 'm not spending nearly as much time trying to think through every twist and turn , i 'm not preparing nearly quite as methodically as last time , ' he told reporters on his bright yellow battlebus
' the longer i 've been in politics the more i think you can over-think these things
and it will be very different - there 'll be seven of us
' the last time nobody knew who i was , so i had nothing to lose
in a sense this time i dont have much to lose either , as everyone appears to have their mind made up one way or the other
' i 'm not going to triumph in these debates - that 's just self - evident
what i learnt about the debates with farage is you might marshal the best arguments but if there are people who play better to the gallery they are going to do well
' i 've been in politics long enough to know its not a beauty contest and it tends to be the case that newcomers or people not well known to the public tend to do best , so i enter with quite sober realistic expectations
but i intend to enjoy it
in the driving seat : cameron today climbed behind the wheel of the 2 millionth mini off a production line in oxford ' i 'm not disillusioned , i think you just have to keep what debates can and cant do in perspective
' lib dem leader clegg boarded his plush battlebus to visit watford and cardiff as he continued campaigning snp leader nicola sturgeon , labour leader miliband and green leader natalie bennett complete the seven - strong line - up mr farage said he was disappointed to be placed near the middle of the line - up for the debates , rather than near mr cameron
speaking on a visit to the coastguard pub , close to the white cliffs of dover , mr farage said : ' i 'm disappointed that mr cameron is so far away from me but we 'll make the best of it
' in the run - up to the 2010 election there were three debates , in which mr cameron and mr clegg took on labour prime minister gordon brown
however , other parties including ukip and the greens demanded a slot , while mr cameron refused to take part in several debates once the campaign got underway
labour have accused the tory leader of being ' chicken ' for refusing to go up against mr miliband
on april 16 the bbc will host a ' challengers debate ' with only the leaders of opposition parties including labour , ukip , the snp , the greens and plaid cymru
then on april 30 there will be a special of bbc 's question time , with mr cameron , mr miliband and mr clegg appearing separately to answer questions from a studio audience
