phil jagielka has warned everton team - mate ross barkley that he will have to wait patiently for a place in england âs midfield
ross barkley was still only 19 years old when he made his england debut in september 2013 and set pulses racing with some of his performances for everton last season which earned him a place at last summer âs world cup in brazil
but this campaign the 21 - year - old has struggled for the same kind of form and , despite winning 10 england caps already , does not currently appear to be in roy hodgson âs first - team plans
ross barkley has been played in multiple positions for club and country and everton manager roberto martinez has experimented the most with him out on the wing , as an attacking central midfielder or further back in the middle
ross barkley may have to wait for his chance to impress with england , according to team - mate phil jagielka phil jagielka spoke on wednesday about his club team - mate 's progress in what has been a difficult season the everton skipper said he believed ross barkley would have to bide his time and wait for an opportunity â i think ross barkley will have to bide his time , â phil jagielka , who is his club captain , said
â and when he does get the opportunities for england , keep playing the way he has , keep playing well , keep being positive and hopefully when he gets that chance to play in two or three games on the spin , that is his chance keep the shirt and make it much harder for someone to take it off him
â it is difficult with the position he would try to get in the team in
we have got a fantastic amount of midfielders that come away with england and quite a lot who want to play in a similar position
â one player almost certain of a starting place in the crunch games is goalkeeper joe hart
after being dropped by city earlier in the season , he has worked his way back into guaranteed first pick
ross barkley has had a difficult season with everton after a brilliant breakthrough campaign last year that season resulted in a world cup call - up , and ross barkley looked a bright spark against costa rica earlier in england 's group , ross barkley congratulates wayne rooney after coming on against uruguay that culminated in his stand - out performance against barcelona , in which lionel messi described him as â phenomenal â even though he could not prevent city going out of the champions league
phil jagielka , ross barkley and the rest of their everton team - mates watched the match in kiev ahead of their europa league tie
â we were pretty much laughing at the performance from joe hart , â phil jagielka revealed
â it was just one of those nights
â it is sometimes difficult to get the accolades when you 're at a big team
it is normally the people scoring the goals and things like that , but when joe hart is needed he normally comes up trumps with some fantastic saves or some fantastic decisions in games
