penn has revealed that he watches propaganda beheading videos published by isis out of a sense of moral responsibility
the actor said he chooses to bear witness to the gruesome clips , in which americans , britons and kurdish have been graphically slaughtered , because ' real violence ' is often hidden from us
speaking to the daily telegraph , he said : ' the problem is we are not seeing enough of real violence
we are being anesthetized when you do n't see the horror of war
' ' real violence ' : penn , pictured left in his new film the gunman , said he watches isis 's propaganda videos showing hostages like james foley , right , being beheaded when asked whether he felt morally obliged to view the clips , he replied that he did
penn said that the graphic reality of the murder videos counteracts ' political correctness ' , which has led upsetting images from conflict such as that in iraq and afghanistan from being kept off - screen
he also mentioned the isis clips in relation to his own new movie , the gunman , which will feature graphic violence
penn said that staged violence in movies and the real violence such as that being perpetrated in iraq and syria are not the same thing
violence in movies : penn made a point of differentiating fictional violence , like that in his new film , above , from real - life acts by the likes of isis he said : ' anyone who sees them [ isis videos ] and claims that they were anaesthetised by violent movies , that they were n't horrified by what they saw , on the most primal level , is intellectually dishonest or existentially unpresent
' penn has voice his opinions about isis before - earlier this week he told conan o'brien that the terrorist organization was ' created ' by bush and cheney
beginning with former vice president cheney , whom he called ' an embittered bacteria [ sic ] of humanity ' , he said : ' these are the guys , he and president bush and some others , who invented daesh , or isis
' the video ends with three isis fighters pulling out their knives and beheading their prisoner
close up shots of the bloodied bodies are shown
he sarcastically added ' thanks for that '
meanwhile isis continues to produce and distribute sickening videos of its barbaric executions
its warped criminal justice system has given rise to footage of people thrown off buildings for being homosexual , and having hands amputated for other crimes
on friday its latest beheading video was released , showing the killing of three kurdish soldiers who had been taken prisoner .
