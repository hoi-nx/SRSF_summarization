the number of states offering same - sex marriages has surged since the u.s. supreme court 's ruling in 2013 that invalidated part of the federal defense of marriage act
states like illinois , hawaii , minnesota and new york joined the fold voluntarily , while others were ordered by state or federal judges to offer and recognize the unions
cases involving ohio , michigan , kentucky and tennessee are expected to be decided in june by the u.s. supreme court , which may settle the issue nationally once and for all
