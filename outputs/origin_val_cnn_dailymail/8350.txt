a niece of one of the victims of the germanwings crash is haunted by the ' atrocious ' thought that her uncle spent the last eight minutes of his life knowing he was going to die
sandrine driessens , niece of 59 - year - old belgian father and grandfather driessens , said that the thought was ' very hard '
' my uncle certainly knew that he was living his last moments and it 's very hard to hear that the descent of the aircraft lasted eight minute , ' she told la provence newspaper
he was killed when the a320 crashed in the alps on tuesday happy : although driessens ' niece said she was haunted by the idea that he knew he was going to die for eight minutes while the plane was descending , an aviation expert has said that it is more likely that the passengers and crew were calm and did not realise that they were in mortal danger ' for eight long minutes , he was dying
this is atrocious ! i dare not imagine the horror of parents who tried to protect their babies in this airplane
' but a veteran a320 pilot has said that the passengers would have been unlikely to know that they were going to die
if anything , he said , the plane would have been filled with ' eerie silence '
' it is likely that there was a problem with the pilots , as they put the plane into descent but failed to control it , ' said tony newton , who is also an examiner for british 's civil aviation authority
' the aircraft descended at fairly normal rate , in a fairly normal way
it was steep , but i have used steeper descents on a regular basis
it was well within the everyday operation and not in any way terrifying
' it is likely the oxygen masks were released , he said , and if passengers did not put them on quickly enough they may have lost consciousness
there also may have been ' unpleasant noises and wind effects ' , which may have caused some alarm
but the plane was not ' tumbling out of the sky in a screaming dive '
' the crew was probably sitting there waiting for the pilot to complete the descent , ' he said
' there was probably no indication to passengers of what the end was going to be
' there may have been some panic when they saw the mountains coming up through the windows , but it would have been brief
' either way , in my experience , passengers tend to stay absolutely silent during an emergency
' it 's not a hollywood panic , it 's an eerie silence
' mr driessens , born in kinshasha , had returned to belgian in 1960 and lived in couvin and mons
after meeting his catalan born wife , monserat domingo , the couple settled down in palleja , 25 km from barcelona
they had three sons aged 17 to 31 , and three grandchildren
' he was a wonderful man who loved his family above all , ' said ms sandrine driessens
' for more than 30 years he travelled almost weekly in his job
but in this family we 're birds
