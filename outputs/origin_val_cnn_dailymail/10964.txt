adem basharan explained the dog learned his name after just one day
over the past year adem basharan has dedicated his time to training the well behaved hound who has a dedicated following on social media sites such as facebook , twitter , youtube and instagram
ziggy 's facebook page has garnered nearly 17,000 likes with an impressive 210,000 views counted on his youtube video ' ziggy trixx-play dead-staffy 's hilarious reaction to being " shot " '
adem basharan said : ' ziggy has always picked things up really quickly - for example it only took a few days for him to learn how to ride a skateboard , but learning to say hello took much longer
' recently we have focused on teaching him routines rather than new tricks and we reward him with positive reinforcement - praise , love , cuddles and of course treats and toys
surprisingly , ziggy is actually the first dog adem basharan has owned or trained
the talented pooch learnt his own name in just one day apart from the basic commands such as sitting or shaking hands , ziggy 's first trick was playing dead which he now has down to a fine art ziggy and adem have amazed crowds in southend-on-sea with their street performances ' other than general commands such as sit , lay down and paw etc , his first trick was to play dead which has become quite a crowd pleaser
' it 's impossible for me to choose a favourite trick - i think i 'd have to say both his skateboarding trick and playing dead
' the street performer is also hoping ziggy 's impressive talents will help to disprove public stereotypes that staffordshire bull terriers are a dangerous breed
the duo are now focusing on routines rather than individual tricks as they expand ziggy 's skills the street performer is hoping ziggy 's talents will help to disprove public stereotypes that staffordshire bull terriers are a dangerous breed adem basharan said : ' a lot of people judge staffies and think that the breed is dangerous
but this is not true , they are no more dangerous than any other breed of dog
' staffordshire bull terriers are very intelligent , loving and loyal - but sadly this does n't stop people mistreating or abandoning them
' most rescue centres are filled with unwanted staffies and they are having difficulty re-homing them
' the breed gets a lot of negative speculation which definitely does not help the situation and people may not want to adopt them , and as a result many are being put down
if people stopped judging them and started helping them , it would really make a difference and prevent so many good dogs being put to sleep
