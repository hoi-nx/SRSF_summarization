former everton and man united boss moyes believes failure in europe has exposed declining standards in the premier league
moyes is manager of spain side real sociedad , a job he took up in november
he has been linked with a return to england with west ham , where sam allardyce remains in charge , but appears comfortable in la liga
former everton and man united boss moyes says the premier league is n't what it once was real sociedad 's moyes says the premier league now is ' probably the poorest i 've seen in a long , long time ' while spain sides have flourished in europe this season their premier league counterparts have struggled , with none left in the champions league or europa league after arsenal , manchester city , chelsea and everton bowed out this month
moyes said on bbc radio five live 's sportsweek programme : ' it 's not been too long ago where we were looked at as probably having the best teams , and it does change
' chelsea , manchester city , arsenal are all exceptional teams in their own right and they 'll be disappointed they went out , and maybe on another day they 'd have gone through
' it 's just becoming a wee bit of a habit that we 're not getting our teams quite as close to the final as we had in the past
moyes shakes hands with lionel messi of barcelona , one of the spain teams flourishing in europe he says chelsea ( here bowing out of the champions league to psg ) , along with manchester city and arsenal ' are all exceptional teams ' but that the premier league might be talked up more than it deserves to be ' i think this year you 'd have to say it 's probably the poorest premier league i 've seen in a long , long time
' maybe we do go over the top and recently we have maybe talked up the premier league more than what it 's actually been
there 's other leagues which are certainly now comparable
' moyes expects to return to the premier league , but not in the near future
' i think someday i will , ' he said
' i 've left when i did n't expect to be leaving but what i 've taken on is a great job
' i love working in spain
