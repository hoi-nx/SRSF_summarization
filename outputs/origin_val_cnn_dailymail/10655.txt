suarez paid back another huge chunk of his transfer fee at the nou camp with the goal that won the el clasico â and quite possibly the spanish league title for barcelona
running on to a long pass forward by alves , suarez took the ball brilliantly in his stride and , with both sergio ramos and pepe closing in , he found iker casillas â far corner with well - struck shot
' it 's the most important goal i have scored for the club so far , ' he said
' and of course it means even more because of who it was against
i tried to make the most of the space i found between the defenders and to get the shot away as quickly as i could

but he added : ' there is still a long way to go and we know it will be difficult
we have to make the most of the advantage we now have
but we know we ca n't relax especially against a rival as strong as real madrid
' jubilant barca coach luis enrique praised suarez saying : â he finished the goal like very few players can
he is a striker who can score goals like this , but he is also technical enough to play the football we play and physical enough to compliment the other players in the side
we signed him for nights like this
â the game looked to be slipping away from barcelona after they were made to suffer in the first half
luis enrique admitted : â the goal calmed us down a lot in the second half
it âs a big a win against our eternal rival but we have a lot of difficult games to go before the league is won
' the win means more because this is a very good real madrid side
â until suarez struck the night had belonged to cristiano ronaldo , who responded to a week of global adulation for messi by equalising in the first half to silence the nou camp after jeremy mathieu opened the scoring
cristiano ronaldo âs every touch was booed â even from his first run down the left inside 60 seconds
it only took messi 10 minutes to mark up his first nutmeg , sending the ball through toni kroos â legs , but it was real with a pumped - up cristiano ronaldo who made much of the early running and he hit the bar from benzema âs cross
at the other end , pepe and suarez clashed and barcelona were awarded a free - kick
messi took it and , powering in ahead of sergio ramos , jeremy mathieu headed past iker casillas for his first barcelona goal
the hosts should have doubled their lead but neymar made a mess of a suarez assist and they paid the price as real madrid scored with their next attack
luka modric played the ball to benzema , the frenchman âs flick found cristiano ronaldo in space and he swept the ball past bravo
suarez was booked for leaving his foot in on pepe , who had already gone in late on the uruguayan
jeremy mathieu headed barcelona into the lead at the nou camp with 19 minutes played in the la liga showdown the frenchman got in front of real madrid defender sergio ramos to head his team into the lead at the nou camp real madrid goalkeeper iker casillas watches on as jeremy mathieu 's header in the 19th minute finds the back of his net jeremy mathieu celebrates with his barcelona team - mates after giving his team the lead in el clasico cristiano ronaldo and gerard pique challenge for the ball in the air while ivan rakitic attempts to hold off gareth bale in the area as cristiano ronaldo watches on barcelona were hanging on before half - time and gareth bale thought he had scored from cristiano ronaldo âs flicked header â only for the goal to be disallowed because the portuguese was offside
five minutes into the second half benzema almost put real ahead after a fine move but was somehow denied by bravo
suarez had been quiet since his booking in the first half but , when alves played him through with a brilliant first touch , he controlled the ball inside the area and rifled into the far corner
cristiano ronaldo levelled the scores for real madrid just before half - time at the nou camp when he prodded the ball into the back of the net cristiano ronaldo runs away to celebrate after beating barcelona goalkeeper bravo to draw real madrid level the portuguese forward is congratulated by toni kroos and dani carvajal after his equaliser in the first half cristiano ronaldo had earlier rattled the crossbar of bravo with his volley from a cross at the far post there was still work to do and barcelona desperately needed the third goal
neymar should have scored it twice but both times shot wide , with suarez better placed on the first occasion
suarez could also have scored again wriggling away from dani carvajal only to pull his shot wide
real madrid kept going forward and as with the very first chance of the second period benzema was denied by bravo
jordi alba then steamed through on to a messi pass only for the ball to be cleared for a corner
from the kick suarez sent a shot high over iker casillas â bar
it now seemed as if barcelona were chasing the late goal and the spain keeper again saved from messi
suarez restored barcelona 's lead early in the second half with a clinical finish past iker casillas into the bottom corner real madrid goalkeeper iker casillas was left with no chance by the barcelona striker 's clinical finish into the bottom corner uruguayan striker suarez celebrates scoring barcelona 's second goal to give them the lead again in el clasico suarez celebrates his first goal in el clasico since moving to spain from liverpool in the summer of 2014 there were 11 bookings on the night and javier mascherano and cristiano ronaldo clattered into each other midway through the second half
but the game was more ' crash bang wallop ' than containing any of the bad blood of previous meetings
suarez thrives in games this frenetic and in that sense it was no surprise his contribution was decisive
he may even have decided the title race
real madrid coach ancelotti said : â the league is more difficult now
we have to keep going and play as we did in the first half for 90 minutes
i do nât think we made any mistakes when you have suarez against you then he can do that
he finds the space and when the right pass comes he can finish
our heads are down but we still have a lot to play for
