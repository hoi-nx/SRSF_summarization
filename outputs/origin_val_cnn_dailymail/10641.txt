juve general director giuseppe marotta said : ' there are many suitors for paul pogba , but we do not want to open negotiations and we want him to stay with us
' that said if clubs offer Â£ 55m it will be difficult for the italians to reject
chances : 4/5 former united midfielder paul pogba has become one of the world 's best midfielders at juve the italians insist paul pogba is not for sale but an offer in excess of Â£ 55m could prove too tempting kevin de bruyne wolfsburg Â£ 35m has grown into one of the best midfielders in europe on current form

the belgian could prove to be one of jose mourinho 's biggest mistakes
