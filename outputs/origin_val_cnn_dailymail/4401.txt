stella mccartney has long held the torch for the ethical treatment of animals in fashion and food
the fashion designer uses no animal products in her designs and has been a vegetarian since childhood , a lifestyle that was championed by her mother linda and father paul
but the 43 - year - old is now calling on fellow consumers to pay more attention to what goes into their meals and garments - by thinking about that final product came from

the designer is calling on consumers to be more aware of where their food and fashion comes from in a new interview with the business of fashion ( bof ) magazine , she said : ' the consumption of animals - whether you 're wearing them or eating them - is extraordinarily damaging to the planet
' there are over a billion animals killed a year for food , half of which do n't even get eaten
and there 's over 50 million animals killed just for fashion
' ' if you 're mindful of how you 're approaching your life , then you see the connection
you ca n't avoid the connection
' the connection between food , illness , environment
i want to see everything as a whole , so that 's how i approach life , and that 's how it comes into my business
' at the start of her fashion career , many criticised stella mccartney - who helped kick off the vegetarian movement meat free mondays with her father - for her refusal to produce and clothes with leather , fur or feathers
but while the mother - of - four is something of a pioneer in ethical high fashion , she concedes that finding high - quality substitutes is a challenge

one of the hardest things is to design something that is desirable and then to take that design and make it in a way that is not conventional
' we âre sourcing our own material , developing our own material - we âre not using pvc
â and , ahead of a lecture she is holding with the magazine tonight in london , stella mccartney said she even feels the need to apologise to her designers for the limitations of using non-leather alternatives
