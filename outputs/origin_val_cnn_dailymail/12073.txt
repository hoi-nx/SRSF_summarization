chelsea supporters are planning their own statement against racism during the second leg of their champions league encounter with psg
instead of the usual array of banners and flags which are draped around stamford bridge at home games , there will be only one on display during wednesday 's game : a small cross of st george with the chelsea badge and the message ' blues against racism '
the flag was made by lifelong supporter phil and inspired by his 18 - year - old daughter jodie in response to the incident filmed on the paris metro ahead of the first leg against psg , when some chelsea fans sang about being racist as they refused to let a black man on the train
lifelong chelsea supporter phil stands next to the flag he had made ahead of the psg clash phil and his daughter jodie were motivated to do it by the incident that took place in paris in february ' my daughter was very upset by what happened in paris and it has tainted the image of chelsea fans everywhere , ' said phil. ' we thought it was important to do something positive and show psg and the rest of the world that is not what chelsea fans are like
' the flag , which phil and jodie took to the capital one cup final at wembley , will hang behind the goal in the matthew harding stand during the game against psg , a last - 16 tie poised at 1 - 1 after the first - leg
after the racist incident on the paris metro , last month , two other incidents of racist chanting involving chelsea fans which have been reported to police
one occurred on a eurostar train as supporters returned to london from paris and another on a train from london euston to manchester after the capital one cup final
