if you thought you had seen it all then prepare to be mistaken
instagram personality irina goncharova has trained a slow loris to hold onto a metal pole and well ... pole dance
featured in a video , the slow loris swivels around the long pole in front of some rather fetching leopard print wallpaper
this slow loris is just the performer in a humorous video released on instagram the wide - eyed primate wears a cross between a nappy and a pair of shorts with what appears to have a fruit print on it
and actually picks up speed while spinning , becoming undoubtedly dizzy
stopping to catch its breath , the primate then swivels back in the other direction before climbing further up the pole
the primate makes sure to keep a firm grip on the pole as it entertains its crowd the video then switches to another shot of the slow loris pole dancing on a separate occasion
still wearing its interesting underpants , the primate this time performs in front of a different wallpapered backdrop
before showing off by turning upside down and continuing to spin
according to ruptly , the slow loris has become increasingly popular as a pet among people who adore it for its cute behaviour and large eyes
the slow loris shows off a fancy pair of underpants in a separate performance no stone is left unturned as the slow loris goes upside down to the delight of the filmmaker but unfortunately this has caused many problems and is considered to be , alongside deforestation , the main threat to the species
the international union for conservation of nature estimates well over half of the slow loris population is either endangered , at risk or vulnerable
the video of the pole dancing slow loris was captured in perm , russia .
