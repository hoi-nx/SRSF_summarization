mr hope , of sunderland , tyne and wear , put his son down for a nap on sunday february 8 , believing he was recovering from a bout of chickenpox
but when he woke for his lunch , layton was having difficulty breathing and his temperature was soaring
mr hope , an optical lab technician , said : ' we took him to sunderland royal hospital where he had blood tests done and were told he had an infection of some sort , but that antibiotics could n't be administered until it was clear exactly what was wrong
' layton was administered to the ward for observation and was going to be kept in overnight , but he died before the morning
' it all happened so quickly
' it felt like one minute we were in a&e and he was mumbling away and reaching his arms out to me - not his normal self but not like a child who only had hours to live - and the next he was gone
' for most children , chickenpox - which causes a red itchy spots that crust over to form scabs - is a mild illness that gets better on its own
but one in 100 chickenpox patients suffer complications from the virus
around 95 per cent of children catch chickenpox before the age of 16 , and for most it 's a mild illness leading to itching , blisters and sometimes a high temperature
it 's caused by the varicella - zoster virus and is highly contagious , usually lasting a week to ten days
in an estimated one per cent of cases , though , serious complications can develop such as pneumonia , meningitis , encephalitis ( inflammation of the brain ) , inflammation of the heart and toxic shock , a type of blood poisoning - all usually down to impaired immunity
doctors advise parents to contact a gp straight away if your child develops any abnormal symptoms , such as : mr hope left the ward at around 8pm to see to his other children : james , three , skye , six , brooke , nine , and reese , 11 , but at 10.30pm he got a call from his wife begging him to come to the hospital
he said : ' she was saying she was scared and that there were all sorts of things going on , tubes and needles everywhere and she wanted me there
' then a nurse took the phone and told me i should come back to the hospital if at all possible
' we lost him just hours after that
' around 95 per cent of children catch chickenpox before the age of 16
for most , it 's a mild illness leading to itching , blisters and sometimes a high temperature
it is caused by the varicella - zoster virus and is highly contagious , usually lasting a week to ten days
however , in an estimated one per cent of cases , serious complications can develop such as pneumonia , meningitis , encephalitis ( inflammation of the brain ) , inflammation of the heart and toxic shock , a type of blood poisoning - all usually down to impaired immunity
experts have calculated that complications may result in 6,700 children 's hospital admissions a year in the uk
layton 's family , who are struggling to cope with his death , want other parents to take chicken pox more seriously
mr hope said : ' most people would n't even take their child to the doctors if they had chickenpox
' it 's such a common thing and we all expect it to come and go quickly
layton was put down for a nap on sunday february 8th but when his father checked on him later on he had a soaring temperature and difficulty breathing
he died the next morning in hospital chickenpox is normally a mild childhood illness but serious complications can occur in an estimated one per cent of cases ' some parents even wish that their child would get the illness , so that it is " out of the way " but now even the mention of chicken pox sends a shiver down my spine
' of course it 's incredibly rare for chicken pox to kill a child , it 's obviously not impossible and i just wish something could have been done to help him
' miss boys , who is a full - time mother , said that she is still in shock and does n't know how to respond to the death of her son
she said : ' we were there when they stopped trying to resuscitate layton and it was heartbreaking for us both
' i remember turning to the nurse and asking her why i was n't crying , she said i was in shock , i think i still am
' my son james has lost his best friend and all the kids are up and down
' it was skye 's birthday yesterday and she said that she wished layton could have had some cake
' we are trying to continue on but every time we find ourselves feeling anything but complete despair we feel guilty
' the family are now fundraising to take their other children on holiday to deal with the grief of their loss
mr hope said : ' skye 's birthday was really difficult and although we wo n't ever go back to " normal " i want the kids to know that there are still good days that will happen in the future
' if we could just get them away for a little while to relax and play it would do them the world of good
