barrington , new hampshire u.s. sen. ted cruz was delivering his normal rhetoric during a new hampshire speech on sunday , hitting the current administration on the economy , obamacare and national security
" and the obama - clinton foreign policy of leading from behind -- the whole world is on fire , " the senator from texas declared
but he was stopped by a 3 - year - old girl sitting in the front row
" the world is on fire ? " she yelled out
ted cruz took it and ran with it
" the world is on fire -- yes ! your world is on fire , " he exclaimed , seizing the moment as the crowd burst out into laughter
" but you know what ? your mommy 's here and everyone 's here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better
" the scene -- while cute -- captured ted cruz 's determination to remain unwavering in his views and language , never backtracking
there was no " just kidding " or " that was only a metaphor " to assuage the little girl
instead , the first - term senator continued with his speechifying and used the moment to illustrate his point that while things are bad now , they could get better -- especially , cough cough , if he becomes president
a woman who identified herself as the child 's mother named michelle later told the wrko 's kuhner report that her child 's reaction came in a " high question kind of voice , " but that her daughter was " quite happy " in the aftermath
" she really , basically was like ' oh , oh , this is a great man
' he 's the firefighter in her mind as a three - year - old
and was quite happy and she wanted a cookie
" ted cruz is bringing the resolute disruptor brand that he 's built in congress out on the trail as he lays the groundwork for a white house bid
this weekend , he was on a two - day swing through new hampshire , stopping sunday afternoon at an event put on by the strafford county gop
in the same way ted cruz challenges establishment republicans in the senate , he 's trying to build a campaign that breaks from the mold and showcases his firebrand conservatism
for example , his first question from the audience came from a woman who wanted to know how ted cruz was going to make campaign finance reform a reality , a huge issue in the first - in - the - nation primary state
but ted cruz argued that not only is money a form of speech , it emboldens speech
" the answer is not to muzzle citizens ; it 's to empower citizens across the country , " he said
throwing a bone to his questioner , however , he said he supports requiring that campaign donations be disclosed
he took the same steadfast approach last weekend in iowa , when he and other contenders were asked about the ethanol mandate requiring that gasoline contain a certain amount of ethanol -- a popular regulation in iowa where corn is king
while nearly every other potential candidate expressed at least some measure of support for the mandate , ted cruz flatly opposed it , saying in front of close to a thousand iowa farmers that he does n't think the government should be involved in the private sector
gov. walker , who 's vying with bush for frontrunner status , said he supported the mandate in iowa , despite previously opposing it in his home state of wisconsin asked by reporters sunday about accusations that walker is a flip - flopper , ted cruz first praised his potential rival but made sure to mention that candidates need to be challenged on their actions
" it 's easy for candidates to give an answer , " he said , but added : " the proof is in the pudding
what i 've urged republicans to ask of every candidate is : have you walked the walk ? show me your record
" ted cruz got heavy applause when he said he wanted to " repeal every word of common core , " a set of testing standards that bush staunchly defended when he appeared at a nearby event in dover , new hampshire just two days earlier
common core , however , was not legislation approved by congress
rather , it was created by a bipartisan group of governors and state leaders , and states received financial incentives by the government to adopt the standards
still , ted cruz played somewhat coy with his white house aspirations , aware of the tight federal regulations that would start holding contenders to different standards once they admit they 're running for president
when voters pressed him sunday to make a white house bid , ted cruz told them to " stay tuned
" " i 'm looking at it very , very seriously , " he told the audience
" i would point out a week ago i was in iowa , yesterday i was in south carolina , and today i 'm in new hampshire
" but he truly charmed the crowd when he said that after he and his wife got their daughters a puppy recently , one of the girls gave her approval for ted cruz 's presidential aspirations
" if you win , that means snowflake will finally get a backyard to pee in , " his daughter said , according to ted cruz
in terms of energy and turnout , sunday 's event stood out from other events held by potential white house contenders who were in new hampshire this weekend , in part because it was open to the public , unlike other events headlined by walker and bush
his remarks were met with boisterous applause , and he was frequently urged to run for president by people who shook his hand before and after the event
halfway through ted cruz 's remarks , a small - business owner in the audience was called on to ask a question but instead stood up proudly next to the senator and went off into a two - minute rant about how other republican in washington are n't representing their conservative constituents
" it is d-day in u.s. folks , " he said , getting the crowd on their feet
" we ca n't wait for another republican
" the man said his wife wrote a blank check for ted cruz and pulled out his wallet , only to throw it on the ground at ted cruz 's feet
" for those who believe in miracles , this gentleman just threw his wallet at a politician , " ted cruz said , getting a big laugh from the crowd
" and he actually got it back
" ted cruz could not accept the money because he 's not yet a candidate
one man , higgins , stood outside in the snow for four hours hoping ted cruz would meet his goat named izak , an apparent fixture on the campaign trail which was wearing a hat that said " i voted " and who happened to bite jon huntsman in 2011
ted cruz waved hello at higgins as the senator exited the building sunday afternoon but did n't stop to greet the goat
" he 'll be back again , " higgins said , trying to appear unfazed
" i 'm sure he wants to get to his next stop
