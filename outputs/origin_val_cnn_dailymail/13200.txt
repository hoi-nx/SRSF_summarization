the prospect of a palestinian state is nil so long as prime minister benjamin netanyahu stays in office , benjamin netanyahu said in a monday interview
asked by an interviewer with the israel news site , nrg , if it was true that a palestinian nation would never be formed while he 's prime minister , benjamin netanyahu replied , " indeed
" his interview with nrg came as he courted conservative supporters a day before israel head to the polls for national elections
" anyone who is going to establish a palestinian state , anyone who is going to evacuate territories today , is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical islam against israel , " he said
" this is the true reality that was created here in the last few years
" benjamin netanyahu went on to say that any opponents on the left who might argue otherwise are " sticking their head in the sand , time and time again
" he further said a strong government led by his likud is necessary to beat back international pressure to divide jerusalem and return israel to its pre- 1967 borders , according to a jewish report on the nrg interview
" i do not give in , " benjamin netanyahu told nrg
" we stood fast against huge pressure , and we will continue to do so
" following benjamin netanyahu 's interview , chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat , who is also a member of the executive committee of the palestine liberation organization , said the israel prime minister 's stance is nothing new
" benjamin netanyahu has done everything possible to bury the two - state solution , " he said
" benjamin netanyahu 's statement at the illegal settlement of har homa is a response to all those governments who tried to block palestinian diplomatic initiatives
he could n't have done that without counting on full impunity from the international community
now the world must learn its lesson and understand that impunity wo n't bring peace , only justice will
" earlier in the day , benjamin netanyahu continued his efforts to drum up support during a campaign speech in the har homa neighborhood of jerusalem , which he boasted that he helped establish in 1997 , during his first prime ministerial term
israel considers har homa part of a unified jerusalem , while palestinian consider the neighborhood an illegal settlement
if he is re-elected , benjamin netanyahu said , he will continue to promote construction in jerusalem as a means of national security , he said
" the pressure around this decision back then was enormous
but i insisted -- i ordered the construction and it paid off , " he said
" today , har homa is a flourishing neighborhood in which tens of thousands of israel civilians are living
as we proved in the past , my friends in the likud and i , we will keep jerusalem protected and keep developing it
" opposition leaders herzog and livni of the zionist union , he alleged , are " ready to surrender to every dictate
" livni , he said , has denounced previous calls for more construction in jerusalem 's jewish neighborhoods , while herzog would strive to establish a palestinian capital in jerusalem
" i will not let that happen , " he said
" my friends and i in the likud will keep jerusalem united in all its parts , and we will keep fortifying it so that dividing it will not be possible and it will always remain united
we will keep developing our eternal capital
" a vote for herzog or livni is a vote for the establishment of " hamastan , " benjamin netanyahu said , referring to hamas , the islamist group which dominates gaza
he further alleged that his opponents would yield to international pressure and " huge financial support coming from abroad , from left - leaning tycoons and foreign governments
" he closed his speech saying , " the meaning of this is simple : we will not be able to keep israel safe and secure and the terror against us that once emerged through these hills with machine guns will turn into missile fire
