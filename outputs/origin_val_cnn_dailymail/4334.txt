pete lynes , chairman of brockenhurst , told mailonline : ' i heard about it on the day itself and at first i did n't believe it
' but when i went down i saw the damage to the post and i immediately telephoned the manufacturers to see if they would be able to provide replacements
' but they could not deliver new ones until the middle of next week , so we had to call the game off
it 's just one of those things
