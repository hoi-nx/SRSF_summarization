not many people were more excited for the first day of spring - weather in sync or not - than jillian tenen
the 29 - year - old events planner moved to boston from florida two years ago and does n't have any family in town
when the first of many record - breaking snowfalls dumped down on the city in january , jillian tenen was sick with the flu , and did n't dig out her 2007 honda civic
only the snow did n't stop , and the street plows only pushed more mounds in and around where her car was parked in bay village
by the time jillian tenen got her shovel out , it was all - but too late
' i 'm 5 ' 2 , ' and it was all ice , an iceberg on top of my car , ' jillian tenen told the boston globe
' i could n't reach it
i could n't lift it
and even if i could , there was nowhere to put it
i just did n't know what to do
' after a few laughs , quite a lot of tears , and at lease one breakdown , jillian tenen realized she had no choice but to abandon her car until winter passed
it 's under the iceberg : jillian tenen was sick with the flu during the first big snow of winter in boston in winter , and after failing to dig out her car , it ended up under this mountain of snow on isabella street in the bay village neighborhood there it is : recently , some of the ' iceberg ' began to clear and the car - or at least its shape - became a little more clear not again : but with this winter being boston 's snowiest ever , the heavens kept opening and the car kept getting buried bleak : jillian tenen 's car is seen parked on isabella street in boston on february 23 , 2015
winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of boston 's history clearing up : jillian tenen 's car went through weeks of storms and melting snow , staying frozen in place at the same on - street parking spot almost there : by last week - march 12 - and after two months almost , the honda civic was almost ready to escape its cave finally ! : on march 16 , jillian tenen 's was finally back on the road , seven weeks after it was first snowed in yay ! all - smiles , jillian tenen finally got behind the wheel of her car on march 18 , and was shocked that it started right away but after seven weeks , and a heap of chipping , the car has finally freed from its icy cave
sadly not much could be done about the damage
the windscreen buckled under the weight of the snow and is all smashed up
there were also deep dents in the roof
but , surprisingly , the car started on the first go after it had thawed
jillian tenen said her insurance company will now assess the damage
while she hopes that future winters wo n't be so severe , and will plow her car diligently from now on , she learnt a valuable lesson
' if i had to do it again , i would definitely do one thing differently , ' she told the globe
' i would not park on the corner
' although the storm did n't cripple boston as previous storms have , it still created a nuisance for snow - weary residents damage : the weight of the snow and ice smashed the windscreen and dented the roof quite badly , but jillian tenen is filing an insurance claim many people in the northeastern us had to put on winter boots as winter storm ultima hijacked the first official day of spring the brooklyn was coated with snow as new york city was hit with yet another snowstorm on friday , march 20 brooklyn residents had to bundle up and deal with the cold even though friday was the first day of spring spring arrived on friday , but winter storm ultima ensured that winter would have at least one more go around with snow snow will continue to fall in some parts of the country throughout the weekend winter storm ultima may have cause more issues for jillian tenen and her car on friday
although the storm did n't cripple the city as previous storms have , it still created a nuisance for snow - weary boston
in the city , it 's par for the course to pick up another 3 to 4 inches of snow after march 20 , weather.com reported
during the april fools ' blizzard of 1997 , 25.4 inches of snow in just 24 hours paralyzed boston
on friday , ultima led to some travel advisories and early school dismissals weather.com meteorologist jon erdman said : ' while late march surface temperatures and winter storm ultima 's quick movement wo n't make this a blockbuster , some fairly impressive snowfall rates today will likely lead to at least a slushy afternoon commute in parts of the new york city and philadelphia metros
the storm dumped 7.3 inches of snow in lynnport , pennsylvania , 6.7 inches at mcguire air force base in new jersey and six inches in cascade , maryland .
