fellaini has endured a lot since swapping merseyside for manchester
derided as a symbol of the david moyes regime , ridiculed by his own fans and , lately , held responsible for louis van gaal âs occasional lurch towards route - one football , the big belgian has had more weighing on his shoulders than that trademark mass of curly hair
so the standing ovation he received from the majority of manchester united supporters when he came off against tottenham at old trafford last weekend will have been music to his ears
fellaini fires manchester united into the lead against tottenham , a reminder of his footballing ability the belgian trains ahead of manchester united 's crucial clash with liverpool on sunday , where he is sure to be involved fellaini has grown from a bit - part player last season to become a vital member of louis van gaal 's squad a well - taken opening goal with his left foot served as a reminder that fellaini âs attributes are not just sandwiched between his chest and his head
there are those who will never accept that he is a true manchester united player , who believe his very presence encourages manchester united to play other than the manchester united way
but as he prepares to make his first appearance on merseyside since moving from everton when van gaal âs side take on liverpool on sunday , the 6ft 4in midfielder has every right to feel that things are looking up
the Â£ 27.5million white elephant of old trafford has been reinvented as manchester united âs not - so - secret weapon
the advanced role that van gaal has given to fellaini led sam allardyce , of all people , to label his opponents â long ball united â after the 27 - year - old âs introduction off the bench helped salvage a 1 - 1 draw at west ham last month
fellaini starred in the 3 - 0 win over liverpool at old trafford in december , and offers van gaal an alternative wayne rooney celebrates with the big belgian , who has scored five times for manchester united this season fellaini was tainted , somewhat unfairly , by being the only signing made during david moyes ' summer in charge van gaal does nât care
â fellaini is a player that , when we can not beat the pressure with quality , we can always beat with pressure â that is a quality , â says the dutchman
the transition from defensive midfielder , who first impressed david moyes playing for standard liege against liverpool in the champions league in 2008 , to target man worked particularly well for everton
but , unlike van gaal , david moyes did not feel comfortable deploying fellaini in a similar role at old trafford , having drawn enough criticism merely for signing him when cesc fabregas was his priority in the summer of 2013
disastrously , fellaini ended up as manchester united âs only signing and david moyes knew that he risked being accused of turning the premier league champions into a poor imitation of everton
the player was said to be ecstatic at signing for manchester united , if a little overawed at the scale of the club
he struck up an immediate bond with fellow belgian adnan januzaj and , later , juan mata , when the spaniard joined the following january
by then it had all started to go wrong , a combination of injuries and sub-standard performances in a more defensive position confirming the fears of many manchester united supporters
last april , the now - defunct fanzine red issue mocked up an advert of his afro hair as a toilet brush with the slogan : â flush a fortune down the pan â
since the arrival of van gaal , the midfielder has been used as an outlet and a way of breaking teams down the belgian was given a rousing applause when he was replaced after a good performance against tottenham fellaini was said to be devastated by it all , and even more so when david moyes was sacked later that month
he felt isolated and has since claimed that he was made a scapegoat for the club âs decline
one thing that never waned , however , was fellaini âs determination to salvage his dream
when he returned from the world cup last summer he held talks with van gaal , who reassured him that he would not be sold despite talk of a move to napoli
the message had not reached manchester united fans , some of whom sarcastically applauded fellaini âs every touch in van gaal âs first home game against valencia right up until the moment he scored a last - minute winner
even then , it was assumed that his first goal for manchester united would be his last
five more have followed this season
fellaini came off the bench at half - time to turn the game at west brom in october and again at qpr in january
in between , he started in six successive wins before christmas , ending with a comprehensive 3 - 0 win over liverpool when he destroyed his old merseyside rivals
while david moyes seemed loathe to play fellaini off the striker , van gaal has returned him to his best role fellaini may suit slightly more ' long ball ' football , but has shown he can be mighty effective for manchester united now fellaini is set to face them again on sunday having won over at least some of his critics , much to the admiration of neville , his former everton team - mate and manchester united âs first - team coach under david moyes
â last season fellaini was getting ridiculed and the way he has come back from that has been fantastic , â said neville
â he âs won people over by being brave about the stick he was getting and never going missing in games , even when things were not working for him
â you also have to give louis van gaal credit
he has not been afraid of playing to fellaini âs strengths despite being criticised for doing so
i think he has come up trumps
