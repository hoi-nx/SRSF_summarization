' i think it could definitely be the toughest test for me and jared , ' said henshaw of the challenge against jamie roberts and jonathan davies
' wales are very direct but also they run decoy lines with jamie roberts coming up , only to throw it out the back and go wide
the centre scored a crucial try during their victory of six nations rivals england at the aviva stadium ' it 's going to test us big - time , so we 've got to be prepared and stay connected in defence , and just keep our communication up all day

d'arcy and brian o'driscoll set a world record 55 - test centre partnership in their wide - ranging careers

henshaw has vowed he and jared ' wo n't hold back ' however , buoyed by his first test try that clinched ireland 's 19 - 9 victory over england on march 1
' this wales team is absolutely not past its peak , ' said henshaw
' the fact that they are at home and that they play their best rugby at the millennium , they 're going to cause a massive threat for us
' so we 're going to have to be squeaky clean on the day in terms of our discipline and we 're going to have to take all the chances we get
henshaw knows he 's in for a tough afternoon when he comes up against the experienced jamie roberts wales centre jonathan davies ( centre ) has formed an impressive partnership with jamie roberts over the years ' it might be more open than the england game , but we want to stick to our game plan and follow through on what the coaches want from us
' it 's not going to be more than a two - score game though
' they are not predictable either : they have a lot of different options available to them with dan biggar at 10
' he gives them a good attacking threat and good aerial skills in the team
' we 're just going to have to be prepared for anything
' i think the welsh centre partnership is up there with one of the best in the world
sexton ( left ) is ireland 's danger man with some labeling him as the best fly half in the world ' they have a really physical threat and massive size in that 10 , 12 channel from jamie roberts , and then a very good ball player and direct runner in jonathan davies
' they are going to test us big - time this week but we are fully prepared for what they are going to throw at us
' we 'll have to get off the line quickly in defence and shut down their space and options as early as we can
' we 'll look to get into them early , and we wo n't hold back
head coach joe schmidt ( centre ) is closing in on winning the grand slam with ireland once again ' i 'm constantly learning , growing into it more and more , getting a bit more confident with every game , especially with jared outside and johnny ( sexton ) inside
' we 're building a good relationship there , so at the moment we 're just looking to build on recent performances
' we 're feeding off each other at the moment , learning little bits all the time , and growing too
