' the procession was able to get past and that was it
after the procession came by [ the car 's owner ] jumped in his car and moved it out of the way before the hearse came down
' no one is sure exactly how many officers pitched in or from which departments they came
' there were so many , ' hart told nbc philly
' they just came over , grabbed a piece of the car and they moved it
i do n't even know where they were from
