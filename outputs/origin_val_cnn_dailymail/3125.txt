step out onto the surface of the planet 30 ari b in daylight and you would see not one , not two , not three suns in the sky - but a remarkable four stars , all of which are in its system
the amazing discovery , the second of its kind , suggests that planets in four - star systems are much more common in the universe than thought
and studying the system could reveal the effect multiple stars can have on a planet - and whether they make them more likely to turn into ' hot jupiters '
nasa astronomers in california have found a planet in a multi-star system
30 ari b ( illustration shown ) has four stars in its system - two sets of binary stars
in this image the primary star is in the foreground and its companion to the left , while the planet is in the middle and the other two stars are top right the planet , studied by an international team of scientists led by nasa 's jpl ( jpl ) , had previously been known to exist
however , scientists had thought the planetary system had three stars - not four
the newfound four - star planetary system , called 30 aries , is located 136 light - years away in the constellation aries
the primary star is known as 30 ari b ( upper case ) , and the planet is 30 ari b ( lower case )
the system 's gaseous planet is enormous , with 10 times the mass of jupiter , and it orbits its primary star every 335 days
the primary star has a relatively close partner star , which the planet does not orbit
this pair , in turn , is locked in a long - distance orbit with another pair of stars about 1,670 astronomical units away - one astronomical unit is the distance between earth and the sun. astronomers think it 's highly unlikely that this planet , or any moons that might circle it , could sustain life
the exoplanet , a gas giant , orbits its primary ' yellow ' star in about an earth year 's time
its primary star , called 30 ari b , orbits the newly discovered small ' red dwarf ' star
this pair of stars is itself locked in a long - distance orbit with another pair of stars , known as 30 ari a. the fourth star , found using instruments fitted to the palomar observatory in san diego , marks only the second time a planet has been identified in a quadruple star system
the first four - star planet , kic 4862625 , was discovered in 2013 by citizen scientists using public data from nasa 's kepler mission
this latest discovery is important , though , because it suggests that one in 25 sun - like stars are in a quadruple system , whereas previously they were thought to be much rarer
' about four per cent of solar - type stars are in quadruple systems , which is up from previous estimates because observational techniques are steadily improving , ' said co-author dr andrei tokovinin of the cerro tololo inter-american observatory in chile
the four stars and one planet of the 30 ari system are illustrated in this diagram
this quadruple star system consists of two pairs of stars : 30 ari b and 30 ari a. the gas giant planet ( red ) , 30 ari b ( lower case ) , orbits one of the stars in 30 ari b about once a year
the newly discovered star is shown in green were it possible to see the skies from this particular world , the four parent stars would look like one small sun and two very bright stars that would be visible in daylight
this is not the case for all multi-star systems ; in some , the other stars are so distant and dim that they would only be visible at night
one of the stars in sky of 30 ari b , if viewed with a large enough telescope , would be revealed to be a binary system , or two stars orbiting each other
in recent years , dozens of planets with two or three parent stars have been found , including those with ' tatooine ' sunsets reminiscent of the star wars movies
finding planets with multiple parents is n't too much of a surprise , though , as binary stars are more common in our galaxy than single stars
' star systems come in myriad forms
there can be single stars , binary stars , triple stars , even quintuple star systems , ' said dr roberts of jpl , lead author of the new findings appearing in the journal astronomical journal
the fourth star , found using instruments fitted to the palomar observatory ( pictuerd ) in san diego , marks only the second time a planet has been identified in a quadruple star system
the first four - star planet , kic 4862625 , was discovered in 2013 by citizen scientists using public data from nasa 's kepler mission ' it 's amazing the way nature puts these things together
' the newly discovered fourth star in the ari 30 system is a companion of the primary star the planet orbits , and lies at a distance of 23 astronomical units from the planet - about the distance of uranus to our own sun. however , despite it being relatively close , the newfound star does not appear to have impacted the orbit of the planet
the exact reason for this is uncertain , so the team is planning further observations to better understand the orbit of the star and its complicated family dynamics
in addition to this discovery , made by studying hundreds of stars each night for stellar companions , the astronomers also identified a triple - star system called hd 2638
a planet in this trio of stars is a hot jupiter that circles its primary star tightly , completing one lap every three days
scientists already knew this primary star was locked in a gravitational tango with another star , about 0.7 light - years away , or 44,000 astronomical units
that 's relatively far apart for a pair of stellar companions
the latest discovery is of a third star in the system , which orbits the primary star from a distance of 28 astronomical units - close enough to have influenced the hot jupiter 's development and final orbit
' this result strengthens the connection between multiple star systems and massive planets , ' said roberts .
