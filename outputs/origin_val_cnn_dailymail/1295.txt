dinner : pizza , chips and full - fat barbecue sauce
snacks : biscuits , chocolate bars and sausage rolls

' i remember hating it because i 'd get really tired and i 'd look like a tomato after pe but that 's all changed now
' nobody really said anything bad to me about my weight but i could n't play football with all my friends and i wanted to change
' now i absolutely love football and i play for at least an hour every day
' i never used to enjoy pe and felt a bit left out but now that 's all changed
' i feel like i can compete and enjoy myself without getting embarrassed
' when he started losing weight in january 2014 , owen was 5 " 1 tall
his weight meant he was technically classed as obese , as he had bmi ( bmi ) in the 99th centile of the bmi chart
after losing more than two stone in five months , he now has a healthy bmi
owen 's efforts made ms michelle hatfield realise it was the food she fed him that made him pile on the pounds
she said : ' it all started when i decided i wanted to lose some weight on a slimming world plan and went home to tell the family that i was going to change my diet
' it did n't take long for owen to ask if he could join me
' we always ate convenience food because it 's so much cheaper
i 'd been brought up that way and i 've never known anything different
' one afternoon , owen came over to me and asked if he could change his diet too
' before he lost weight , owen 's bmi meant he was obese
after losing weight ( pictured left and right ) , he has a bmi in the healthy range owen swapped chocolate and sausage rolls for low fat yoghurts and cucumber and carrot sticks
he is now able to play football with his friends , and plays for up to an hour a day ms michelle hatfield , who dropped from 13st 8lbs ( 86kg ) to 11st 1lbs ( 70kg ) at the same time as owen said she never saw her son as being overweight
she said : ' when he first asked me if he could do it too , it made me feel awful
' i 'd never looked at him and thought he was fat or overweight
he 's my son and you just do n't look at your children like that
' i 'd obviously noticed but until he came to ask me that , i 'd always dismissed his weight as nothing more than puppy fat
' it took me a while to get my head around it because i could n't get over the fact that it was my fault
' i 'm his mother and it 's always been my responsibility to feed him
ms michelle hatfield said : ' owen made me realise how irresponsible i 'd been with the food i was buying ' ' that moment when he asked if he could join me at slimming world finally made me realise how irresponsible i 'd been with the food i was buying in
' i 'm really proud of owen because he did this all on his own back and it 's inspired me to think differently about the food i put on the table
' he was n't pushed to lose weight at any stage , he 's just got his head down and done it
' even though i was initially pretty ashamed of myself , i could n't be any more proud of owen
' his transformation has been amazing and i feel like a better mother too
' he 's been so determined from the very start and he 's had the discipline to maintain the weight loss
' now when i take him to the supermarket , he 's out looking for muller light rather than chocolate trifles ! ' owen added : ' my attitude towards food has completely changed too
i 've actually started to see the grease on takeaways and it puts me off
' i 'm really proud of how much weight i 've lost and my friends at school have noticed too
' my friends have all said congratulations and are really impressed with how much i 've managed to lose
' owen 's dad , lee clarke , has also noticed his son 's remarkable transformation when he cares for him at weekends
mr owen , who works at dunelm mill , said : ' it really is amazing
i 'm so proud of him
' it 's done wonders for his confidence and it 's just great to see
' one in five children now leaves primary school obese , official figures show more than three quarters of parents refuse to admit their child is overweight , as official figures show one in five children now leaves primary school obese
researchers at imperial college london found 77 per cent of parents claimed their overweight child was â normal â
among those who did accept their child was too fat , many claimed it was just â puppy fat â or their genes
others said their child was just â solid â or that they had a â big build â
the study came as official figures found the number of obese 11 - year - olds has increased since previous years
experts warned that lifestyle habits are ingrained by the time a child is 11
mr tam fry , of the national obesity forum , warned : ' those 11 - year - olds are probably going to end up as obese adults
â other experts say the problem of childhood obesity is compounded by the fact parents often do nât realise , or refuse to admit , that their child is fat .
