it was supposed to be a special moment when laura strange cradled her newborn daughter in her arms for the first time
but instead of enjoying the happy arrival , the 25 - year - old was preparing to say goodbye to the tiny infant
at little over two hours old haley , swaddled in a hospital blanket , was taken away from her mother and it could be two years before the pair are reunited
with on average 120 inmates pregnant each month only a handful of women are lucky enough to avoid separation from their infants
strange said : ' i accept the consequence of my crime ; i accept the fact that i broke the law
but what does that have to do with my child ? inmate laura strange was shackled to the hospital bed after giving birth to her second child ' giving her up was the hardest thing i have ever done in my life
' i hurt every second of the day for her

blonde - haired strange was taken from her prison cell at the onset of labour to madera community hospital where she gave birth by cesarean section
just two hours after the delivery , a booming voice breaks the silence of the ward , ' strange , fifteen more minutes
' eager to enjoy their last few moments together , the new mother quickly feeds the infant from a bottle of baby formula whispering : ' momma does n't want to send you away on an empty stomach
' gazing down at the shackles around her ankle that confine her to the hospital bed , strange shakes her right foot
' my damn leg fell asleep again , ' she moans
' five more minutes , ' the voice shouts , interrupting her final moments with haley
trembling , strange quietly pleads , ' why me ? ' as the newborn finishes her bottle a nurse arrives and prises the infant from her mother 's grasp before walking out of the door with the child
just an hour later strange is on her way back to valley state prison , where she will spend two years behind bars for drugs charges
while she serves the remainder of her sentence her mother , anita , who is already looking after her son gerard , will take care of haley

' at any given time , approximately 120 are pregnant at valley state prison on average each month
but with over 340 babies born annually to female inmates , only a handful of these children are able to avoid separation from their mothers
the california operates three mother - infant prisoner programs that allow those who qualify to live in a low - level prison setting with their newborn if the duration of their sentence is less than six years
with as few as 75 beds in the program , many prisoners are forced to give up their babies for adoption or foster care , or , in some cases , they give parental custody to friends or relatives
melissa bates is one of the lucky ones
she and her daughter are serving her sentence of two years and seven months together at community prisoner mother program ( cpmp )
the low - level prison houses up to 24 women inmates who gave birth behind bars and aims to keep mother and child together
for those not so lucky and who do not have family who can step in , a host family is provided
they are put on standby ahead of the birth and wait for a call from prison officials telling them when they are needed
they can then care for the newborn for as little as a couple of weeks to as long as a couple of years , depending how much of the sentence is left to run
