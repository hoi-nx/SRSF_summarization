rings of gas and dust are known to encircle saturn , jupiter , uranus , and neptune
scientists recently discovered a fifth member of this haloed group known as chariklo , which is one of a class of minor ' centaur ' planets
now astronomers have detected a possible ring system around a second centaur , chiron , suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought
scientists have detected a possible saturn - like ring system ( pictured ) around a minor , chiron , suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought like their mythological counterparts , centaurs are hybrids , embodying traits of both asteroids and comets
today , scientists estimate there are more than 44,000 centaurs in the solar system , concentrated mainly in a band between the orbits of jupiter and pluto
chiron , discovered in 1977 , was the first planetary body categorised as a centaur , after the mythological greek creature -- a hybrid of man and beast
to discover the rings , the mit observed the dimming of a star as chiron passed in front of it , briefly blocking the light
by looking at how much and when the light was blocked , scientists say the centaur may possess a circulating disk of debris
' it 's interesting , because chiron is a centaur - part of that middle section of the solar system , between jupiter and pluto , where we originally were n't thinking things would be active , but it 's turning out things are quite active , ' says bosh , a lecturer in mit 's department of earth , atmospheric and planetary sciences
it follows the discovery of rings around a giant asteroid called chariklo last year
' i try to imagine how it would be to stand on the surface of this icy object , small enough that a fast sports car could reach escape velocity and drive off into space , and stare up at a 20 kilometer wide ring system 1,000 times closer than the moon , ' said uffe grã¥e jã¸rgensen of the university of copenhagen of the chariklo study
chiron , discovered in 1977 , was the first planetary body categorised as a centaur , after the mythological greek creature -- a hybrid of man and beast
like their mythological counterparts , centaurs are hybrids , embodying traits of both asteroids and comets
today , scientists estimate there are more than 44,000 centaurs in the solar system , concentrated mainly in a band between the orbits of jupiter and pluto
while most centaurs are thought to be dormant , scientists have seen glimmers of activity from chiron
chiron was discovered in 1977 by charles kowal recovery images have been found as far back as 1895 , it was the first - known member of a class of objects now known as centaurs , with an orbit between saturn and uranus starting in the late 1980s , astronomers observed patterns of brightening from the centaur , as well as activity similar to that of a streaking comet
in 2010 , mit started to chart the orbits of chiron and nearby stars in order to pinpoint exactly when the centaur might pass across a star bright enough to detect
' there 's an aspect of serendipity to these observations , ' professor bosh says
' we need a certain amount of luck , waiting for chiron to pass in front of a star that is bright enough
chiron itself is small enough that the event is very short ; if you blink , you might miss it
' in light of these new observations , the researchers say that chiron may still possess symmetrical jets of gas and dust
but other interpretations may be equally valid , including the ' intriguing possibility , ' professor bosh says , of a shell or ring of gas and dust
pictured are the positions of known outer solar system objects
the centaurs are those objects ( in green ) that lie generally inwards of the kuiper belt ( in blue ) ruprecht , who is a researcher at mit 's lincoln laboratory , says it is possible to imagine a scenario in which centaurs may form rings
for example , when a body breaks up , the resulting debris can be captured gravitationally around another body , such as chiron
rings can also be leftover material from the formation of chiron itself
nevertheless , bosh says the possibility of a second ringed centaur in the solar system is an enticing one
' until chariklo 's rings were found , it was commonly believed that these smaller bodies do n't have ring systems , ' bosh says
' if chiron has a ring system , it will show it 's more common than previously thought
