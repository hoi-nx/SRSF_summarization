falcao 's miserable time at manchester united plumbed new depths when he turned out for the club 's under 21s in their 1 - 1 draw with spurs
at a virtually empty old trafford the Â£ 280,00 - a - week misfit endured a lifeless 72 minutes before suffering the ignominy of hearing cheers when his number was held up

catch up on all the action with sportsmail 's oliver todd
host commentator it could have been a win for manchester united on tuesday night , had falcao not found his way in front of two goalbound shots
the expensive loanee did more harm than good to manchester united 's attack
one big positive for the home side though was rafael
his all - round performance and excellent goal will surely give louis van gaal food for thought with regards to the left back slot
anyway , that 's it from our live coverage

falcao is being subbed off ! he 's been poor in truth and has done more harm than good to manchester united 's attacks
louis van gaal is unlikely to be impressed and you would think he has no chance of starting at the weekend on this showing
he is replaced by josh harrop
oh , and he awkwardly did n't seem to realise it was him that was being hooked at first , just as he did with the first team against preston north end
it 's fair to say the old trafford crowd were n't too impressed with him either : victor valdes comes out to scoop up the ball under the feet shaquile coulthirst but the spurs make takes exception to his efforts and they have a bit of a shove at each other
nothing special too and they 're both just warned by the referee
reece james comes off and surprise january signing on loan from bolton , andy kellet , joins the action

that 's it for the first half

one minute of added time is shown at old trafford

surely he could n't have envisaged that when he arrived back in august
meanwhile , sportsmail 's mike keegan reports that the steadily growing crowd at old trafford are finding their voices after the goal
just when spurs looked to be getting on top goalkeeper luke mcgee drops a bit of a clanger
he collects the ball from a cross ahead of falcao and looks to bowl it out to a team - mate

left - footed , and from 35 yards
awful pass out of the area from donald love for manchester united and shaquile coulthirst latches on to a ball back in
a brilliant bit of skill gets him away from his marker but a cheeky chipped finish past victor valdes drops just wide
shades of manchester united 's defeat on monday night here ...
shocking back pass from joe rothwell and it arrives at the feet of spurs ' kenny mcevoy
he advances forward past one challenger and slots in an excellent finish past victor valdes
ah , that 's not so good from the on - loan forward
james wilson makes an excellent run cutting in from the right wing and fires in a thunderous left - footed shot
it looks to be going on target but instead the smashes into the back of falcao and out of play
