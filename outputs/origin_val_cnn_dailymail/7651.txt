kimi raikkonen was left to bemoan bad timing as the reason why he faces an uphill struggle to claim a podium finish in sunday 's grand prix
throughout practice at the sepang had suggested a top - three position was on the cards as he emerged the closest rival to mercedes duo lewis hamilton and nico rosberg
but come qualifying , and the start of the second session with a storm brewing overhead , the finn found himself out of position in the queue to take to the track and set a banker lap. kimi raikkonen 's chances of a podium finish in malaysian were dampened by a storm during qualifying the finn eventually qualified in 11th position in his ferrari at the sepang circuit click here to read jonathan mcevoy 's report as lewis hamilton secures pole ahead of sebastian vettel and nico rosberg with team - mate sebastian vettel at the head of the line of cars , the four - times champion eventually emerged quickest in q2 as the drivers only had time for one hot lap before the heavens opened
that lap proved to be a mad scramble from which kimi raikkonen could only qualify 11th , with sauber 's marcus ericsson his undoing
' i tried to overtake ericsson because he was in front of me , ' said kimi raikkonen
' but at the last corner i could n't slow down because there were other people pushing me forward
' in my mind we just got the timing wrong
that 's how it ended up
' television pictures of qualifying showed lightning and stormy conditions approaching the circuit dark clouds gather in the background at the sepang during the qualifying session kimi raikkonen , though , opted not to point an accusing finger at his team , adding : ' i do n't know if it helps to blame anyone
' it 's easy to say afterwards we should have been waiting behind one another , but the end result is this and whatever we will do now will not change it
' obviously , we have made our life very difficult , so i have no idea what we will do tomorrow
we will try our best and see where we end up

' it was an interesting qualifying session
the car felt good in both dry and wet conditions at the end
' i 'm reasonably happy , and also the long runs look good on practice days , so we should be in good shape , but we know they ( mercedes ) are difficult to beat
' that 's ultimately why we turn up trying to win , so we will see what we can do
maybe it looks like we are a little bit closer here , but we will have to wait and see
