a computer expert has managed track down the delighted owner of a memory stick full of treasured photographs living half way across the world , two years after she believed they were lost forever
jonathan , 26 , was handed two usb sticks by a friend after they lay unclaimed for two years after being discovered in a marks and spencer store
the memory sticks were full of photographs , and it expert and photography enthusiast jonathan quickly realised how precious the images could be and determined to find the owner
amazing : jonathan managed use technology to track down the photos ' owner half way across the world technology : when jonathan put this picture in , it matched to a woman called narien - who would eventually turn out to be the owner of the photographs so he set about selecting images and running them through google image search , trying to get the perfect match
and his hard work paid off , when he managed to find the name narien
but even with the unusual name , he was still struggling to find the mystery owner
' none of the names was narien , so i went onto facebook and trawled through some of the photographs of people with that name to see if i recognised anyone from the pictures , ' he explained
' then i went back to the usb stick and looked at some of the documents on it and found the surname narien meyer
' i typed that in facebook and a lady called narien meyer , from south africa , came up and i managed to positively identify her
' narien , it transpired , was a teacher now living in oman - almost 4,000 miles from jonathan 's home in hartlepool
extra : jonathan then turned back to the usb sticks to find more information , and then found a surname then he hit another hurdle : he sent a message to narien , to let her know he had found her photos
but she did n't respond , so he did a little more sleuthing work and found a friend who was willing to help
and finally , he was able get the pictures back to their rightful owner , who is said to be ' absolutely delighted '
narien sent jonathan a thank you message saying that she believes she lost the sticks possibly on a visit to barnard castle in 2013
it said : ' thank you so much for getting my pics back to me ! i lost my bag with the usbs in it in barnard castle two years ago - or so i thought
' we probably stopped at other places as well but i 'm not that familiar with the area
' amazing that after two years you got it back to me i 'm now in saudi arabia , and most of the photos were taken in kuwait and oman , and the saudi arabia , where i 've been teaching
' thanks to you i 'll have my memories ! ' jonathan is equally as pleased
' i had a one in 7.126billion chance of success and with hard work i accomplished it - and made new friends some 3,6660 miles away , ' he said .
