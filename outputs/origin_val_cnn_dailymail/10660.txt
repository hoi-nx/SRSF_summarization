' the lightning is very rare and does not appear in a normal ash cloud but in clouds from pyroclastic flows - which are mixtures of rock fragments and hot gases
' pyroclastic flows are the most dangerous hazards on volcanoes and so i was a little bit afraid when a big one was happening in front of me - but in fact the whole experience was a great adventure
