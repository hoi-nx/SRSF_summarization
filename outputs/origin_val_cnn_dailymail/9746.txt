demand : an official organ transplant
the first illegal ' organ harvesting ' in british was reported in 2011 two people â one a boy as young as 12 â have been smuggled into british to have their organs removed and sold on the black market
the horrific cases , which have been revealed in an official report , show the lengths to which human traffickers will go to make money from their vile trade
the pair were brought into the country last year by gangs seeking to exploit the worldwide demand for transplant organs
one was identified as a boy aged between 12 and 15 and the other as a woman in her 30s
they are thought to have started their journey in africa or asia and to have been rescued by british police or immigration officials who suspected they were being trafficked
such cases are rare , but expose what charities and campaign groups suspect is a little - known aspect of international people - smuggling
the first incident of illegal â organ harvesting â in british was reported in 2011
two years later a girl was brought from somalia with the intention of removing her organs and selling them on to patients desperate for a transplant
the two latest cases are revealed in a report by the nca , which was set up by the government to combat serious and organised crime
according to the who ( who ) , as many as 7,000 kidneys are illegally obtained by gangs each year around the world
while there is a black market for hearts , lungs and livers , kidneys are the most sought - after organs because one can be removed from a patient without serious ill - effects
the conspiracy involves a number of people , including a recruiter who identifies the victim , someone else to organise their journey , medical professionals to perform the operation and an accomplice charged with offering the organ for sale
while the vast majority of trafficking cases highlighted in the nca statistics relate to sexual exploitation and modern - day slavery , â organ harvesting â is specifically identified as a category of cross-border criminal activity
vigilant : border police at heathrow
immigration officials suspected the pair were being trafficked and they were rescued the salvation army was awarded a government contract in 2011 to give specialist support to victims of all forms of people - smuggling , including providing them with safe houses as well as medical care and legal advice
anne read , the salvation army âs human trafficking response co-ordinator , said : â front - line staff are becoming more aware of the different types of exploitation that are taking place and the extremes to which gangs will go to make money from their victims
â the woman who was found in 2011 and referred to us had not yet had an organ removed but she was completely traumatised and very frightened
â she had suffered an awful ordeal and was in such an emotional state that she found it difficult to talk about what she had been through
it is almost impossible to imagine anyone even thinking of carrying out a complicated operation in secret without the necessary medical back - up
the cases highlighted by the nca are a truly shocking development
â chloe setter , from child protection charity ecpat uk , said : â we know of just a handful of cases but we suspect these are the tip of the iceberg
organ harvesting is prevalent in many countries
we have felt confident in the british that we have robust systems and procedures in place in relation to transplants but this could be something that is happening underground and out of view
â traffickers target the most vulnerable â children , those living in poverty , refugees and migrants â because they are often desperate and easy to manipulate
â the demand for organs outstrips supply in almost every country
in many places the wait for an organ can be measured in years
the who says around ten per cent of the 63,000 kidney transplants carried out annually worldwide involve payment of non-related donors of different nationalities
lutfi dervishi , clinic director , was jailed for eight years after heading an organ - trafficking ring that performed at least 24 illegal kidney transplants on the outskirts of pristina , in the former yugoslav republic of kosovo globally , at least 200,000 people are on waiting lists for kidneys , and many more have no access to transplantation or dialysis services
one of the worst cases uncovered so far was in the former yugoslav republic of kosovo , where five men were convicted in 2013 of involvement in an organ - trafficking ring that performed at least 24 illegal kidney transplants at a clinic on the outskirts of the capital , pristina
the clinic âs director lutfi dervishi , who was sentenced to eight years in jail , had promised victims about Â£ 12,500 each for kidneys that were then sold on the black market for as much as Â£ 84,000 a time , but donors often went unpaid
prosecutors at the trial said they were â cast aside at the airport â
most of the organs were sold to recipients in israel , canada , poland and germany
according to the who , a heart can fetch up to Â£ 1 million on the black market and a pancreas or liver about Â£ 500,000
a spokesman for the human tissue authority , which regulates organ transplants in the british , said : â we have been made aware of these two cases
fortunately , the authorities were able to intervene before the traffickers could carry out their plan
