saving the lives of premature babies is not always the most kind course of action , doctors have been told
new guidance says health professionals should carefully consider whether medical intervention is in the baby 's best interest , and should n't be carried out ' just because the technology is there '
continuing treatment to keep the baby alive can sometimes actually cause greater suffering , child health doctors said
doctors should carefully consider whether saving the lives of premature babies is the kindest course of action , new guidance from the royal college of paediatrics and child health ( royal college of paediatrics and child health ) says the royal college of paediatrics and child health ( royal college of paediatrics and child health ) today released a new framework , which advises doctors on how to care for children and babies with life - limiting and life - threatening conditions
it asks medics to weight up the benefits of prolonged treatment versus the suffering the young patient might be likely to experience
it says seriously ill children should be given a greater say in whether they want to continue receiving treatment which is keeping them alive
the updated information provides three sets of circumstances for when limiting or withdrawing the treatment of children and babies can be considered
this can be done when life is limited in quality or when life is limited in quantity
treatment can also be limited or withdrawn when there is ' competent refusal of treatment ' - if an older child with extensive experience of illness repeatedly consents to stopping their medical care
the royal college of paediatrics and child health ( royal college of paediatrics and child health ) advises doctors on when to treat children and babies with life - limiting and life - threatening illnesses
it says life - sustaining treatment can be limited or withdrawn when : for example , a child that has undergone repeated cycles of chemotherapy or had organ transplantation , ' will have more informed views about continuing treatment than an adult facing such treatment for the first time ' , the document says
but it adds that , equally , children may not have any experience in decision making and it therefore may not be as appropriate for them to be involved
written by medics , lawyers and ethicists , the framework was published to provide an ethical and legal framework for doctors
since the last version was published 10 years ago , major breakthroughs in medical science have led to better survival rates for seriously sick babies and children
babies born at 22 or 23 weeks are now surviving
but child health experts said that just because the technology is there , it does not mean it is necessarily in the child or baby 's best interests to use it if their circumstances fall under any of the categories set out
dr simon newell , a consultant neonatologist and vice president of the royal college of paediatrics and child health , said the document sets out a ' better and more family - friendly process '
' for some , continuing life - sustaining treatment is simply prolonging suffering in the face of the inevitable , ' he said
seriously ill children should be given a greater say in whether they want to continue treatment that is keeping them alive , the guidance adds ( file photo ) ' in these cases , an active decision is reached among the clinicians , parents and other parties to discontinue treatment rather than cause greater suffering for the child by keeping them alive
' the better informed the family or the patient themselves is , the better , he said , and more children and babies are receiving palliative care in hospices or at home rather than dying in hospital
dr joe brierley , consultant in paediatric and neonatal intensive care at gosh ( gosh ) and chairman of the ethics and law advisory committee at the royal college of paediatrics and child health , said : ' this is a sensitive and challenging area of medicine
' the guiding principle remains to act in the best interest of the child , actively involving them in the decision making where possible , and of course considering the interests of the families and their rights
' decisions to limit treatments should be made by clinical teams in partnership with , and with the agreement of , the parents and child
