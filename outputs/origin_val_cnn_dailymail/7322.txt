method of choice : double murderer ron lafferty has chosen to die by firing squad it is a macabre choice to make - and almost unique to some inmates on utah 's death row : would you be injected with toxic chemicals , or shot in the heart ? but , amid cries of outrage against the southwestern state bringing death by firing quad back into law , almost half of those due to die that way have picked the punishment themselves
ron lafferty , who slit the throats of his sister - in - law and her baby daughter in 1984 , is one of three who has opted to die by the bullet
two others in utah 's eight - strong death row have made the same choice , the los angeles times reported - though it is not clear who they are
the recent change in utah 's execution law revived the firing squad as a back - up method , in case no lethal injection drugs are available it was outlawed in 2004 , before which time inmates such as lafferty had been able to choose between the two
even while firing squads were banned , a legal technicality meant previous decisions were still valid
the last was carried out in 2010
in practice , utah has no doses of lethal injection , and no way to acquire more
that situation means anybody the state executes is likely to be put before a firing squad - five marksmen with .30 - caliber winchester rifles - whatever their preference
the state is not due to kill anybody for several years yet , so a new source could be found - though many drugs manufacturers now refuse to do business with governments that carry out capital punishment
human rights organizations criticize the method as a barbaric throwback to the days of the wild west - the same charges which led to the scrapping in the first place
he said : ' those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state
' we regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued
others : two other inmates have requested death by firing squad

pictured above ( left to right ) are von taylor , michael archuleta and floyd maestas ' however , when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant , enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch
' refusal : douglas carter , pictured , has asked for lethal injection - but may be killed by firing squad anyway if none can be found the move follows a series of high - profile botched executions around the united states in 2014 and 2015 , many due to concerns about the efficacy of lethal injection drugs
proponents of the punishment tout the speed of firing squads - provided some of the five bullets hit the heart , death can come in little longer than a minute
lethal injections have in some cases dragged on for almost half an hour
the last firing squad death in utah , and the united states , was that of ronnie lee gardner in 2010
a new york times report said that he told a utah judge ' i would like the firing squad , please ' a few weeks before his execution date
he explained his preference more than a decade earlier , in an interview with the deseret news
he told the paper : ' i guess it 's my mormon heritage
' ' i like the firing squad
it 's so much easier ... and there 's no mistakes
' as per his wishes , the marksmen opened fire at a 12:15am on june 18 , 2010 , abc news reported
at 12:17am , he was declared dead
the prisoner is seated in a chair that is set up in front of a wood panel and in between stacked sandbags that keep the bullets from ricocheting around the room
a target is pinned over the inmate 's heart
shooters aim for the chest rather than the head because it 's a bigger target and usually allows for a faster death
the prisoner is offered a two - minute window to offer final words
in 1977 , gary gilmore used that chance to say ' let 's do this ! ' before he died
five shooters set up about 25 feet from the chair , with their .30 - caliber winchester rifles pointing through slots in a wall
assuming they hit their target , the heart ruptures and the prisoner dies quickly from blood loss
weapon : utah 's marksmen fire the fatal rounds from a .30 - caliber winchester rifle , similar to the one above the gunmen are chosen from a pool of volunteer officers , with priority given to those from the area where the crime happened
thus far there have always been more volunteers than necessary
the shooters ' identities are kept anonymous , and one of their rifles is loaded with a blank round so nobody knows which officer killed the inmate
unlike lethal injections , death by firing squad leaves some of an inmates ' organs - such as the eyes , kidneys and liver - unspoilt for donation , so long as they are not hit by stray bullets
