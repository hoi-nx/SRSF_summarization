' i had quite a troubled childhood - my father was quite famous at the time , ' mr chris bonington told daily mail australia
' i went off the rails a bit and got into a bit of trouble because i was sick of people asking me if i was going to follow in my father 's footsteps
' i guess when i was young , i kind of wanted to make my own mark and also could n't really understand why my dad spent days away on these trips
' i was always scared that he was going to get killed - like all his friends did
it was quite hard for a young kid to digest
' at the age of 24 , he embarked on his very first expedition with the help of his father
' that year i decided to go on my first expedition and it absolutely changed my life , ' mr chris bonington said

i remember seeing my dad crying his eyes out as i went off on my own
' when i reached the top , i just burst into tears
i just stood there crying because i finally understood why my dad did what he does
' i learnt that yes there are risks but what you get from these experiences just outweighs everything else
' that first experience taught me that i need to get out of my comfort zone and i 've been doing that ever since
i 'm now teaching others to do the same
