but a new generation of consumers is demanding luggage that is not only portable and durable , but tell you if it gets lost , and designers are happy to oblige
bags with gps trackers , smart phone locking systems and ports for charging mobile phones are among some of the innovative designs available in time for the summer holiday season
gps tells you where your bag is if it gets re-routed to another flight , and a built - in battery can charge your smartphone six times over trunkster features an innovative sliding door as well as gps trackers and a battery charger coming in august is trunkster , which offers both carry on and check in options
funded by a kickstarter campaign , it was created by gaston blanchet and jesse potash , from new york , they set about creating their ultimate suitcase after tiring of ' brittle zippers , cumbersome flaps , flimsy handles , and unreliable wheels ' on traditional luggage
they came up with the ' game - changing ' design for the sliding door on the luggage which opens at the touch of a button
' we 're all too familiar with that frustrating moment when you realise you quickly need something out of your bag , ' the trunkster team writes on their kickstarter page
' with trunkster âs revolutionary sliding door , you no longer have to unzip your entire bag and flap it open
the rolltop door lets you instantly access your belongings in one swift motion

sensors in the suitcase automatically detect if the owner has walked away and lock it or notify the user if it is being left behind

' we came up with the idea for bluesmart after suffering a couple of bad experiences with our luggage , when airlines forced us to check bags only to have them mishandled or lost , ' said tomi pierucci , co-founder of bluesmart
' we realised that with all the amazing technology available today , we could do better
' suitcases have nât seen much innovation in decades , so we decided to design a suitcase for this century

created by a team of israeli designers , it triples its volume from 40 litres to 120 litres
the expandable suitcase , which doubles as a closet and laptop table , can then be checked into the hold
isaac atlas , industrial designer at fugu , got the idea for the case when he had to buy new luggage on his way home from a trip because his carry - on bag could not fit in all his extra shopping
on their kickstarter page they write : ' today 's advanced technology makes nearly every aspect of day - to - day life simpler and easier
despite these advances , there is one heavily used product that has not significantly progressed in decades : the suitcase ' having decided that the time has come to rethink the traditional suitcase , we have developed fugu luggage â an innovative lifestyle product that adjusts to meet the needs of the modern traveller
' it will be released by the end of the year
chairman of the uk travelgoods and acessories association jacquie sandison said the industry was worth Â£ 1.63billion to the uk economy and she believed there would be a strong market for smart luggage in the uk
she added : ' the industry is buoyant and consumers are always keen to source new and exciting travel brands that keep pace with trends , lifestyles and now technology
manufacturers are innovative these days and invest heavily in research , development and design
it was inevitable that a company would produce products like these eventually
as smartphone ownership in the uk continues to increase i believe there is real growth potential here for smartphone compatible luggage , not everyone wants a black suitcase with a red ribbon tied to the handle
