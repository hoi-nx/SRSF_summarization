reading boss steve clarke has revealed he did not watch the fa cup semi-final draw as he refuses to look beyond monday 's sixth - round replay against bradford
the reading will welcome phil parkinson 's side to the madejski stadium on monday night , with the winner progressing into the final four to face cup - holders arsenal at wembley
a goalless draw at valley parade in the original tie means the draw was made following arsenal 's win at manchester united but before a replay could decide who would face the gunners
reading manager steve clarke reveals he did not watch the fa cup semi-final draw reading and bradford played out a goalless draw in the fa cup quarter - final last weekend and steve clarke , who made nine changes to his side that lost 4 - 1 at watford in their sky bet championship clash on saturday , insists he can not entertain the idea of a wembley date as he pays full respect to bradford
' i did n't watch the draw , ' he said
' a friend texted me telling me we had drawn arsenal , but i never intended on watching it
' i do n't think it ( the draw ) makes any difference whatsoever
i think the game against bradford is big enough in its own right and the reward of getting through to an fa cup semi-final is big enough in its own right
so i do n't think the semi-final opposition makes a difference to either team
' before there is any talk of semi-finals you have to get through to the quarter - final and that 's what we intend to do
' what 's the point of thinking about a game that is not there ? you have to think about the game coming up and it 's a very difficult game for us against a very good bradford team
' almen abdi ( centre ) got watford off to a dream start against reading by scoring inside a minute matej vyrdra ( right ) also scored as watford beat reading 4 - 1 on saturday afternoon despite a potential meeting with arsene wenger 's fa cup winners , steve clarke believes his squad must be targeting their own success in this season 's competition rather than just hoping for a wembley day out against arsenal
' to get to wembley does n't excite me , to get to the fa cup semi-final does , ' he said
that 's the key for me
one more step in the cup would be nice
to get to wembley is just another game , there are no prizes for it
' the final goal of any competition is to pick up the silver trophy at the end of it
this is just another step on the way to the final
that 's how you have to look at every round and that 's how we have looked at every round
' it 's not to get excited about a semi-final
in a semi-final there is no trophy , there are no medals
it 's much better to put down on your cv that you have got a cup winners medal or you 've lifted a trophy
' that has to be the ambition
the ambition can not be to reach the semi-final at wembley , it has to be to lift the trophy
' that is the mindset i have to give them
that 's the mindset you have to have
if you 're satisfied to reach a semi-final then that 's not correct
