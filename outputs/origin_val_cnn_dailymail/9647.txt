on the way home from old trafford on monday night , the debate , as it turned out , was the wrong debate
should danny welbeck have been sold to arsenal last summer ? should he have celebrated his winning goal back in manchester ? both questions were irrelevant
danny welbeck is an honest and talented footballer but he would nât make a difference to louis van gaal âs manchester united
he is good without being really good
danny welbeck shoots to score the winning goal against manchester united on monday night at old trafford a stranded david de gea ( right ) looks on as the goalkeeper was beaten by former manchester united player danny welbeck danny welbeck celebrated his goal against his former club as arsenal won the fa cup tie 2 - 1 danny welbeck is swamped by his arsenal team - mates on a night to forget for manchester united supporters manchester united manager louis van gaal ( left ) and assistant giggs watch on during their latest defeat danny welbeck , whose international record is better than his club record , scored a well - taken and well - anticipated goal on monday and celebrated appropriately
his overall performance , though , was modest
had he been playing in red rather than in blue and yellow , the result would not have been different
on tuesday danny welbeck said : â manchester united is a club that means so much to me
i âm a fan and it âs hard to knock them out
i âll always respect the fans
i had a lovely reception and i âm thankful for that
â but manchester united âs problems under van gaal go much deeper than any associated with his decision last august to sell a player he figured â with reason â would have been his fourth - choice centre forward
van gaal cut a frustrated figure during the match as he and his team lost their last chance of a trophy manchester united 's ( left to right ) marouane fellaini , michael carrick and wayne rooney look frustrated on the pitch tactical genius ? not quite
louis van gaal received 3/10 for his tactics on monday night , but what about the players ? click here for full ratings the most telling moments of this fa cup tie came in the second half
it was a close game at that point
arsenal manager wenger will have been disappointed his team had conceded an equaliser so carelessly so soon after taking the lead but at half - time he appeared to tell his team to continue in the same vein
van gaal , however , sniffed danger , or thought he did
he made two substitutions , neither of them positive , and that seemed indicative of a coach unsure of his players and unconvinced by his original plan
he did a similar thing at swansea recently and manchester united lost that one , too
later , with manchester united chasing in the wake of danny welbeck âs goal and angel di maria âs sending - off , van gaal pushed marouane fellaini â and , soon after , smalling â to the top of the manchester united formation and asked them to feed off a diet of long balls pumped from their own half
angel di maria is sent off by referee michael oliver after the midfielder grabbed the official 's shirt di maria applauds the manchester united supporters after being sent off for manhandling the referee during the tie radamel falcao sits on the bench next to juan mata as the on - loan striker went unused against arsenal van gaal issues instructions alongside giggs but their tactics and substitutions were questionable with their exit from the fa cup against arsenal , manchester united 's attention now rests solely on the premier league
yet manchester united have n't beaten a side currently in the top half since their home win against liverpool in mid december last year
click here for the full story this is a valid tactic and one that worked at west ham last month
marouane fellaini , in particular , can be strangely effective in that role
nevertheless , while this was going on , manchester united âs spanish playmaker juan mata and their colombian centre forward radamel falcao sat in the dug - out
they were still there when an aimless hoof from jones rolled out of play for a goal - kick and referee michael oliver signalled the end of the game
this , perhaps , is most damning
van gaal âs tactical preferences can be discussed all night long
manchester united , whether they knew it or not , hired a pragmatist last summer and it is that side of the manager that the supporters are seeing now
more pertinent is the fact that one of european football âs leading coaches decided â at the sharp end of a home cup tie that he knew his team must win â to put his trust in some hackney marshes football rather than ask two players in whom his club has invested millions of pounds to go on and change the game through method and design
it is a strange state of affairs and one that tells us van gaal has limited faith in his players
it also points to problems that will greatly affect manchester united âs transfer strategy this summer

that is probably about Â£ 150million right there
the dutch coach also knows , however , that he needs to ease out some very big names to make that happen
van gaal has to make decisions about juan mata , radamel falcao , robin van persie and rafael da silva and that is before he addresses the issue of whether less glamorous types such as jones , smalling and jonny evans are evergoing to mature into footballers good enough to help manchester united back to the top of the premier league
van gaal has spoken many times about his squad lacking balance
what he has been understandably less candid about is the fact that it is just not good enough
there are problems with players such as di maria that need time and tactical tuning to address
there is , at least , no doubt about his quality
the cross he delivered for wayne rooney to equalise on monday was evidence of that
di maria is not the issue
it is the supporting cast â such as adnan januzaj and ashley young â that van gaal remains unsure about
at arsenal , wenger has his critics
his team remain skittish and unpredictable
nobody can accuse the arsenal manager of not knowing his own mind , however
there is a methodical consistency about wenger that , for better or for worse , is clear from the way he chooses and sets up his teams
the same can not be said about van gaal
at the manchester united training ground on wednesday , the increasingly irritable manager will be looking for something new , trying to find yet another way of turning water into wine before sunday âs home game with tottenham
what is unclear though , is whether this constant changing of personnel and tactics tells us more about the limitations of the manager or the players
