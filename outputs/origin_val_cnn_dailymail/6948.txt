the real - life ' up ' house , which saw its elderly owner refuse to take $ 1million from developers to move out looks set to be demolished by a wrecking ball when it is auctioned off
in 2006 , macefield took a stand against developers by staying in the house in seattle 's ballard neighborhood where she had lived in for almost 60 years despite being offered money to leave so new retail and office space could be created
both she and the 1,000 square foot house became a symbol of standing up to corporate giants after developers were forced to awkwardly build around it
however , ms macefield passed away from pancreatic cancer in june 2008 , leaving the house boarded up and empty
tomorrow it will be entered into a foreclosure auction , where it is expected to be bought by developers and demolished
it comes after a friend she left the house to sold it to a company called reach returns , who planned to keep it in tact for a new project
but when the company started work , they were n't able to get the financing they needed and defaulted on their loans , meaning it went into foreclosure
the row with developers came after the neighborhood of ballard , just across salmon bay from seattle , held out against the forces of gentrification until 2000 when developers came knocking
condominiums and shopping malls for tech - industry workers began to spring up where once modest family homes had once stood
by 2006 , ms macefield 's home stood almost alone , her neighbors long gone , as developers prepared to build ballard blocks , a retail and office development
she was offered $ 1 million in cash for her property , in addition to assistance with housing and healthcare
but she turned down the money for the simple reason that she did not want to leave
macefield refused to leave her home of 50 years , and construction began on the development that would end up surrounding her house and garden ms macefield had lived in the house for almost 60 years , having originally moved there in 1952 to take care of her ailing mother
it was home to all of her memories , and a large collection of ceramic cats , dogs and cows
the money meant nothing to her , she did not want to move , and had already rejected a smaller buyout offer a couple of years before
as concrete walls began to tower some five floors high above her home , her fame grew and she earned the grudging respect of the construction workers that would pass by every day
ms macefield never had to leave her home , and she died there aged 86 , leaving the small house sandwiched between a trader joe 's and an l.a. fitness
ironically , she left the house to the supervisor of the very project that had tried to displace her
martin was one of several construction workers that got to know ms macefield , often dropping in to check on her
' she would get up really early to feed the birds every day , ' mr martin told yahoo homes
' and so if we ever did n't see birdseed out front by 10 am , we 'd know to go check on her
' as concrete walls began to tower above her home , her fame grew and she earned the grudging respect of the construction workers that would pass by every day macefield never had to leave her home , and she died there aged 86 , leaving the small house sandwiched between a trader joe 's and an l.a. fitness
mr martin would even drive her to hair appointments , run errands , cook for her and take her to hospital
she was tough and stubborn and would test mr martin , but he could be too and did not stop looking after her
' all she wanted to do was live and die in her house , and that seems like a pretty simple request
and all she really needed was some help using her hands and being on her feet , ' he said
ms macefield , a very private person , did not like the worldwide attention she received for just wanting to stay put in her home
she stood her ground not because she was standing up to corporate america or because she wanted to be a hero
she simply did n't want to leave
' some people still believe that she was doing it to stand up against the man , and that really was n't it
' she decided what it was she wanted to do and stuck to her guns , and that part to me makes sense
that 's what i relate to , ' said mr martin
the house is now boarded up ahead of the auction at the end of the week , where it is expected to face demolition by a wrecking ball macefield was a reluctant folk hero with a colorful past
she claimed she was not trying to make a stand against corporate america
she simply did n't want to leave the story of the house came at the end of a remarkable life according to stories she told mr martin , some of which he was able to corroborate through letters and photographs he found after her death
ms macefield had a large musical collection , and played the clarinet
she talked of playing with jazz and swing musician benny goodman , her cousin , and his friends jimmy and tommy dorsey
she had lived overseas in her early life , could quote from classic books , and spoke multiple languages
she also claimed to have worked as a spy during world war ii , until she was captured and sent to the concentration camp at dachau , from which she then escaped
later she ran an orphanage for war refugees before returning to america to look after her mother
despite shunning the limelight she has been immortalized in seattle due to her refusal of the developer 's money
some two dozen people are reported to have tattoos of her house ; a drink is named after her at a local cocktail bar ; and the macefield music festival still attracts a crowd of 3,000 people each year .
