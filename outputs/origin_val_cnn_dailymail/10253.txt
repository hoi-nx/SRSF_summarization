scientists have found that pollution coming from asia countries is affecting weather in the united states
the effect that pollution in asia may have on other parts of the world has been examined by both nasa 's jpl ( jpl ) and the california institute of technology , nasa 's earth science news reported
jiang , who is part of jpl , and yuan wang looked at the potential link between more intense storms in the northwest pacific , deeper clouds over the pacific ocean , and asia 's period of economic growth -- all of which happened in the same 30 - year period , according to the news outlet
research : scientists have found that pollution coming from asia countries is affecting weather in the united states

jiang , pictured , was one of the researchers involved in the project yuan wang told the news outlet that more powerful extratropical cyclones likely played a role in 2013 winter weather on the east coast
he also said that during extratropical cyclones , a larger amount of water undergoes condensation on aerosols -- due to greater pollution
heat released from the process can contribute to a cloud becoming both larger and deeper , earth science news explained
jiang told the news outlet ' before , we thought about the north-south contrast : the northern hemisphere has more land , the southern hemisphere has more ocean
' that difference is important to global atmospheric circulation
' now , in addition to that , there 's a west-east contrast
europe and north america are reducing emissions ; asia is increasing them
' that change also affects the global circulation and perturbs the climate
' speaking to the weather channel , jiang said ' during the wintertime , human - induced pollution such as coal burning in many asia cities can create smog that lasts for weeks

( a woman is seen in boston in this february 2013 file photo ) ' under favorable wind conditions , pollution particles can be transported downwind across the pacific ocean , where winter storms are prevalent
' however , jiang told npr that he does not know to what extent powerful northwest pacific storms can cause severe weather in other parts of the united states
' we have not reached a final conclusion yet , ' he told the media outlet .
