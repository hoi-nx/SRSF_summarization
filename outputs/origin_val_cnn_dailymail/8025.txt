no one expects to unearth histories of love while looking for a rice cooker
but for one couple , this helped them discover that their relationship started much earlier than they previously thought
through finding a preschool class photograph , the couple realized they had actually met 16 years previously , when they were three years old
while at his girlfriend 's house , believed to be in the u.s. , reddit user evanaka1234 came across an old school photo of her and recognized her immediately , claiming that she looked like an ' imp '
reddit user evanaka found this preschool class photo in his girlfriend 's house while trying to find a rice cooker he recognized his girlfriend immediately , but then realized the boy next to her looked familiar as well
he then discovered that the boy next to his girlfriend was him and that the couple had unknowingly gone to preschool together but as he stared at the photo he realized the blond boy next to his girlfriend , who has not been named , looked familiar
then it hit him : the little boy next to his girlfriend was him
he could n't believe it , so he called his mom , who confirmed the name of his preschool , which was in fact the school his girlfriend went to , even though neither of them remember it
evanaka1234 posted the picture on reddit , sharing his story with the world
sixteen years later the couple are together again , except as a couple rather than classmates
it is unknown how long the couple has been dating
