president obama says he takes israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu ' at his word ' for saying there 'd never be an independent palestinian state as long as he 's in office , but still believes a two - state solution is the key to peace in the area
benjamin netanyahu has softened his position since making the comment just before he won re-election last week
he said in a statement on monday that a palestinian state would not be established on his watch
but the change in tone does n't seem to be swaying obama , who said he spoke to benjamin netanyahu on the phone on thursday
rift : president obama says the u.s. will evaluate other options for establishing peace between the israeli and palestinian as a result of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's rejection of longstanding u.s. policy ' i did indicate to him that we continue to believe that a two - state solution is the only way for the long - term security of israeli , if it wants to stay both a jewish state and democratic , ' obama told huff post on saturday
' and i indicated to him that given his statements prior to the election , it is going to be hard to find a path where people are seriously believing that negotiations are possible
' obama says the u.s. will evaluate other options for establishing peace between the israeli and palestinian as a result of benjamin netanyahu 's rejection of longstanding u.s. policy
obama says he indicated to benjamin netanyahu when they spoke this week that the u.s. continues to believe a two - state solution is the only way to keep israeli secure
the comments were obama 's first on the israeli election outcome
he spoke in an interview with the huff post
' we take him at his word when he said that it would n't happen during his prime ministership , and so that 's why we 've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we do n't see a chaotic situation in the region , ' the president said
the huff post reported obama said he was most disappointment at benjamin netanyahu 's election day warning about arab israeli voters going to the polls ' in droves
' ' we indicated that that kind of rhetoric was contrary to what is the best of israeli 's traditions , ' obama said in the interview
' that although israeli was founded based on the historic jewish homeland and the need to have a jewish homeland , israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly
' and i think that that is what 's best about israeli democracy
' if that is lost , then i think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who do n't believe in a jewish state , but it also i think starts to erode the meaning of democracy in the country
