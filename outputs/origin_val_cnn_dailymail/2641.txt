kane 's impact on friday night was extraordinary
what a delight it was to see a young english , who is leading the premier league scoring charts , come on and score for england within 79 seconds
like everyone at wembley , i left the ground with a smile on my face because of kane âs cameo appearance
but we do have to measure our praise a little bit
on friday against lithuania he was facing a league one back four
to judge kane properly you need to see him over 10 international games â and probably 10 back - to - back games
he needs those games to settle in and see what international football is about
kane ( left ) scored 79 seconds into his england debut against lithuania on friday kane wheels away to celebrate scoring for england against lithuania at wembley on friday kane 's incredible rise continued on friday when he marked his first england game with a goal what i will say is that from what i âve seen of him over the past 12 months , stepping up from under - 21 level to the tottenham first team , to the europa league and now to full international level , he has looked comfortable at every stage
he can hold the ball up , he leaps well to head the ball , he works hard and can play in either of the front two positions and his finishing does nât really need any additional comment
he can be a genuine international player but we have to see him against tougher defences first
if he starts against italy on tuesday , it will be more of a test both on the pitch and mentally
on friday , when he came on , there was nothing to lose
the game was won and their back four , which was struggling anyway , had been stretched
that âs a lovely position to be in as a fresh , young striker
when you start the focus is all on you and the team is looking to you for the breakthrough goals
that âs a different test
and he âs likely to be up against leonardo bonucci and giorgio chiellini , two of the toughest defenders around
i do believe that he will learn quickly and he can raise the bar at international level
rooney and daniel sturridge will both enjoy playing with him
i âve said before that we have nât had this range of attacking talent since i was the england manager and had to pick between alan , teddy , michael , ian wright , les ferdinand , robbie fowler and andrew cole
there are some great options for roy now
we âre not going to mess around any more with rooney playing out wide
but i can see rooney and kane playing up top together , with one dropping in behind at times
both of them can do that , so you can rotate the role
i had the same kind of pleasant problem going into the world cup
we knew alan and teddy could play together and they had a wonderful balance to them , with teddy dropping in and alan always playing close to the goal
but then michael burst on the scene with his lightning pace
i did nât want alan to play in the pocket if he played alongside michael , because that âs not his best position
so we had to work at the system so that both of them would have little spells where they would be up top : michael because of his pace and alan because of his goal threat
if you look at michael âs famous goal against argentina , he comes from deep
that âs because he had dropped in for that period of the game and that was something we had specifically worked on
i did nât want a 4 - 4 - 2 with two strikers playing square because , at international level , that âs food and drink to defenders
kane headed in england 's fourth against lithuania shortly after replacing rooney it has been queried how kane ( left ) would fit in a starting line - up alongside captain rooney kane and rooney in the same starting line - up could see formation turn to a 4 - 3 - 3 the attacking full backs , leighton baines and nathaniel clyne , would be able to provide width to the attack i think rooney and kane can do that , so that when we âre in possession it naturally changes into a 4 - 3 - 3 , with the wide men pushing high
and if they stay up square of each other , the two wide men can come back down and the full - backs can get overlaps on them
that should happen so you âre changing your shape constantly
it also gives your wide player the opportunity to come inside and , although he ca nât play on tuesday , danny welbeck did that fantastically on friday , driving into the box
he is going to win so many penalties doing that because he âs flying at people and throws defenders off their guard
and with raheem sterling , theo walcott , alex oxlade-chamberlain to add to the mix , it really does feel like a great period for english forwards
give kane a bit of time and there âs no reason to think he ca nât be an important part of that
it is not just kane who we have to be careful not to overpraise
we need to be realistic about this england team , too
the qualifying campaign is telling us very little about whether roy hodgson âs team have progressed since the world cup
we âre in control of the games and dominating possession
but we need to know how to play when we do nât have the ball and whether we can keep possession under pressure
we âre not really going to know if they âre good enough until june 2016
friendlies wo nât give us a real idea , as teams like italy will be chopping and changing
roy hodgson is refusing to get carried away with the hype that is surrounding kane danny welbeck ( left ) produced a man - of - the - match display in england 's win against lithuania raheem sterling ( left ) scored his first england goal in the victory over lithuania on friday as the world cup demonstrated , if you âre a little bit short , two years of work can all be over in 180 minutes of football
there âs nothing like a tournament to apply some cold reality
i think gary cahill is a really good defender but he and phil jagielka struggled against italy and uruguay at the world cup
we do nât know whether that weakness is still there
and we do nât have the depth of defenders , because phil jones , chris smalling and john stones have nât seized their chance yet
our wide forward players like danny welbeck and raheem sterling look great but they do nât have to defend that much
the problem will come when they get dragged back against much better sides
and let âs see how well the full - backs stand up when they are put under pressure
it was down that left side with danny welbeck and leighton baines that italy caught us out in the world cup
phil jones ( left ) started alongside gary cahill in defence for england against lithuania danny welbeck ( second right ) celebrates england 's second goal with gary cahill and raheem sterling if england have less of the possession against italy on tuesday it would be probably be beneficial in the long term
we wo nât have been used to playing without the ball
major international tournaments are like being an olympic athlete who has to be ready for a few days of competition every four years
let âs hope england are up to the olympic standard because we âre only going to find out next june .
