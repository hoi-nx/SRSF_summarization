sir alex ferguson made a phone call to blair as part of a desperate attempt to keep united in the 1999 - 2000 fa cup , a man close to the talks has revealed
but the then prime minister was about to go into a meeting with yugoslavia president slobodan milosevic in a bid to bring an end to the raging war in kosovo and could not speak
as a result , sir alex ferguson admitted defeat and united ended up going to fifa 's inaugural club world championship in brazil in an attempt to boost the fa cup 's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to win the right to host the 2006 world cup , and pulling out of a competition they had won a year previously
sir alex ferguson ( right ) asked blair ( left ) if united could compete in the 1999 - 2000 fa cup united were asked by blair 's envoy to play at the inaugural club world championship in 2000 united withdrew from the 1999 - 2000 fa cup in order to help the fa cup 's bid to host the 2006 world cup andy is now general manager at fc united , the club set up in protest at the glazer family 's takeover of united in 2005 who are set to move to a new home in april
but in june of 1999 he was an member of the influential independent manchester united supporters association and in regular contact with the fiery scotsman
andy , who made the revelation in an interview with the fanzine red news , explained the unlikely story to sportsmail
' united came out as the villains in all of it , ' andy said
' but both sir alex ferguson and then chairman martin edwards were under incredible pressure from tony banks , the prime minister 's envoy for the world cup bid , and from david davies , the fa cup 's acting chief executive to pull out of the fa cup and go to brazil for the fifa tournament
' as fans we wanted to find ways of keeping them in the fa cup and we thought we had come up with a solution
' it involved moving some of the fixtures to earlier in the season and creating a gap before united were due to go in january during which , if the fa cup would move the tie , they could play their third round cup match
' united were under pressure to withdraw from the fa cup , according to andy ( centre ) andy explained that the plan had gathered momentum , but added that things took a turn for the worse at the charity shield
' we were playing arsenal and martin edwards was sat next to the new minister for sport , kate hoey
she made some remark along the lines of " i believe you 're ruining this season 's fa cup " and when word of that got back to alex ferguson he was furious
' i spoke to him over the phone and he said : " that 's it , they 're forcing us out
f * * * them
we 're going to brazil and that 's the end of it "
' then he told me that he had tried to call blair and he could n't sort it
' i 'd seen blair on the news that morning going to yugoslavia so i asked alex ferguson what had been said
' he told me that blair had told him he was about to go into a meeting with slobodan milosevic and that was the end of it
' blair could not answer alex ferguson 's request as he was about to speak to slobodan milosevic ( pictured ) the saga turned into a disaster all around , with england 's world cup bid failing and united drawing with mexicans necaxa ( with david beckham sent off and alex ferguson sent to the stands for complaining about the decision ) and defeated by brazil vasco da gama
sir alex ferguson would have the last laugh , however , with his side returning to england to romp to the premier league title , finishing 18 points ahead of arsenal
in the summer of 1999 peacekeepers entered kosovo as slobodan milosevic 's forces withdrew
he would eventually be found dead in his cell in 2006 during a war crimes prosecution at the hague at which he was defending himself .
