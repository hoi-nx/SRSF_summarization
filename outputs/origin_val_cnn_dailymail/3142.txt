psychologist johannes eichstaedt led a team that analysed 826million tweets from 1,400 counties in the us for words associated with anger , anxiety and other emotions , to emotionally profile users
they found that counties where people âs tweets included hostile , aggressive and lazy words , such as â jealous â and â bored â had higher rates of death from heart attacks and strokes , whereas places with more positive tweeters had less
this suggests that negative and angry language used on social media could be used to predict medical conditions , but the field of research is young .
