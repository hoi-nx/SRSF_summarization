â i remember been thrown into the back of a taxi with black bin liners full of our belongings and packed off from the family home
â we never really saw the end of black bin liners over the next few years as we moved from squalor to squalor , 14 times in less than two years , from back to back houses where the toilet was outside to rat infested damp houses where we lived and slept in just one room
zoora shah ( left ) served 14 years for the murder of azam after poisoning the drug dealer 's food when she feared he planned to sexually abuse her daughters â my mother âs attempt to provide her children with the security of a home came at the expense of being abused by azam over years
a man that she thought would save her children from an uncertain and insecure future , little did she know he would be the exact opposite
â my mother had sent me to pakistan at the age of 12 when she felt i was at risk of his abuse
last week i was selected to stand as the prospective parliamentary candidate for bradford west , where i was born and raised , and where i am raising my own family
â i was only six when my father abandoned my mother with two young children and pregnant with a third when he eloped with the neighbour âs 16 - year - old daughter
â i remember being thrown into the back of a taxi with black bin liners full of our belongings and packed off from the family home ... we never really saw the end of black bin liners over the next few years as we moved from squalor to squalor
â [ our new home ] was purchased with the sale of my mother âs wedding jewellery but in someone else âs name , azam âs name
my mother âs attempt to provide her children with the security of a home came at the expense of being abused by azam
â following years of anti-depressants , failed suicide attempts and feeling desperate and destitute she snapped
she killed the man who abused her
â my world was turned upside down , how i became a mother to my two siblings who were 11 and 13 at the time ... i remember the first day i visited my mother in prison , when i left it was like leaving a crying child at nursery for the first time
i now became a mother to my mother
â for me to be selected as a prospective parliamentary candidate is not really about me , it âs the dream of my mother ... when i expressed my interest last year for politics ... my mother understood that her story from 22 years ago would resurface , it would open up wounds , but she blessed me as she knew it âs what made me this way
â when my younger sister was growing up and my mother felt she was now at risk , and following years of antidepressants , failed suicide attempts and feeling desperate and destitute she snapped
' she killed the man who abused her
â mrs shah said she was forced to become a mother to her sisters , who were aged 11 and 13

â my life now revolved around solicitor and prison visits , â she said
â i did nât know how to run a house
â i remember the first day i visited my mother at new hall prison , when i left it was like leaving a crying child at nursery for the first time , i now became a mother to my mother
we lost the house , we lost everything and the moving around started all over again

â later on that evening on the journey back from london my friend asked me how i felt
i responded i would know once i was in my mother âs arms
â describing her mother âs reaction to her selection as the local candidate , she added : â when i did finally get home that night i was selected , my mother sat up in her bed and held me close whilst i cried
â we cried together knowing that whilst my past and my present are the dreams of my mother and her inspiration for me , my future is about the dreams i have for my own daughter
she is my inspiration to bring change and equality for the world in which she is growing up in , the community we live in and the wider society
