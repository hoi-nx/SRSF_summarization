uk 's first world war debt has finally be repaid in full â more than 100 years after the outbreak of the conflict
the government repaid some Â£ 1.9billion still owed to more than 100,000 people who held ' war bonds ' , issued in 1917 to help fund the military effort
george osborne said he could pay off the debts because he can borrow the money cheaper elsewhere
more than 100 years after it started , the first world war debt has been paid off by the coalition government the government was paying 3.5 per cent in interest to the 120,000 people who bought the bonds in 1917
the debt management office estimates that uk has paid some Â£ 5.5 billion in total interest on the loans since 1917
current low interest rates mean the government is able to pay off the debt with new bonds which pay a much lower rate of interest
mr george osborne said : ' this is a moment for uk to be proud of
we can , at last , pay off the debts uk incurred to fight the first world war
' it is a sign of our fiscal credibility and it 's a good deal for this generation of taxpayers
it 's also another fitting way to remember that extraordinary sacrifice of the past

the tories claim that uk can borrow at such low interest rates because the government has got a grip of the public finances and international investors know they will get their money back if they lend it to the uk
they claim the labour 's spending plans would see billons added to the national debt
treasury secretary david gauke said : ' there is a clear choice at this election : sticking with the competence and stability of david cameron and the conservatives ' long - term economic plan that 's securing a better future for uk â the deficit has been halved , there are 1.85 million more people with the security of a regular wage and the economy is recovering from labour 's great recession

' the warning came after labour 's shadow chancellor balls claimed george osborne 's spending plans would mean Â£ 70billion of cuts â more than double the amount admitted by david cameron and george osborne
he said if the tories were to keep to their promises to protect spending on health , schools and overseas aid , this would mean the foreign office and department for transport being shut down altogether
mr balls said the government 's cuts were ' so extreme that they would lead to the smallest police force since comparable records began , the smallest army since cromwell and over a third of older people receiving social care losing their entitlement to it '
he added : ' the tories now have a choice
they can either say that these unprecedented , extreme and close - to - impossible cuts to our police , armed forces and social care are the true consequences of their spending plans , ' he said
' or they can confess that their plans are in fact impossible to achieve without breaking their promise to protect the nhs
' if david cameron and george osborne can not spell out how their sums add up for non-protected departments in order to achieve their fiscal surplus , the uk people can only conclude - and would be right to conclude - that alternative plans do exist : to cut nhs spending and introduce charging
' david cameron and george osborne must come clean or the uk people will draw their own conclusions
