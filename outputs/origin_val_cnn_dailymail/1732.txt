the extent of the fall - out between jevans and the rfu hierarchy has started to emerge since the england 2015 chief executive suddenly quit last friday
as sportsmail revealed , jevans had become so exasperated with the increasing level of interference in her forensic planning of the world cup that she felt she could nât work at twickenham any longer
but it âs now understood that the rfu had become equally fed up with the way jevans always demanded her own way â as in her previous role as director of sport at the london olympics â and did nât properly accommodate the host nation position at a world cup where the financial guarantee stops with them
jevans resigned as chief executive of england 's world cup 2015 organising committee last friday and although jevans resigned of her own accord , the rfu made no attempt to change her mind
the crucial relationship between rfu chief executive ian ritchie and jevans had began to unravel over the last few months and culminated in a series of huge rows in ian ritchie âs office at twickenham last week
this led rfu chairman bill beaumont to tell a member of staff : â we âve got a major problem here
â it was ian ritchie who was responsible for signing the highly combative jevans , whom he knew from his role as ceo of the all england club where jevans is an influential committee member
the exact flashpoint that forced jevans to resign less than six months before the start of the tournament is not known
but staffing levels at er 2015 are known to concern the rfu with nearly 200 already on the er 2015 payroll
the relationship between rfu chief ian ritchie and jevans had began to unravel over the last few months sources say ian ritchie walked through er2015 âs expanded office space recently , wondering what the huge army of employees actually did
the 1991 world cup , hosted by five unions , had been organised by less than 25 full - time staff â not many more than turned up on the er 2015 team recently to arrange a single fanzone
the split with ian ritchie also left jevans isolated as she made no attempt to embrace the rugby fraternity or commercial agencies like img
certainly , the clubs regarded her as very difficult to deal with â unplayable some even said
also , ian ritchie is not the jovial , happy - go - lucky ceo he portrays on the surface but a ruthless , cold - eyed businessman who has seen off jevans in the same ruthless way he brought her in to replace paul vaughan ian ritchie âs desire to curb er2015 excess and bring the organising committee into the bosom of the rfu can be seen by the installation of rfu finance director stephen brown as the new er2015 managing director
jevans had previously held the role of director of sport at the london olympics the international rugby board have kept their distance from the jevans walk - out
but they have to take some of the blame for the crazy structure of the world cup where they receive an Â£ 80million guarantee but still keep sponsorship , corporate hospitality and tv rights while leaving the host nation and the organising committee to sell the tickets and fight for recognition
jevans has made it clear she will not be explaining the personal reasons behind her departure any time soon
the international rugby board , headed by bernard lapasset , have kept their distance from the jevans saga it has nât helped the strained relationship between the premier league and the fa over homegrown player numbers that the clubs kept fa chairman greg dyke waiting for one hour and 20 minutes outside their piccadilly meeting last week
greg dyke had prepared a presentation but was nât given the opportunity to address the clubs
fa chairman greg dyke was not given the opportunity to address the premier league clubs last week eden hazard , chelsea âs world - class forward who shuns the trappings of a superstar , has re-organised his representative management in keeping with his low - profile image
