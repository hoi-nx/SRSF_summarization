great - grandfather mr lloyd wilce said : ' all those years ago i never thought for a second i would last this long as a councillor
' in fact , around three years ago i had a spell of poor health and i did n't think i would last much longer
' but here i am , and i enjoy just being part of the community
i 've always liked joining in with things and being part of what is going on in the area

he joined in a bid to improve cinderford 's sports facilities and one of his early political achievements was raising enough money to increase the size of the town 's swimming pool
' i had been on a proper running track and we had nothing like that in cinderford - there was no swimming pool or sports facilities
' when i got demobbed and i had an interest in those things , and there was some councillor making moves and thinking we wanted to have those things , so i got involved

' mr lloyd wilce had two sons with wife mary and after 17 years in the outfitting trade the pair took over the village hall in steam mills , gloucestershire
they applied for a pub licence and ran it as the old engine inn for around 25 years before he retired and mary passed away four years ago , aged 77

' i was n't going to stand but i had my arm twisted - people said i had been doing it so long i might as well keep going , ' he said
' i 'm pretty sure with all these other parties like ukip that there will be an election this year and i 'll probably go against someone else
' i do n't know that i 'm very happy about ukip to be honest
' they promise an awful lot and from what i 've seen of farage i 'm not sure their ideas are good ones
' i would n't put myself forward if i did n't think i was going to get in , but i 'll have to wait and see i guess
' speaking of david cameron 's announcement that he would leave after three terms as pm , mr lloyd wilce remained sceptical
' he might change his mind , ' he said
