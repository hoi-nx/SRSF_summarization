the us has launched airstrikes against targets in tikrit to support iraqi ground forces trying to push isil militants out of the city , a senior official said
iraqi requested the strikes , which began wednesday and are ' ongoing , ' according to the unnamed us official
an associated press correspondent in tikrit reported hearing warplanes overhead late wednesday , followed by multiple explosions
in an address to the nation wednesday evening , prime minister haider al-abadi predicted success in tikrit but did not say the us was providing airstrikes
' we have started the final phase of the operation in tikrit , ' he said
" you will liberate your ground , not anyone but you , " he said , in a speech to the iraqi people
al-abadi praised all the groups involved in the battle against the islamic state group , including the so - called popular mobilization forces , which the us calls iran - backed militias , the sunnis tribes and coalition forces
he fell short of confirming that the coalition is playing a direct role in tikrit
us airstrikes in tikrit raise highly sensitive questions about participating in an iraqi campaign that has been spearheaded by iraqi shiite militias trained and equipped by iran , an avowed us adversary
difficulties : militias like the imam ali brigades , one of whose members is shown , have encircled isil forces but have been unable to dislodge them from the city iran has provided artillery and other weaponry for the tikrit battle , and senior iran advisers have helped iraqi coordinate the offensive
iraqi pointedly did not request us air support when it launched the offensive in early march and recently , the offensive has lost momentum
col warren , a pentagon spokesman , said wednesday the iraqi forces have encircled tikrit but not yet made significant inroads into the heavily defended city limits
' they are stalled , ' he said
the us has hundreds of military advisers in iraqi helping its security forces plan operations against the islamic state , which occupies large chunks of northern and western iraqi
but the us has said it is not coordinating any military actions with the iran
warren said that at baghdad 's request the us began aerial surveillance over tikrit in recent days and is sharing the collected intelligence with the iraqi government
the us - led air campaign , launched in august and joined by several european allies , has allowed iraqi forces to halt the isis group 's advance and claw back some of the territory militants seized last summer
uneasy : militiamen guarding the front line in the battle between iraqi forces and isil militants , a battle which has ' stalled ' recently but the growing iran presence on the ground has complicated the mission , with washington refusing to work directly with a country it views as a regional menace , yet is currently embroiled with iran in sensitive negotiations over a nuclear deal
the prominent role of the shiite militias in the fight to retake tikrit and other parts of iraqi 's sunnis heartland has meanwhile raised concerns that the offensive could deepen the country 's sectarian divide and drive sunnis into the arms of the islamic state group
hadi al-amiri , leader of the badr organization and a commander of iraqi 's shiite militias , told reporters in samarra : ' if we need them ( the us - led coalition ) we will tell them we need them
but we do n't need the coalition
we have surveillance planes over our heads already
the participation of us planes hinders out operations ... if we need it , we 'll tell our government what we need
' he claimed that the militias , the overwhelming majority of which is made up of shiite fighters , have their own surveillance drones
' we buy them anywhere , ' he said
' we have our own ... controlled by iraqi
' a series of us airstrikes north of tikrit , in the vicinity of beiji , in recent weeks has had the indirect benefit of tying down isil forces that might otherwise be operating in defense of tikrit
on wednesday , for example , the us military said it had conducted five airstrikes tuesday near beiji , home of a major oil refinery that isil has sought to capture
that bombing targeted isil combat units and destroyed what the us called an isil ' fighting position , ' as well as an isil armored vehicle
warren said the iraqi are discovering how difficult it can be to carry out ground operations in an urban area
' we heard quite a bit from the iraqi and some even from the iran â some fairly high - confidence statements about how rapidly the operations for tikrit would go , " warren said
" we 've seen otherwise
' ' i think it 's important that the iraqi understand that what would be most helpful to them is a reliable partner in this fight against isil , ' warren said
' reliable , professional , advanced military capabilities are something that reside very clearly and very squarely with the coalition
