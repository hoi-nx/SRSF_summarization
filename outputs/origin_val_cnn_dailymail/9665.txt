a mysterious object has been spotted flying through an argentinian news broadcast , leading to claims of a ufo
the disc - shaped object was seen moving across a studio backdrop during a live broadcast in buenos aires last week
however , several outlets and experts are dismissing the claims of a ufo , pointing out several errors in the short clip
' mysterious object ' : the disc - shaped object can be spotted in the top - left corner of the background the object was seen moving across what is purported to be a large widow during a studio broadcast from todo noticias , aka tn , an argentinian cable news channel
as the anchors discuss a topic on the daily agenda , a disc - shaped object is seen zooming across the skyline in the background
the ' ufo ' was first reported by mysteriousuniverse.org , who writes that the broadcast took place on february 28th before it was posted on youtube
unfortunately for alien enthusiasts , there are several indications that the ufo is nothing but a hoax
several anomalies in the short clip indicates that the background in the studio has been tampered with
ufo ? the object zooms across the skyline in the background behind the broadcasters myth debunked : the ufo has been dismissed as a fake by experts , who has pointed out several flaws in what they call an ' animation hoax ' pie in the sky : the disc - shaped ufo is now in the top left corner having ' flown ' behind the skyscraper ' this was most likely an animation hoax because of some common editing errors that appear to be present , ' hansen , the former lead investigator of the syfy channel 's ' fact or faked : paranormal files ' , told the huffington post
raã«lian movement , also known as raã«lian movement or the raã«lian movement , is a ufo religion that was founded in 1974
the raã«lian movement teaches that life on earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials , which they call the elohim
members of this species appeared human and when having personal contacts with the descendants of the humans they made , they previously misinformed ( on purpose ) early humanity that they were angels , cherubim or gods
raÃ«lians believe messengers , or prophets , of the elohim include buddha , jesus , and others who informed humans of each era
hansen highlights two particular errors , one being proof that the ufo is superimposed on top of wires on an antenna mast at the 33 - second mark , and the second that the ufo disappears before it supposedly flies behind a building
he also highlights that if the station really had captured a flying alien vessel , he believes they would have either mentioned it during the live broadcast or used it later for publicity
this comes just a week after another alleged ufo spotting during a south american broadcast
the production crew in lima , peru , were filming a programme when they interrupted it in order to focus on what appears to be a ' ufo ' hovering over the city
the purple - colored disc - shaped object can be seen hovering in the sky near a construction site , but so far , there has been no official explanation for the object
thousands of people have taken to social media to discuss what they think the mysterious purple object is and the video has already been viewed more than 100,000 times .
