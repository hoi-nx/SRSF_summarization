dawn bruce , from picollecta said : ' i think the reason pieces like these sell so well is because of how iconic the films are
' the my fair lady dress is one of audrey hepburn 's most popular films , along with breakfast at tiffany 's , and the style in that film is held in high regard
' it 's the same with pieces from casablanca and wizard of oz , it represents a time in cinema that seems so far away now , so different from ours

' many people now are much more interested in buying a piece of movie history than say an antique vase
it feels more personal to them as films are a huge part of people 's lives
' i think there is a bit of competition between high end collectors
people with private collections want to own the most iconic , instantly recognisable pieces
