in the stockton-on-tees hall of fame , kilty is sandwiched between john walker , the inventor of the matchstick , and george stephenson , who envisaged the first passenger steam train

as a 13 - year - old , for seven months he shared one room in a homeless hostel with his parents and four siblings after the family ran into financial difficulties
citing his â mental strength â , he decided to give athletics one last roll of the dice
it paid off with a 60m gold medal at the world indoor championships in sopot last year , where he surprised everyone - including the bookmakers who had him at 33 - 1 - by beating jamaicans nesta carter in the final
boosted by his extra income , kilty has rejoined the linford christie training group of which he was a part in the run - up to london 2012
asked after his golden 6.51sec season âs - best run on sunday what christie had brought to the party , kilty did a double gun salute

i âve got a bit more bicep there , â he said , â we did nât necessarily train for the indoors but if you saw the semi-final i dropped my arms and could have run about 6.45sec
â he doubts whether even the americans and jamaicans , including usain bolt , could beat him over the distance
â kim collins beat me a couple of times but a lot of people beat me early season
in a championship i think it would be very difficult
â he has now set his sights on breaking that hallowed 100m 10 - second barrier outdoors
â some people think i âm a spring runner but you âve only seen me on the scene for 12 months now
â if you watched the race today and saw the way i ran away from the field you can see what is going to happen outdoors
