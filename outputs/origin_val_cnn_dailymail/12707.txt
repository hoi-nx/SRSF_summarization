amy 's kitchen says it 's recalling nearly 74,000 cases of its products that could contain listeria
in a statement released through the fda on sunday , amy 's kitchen said that it was voluntarily recalling the products after learning from one of its suppliers that it may have received organic spinach that was possibly contaminated with listeria monocytogenes
the california - based organic and natural food company said it was n't aware of any reports of illness connected with its products , but was recalling them " out of an abundance of caution
" the recalled products , which are listed on the fda 's website and were distributed throughout the united states and canada , include multiple types of vegetable lasagna , tofu scrambles , spinach pizza , enchiladas , brown rice and vegetable bowls and stuffed pasta shells
listeriosis , a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria , primarily affects the elderly , pregnant women , newborns and people with weakened immune systems , according to the centers for disease control and prevention
in the united states , an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year ; approximately 16 % of these illnesses result in death
cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters or stillbirth
