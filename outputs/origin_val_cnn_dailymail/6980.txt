he saw the decline of the fish industry years ago and at the age of 52 decided to completely change career

their son ashley , a tv host on the history channel and recently dubbed ' scotland 's indiana jones ' is also a director of the company and is as hands on as possible when he is up from london
' from time to time , on a full moon , i go rod fishing for wild sea trout , ' he says
' it is so delicious and dad is thrilled when i bring some home for him to cook for the restaurant
' an expert in local history , ashley explains the suitability of the restaurant : ' caithness was the first area in the uk to adopt farming as a lifestyle around 4000bc
' ' the captains galley maintain this tradition by selecting and serving the best veg from the richest agricultural soils in the uk
' my father is a more a craftsman than a chef
where most chefs spoil fish by over cooking it and smothering it with sauces , he gently cooks the fish and let 's the wild sea taste speak for itself
