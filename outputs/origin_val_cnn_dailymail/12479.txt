port gibson , mississippi an african - u.s. man is found hanging from a tree in the mississippi woods with bedsheets around his neck attached to a limb 15 feet above the ground
there 's no chair in sight
his feet are 2 to 3 feet off the ground
his hands are not bound
is this a suicide ? or is it a lynching -- a shadow from the south 's history of racial violence re-emerging ? those were the big questions friday , one day after authorities found a man 's body with bedsheets around his neck in port gibson , a small town of just over 1,500 people in rural claiborne county , about 60 miles southwest of jackson , the state capital
evidence collected so far does n't suggest foul play in the death , law enforcement officials said
for that reason , suicide is the early theory as the likely manner of death , the officials said
claiborne county sheriff lucas on friday identified the man as byrd
even though authorities have confirmed his name , they still have a lot of work ahead to figure out how byrd died and who is responsible
" it could take a week , it could take two weeks , it could take months , " lucas said
authorities expect to receive a preliminary report next week on what caused byrd 's death , alway , special agent in charge of the fbi office in jackson , said friday afternoon at a press conference
he said 30 agents from the fbi , the mississippi bureau of investigation and other agencies are looking for friends and family of the victim " that might help paint a picture on the cause of death of mr. byrd
" agents have finished searching the area where the body was found and are looking at a " storage location " byrd owned that might yield information , alway said
alway said the fbi is communicating with the family and wo n't comment on rumors circulating about the death
" the community deserves answers , " he said
" the family deserves answers
" the body was found at 10:21 a.m. thursday , deep in a forest about 500 yards from the house byrd was renting , according to lucas
a skullcap had been pulled over his head , the sheriff said
that house was the last place where byrd had been seen on march 2 , according to the sheriff
he was reported missing a week later , spurring a search
the body was found by staffers from the mississippi department of wildlife , fisheries and parks who were taking part in the search , lucas said
thursday was the first time authorities looked specifically in the wooded area where the body was found , according to the sheriff
a family member who did not want to be identified said byrd was not acting out of the ordinary in the days before he went missing
he went to church , he worked and occasionally ventured to a casino , according to the family member , who described byrd as a " good , hardworking man
" byrd had been in prison
he was convicted in 1980 of murdering a woman , but was paroled in 2006 , according to the mississippi department of corrections
no one has given any indication publicly whether byrd had enemies
what distinguishes a suicidal hanging from a lynching ? martin , a veteran crime scene investigator and president of crime scene forensics llc , said he knew nothing about the mississippi case but had investigated other deaths by hanging or strangulation
injuries to the dead person indicate lynching , he said , because it means the dead person struggled with other people before being hanged
when people are strangled by somebody else , investigators sometimes find the deceased has grabbed at the ligature and left finger marks and even bits of fingernails around his neck , he said
the direction of the ligature is another indicator , martin said
when people hang themselves , the rope often rides up directly behind the ears , he said
when a person is hanged by other people , the ligature moves differently on the neck , he said
martin said these are general observations and that " the facts are what make or break the case
" mississippi naacp chapter president derrick johnson issued a statement calling on " federal authorities to immediately investigate the hanging death of mr. byrd
" the fbi already is looking into any federal civil rights violations and has a forensics team on the scene
the u.s. justice department civil rights division and u.s. attorney for the southern district of mississippi are also investigating , according to a spokeswoman for the justice department
the mississippi bureau of investigation also is investigating
fbi supervisory special agent pack told wapt that " it 's too early to say what happened or speculate about the cause or the manner " of death
" we do n't know what happened out there , " pack said
" we do n't know if it was a suicide , if it was a homicide
that 's why we investigate these types of cases
" lucas , who is himself african - american , said friday that he 's worried people will jump to the conclusion that byrd was murdered and that race was a factor
" i do n't want the community to go excited saying it was a white - on - black thing
that 's the worst thing that can happen , is people making it into a race issue , " lucas said
" and that 's my biggest fear
and i do n't want that to happen
