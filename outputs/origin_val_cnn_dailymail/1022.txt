luke shaw will come through this , but he is playing like he has the handbrake on
is he being overcoached ? luke shaw was substituted at half - time in the 2 - 1 fa cup quarter - final loss against arsenal at old trafford
what has happened to the marauding full back who played with such freedom for saints ? he is only 19 and he will come again , but the player united signed for Â£ 30million would hit crosses on the run and did his best work at the top end of the pitch
luke shaw has struggled to recapture his saints form at united luke shaw was taken off by united manager louis van gaal during half - time against arsenal luke shaw has not progressed in a similar manner to his former saints team - mate nathaniel clyne ( right ) he is nât doing that now
it looks to me as if he âs thinking too much and that will be down to him trying to carry out instructions
luke shaw is going to be a star , but when you consider how nathaniel clyne is developing , why is nât luke shaw doing the same ? he is a young man , who has had his injuries , but he is struggling and was taken off at half - time in a reshuffle that ultimately did nât pay off .
