barca kicked off the biggest week of their season in style by beating eibar 2 - 0 thanks to a messi double that took him past cristiano ronaldo as la liga âs top scorer this season
barca play manchestser city on wednesday , just four days before the decisive clasico against real madrid at the camp nou next sunday , and messi led them to victory with his 31st and 32nd goals of the season
he even scored a goal he had never scored before in la liga â a header direct from a corner
messi wheels away in celebration of his first half penalty , which put barca into a 1 - 0 lead the barca star scored his 16th and 17th la liga goals of 2015 as his side strolled to victory at the start of the year cristiano ronaldo collected the balon dâor and sent an â i âm coming for you â message to messi who has one more world player award than the portuguese
but instead it has been messi pursuing , catching and over-taking cristiano ronaldo in scoring stakes in spain
the real madrid striker was 12 goals clear of messi but the barca number 10 has scored 17 goals in 10 games since the turn of the year and is now in top spot like his team
this was the first time eibar had played barca in spain âs top flight â it is with the catalan club that the contrasts are most stark
they have 5,250 supporters crammed into the league âs smallest ground while barca âs 99,000 capacity camp nou is la liga âs largest
barca âs budget runs to â¬ 540m euros , eibar âs is â¬ 16m ; barca make â¬ 140m from their television deal , eibar make â¬ 14m ; barca âs sponsor qatar airways pays them â¬ 35m a year while the minnows are paid â¬ 130,000 by a local steel company
on the pitch there are massive differences too
and the home team came into the game having scored 34 goals â six fewer than messi
although it was the argentine who got the opening goal barca had to suffer for the breakthrough
neymar ( left ) and rakitic ( right ) join messi in celebration of his 31st minute spot - kick they almost scored with their first attack when first messi and then rakitic went close after suarez and adriano had combined down the left
but with a relatively inexperienced midfield trio of sergi roberto between , rafinha and rakitic , and faced with a five - man eibar defence , the first half hour was heavy going
luis enrique had decided not to risk javier mascherano who was a booking away from missing next week âs clasico but his presence in a midfield already missing the injured sergi busquets was keenly felt at times as the leaders failed to control the game
messi left five eibar players behind with one dribble that started inside his own half but the move broke down as soon as he played in a team - mate and eibar remained on level terms
resistance was finally broken on the half hour when suarez went on a driving run into the area and released messi
neymar skips past the challenge of eibar 's borja ekiza during the la liga clash his shot cannoned off a defender and hit the arm of eibar defender borja ekiza
the referee pointed to the spot and although keeper jaime jiminez dived the right way messi âs penalty beat him
the goal sent him one goal past cristiano ronaldo in the top scorer list in spain
it âs been an incredible turnaround since the real madrid striker raced to a 12 goal advantage over his nemesis earlier in the campaign
neymar might have doubled barca âs lead but messi âs cross from the byline was cleared before it reached the brazilian and eibar made it to the break just the one goal down
messi was at his very best at times and made a sensational 70 - yard run during the first half messi set up barca âs first chance of the second period when he slipped neymar through in the six - yard box only for team - mate to try and fail to nutmeg the goalkeeper
having failed to create the second he scored it , and with the most unusual of messi goals
rakitic took a corner from the right and messi found space 10 yards out
his header down skidded off the turf and past a defender on the line to make it 2 - 0
there was time for 35 - year - old xavi to come and make his 750th appearance for barca as the visitors saw out the remaining minutes
federico piovaccari hit the bar but barca took the points to mean they stay top a week ahead of the clasico and four days ahead of the visit of manchester city .
