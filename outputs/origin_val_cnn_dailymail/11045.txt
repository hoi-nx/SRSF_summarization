militants fighting for the islamic state in syria have released sickening footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy

it also carries the logo of one of the group 's official halab - based propaganda arms , halab
the sickening film is reminiscent of the gruesome video showing the burning to death of jordanian pilot muath al-kaseasbeh , in that it begins with a lengthy interview with the orange - jumpsuit wearing victim speaking while sat at a table in a darkened room
muhammad is seen giving details of the charges against him , which are understood to relate to accusations he was working as part of a spy network over the border in southern turkey

seconds later the video cuts back to show muhammad face on , his eyes closed in fear
the militant shoots the victim once in the back of the head , before standing over him and firing several more bullets into his neck once muhammad lies prone on the floor of the courtyard
