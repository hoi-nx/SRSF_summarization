the soldier pulled over motorists who he thought were driving poorly before telling them they had been breaking the speed limit
walster was caught when on january 22 he pulled over a car at lindis retail park before taking their personal details

prosecutor harris said : ' on each occasion , it seems to be that he believed the manner of driving was not up to standard
' walster pulled a motorist over using the flashing blue light as they passed by lindis retail park ( pictured ) in lincoln magistrates ' court ms harris added : ' a motorist was followed on tritton road by a car with a flashing blue light
the defendant asked him to sit in the back of his car and he was asked questions
' as a result of the investigation , the defendant was arrested and in his vehicle was a notebook containing personal details
' he accepted that book belonged to him and he did take names and addresses of members of the public
' while being interviewed by police , walster admitted he had impersonated a police officer on another occasion
his defence lawyer told the court that being arrested had been more terrifying for walster than his tour of afghanistan
dave clapham , defending , said : ' in essence , what he says is that the lights were bought off ebay and used to stop his mates on the barracks as a joke
' for whatever reason this continued into the public arena
he does not know why
he just says he has been a bloody fool and completely stupid
the soldier even asked drivers to get back into the back of his car to give them a telling off , lincoln magistrates ' court ( pictured ) heard ' he tells me the process of being arrested was more terrifying than his tour of afghanistan
' the consequences of your sentence have ramifications that could go far higher
not only could he be overlooked for promotions bonuses , he could face a reduction in rank - ultimately it could lead to his discharge
he is a good soldier
' after the case , pc robert mcghee , from lincolnshire police , said : ' offences of this type are really very serious
' police officers are trained to the highest of standards and the job they carry out every day requires not only application of that training but a thorough knowledge of the law , as well as practice and procedure
impersonating an officer carries hefty penalties for good reason
' we are pleased with the outcome of the court case as it is a fitting sentence
we hope this serves as a stark warning to not only the gentleman involved but also to others that police and the courts take a very dim view of anyone acting in this fashion
' an army spokesperson said : ' all those who are found to fall short of the army 's high standards are dealt with as appropriate through the discipline process , up to and including discharge
