jasem emwazi , 51 , feels there is ' no proof ' that the black - clad knife - wielding man featured in chilling hostage execution videos is his eldest child , it was reported today
his kuwait lawyer , al-hashah , told kuwait 's respected al-qabas newspaper : ' he is not sure that he [ jihadi john ] is his son
' there is no proof that the man shown in the videos and photographs is his son , as the media has reported in the last few days
' the lawyer 's comments appear to contradict earlier remarks made by mr emwazi , who is said to have told a colleague that his son is ' a dog , an animal , a terrorist ' and called for him to be killed
mr emwazi , who moved to the britain from his native kuwait in 1994 and holds a britain passport , was seen in public for the first time today since he was questioned by kuwait police at the weekend about his son 's activities
a kuwait journalist present at a meeting in his lawyer 's office in the upmarket salmiya district of kuwait said mr emwazi looked ' very scared ' and was shaking
mr al-hashah said the father is not responsible for what his son has done and that there is nothing to prove his father agreed with his son , or helped him in any way
the lawyer added : ' jasem emwazi is under stress
many people are calling him names
he ca n't leave his home and ca n't walk outside
he is scared of people because everyone believes all the rumours that have been written about him

mr al-hashah said mr emwazi and his eldest daughter asma , 25 , are currently in kuwait
his wife ghaneya , 47 , and other children are in britain
