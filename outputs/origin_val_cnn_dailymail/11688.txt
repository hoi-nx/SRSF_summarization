a new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases , it has emerged
an official source told ap that the secret service will conduct drone flights between 1am and 4am over the coming weeks in restricted airspace over washington d.c. during missions , agents will look at how to interfere with rogue consumer - level drones , which commonly carry video cameras but are powerful enough to carry small amounts of explosives
the challenge for the secret service is quickly detecting a rogue drone flying near the white house or the president 's location , then within moments either hacking it to seize control over its flight or jamming its signal to send it off course or make it crash
growing trend : a new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases , it has emerged the secret service has said only that it will openly test drones over washington d.c. , but it declined to provide details such as when it will fly , how many drones , over what parts of the city , for how long and for what purposes
it decided to tell the public in advance about the tests out of concern that people who saw the drones might be alarmed , particularly in the wake of the drones spotted recently over paris at night
flying overnight also diminishes the chances that radio jamming would accidentally affect nearby businesses , drivers , pedestrians and tourists
it is illegal under the u.s. communications act to sell or use signal jammers except for narrow purposes by government agencies
depending on a drone 's manufacturer and capabilities , its flight - control and video - broadcasting systems commonly use the same common radio frequencies as popular wi-fi and bluetooth technologies
jamming by the secret service - depending on how powerfully or precisely it works - could disrupt nearby internet networks or phone conversations until it 's turned off
testing in the real - world environment around the white house would reveal unexpected effects on jamming efforts from nearby buildings , monuments or tall trees
signals emanating from an inbound drone - such as coming from a video stream back to its pilot - could allow the secret service to detect and track it
federal agencies generally need approval to jam signals from the u.s. telecommunications advisory agency , the commerce department 's national telecommunications and information administration
found : the recreational drone that landed on the white house south lawn is seen in this secret service handout that agency declined to tell the ap whether the secret service sought permission because it said such requests are not routinely made public
the federal aviation administration has confirmed it formally authorized the secret service to fly the drones and granted it a special waiver to fly them over washington d.c.
the agency declined to provide specifics about the secret program
in january , a wayward quadcopter drone , piloted by an off - duty u.s. intelligence employee , landed on the white house lawn
at the time , the secret service said the errant landing appeared to be accidental and was not considered a security threat
the agency had been looking at security issues surrounding drones before the january crash , but the crash of that drone led the agency to focus more attention on security issues surrounding small , unmanned aircraft that can be hard to detect
previously published reports have disclosed that the secret service already uses jammers in presidential and vice presidential motorcades to disrupt signals that might detonate hidden remotely triggered improvised explosive devices
the secret service , in conjunction with other inter-agency partners , will conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems , in the coming days and weeks
because these exercises will be conducted within the normally flight restricted areas in the washington d.c. area , they have been carefully planned and will be tightly controlled
in preparation for these exercises the secret service has coordinated with all appropriate federal , state and local agencies
researchers with the homeland security department 's science and technology directorate are working on strategies to interdict an unauthorized drone flying inside security areas
the research arm of homeland security department is trying to balance security concerns of the small , hard - to - detect devices , with the burgeoning commercial use and interests of hobbyists
likewise , the national telecommunications and information administration said last week it 's studying how the u.s. can resolve privacy risks with increasing use of drones
the homeland security department hosted a two - day meeting last month with industry officials , law enforcement and academics to discuss balancing security and commercial interests and establishing security practices
days later , the secret service , which is part of the homeland security department , distributed a three - sentence press release saying it will ' conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems , in the coming days and weeks
' trying to keep drones out of a secure area can be tricky
there are basically three ways to stop a drone , said gillula , a staff technologist at the electronic frontier foundation : block the radio signals linking the drone to its controller , hack the aircraft 's control signals and trick it into believing it is somewhere else , or physically disable it
some drone manufacturers program a ' geo fence ' - location coordinates their drones treat as off - limits and refuse to fly past - into the drone 's programming
police could physically knock a drone out of the air with a projectile or use a net to catch it
' if it were me that would actually be the first thing i would think about doing , ' gillula said
' you would have to basically encase the white house in this net
it sure would n't look pretty , but in some ways it would be the most effective way
