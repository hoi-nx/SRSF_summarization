in a season when manchester united âs aspirations have been peeled away like layers of an onion , the only goal left is qualification for the champions league
it is enough to make even the steadfast shed a tear
thrashed in the capital one cup by league one mk dons and dumped out of the fa cup by one of their own , manchester united were never even in the premier league title race
entry back into europe âs elite competition would represent a positive campaign however
the minimal requirement , undoubtedly , but a mark of improvement nonetheless
something to look forward to
manchester united have not beaten a team in the top half of the premier league since liverpool in december failure to finish in the top four would be pretty disastrous though
without the extra commitment of a european campaign and having held a healthy lead in this run at one stage , falling late would ask serious questions of louis van gaal
it would probably mean entry into the europa league instead â a nightmare scenario adding games in a competition manchester united would rather avoid entirely
manchester united face a difficult run - in , with 10 games to define their season
four of their next five matches are against the top six but van gaal âs side have not beaten a team currently in the top half of the table since december
here , sportsmail assesses their chances
manchester united vs spurs ( march 15 ) reverse fixture : 0 - 0 a struggle for life , is how van gaal termed the second half of the sides â dour draw at white hart lane on december 28
a repeat would be intolerable not only to watching fans but in the table
manchester united must win , and beware harry kane
the 21 - year - old striker already has 26 goals to his name this season - more than the supposedly stellar line - up of wayne rooney , robin van persie and radamel falcao have managed for manchester united combined
besides , mauricio pochettino 's men have champions league ambitions of their own , and will be desperate for a victory over one of their chief rivals for the top four
prediction : 2 - 1 manchester united manchester united train ahead of their crunch premier league clash against spurs on sunday wayne rooney , juan mata and radamel falcao are all smiles despite their side 's recent struggles football data analysts bsports believe a manchester united home win is easily the most likely outcome march 15 : spurs ( home ) march 22 : liverpool ( away ) april 4 : villa ( home ) april 12 : city ( home ) april 18 : chelsea ( away ) april 26 : everton ( away ) may 2 : west brom ( home ) may 9 : crystal palace ( away ) may 16 : arsenal ( home ) may 24 : hull ( away ) liverpool vs manchester united ( march 22 ) reverse fixture : 3 - 0 manchester united the match at old trafford sparked liverpool âs remarkable resurgence into the champions league hunt
this game could prove the deciding factor
brendan rodgers has his side buoyant and anfield will be bouncing
van gaal should douse the flames with his selection
but , with philippe coutinho rampant , raheem sterling offering pace and dynamism simply not seen in manchester united 's team and daniel sturridge now back in action after injury , the dutchman will need a tactical masterstroke to pull off victory
this is arguably the fiercest rivalry in the land as england 's two most successful clubs go head - to - head
anfield will be rocking with the added incentive that van gaal 's head could be on the block if he fails to finish in the top four
prediction : 1 - 1 manchester united vs villa ( april 4 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 1 tim sherwood led spurs to victory in his previous visit to old trafford as a manager , and villa are showing signs of vibrancy under his charge
they need points for survival and will fight all the way for it
surely manchester united will have too much quality though
could arguably be the easiest fixture in manchester united 's run - in
but , as we 've seen these last two seasons , anything is possible in the post-fergie era
prediction : 2 - 0 manchester united manchester united vs city ( april 12 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 0 city sergio aguero got the decisive goal at the etihad on an afternoon chris smalling lost his head and city were denied three clear penalties
manuel pellegrini âs team have not often been at their best since , but their firepower can be awesome when focused on the right target
such as their biggest rivals
this will be a third manchester derby at old trafford at this stage in three consecutive seasons
city have won the past two
6 - 1 , anyone ? manchester united have rarely got near their noisy neighbours in recent years
and city 's focus could be entirely focused on overhauling chelsea 's premier league lead after their likely champions league elimination in barcelona
but old trafford will not stand for their men surrendering as meekly as during last season 's grim 3 - 0 defeat
prediction : 1 - 1 sergio aguero is likely to cause the manchester united defence problems in next month 's manchester derby chelsea vs manchester united ( april 18 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 1 robin van persie âs late equalising goal got old trafford to its feet and hoping a turning point had been found
it proved to be a false dawn and chelsea have eased away at the top
out of europe , jose mourinho âs side are unlikely to lose focus as their hunt for the title reaches its closing moments
men like john terry , nemanja matic and diego costa will surely not let that happen , and the blues ' mixture of power , pace and potency should see them too good for manchester united
psg did , however , expose chinks in chelsea 's armour
whether angel di maria , ashley young et al are strong enough to pierce those gaps is another matter , prediction 2 - 1 chelsea eden hazard has been chelsea 's stand out player this season as they bid to recapture the title everton vs manchester united ( april 26 ) reverse fixture : 2 - 1 manchester united radamel falcao appeared like a tiger to pounce for the winning goal at old trafford but the once - feared predator has experienced the wilderness since
defeat at goodison park did for david moyes last season although the ground does hold happier memories for manchester united
but everton are in a scrap themselves
defeat this weekend and a victory for qpr or burnley could leave roberto martinez 's men just three points off the dreaded drop zone
surely that would be the wake - up call everton need to spark their season into life at long last
prediction : 1 - 1 romelu lukaku could cause manchester united problems if he can carry his european form into the premier league manchester united vs west brom ( may 2 ) reverse fixture : 2 - 2 twice united came from behind to salvage a point at the hawthorns , with daley blind âs measured effort the point - clincher
west brom are a tougher nut to crack these days under tony pulis but the need for victory will weigh heavy on the hosts
the west brom were also one of the teams to spring a shock at old trafford last season , when berahino and morgan amalfitano stunned david moyes
expect berahino to score at old trafford again , but manchester united to have the edge with more to play for than their visitors
prediction : 2 - 1 manchester united tony pulis has transformed west brom 's fortunes and his side will be a stern test for manchester united in may crystal palace vs manchester united ( may 9 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 0 manchester united juan mata , remember him ? the spaniard popped up for the winner in the season âs earlier game , an example of manchester united at their most stubborn - performing poorly but still grinding out a win
another illustration at selhurst park would do just fine
but that is easier said than done , with alan pardew having galvanised crystal palace since his return to selhurst park
silencing the crystal palace ' ferocious home support in a big game towards the end of the season is no easy task - just ask liverpool
but surely van gaal can squeeze a win here
prediction : 1 - 0 manchester united juan mata scored the only goal of the game when manchester united hosted crystal palace earlier in the season manchester united vs arsenal ( may 16 ) reverse fixture : 2 - 1 manchester united a smash and grab to make john dillinger blush , manchester united stole three points from the emirates in a game they ought to have lost
angel di maria and wayne rooney showed a fleeting impression of understanding too
arsenal have since shown that they know how to win at old trafford , thanks to the danny welbeck - inspired win in the fa cup on monday in which manchester united struggled to get break down their opponents and were outfought as well as out - thought
but monday 's fa cup defeat has pained manchester united
that danny welbeck was the man to deliver the knockout blow stings even more
prediction : 2 - 1 manchester united danny welbeck scored the winner as arsenal dumped manchester united out of the fa cup earlier this week hull vs man united ( may 24 ) reverse fixture : 3 - 0 manchester united the last time manchester united visited the kc stadium on the final day sir alex ferguson fielded an inexperienced side having wrapped up the title and with a champions league final against barcelona on the horizon
steve bruce âs side could be safe by then and less motivated
but if they 're not , this fixture becomes loaded full of danger - for both sides
you would back the manchester united of old to win this encounter every time , but can you say the same about van gaal 's version ? prediction : 1 - 0 manchester united total predicted points : 74
manchester united won the title with just one point more in 1996/97 but the parameters have shifted since then
last year under moyes they finished seventh on 64 points , while arsenal came fourth on 79
close call on whether 74 would be enough this time .
