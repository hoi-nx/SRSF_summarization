susan lenihan , 30 , admitted harassment after she ' terrorised ' her neighbours for two years a mother who threw eggs at neighbours and poured washing - up liquid over their car is facing prison sentence
susan lenihan , 30 , spent two years ' persistently targeting ' residents in the cul-de-sac they shared in birmingham , west midlands , after claims they told police about another neighbour having drugs
james harrison and his wife harrison said their family had been ' victimised ' after susan lenihan put up posters in her windows calling them a ' grass '
birmingham magistrates ' court heard the mother - of - one had also shouted at the couple , warning them to ' watch your family ' and threw eggs at him while he visited a disabled neighbour
susan lenihan admitted a charge of harassment and her sentencing was adjourned until april 2 , where district judge jan jellema told her that all options were open , including imprisonment
palmer , prosecuting , said the abuse began after another resident 's home was searched by police looking for drugs
mr palmer said : ' the defendant put up posters in her windows calling mr harrison and his wife a ' grass '
the posters also included the words ' act now '
' the court heard mr harrison was later prosecuted for dangerous driving but it was thrown out because susan lenihan was not considered a credible witness
he also reported several incidents of damage to his car and on february 13 last year lenhihan was seen spitting on his car after mr harrison fitted cctv outside his home
mr palmer said an attempt at mediation between the two parties had failed and susan lenihan threw eggs at mr harrison when he visited a disabled neighbour
' the defendant opened a bedroom window and threw eggs in his direction , ' he said
' they landed on the ground next to him
it appears some of the yoke went on his shoes
' there was another incident in july when mr harrison found what was believed to be washing - up liquid on his car
he later checked the cctv and saw the defendant spraying the car
the cul - de - sac in shard end , birmingham , where susan lenihan lived near to james harrison and his wife harrison christopher stewart , defending , said it was not just a ' one - sided campaign of terror '
speaking after susan lenihan pleaded guilty , mr harrison said his family had been victimised because ' we are as straight as it comes '
' if we have a problem we talk to the person we have the problem with
' these people do n't like people who stand up to them so victimise and bully them with others in the hope we move and bow down
the court heard that susan lenihan had accused the harrison family of ' grassing ' up another neighbour to police about possessing drugs
she put up posters in her windows saying they were ' grasses ' and to ' act now ' ' why should the victims move when it 's the bullies that should be moved and lose what they had â which in this case was a nice grove and nice neighbours
' he added that there were times when the families enjoyed summer evenings together , chatting and having a laugh
mr harrison also said he had never considered moving away and is hopeful that after her sentence is handed out she is moved out of the area .
