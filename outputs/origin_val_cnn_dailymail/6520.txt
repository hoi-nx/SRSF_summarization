as more places legalise marijuana , scientists are warning of the potential health risks of eating cannabis - infused snacks
with smoking , the peak blood levels happen within 3 - 10 minutes , and with eating , it 's 1 - 3 hours , making it easier to overdose on food - related cannabis products
now experts are warning that legalised marijuana needs to have strong restrictions on the drug 's edible products , which are often packaged to appeal to children
' as legalisation of marijuana spreads , new adopters should ensure that their regulatory scheme for marijuana edibles is fully baked , ' wrote maccoun and mello of stanford
marijuana use for adults over 21 is fully legal in colorado , washington and alaska
oregon passed a similar law that will take effect in july
several other states have legalised marijuana for medicinal use or have decriminalised it
a notable feature of state - legalised retail sales of marijuana has been the popularity of edibles
the problem is that marijuana edibles â which often look like candy or cookies and are frequently potent â increase the chances that children will overdose , they say
' as legalisation of marijuana spreads , new adopters should ensure that their regulatory scheme for marijuana edibles is fully baked , ' the stanford experts warned professor maccoun explained that the original marijuana laws ' were not rigorous and detailed in their approach to issues like edibles , colorado and washington put extremely modest rules on edibles , therefore making it easy to sell and market edible products , he said
' both states require child - resistant packaging , a warning to ' keep out of the reach of children , ' and labelling describing a standard serving size , ' wrote maccoun and mello ' neither requires warnings that ingested marijuana can have different effects from smoked marijuana
' some of the edibles look like hershey or kitkat bars , and the drinks resemble the major brands of non-marijuana colas
motor neurons ( pictured ) are nerve cells found in the cerebral cortex of the brain stem , and are responsible for giving orders to muscles marijuana users can sometimes have difficulty speaking , breathing and swallowing food as a result of muscle weakness
now researchers in spain have conducted a landmark study to shed light on how marijuana reduces the activity of motor neurons that lead to these symptoms
motor neurons are nerve cells found in the cerebral cortex of the brain stem , and are responsible for giving orders to muscles in the body
researchers at the university of cadiz , led by professor bernardo moreno , used synthetic analogues of the psychoactive compounds of marijuana to see how they affected these neurons
they looked , in particular , at movements of the tongue and how they responded to the drug
' during the investigation , we used an animal model in which we studied the alterations produced by synthetic cannabinoids on the activity of the motor neurons , ' the researchers wrote
' in doing so , we discovered that these psychoactive compounds inhibit the information that reaches these neurons via the synapses
' in other words , cannabinoids hinder the transmission of information between neurons
' all of this could lead to problems speaking , breathing and swallowing food
' it evokes tobacco companies ' use of advertising campaigns with youth appeal , ' maccoun and mello wrote
they acknowledge that marijuana is associated with a long history of ' public misinformation ' about the effects of the drug
but the scientific record is clear on the documented risk of edibles , especially for children
' some of these products contain four or more times the level of tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) that is considered to be a safe dose , ' they noted
taken in large doses , thc can produce serious anxiety attacks and psychotic - like symptoms , according to maccoun and mello
and strong differences exist in the effects of marijuana when it is eaten rather than smoked
case reports document respiratory insufficiency in young children who have ingested marijuana through edibles , maccoun said
a recent study showed that the proportion of ingestion - related emergency department visits by children in colorado associated with marijuana ingestion increased after legal restrictions were eased
the majority of identified sources in those cases were marijuana edibles .
