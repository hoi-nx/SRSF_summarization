the greek government has proposed hiring tourists to help uncover tax dodging businesses in holiday resorts as part of its efforts to rescue the country âs shattered finances
holidaymakers could be recruited alongside students and housewives to form an army of so - called â onlookers â carrying hidden cameras and recorders to catch tax dodgers
the plan , which met with immediate mockery from critics , emerged in a leaked letter sent by greek finance minister yanis varoufakis to the president of the eurogroup jeroen dijsselbloem , which outlines a range of reforms for the greek economy
revelation : the unusual plan emerged in a leaked letter sent by greek finance minister yanis varoufakis ( above ) to the president of the eurogroup jeroen dijsselbloem in the letter essex-university educated yanis varoufakis said : â the culture of tax avoidance runs deep within greek society
â arguing that tax authorities were overstretched , he suggests hiring â large numbers of non-professional inspectors â to spread fear among tax - avoiders
the plan would involve basic training for the amateur tax sleuths who would be â wired for sound and video
â the inspectors , who would operate across the country with tourists most suitable for spying on resort areas , would not be able to confront tax dodgers or have any authority to carry out checks but the evidence they collected could be used in prosecutions
the inspectors would be hired for a maximum of two months and would not be re-hired
yanis varoufakis , finance minister of the new left - wing syriza government in greek , claims the move would create a new climate in the country
secret filming : holiday makers could be recruited alongside students and housewives to form an army of so - called â onlookers â carrying hidden cameras â the very news that thousands of casual â onlookers â are everywhere , bearing audio and video recording equipment on behalf of the tax authorities , has the capacity to shift attitudes very quickly spreading a sense of justice across society and engendering a new tax compliance culture , â yanis varoufakis writes in his letter
the idea however has met with derision from some quarters with one unnamed european official quoted as saying the plan was â hilarious â
the letter is the greek government âs detailed response to a request from its european partners to provide a list of reforms for its economy , a promise agreed by yanis varoufakis last month in return for an extension of its current bail - out pending further talks
the tax spy proposal is one of seven reforms proposed by yanis varoufakis , which will be considered by eurozone finance ministers on monday
other measures include taxing gambling , improving existing budget and tax collecting systems and creating a fiscal council which would act as an independent overseer of state spending
laws to create the fiscal council were passed by the previous greek government but have yet to be put into practice .
