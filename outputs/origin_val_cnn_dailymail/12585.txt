, he apparently did not anticipate the resulting uproar
many of indiana 's businesses fear that the law could be used to allow store owners to deny service to gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender ( lgbt ) persons
the ncaa has expressed concern about the final four , which indianapolis is hosting this weekend , and other companies have threatened to move their businesses outside of the state
but , when pushed on the issue , pence insisted that the law is " not about discrimination " but instead is " about protecting the religious liberty of every hoosier of every faith
" when asked whether he would allow an amendment to clarify that the law will not preclude anti-discrimination protections , the governor doubled - down , noting that " we 're not going to change this law
" but members of the indiana legislature beg to differ with the governor , pledging to " fix " indiana 's rfra
and now , the governor has changed his tune , also calling for a fix to the bill
can there really be an easy " fix , " short of repealing the rfra ? the answer is , of course , it depends
under rfras like indiana 's , people are not free to disobey any law in tension with their religious convictions
instead , rfras create a standard to balance a person 's religious interests against the governmental policy at stake
under indiana 's rfra , the government must show that its policy interest advances a compelling state interest and is the least restrictive means to address the problem at issue
the question would then become whether anti-discrimination laws advance a compelling interest in the least restrictive means
the answer to that question is easy : yes
the adoption of such laws have long been viewed as advancing compelling state interests , and the only way to eliminate discrimination is to ban it , so they are the least restrictive means
at present in indiana , there is no state - level law that protects lgbt persons from discrimination by private parties
in certain cities and other , local jurisdictions , however , there are ordinances prohibiting such discrimination
indiana would have two ways to " fix " the rfra problem
the first would be to adopt state - wide nondiscrimination laws that protect lgbt persons
such an act would confirm that , as a matter of state policy , protecting the lgbt community is viewed as a compelling state interest
this would bring indiana into alignment with illinois , which has a rfra , but which also has a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute , ameliorating any concerns about the rfra being used in discriminatory fashion
given the wishy - washy answer that gov. pence provided when asked whether he thought discrimination against lgbt persons was appropriate , the likelihood of indiana adopting a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute seems remote at best , eliminating this fix as an option
another possibility would be to amend the statute to confirm that any federal , state , or local nondiscrimination laws constitute a compelling state interest for the purposes of the rfra
importantly , federal law does not protect lgbt persons from discrimination by private actors , and neither does indiana state law
but this language would expressly carve out local ordinances from the scope of the rfra , such as the nondiscrimination ordinance in indianapolis
in essence , this would preserve much of the law as it existed before the rfra : absent local nondiscrimination laws , persons are free in indiana to discriminate against lgbt persons on any basis
this amendment , however , would make clear that the state - level rfra can not be used to trump local city ordinances that protect the lgbt community
what are the odds of this second fix ? well , that precise amendment was proposed -- and adopted -- in the georgia legislature as it considered a rfra comparable to indiana 's
the result : the bill 's sponsors tabled it , noting that the exception for local nondiscrimination laws would " gut " the bill
that reaction shines a light on the true motivations for these rfras
if these acts are n't about discrimination , then why would ensuring nondiscrimination protections " gut " the bill ? it 's because these bills truly are about permitting discrimination against the lgbt community
all of the hand - waving by gov. pence and others can not distract from the truth : rfras are the first responses to lgbt advances .
