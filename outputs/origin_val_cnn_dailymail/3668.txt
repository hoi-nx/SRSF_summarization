a museum for gangster dillinger has residents of a small indiana town choosing sides over the infamous gangster 80 years after his death
on one side are the citizens of crown point , pop. 28,000 , who see tourism dollars in the collection of dillinger artifacts that recently moved from the town of hammond to the lake county courthouse in crown point
on the other side are the town 's supporters of sheriff holley , the first woman to carry the title in indiana who became a national pariah after dillinger duped her into setting him free using a piece of wood meant to look like a gun
on one are the residents who applaud a potentially money - making new attraction
opponents say it is a slap in the face to justice and to the state 's first female sheriff who was duped into letting dillinger escape infamous extradition : seen here , in an infamous photo that would one day prevent prosecuting attorney robert g. estell from running for governor of indiana , the state 's first female sheriff holley stands to the attorney 's left with dillinger at the right after the gangster 's extradition back to indiana in 1934 holley died in 1994 at 103 after spending her life being protected by the people of crown point , writes the indystar
her supporters maintain that a dillinger museum is not only a slap in the face of justice but also an affront to women and an embarrassment to the town that was , for a time , infamous for having let public enemy no. 1 walk free
' here was this young widow who 'd been embarrassed and humiliated , ' local historian and director of the house and jail museum thill said of holley , whose sheriff husband had died and left the position to her
' holley was a kind person , and the town formed a human cocoon around her
' people like thill are helping make sure that continues
years ago , a local investor helped the town acquire some dillinger artifacts expecting to place them in the old sheriff 's house and jail museum
but the museum said no. now , the new dillinger museum is located in the historic courthouse , instead of the actual site of the dillinger escape
' our goal , ' says thill , ' is to turn this into a law enforcement museum , not a dillinger museum
' meanwhile , the south shore convention and visitors authority , the courthouse foundation and the city held the first of what will be two openings for the museum tuesday
dillinger escaped from the old sheriff 's house and jail , pictured here dillinger was placed in the prison at crown point , indiana while awaiting trial for the murder of chicago , indiana police officer william patrick o'malley
at the helm of the town 's sheriff 's department was sheriff holley , who 'd been appointed to serve out the term of her late sheriff husband after he died in the line of duty
the jail at the time had been deemed inescapable and became the command center for throngs of national press there to document public enemy number 1 's long - awaited trial
however , those plans were put on hold when dillinger managed to escape the jail -- and get away in sheriff holley 's car , no less -- without firing a single bullet
some say dillinger did it by fashioning a fake gun out of wood smeared with shoe polish
the supposed gun is housed in the crown point museum to this day
' sticking a fake wooden gun into the back of one guard after another , he locked each one up , then moved on , ' a placard at the museum reads
' at a nearby garage , a mechanic was taken hostage and the four drove off in the fastest car available â sheriff holley 's ford v-8
' another theory asserts that someone corrupt within the prison helped dillinger get a real gun
dillinger remained free until july of 1934 , when he was tracked down to chicago and killed in a hail of police bullets while walking out of a movie
source sheriff holley ( left ) , prosecuting attorney robert g. estell ( center ) and infamous gangster dillinger ( right ) dillinger would evade police for only a few more months following his escape from holley 's jail , but in those months the widow sheriff was the butt of ridicule nationwide it coincided with the 81st anniversary of the day the depression - era bank robber escaped from the old lake county jail , the munster times reported
' we are pleased to bring you a small taste of what the museum will be in a few months , ' sscva president and ceo batistatos told the crowd that filled the hall outside the museum
he said the grand opening for the finished product will be july 22 , the anniversary of dillinger 's infamous end outside the biograph theater in chicago
' we are not here to glorify or say dillinger was a hero , ' crown point mayor david uran said
' there are a multitude of stories to tell in crown point , and this is a story we want to share with our residents and those who come to visit the city
' marty wheeler , chairman of the courthouse foundation board , said , ' i 'm very excited about having all of you here
i think you will be very surprised at what you see
and remember there are stores at the other end of the hall , and that 's the reason we brought the museum here
' the end of the dillinger story is all that 's depicted so far with diagrams of the layout planned for the future depicting the rest of his life
the museum , previously in the sscva visitors center in hammond , will occupy 2,000 square feet on the lower level of the courthouse
the displays offered tuesday included the wooden gun dillinger used in his escape from the jail and descriptions of how he and many other bandits of that era met their deaths
tool of his escape ? the famous dillinger escape gun is displayed next to a photograph of dillinger posing with the wooden weapon at an exhibit at the new dillinger museum that will open in july at the old lake county courthouse in crown point , indiana
some say he duped crown point prison guards with the fake gun , others say he was slipped a real one by a crooked jail insider partially completed was a representation of a jail cell from that era with a wooden bucket prisoners had to use as a bathroom
' if anyone thinks we are glamorizing a life , look at what we have here , ' batistatos said
batistatos said painters will begin work soon on the rest of the project
the sscva is deciding whether to contract out remaining work or do it with staff assisted by union workers for the parts requiring more skilled labor as has been done so far
' we have new space to fill at the visitors center ( vacated by the museum 's departure ) , so we have to be budget - conscious , ' he said
while the new museum will have items not previously seen at the visitors center location , one item that will not be making the transition to new quarters is the black 1933 essex terraplane 8 , which was used in the movie ' public enemies ' starring johnny depp as dillinger
the car , known as the preferred model for dillinger to steal and own , will be auctioned off may 2 in front of the north entrance to the courthouse
its value is estimated between $ 20,000 and $ 27,000
instead of at the old sheriff 's house and jail -- where the escape actually occurred -- the dillinger museum is housed here , at the lake county historic courthouse
the folks at the jail believe the museum dishonors sheriff holley 's memory and good deeds outside letting dillinger free
