scotland boss strachan has vowed to stand by steven fletcher as the striker bids to end a six - year goal drought for his country
the sunderland forward , a Â£ 14million player , scored his only international goal in a 2 - 1 world cup qualifying win over iceland in april 2009
missing from the scotland set - up for 19 months under former manager craig levein , the 28 - year - old âs record now stands at one goal in 19 caps after wednesday night âs friendly win over northern ireland
striker steven fletcher has scored just one goal for scotland in 19 appearances a home european championships qualifier with group d minnows gibraltar offers the chance to put that right on sunday and strachan believes one may be enough to set his first - choice striker scoring again
â there was a lovely movement from steven fletcher and link - up play ( against northern ireland ) , â said the manager
â all his game is needing is a goal
â but i do nât think it âs affecting his touch or his willingness to work - you see him sliding into tackles and making blocks
â if you do nât have your goalscoring boots on then you dig in and do something else for the team
i âm happy with that
â he is terrific to watch
i think he is elegant , i think he âs clever , he brings people into play
you can trust him when the ball goes up so we can then get up beside him
steven fletcher 's goal drought continued in wednesday night âs friendly win over northern ireland â but i would like to see more people round about him
â in the first half against northern ireland , i did nât think we had enough people in the box
â we played too much around the edge of the box , so i would like to see more bodies in there
in saying that , we do nât have a podolski or a muller who comes in off the line
â steven fletcher has found it difficult scoring goals for relegation threatened sunderland as well , claiming four in 28 appearances this season
â he a good player , â said strachan
â but as i said , you do nât have to be scoring goals as long as your team is winning
so i âm fine with that

â defender berra has scored three goals in the period since steven fletcher struck against iceland , adding his latest goal on wednesday night
â funnily enough , when we put berra on we knew that he had scored a few goals this season so he came up with another one , â added strachan
â i felt pleased for him because he has been to all the get - togethers and not played - so we had to get him on the pitch to make all of his travels previously worthwhile
â berra is unlikely to start against gibraltar , with strachan set to name his strongest side after vowing to treat sunday âs opponents with respect
â we âve got to , â he said
â but our players would nât have got to where they are by taking shortcuts
â you just had to watch their intensity in training on tuesday when they were playing amongst themselves to see their hard work
scotland boss strachan believes one may be enough to set steven fletcher scoring again â you do nât get to where they are by taking people for granted
that just wo nât happen
â you can be rest assured that wo nât happen
â gibraltar have yet to win fifa recognition and , after battling for access to uefa , shipped 21 goals in their four qualifiers so far - losing two of their games 7 - 0
cautioning against expectations of a rout , however , strachan added : â the world champions only beat gibraltar 4 - 0
â i ca nât tell our fans how to behave
i âve said already , i âd imagine we âll get about three minutes before they get anxious
â that âs just the way we are , everybody is like that
there is not a problem , we all come along to games and get anxious
â as long as the players do nât get anxious , that âs the main thing
â but as i say , when it was germany , it was only four goals
