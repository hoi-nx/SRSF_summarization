israeli prime minister netanyahu said monday there would be no palestinians state if he were reelected , in a last - ditch effort to woo right - wing voters on the eve of a general election
polling stations opened today for israeli 's second snap general election in three years in a ballot experts agree is likely to be a referendum on the netanyahu years
with his rightwing likud trailing the centre - left zionist union in the latest opinion polls , netanyahu said that if his rivals were elected security would be compromised and they would give up total israeli control over jerusalem
he 's pictured here giving a statement to the press during his visit on monday to har homa , an israeli settlement neighbourhood in annexed east jerusalem support : norris in his youtube video netanyahu received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star chuck norris , who said that his re-election is crucial for the safety of israeli
in a short youtube video called please vote for prime minister netanyahu , chuck norris said : ' i watched prime minister netanyahu 's speech before congress , and i saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul
i also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the israeli people
' i have done three movies in israeli â ' delta force ' being my favorite â and i formed many friendships while there
you have an incredible country , and we want to keep it that way
' that 's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only israeli but also the america
you see , we the america people need prime minister netanyahu as much as you do
weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on america , too
' so i ask you , please , for the sake of israeli and the whole middle east , vote for prime minister netanyahu on election day
' and as far as those in the america and the rest of the world , in this season of easter , it 's good to remember what the hebrew scriptures say about israeli and those who support her : ' pray for the peace of jerusalem : may they prosper who love you ' ( psalm 122:1 )
' ' we will continue to build to fortify jerusalem so its division will not be possible and it will remain united forever , ' he said on a tour of har homa , a settlement neighbourhood of annexed east jerusalem
netanyahu , who is seeking a third consecutive term , vowed he would never allow the palestinians to establish a capital in the city 's eastern sector and pledged to build ' thousands ' of settler homes
the palestinians want east jerusalem as capital of their future state , and continued settlement building has incensed the international community , which sees it as an obstacle to peace
throughout his campaign , netanyahu has repeatedly accused zionist union leaders herzog and former peace negotiator tzipi livni of being ready to abandon israeli 's claim to jerusalem as its indivisible capital
but netanyahu 's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing nrg website if it was true that there would be no palestinians state established if he was reelected
' indeed , ' said netanyahu , who in 2009 had endorsed the idea of two states living side by side
he later told public radio the two - state solution was now irrelevant , saying the ' reality has changed ' and ' any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical islamists '
netanyahu has based his campaign solidly on security issues , notably the iranian nuclear threat , giving short shrift to the focus on economic issues in centre - left campaigning
' if tzipi livni and bougie set up the next government , hamastan will be established on these hills here , ' he said in har homa , using the nickname of his key challenger , labour leader herzog
' hamastan ' is a derogatory term used by israeli politicians to refer to the gaza strip , which has been ruled by palestinians islamist movement hamas since 2007
netanyahu received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star chuck norris , who said that his re-election is crucial for the safety of israeli
in a short youtube video called please vote for prime minister netanyahu , chuck norris said : ' i watched prime minister netanyahu 's speech before congress , and i saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul

' i have done three movies in israeli â delta force being my favorite â and i formed many friendships while there
you have an incredible country , and we want to keep it that way
israeli labour leader and co-leader of the zionist union coalition , herzog , speaks with citizens as he campaigns on the eve of israeli 's general election in the coastal israeli city of tel aviv ' that 's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only israeli but also the america
you see , we the america people need prime minister netanyahu as much as you do
weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on america , too
' herzog , meanwhile , has dismissed netanyahu 's jibes
on sunday he pledged to ' safeguard ' jerusalem ' in actions , not just words , more than any other leader ' , and on monday insisted jerusalem would remain forever israeli 's ' undivided capital '
former prime minister and labour leader ehud barak came out in support of herzog , calling him ' experienced and responsible ' and someone who could be relied upon to ensure israeli 's safety
the outgoing israeli parliament and the latest opinion poll supporters netanyahu , attend his campaign meeting on monday in rabin square in the israeli coastal city of tel aviv despite netanyahu 's vitriol , the zionist union is tipped to come out on top in the election
final opinion polls published late last week put the zionist union ahead with 25 - 26 seats with netanyahu 's likud taking 20 - 22 in the 120 - seat knesset
but experts have warned about their reliability of the polls , pointing to the 2013 election when they completely failed to predict the level of support for centrist newcomer yesh atid
' in all previous elections we had considerable differences between the predictions of the public opinion polls and ( the results ) , ' said professor diskin , a political scientist from jerusalem 's hebrew university
' yesh atid did n't get more than 10 or 11 seats in the public opinion polls and finally got twice as many - 19 seats
' israeli mp and chairperson of center - right yesh atid party , yair lapid , delivers a speech during the election campaign at the israeli city of modiin near tel aviv the leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier -- as in 2009 when the centrist kadima party then headed by tzipi livni effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought netanyahu to power for a second term
' in 2009 , ( likud ) had a 100 - percent chance of forming a government while the leader of the largest party , tzipi livni , had no chance whatsoever - and therefore she was not nominated , ' diskin said
under israeli 's complex electoral system , the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes , but to the mp or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61
meanwhile , netanyahu has also made overtures to centre - right kulanu party , seen as the kingmaker , offering the finance portfolio to its leader moshe kahlon who dismissed this as ' spin '
' whoever wants to follow ( netanyahu 's ) path of despair and disappointment will vote for him , ' herzog said after casting his vote
' but whoever wants change , hope , and really a better future for israeli , will vote the zionist union led by me
' that call resonated with 51 - year - old benishti , who voted at a polling station in kfar saba in central israeli
he said he was a lifelong likud voter but was now casting his ballot for the zionist union
' i have had enough , ' said benishti , a businessman whose company deals with spare parts for buses
' netanyahu tried and tried and tried , but it just has n't worked
it 's time to give someone else a chance
it ca n't get worse than this
' israeli election officials said 26.5 percent of eligible voters had voted by midday , a rate similar to previous years
elections day is a public holiday in israeli - most people do not go to work , beaches and restaurants fill up , and stores advertise election - day sales
facebook featured a special ' i voted ' button in hebrew , as it has during elections in other countries , in an effort to get out the vote
this election season has amplified the bitter divide between hard - liners and moderates in israeli .
