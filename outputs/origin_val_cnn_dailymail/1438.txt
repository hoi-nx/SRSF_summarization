when mccarthy 's chihuahua puppy was run over and killed by a park keeper , she expected a heartfelt apology at the very least
instead , the man offered her a black bin bag to throw six - month - old peanut 's body away
the distraught dog lover said the council worker , who had been driving a buggy , showed no remorse
choking back tears , miss mccarthy said : ' the man just stood there saying , ' he is dead , he is dead '
tragic : peanut the adorable six - month - old chihuahua was killed after being run over by a council buggy driver in a park in essex ' he was just standing there with no emotion and then he turned to me and said , ' do you want me to put him in this bag ? ' ' i could n't believe what was happening
' her partner ralph , 33 , added : ' you do n't stuff a pet dog in a bin bag and chuck it on a skip
' the drivers are supposed to drive the buggies at walking pace but our dog landed three metres away on the grass
' nursery worker miss mccarthy , 47 , was at raphael park in romford , essex , with peanut , her other dog missy â an 11 - year - old staffordshire bull terrier â and a friend 's pet , on march 12
the puppy was playing with a bulldog near a cafe and a children 's playground as the owner chatted to another dog walker
miss mccarthy heard shouts from the driver , who had been travelling down a path in the buggy with council livery , and raced over
' i was screaming â poor peanut was just lying there , ' said the mother of two from hornchurch
' his eyes were open â¦ but blood was coming out of his ear and mouth
peanut did n't stand a chance
the man did n't even apologise
' the dog has now been cremated and his ashes placed in an urn
devastated : mccarthy , pictured with her other dog missy at the spot where her puppy was run over , said she screamed in horror after seeing peanut stricken on the ground taxi driver mr ralph added : ' we 've been asking for answers from the council about what happened but we 've just met a brick wall
they do n't seem to care
one of their workers told me there is a sign which says , ' keep dogs on leads ' which simply is not true
' there are signs which say ' keep dogs under control ' , but peanut was under control â¦ he was just playing when he was struck
' the electric buggy has a top speed of 15mph but is supposed to be driven at ' walking speed ' in parks
the couple say staff are still charging around the park at speed
since peanut 's untimely death , ms mccarthy has spoken with other dog walkers at the park who claim to have regularly seen the buggies being driven at speed
and only days ago , she ' screamed ' at a different park keeper in a buggy to slow down , saying ' have you not learnt your lesson ? '
the worker then waved to apologise before slowing his buggy down
ms mccarthy has also seen the park keeper who struck peanut but he would not make eye contact with her or talk to her about what happened
mr ralph has since bought his partner another chihuahua puppy which they have called teddy
he said : ' it wo n't bring peanut back but i just needed to help ms mccarthy fill the void that was left when peanut died
' sources last night suggested the havering council worker was not facing disciplinary action
councillor melvin wallace said an investigation was underway , but asked owners to ensure ' all dogs are kept under control so incidents like this can never happen again ' .
