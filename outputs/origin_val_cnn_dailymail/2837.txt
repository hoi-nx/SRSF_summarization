but landon clements does n't just have friends on reality shows already
lke shep , she has an ex-husband with plenty of experience himself , and she no doubt knew more than most what she would be getting into by joining the bravo hit
her ex-husband maby was a repeat winner on the largely forgotten british reality show lost , which aired for just one season the fall of 2001
on lost two strangers were paired together , given almost no money and just three days ' rations , and were parachuted while blind folded into an unknown destination - including azerbaijan and mali
all they knew was their final destination , and they had to find there way to it
landon clements 's ex maby as seen on the opening credits , in 2001 , from the british reality show lost on the show maby and his teammate , an until - the - show stranger named harriet bulwer-long , were dropped alongside two other teams in an unknown destination with little food or money
here they take their blindfolds off upon being left in newfoundland he worked his posh accent and knowledge of languages to his advantage
his team also had the benefit of his family apartment on fifth avenue , where they stayed one night while passing through new york with no money , seen right
that apartment was sold in 2004 , before he met landon clements one episode saw maby negotiating the price of his camel ride to timbuktu , seen here , before complaining that the saddle hurt his privates maby was also rampant flirt and a charmer during his time on the show , smiling when the women here answered that he was he won multiple times , and celebrated each time with the classic champagne pop and crowd spray upon reaching trafalgar square each race contained three teams , and each team had a cameraman in tow
on all but the season finale the teams were competing to be first back to london 's trafalgar square
they had to beg and borrow and talk their way into freebies - including plane tickets - to survive
maby , who skis and claims to speak five languages , thrived
the first team back to trafalgar square won , and got to go on the adventure again
maby won multiple rounds and featured prominently throughout the season
cameras followed as he and show partner harriet bulwer-long traversed on camel back to timbuktu , found his way out of newfoundland , and borrowed money off old school friends in new york where his father conveniently had an apartment on fifth avenue
as a repeat winner he had a large amount of screen time , but he receded from the spotlight when the show went off the air
no doubt he would have good advice for his ex on how to win over viewers on reality television if the pair still speak
but it 's unclear if they are on speaking terms , and maby appears to have bounced right back from his second divorce and into a new relationship
as of august 2013 his facebook status has been â in a relationship â with kam heskin , 41 , a sometime actress and publicist for jewelry companies
maby seems to have moved on from landon clements with no problem
in august 2013 kam heskin proclaimed them ' in a relationship ' when she posted these two photos
