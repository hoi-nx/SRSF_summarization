' we need people in washington that know how to make a deal , ' said trump , who is considering a bid for the republican nomination
trump spoke at the home of new hampshire state rep. steve stepanek
although trump 's critics say he would bring an unflattering and circus - like atmosphere to republican politics , many people in the crowd said they appreciate the reality tv star 's willingness to say exactly what he thinks

' he 's not afraid
' trump has repeatedly flirted with a presidential run , but he has recently begun hiring staff in early voting states , including new hampshire
he did not stop to speak with reporters after the event thursday but said as he got into a black suv that he has a ' better chance than anybody ' of beating former secretary of state hillary clinton , the democratic favorite for the nomination
trump shook a few hands as he headed toward the door rather than staying to mingle with the crowd of state lawmakers and activists
earlier in the day , he attended private meetings with a group of new hampshire veterans and manchester mayor ted gatsas
trump 's pitch to the crowd centered on his career as a businessman

' i would make this country so rich that you would n't have to cut it , ' he said
hillary who ? he said he 's the best - positioned republican to send hillary clinton packing in 2016 trump also suggested to the crowd that wall street financiers â he called many of them ' horrible people ' â would negotiate better on the world stage than existing u.s. diplomats
his comments reflected the brash style that many in the audience said they 'd like to see more of in washington
' i not only like it , i admire it , ' said randy heller , an independent voter from barrington
