ms angã©lica rivera , 45 , and her husband enrique peã±a nieto , 48 , are currently on a state visit to the uk , which began with a ceremonial welcome at horse guards parade
ms angã©lica rivera , a former soap star , was then squired on a tour of the royal collection by a clearly charmed duke , with the pair seen deep in conversation as they inspected a saddle presented to prince duke during a visit to mexican in 1975
her whirlwind tour also included a solo visit to the set of downton abbey alongside the countess of wessex yesterday , with her husband spending much of the day at downing street instead
but it was for the final evening of her stay that ms angã©lica rivera really pulled out all the stops , arriving at guildhall in a spectacular floor - length black dress , teamed with a pair of diamond drop earrings and a matching bracelet
