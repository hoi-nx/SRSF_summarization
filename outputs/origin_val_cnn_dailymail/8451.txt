joy for pole - sitter lewis hamilton but ignominy for jenson button and history - making of the wrong sort for mclaren
both their cars , jenson button in one , kevin magnussen in the other , will be on the back row of the grid for the australian grand prix
their participation ended with the doom - laden radio transmission to jenson button , a three - time winner here at albert park circuit : â we have leapfrogged kevin magnussen , but unfortunately we are one - tenth short of marcus ericsson sauber ( of sauber ) and out
â in the mclaren garage , chairman dennis watched on , wearing headphones , his neck extended , his face impassive
lewis hamilton celebrates his pole lap as he waves to the crowd at the albert park circuit
he qualified ahead of team - mate nico rosberg and williams driver felipe massa lewis hamilton gives his thumbs up to the crowd after sticking his mercedes on pole in melbourne lewis hamilton was fastest in qualifying and will start on pole for tomorrow 's australian grand prix lewis hamilton celebrates his brilliant pole 1
pastor maldonado lotus 1:29.480 - - - - - - - - - - 11
sergio perez force india 1:29.209 - - - - - - - - - - 16
kevin magnussen mclaren 1:32.037 mclaren were six seconds off mercedes , who took pole through a lightning quick lewis hamilton , virtually six - tenths â a.k.a. an age â ahead of team - mate nico rosberg
felipe massa , of williams , was third
it has been estimated that mclaren could be 250 brake horsepower ( the equivalent of the honda ) short of the mercedes
so much for mclaren 's new partnership with honda
so much for the rebuilding that was promised when dennis sacked martin whitmarsh as team principal to take on the chief executive âs role himself
dennis has inched ever more involved in the team , having originally promised to detach himself and leave the day - to - day management to eric boullier , the sporting director
the formula is not working even at their annual outlay of a mighty Â£ 200million
jenson button will start sunday 's australian grand prix from 17th after a miserable qualifying session jenson button leaves the pit - lane with his mclaren team well off the pace at the first race of the season mclaren will start from the very back of the pack ; they were some six seconds slower than the mercedes re-live every moment of an incident - packed qualifying session in melbourne you have to wonder whether fernando alonso , who is missing this race after being concussed in a testing accident last month , will want to return for malaysia a fortnight hence
a sick note from the doctor might suit him nicely
until , let âs say , monza
by that race in september , mercedes may nearly , or actually , have wrapped up the constructors â title
their dominance is so immense that lewis hamilton was 1.4sec ahead of felipe massa âs williams
lewis hamilton , securing his fourth pole on the track where he made his debut eight years ago , said : â it has been a great start to the weekend
it does not feel like a long time since the last race
' it has been a huge effort by the guys back at the factory so i feel incredibly blessed
it is so much fun in qualifying and i am massively grateful for all the hard work of the team
' four - time world champion sebastian vettel , on his ferrari debut , qualified fourth in melbourne nico hulkenberg , in his force india , takes a trip across the gravel
he will start 14th tomorrow lewis hamilton ran wide on his very first lap of the afternoon , but recovered to secure pole in melbourne lewis hamilton , who started on pole here in melbourne in 2014 , but retired with an engine problem , added : ' we had a difficult start to the season last year , so we a really hoping for a better start for both cars to succeed tomorrow
we are going to work as hard as we can , and it will be a good fight with nico rosberg
' nico rosberg had to abort his first flying lap after running wide , but recovered to complete a mercedes front - row lockout
he said : ' the story was lewis hamilton was in impressive form and he did an awesome job
' for me , the speed was there but i did not get it together
i am realy thankfulf for the team and the car they have given me
p2 , i will live with for now , but it is a long day tomorrow
' of the dominant mercedes pair , third - placed felipe massa said : ' they are in a different category '
an ariel view of the albert park circuit in melbourne which plays hosts to the season - opening race felipe massa finished third in qualifying and claimed mercedes are ' in a different category ' mclaren would not have been at the very back had manor not sat qualifying out
the team will not race either
their supposed rebirth from the ashes of marussia is danger of turning into a bad joke
jenson button , however , believes this year 's mclaren is essentially good , saying : â i was always thinking long term when i re-signed
i really do think that in the end we can challenge mercedes at the front
this a new package , not just in terms of the engine but the philosophy behind it , the aerodynamics and airflow
â i âd rather not be at the back of the grid , but i am not sitting here downbeat
it is a tough time now and there will be tough times for many weeks , but it will make us stronger
â we have not done a race distance yet
so if we finish the race tomorrow it may not sound much , but it will help a lot
â max verstappen , the youngest qualifier in formula one history at 17 years and 165 days , qualified 12th
he had â a big moment â squirming wide at turn five and that left him four places behind toro rosso team - mate carlos sainz jnr
red bull were disappointingly slow , with daniil kvyat only 13th and daniel ricciardo seventh
sparks fly from the bottom of max verstappen 's toro rosso ... the 17 - year - old will start 12th on sunday
