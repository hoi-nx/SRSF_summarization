while boston and other new england cities have suffered through their snowiest seasons , other parts of the country have some unexpected good news to go along with the record - breaking winter conditions
all that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year
march is typically a transitional month , where warm moist air from the gulf of mexico collides with cold arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes
this year , however , the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the east remains stuck in more of a winter mode
" we 're in a persistent pattern that suppresses severe weather , and the right ingredients -- moisture , instability and lift -- ( have yet to come together ) , " said carbin , the warning coordination meteorologist with the storm prediction center in norman , oklahoma
the group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather
so far this year it 's been extremely quiet
by this time in mid-march the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide
this year they have issued a paltry four
both january and february were well below normal
march has been even quieter
at a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably , there has not been a single report this month of a tornado
" we are in uncharted territory with respect to the lack of severe weather " carbin said
in fact if we make it through the entire month of march without any tornado reports it would be a first , according to the center
there have been around 20 tornadoes reported since january 1 , well below the 10 - year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-march
this year comes on the heels of what was has been a welcome lull of tornadoes across the united states the past several years
in 2014 , we ended the year with a count of 881 , well below the average of 1,253
meteorologists do n't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes , but one possible answer is the development of el nino , a warming in the equatorial pacific , which can influence weather patterns globally
recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the united states during these events
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently said that a weak el nino had developed
so while all agree this is good news so far this year , it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet
weather patterns can change quickly
in 1984 , for instance , there was a very similar slow start through mid-march and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of june , according to data from the storm center
it 's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low , you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example
the year ended being roughly 30 % below normal for the number of tornadoes , yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record
the twisters in moore and el reno , oklahoma , occurred in may of that year with devastating results
