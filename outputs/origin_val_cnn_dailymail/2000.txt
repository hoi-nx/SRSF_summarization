philip ewington , 62 , said he is ' trying to see the funny side ' after the royal mail sent his post to the wrong address for six months a frustrated customer said he is ' trying to see the funny side ' after the royal mail sent his post to the wrong address for six months â including their own letters of apology
philip ewington , 62 , said letters and packages clearly marked for his bedford flat have been delivered to another home on the same street for at least half a year
the retired analyst , who lives alone , said the problem usually happens on wednesdays when his mail is in the hands of a relief postman
he first complained to royal mail last year when some family photos he sent to his mother 's address never turned up
they sent a letter of apology - which arrived at flat g in the block at number 10 rather than flat g at number eight where he lives
he said : ' it may seem like a quite a small thing in the scale of the things , but when you 're post just keeps on getting delivered to the wrong place over and over again it is very frustrating
' i am trying to see the funny side of it
i keep asking my neighbour when he 's going to move out , so i can move into his flat
maybe then i 'll get my post delivered
' no one seems to understand why this is happening , it 's bizarre
' mr philip ewington said he was in the process of drawing up his will and was awaiting important documents from his solicitor
he added : ' it is laughable
they ca n't even send a letter of apology to the right address
' if we post a birthday card with the wrong postage we receive penalties , but they just do n't seem that bothered
' they keep saying they are going to escalate it to the manager but nothing ever happens
' the royal mail said : ' we would like to sincerely apologise to the customer for the problems he has experienced with our delivery service and the inconvenience this has caused
' procedures have been put in place which include daily checks by the delivery office manager and staff briefed on the importance of correct delivery and maintaining the high level of service our customers expect and deserve
