mercedes motorsport boss wolff has conceded to being a worried man in the wake of sebastian vettel 's malaysian grand prix victory
suggestions of another season of mercedes domination in the wake of a comfortable one - two in the season - opening race in australia were blown apart by ferrari and sebastian vettel in malaysian
as sebastian vettel himself noted , his triumph was achieved ' fair and square ' as he beat reigning champion lewis hamilton by 8.5 seconds , with team - mate nico rosberg a further four seconds adrift in third
mercedes boss wolff ( right ) was surprised by sebastian vettel 's malaysian grand prix victory despite searing heat of more than 30 degrees , sebastian vettel 's ferrari was kinder on its tyres , stopping just twice compared to three for both lewis hamilton and nico rosberg
it has left wolff concerned , as he said : ' we were pretty sure the three - stop strategy would work for us
' we probably went a bit too aggressive on set - up , which pushed us into a direction of a three - stop
wolff admitted that the german driver deserved to win and ferrari got their tactics spot - on in the soaring heat sebastian vettel celebrates after winning his first race of the season and opening up the drivers championship ' but in the circumstances , with the high temperatures , they were able to go at a faster pace over long runs than us
' we need to analyse why that was the case , and it clearly shows it 's not going to be an easy one
' it is clear they won the race , which is worrying
it would n't be right to say we lost it
' formula one stats provided by f1 stat blog sebastian vettel finished 8.5 seconds ahead of lewis hamilton ( left ) and 12.5 seconds ahead of nico rosberg wolff at least gave credit where it is due to ferrari , although has also admitted to surprise at how quickly his team have been reeled in given their margin of victory in australia
' ferrari deserved to win , ' wolff added
' from a racing perspective , you have to acknowledge they have done a great development over the winter
' for formula one it ( their win ) is a positive , particularly after all the talk we had in melbourne of a boring race and mercedes running away with the championship
lewis hamilton had to pit three times in the race compared to sebastian vettel 's two and that was a major blow for him ' it is what formula one needed , but we did n't expect them to catch us this quickly
' we were pretty dominant in melbourne - we were a little bit sceptical about our own advantage
' that we 've been caught up by a ferrari in two weeks , that they beat us fair and square on the track , is a bit of a surprise , but equally a bit of a wake up call , which is good for us
' we just need to analyse in the next couple of days where we went wrong , what we need to improve , whether we need to bring any developments forward and put them on the car quicker
nico rosberg ( 6 ) finished in third and continued his solid start to the formula one season in malaysian ' definitely we need to increase the pace of our development
' wolff insists , though , mercedes will not over-react to the situation , particularly as the cooler conditions at the next race in china in a fortnight are expected to favour his cars
' there is no panic , but we are in a new situation , ' he said
' we were not in control of things
we had new information which was different to what we had assessed over the weekend
' things did n't pan out in the way we expected them to pan out , but it was clear the winning streak would not go on forever
' the german celebrates with his ferrari team after winning the second formula one race of the season suggested to wolff the loss was the end of an era , he said : ' we must not be extreme in our assessment
' in melbourne there was extreme thinking we would win all season , and here we are two weeks later and we say is this the end of an era ? ' it is not the end of an era - maybe the start of a new era , of a good battle , a battle we would like to take on
' it 's about staying calm , assessing , trying to return with confidence and with the speed we have had in the last couple of races
