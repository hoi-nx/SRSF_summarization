taking her place on the witness stand , a florida court bailiff described being sexually assaulted at gunpoint the day she asked her husband for a divorce after his gambling had led them into debt
the 55 - year - old woman tried to hold back tears as she spoke tuesday of being held against her will by her ex-husband , garrett cunningham , 64 , also a broward court deputy , though he is currently suspended
the sun sentinel reports that the couple met in 1983 while working as corrections officers in new york city 's riker 's island
alleged assault : garrett cunningham , 64 , who worked as a court bailiff was accused by his ex-wife of handcuffing and shackling her before sexually assaulting her in 2013 they married in 1990 , but the woman described how cunningham 's gambling habits drove them into debt , costing them their house and his car
the woman said she tried to keep the couple afloat - even covering a $ 2,000 debt cunningham owed - and stated that even after they separated , she would drive him to work
in september 2013 , she drove him to the plantation motel on state road 7 where he had been living and asked her to help carry groceries to his room , she said
she testified that once inside the room , cunningham handcuffed her and shackled her legs , before pulling out a glock pistol from under the mattress and pointing it at her
on the wall was a note listing everything cunningham had done wrong in his life , while a second note on the bed had a list of questions about her personal and dating life , according to an arrest affidavit
what followed was an hours - long interrogation , where cunningham berated his wife over who she was dating , she testified
county court : cunningham and his ex-wife met as corrections officers at riker 's island in new york city and began working as bailiffs in 1999 cunningham demanded her phone and the password to unlock it
after reading texts sent between her and a man she had met online , he threw the phone to the floor and shot its screen , she said
' he had this crazed look in his eye , ' she claimed on the stand
' i just knew in that moment that i was not coming out of that hotel room alive
' she said that after several hours cunningham concluded she had to be punished , and used a vegetable to sodomize her
when she cried out , he pointed the gun at her head and told her that he would shoot her if she could n't stop screaming , she said
she testified that she cried as she held back screams as he continued his alleged assault
cunningham was arrested days later
in december , he was suspended without pay by the broward sheriff 's office
he is currently being tried on two counts of sexual battery , one count of false and one count of his wife left the motel after allegedly being attacked , then showered and fell asleep , according to cunningham 's attorney , who seized on her delay in reporting the assault
defense attorney ermine said the woman fabricated the story of assault in hopes of keeping an inheritance she had recently received from her late parents
' she wanted it all to herself , ' ermine said in an opening statement
' now she 's using you to convict him so he does n't get any money
' the woman called police after the assault and attempted to get cunningham committed under florida 's baker act , which allows for the involuntary examination of a person that poses threat of harm to self or others
she reported the alleged assault two days later , explaining to the jury that she had a difficult time coming to terms with what had happened at the hands of her husband
' you did that to me ! ' she yelled at cunningham in court
' i did n't do that to you
