saad al-jamal purchased the two - month - old lion cubs called alex and mona from the rafah zoo once the cubs are 15 - months - old they will develop adult teeth and possess the ability to tear flesh at just two months , the cubs eat half a kilogram of meat a day , and their appetites will become even larger as they get older
