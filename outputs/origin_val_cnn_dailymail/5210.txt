a schoolboy was ' excluded ' from world book day celebrations after turning up dressed as a grey character
liam , 11 , arrived at sale high school , greater manchester dressed as grey from the erotic novel , wearing a suit and holding cable ties and an eye mask
but teachers failed to see the funny side and phoned his mother nicola - who is herself a primary school teacher - to tell her the outfit was inappropriate
liam and his mother thought it would be fun for him to dress up as the character following the global success of the book by e.l. james , which has since been made into a hollywood blockbuster
but after packing her son off to school in the risquÃ© outfit , mrs scholes was phoned and told he would not be allowed to participate in themed events or a planned class photo
she said : ' we thought it was funny
we were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as grey
' at first we laughed it off but the we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea
' he went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties
the cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them
we did n't think there would be a problem
' i got a phone call home from the school saying the outfit was inappropriate and that he had been excluded from taking part or being in any of the photographs
' liam 's mother nicola said this morning that children his age knew about the book and its content ms scholes said the costume was liam 's idea to amuse his friends
she said he has n't read the book or seen the film ( which features the character playing a piano ) but knows about it from all the advertising of the film she added : ' me and the teacher agreed to disagree and it 's not being taken any further but i was disappointed for liam that he 'd been stopped from taking part and that he 's had a dressing down
was the school right to take action over schoolboy 's grey outfit ? was the school right to take action over schoolboy 's grey outfit ? now share your opinion ' one of the teachers went dressed as dexter and i do n't see why sex is seen as more offensive than murder
' if it was a primary school i could understand but it 's a secondary school and the book and the film have been everywhere - it 's one of the most famous books in recent years and it 's not like the pupils will be unaware of it
' liam told itv 's good morning britain : ' it 's the content of the book that people might think is inappropriate , but i went in dressed as grey just for a laugh
' his mother told the programme that children his age knew about the book and everyone recognised the character when he arrived for class register
she insists her son - who has n't read the book or seen the film - suggested the outfit after seeing advertising for the movie on tv and the internet
ms scholes told radio 4 's today programme : ' i do n't think i was breaking the rules
he went as a book character
' grey is one of the most famous book characters of recent years
' he 's aware that the book is saying things of a sexual nature
if you looked on twitter after the film came out it was everywhere
' despite the dispute , ms scholes insists she and the school have ' agreed to disagree ' and there are ' no hard feelings '
