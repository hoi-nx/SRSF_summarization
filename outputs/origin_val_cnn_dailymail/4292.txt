most afternoons i can be found huffing and puffing my way up primrose hill in london , pushing what feels like the world 's heaviest baby in a buggy
the view of the city from the top is spectacular but for a few precious days i swapped it for an even better one - with the magnificent backdrop of the italian dolomites
after a two - hour car journey from innsbruck we were greeted at rosa alpina - a five - star , family - owned hotel and spa tucked in a valley in the tiny village of san cassiano - with a local speciality : a sweet and comforting hot apple juice
impossibly neat : rosa alpina is nestled in the green foothills of the italian dolomites in the sunshine , the village looked pristine , with pretty wooden chalets stacked against mountain pastures which would have been snow - covered in winter but were now a vivid green
the grass was impossibly neat and as i wondered how many cows it must take to maintain , i spotted sit - on mowers weaving up and down the slopes
completing the alpine scene was a hefty - looking herd with jangling cowbells
having picked out a buggy from the hotel lobby , with map in hand we set off on a mountain walk but took the lazy way up - in a cable car
as the cable car lurched , my four month - old daughter romilly wobbled in my lap , lip trembling ; looking back down the mountain and up to the peak seemed a long way off
i began to doubt my fitness for what was my first post-baby trip away - billed as a yummy mummy healthy strolling break
i had feared craggy paths at the summit , precariously winding round the mountain , but found gentle , undulating trails
there was a restaurant , playground , park and fountain
it was as family friendly as the nursery department at john lewis
families and groups were starting out or finishing walks , with children in backpacks and buggies , or just jogging alongside their parents , perfectly content without a gadget in sight
some were nordic walking , others speed hiking
would this sort of family outing happen back home ? not likely and what a shame
instead of craggy , unforgiving trails , sarah found undulating trails in the mountains perfect for buggies the views were awesome and the air so pure i took in great gulps in the hope it might benefit my london - worn lungs
we could have easily taken a different trail each day of the week
at one hilltop restaurant , deckchairs overlooked the spectacular view like a sort of mountain beach , and children played on swings
for a different view of the mountains , the larch trail runs through meadows and up into the mountains opposite the hotel
it makes for a wonderful outing for energetic children ( and their parents ) and rosa alpina has produced a brilliant educational booklet which encourages little ones to look out for flora and fauna , plus answer questions on their surroundings
sarah and her four month - old daughter romilly enjoy the alpine views from the cable car tucked up inside at rosa alpina , the rooms were wonderfully warm - all sweet - smelling pine and herringbone fabrics - but come dusk it was far too tempting to resist lighting the wood fire
perhaps it was the mountain air , but bedtime passed without a murmur from romilly , who was spoilt with a beautifully made - up cot and goodie bag including baby slippers , towelling robe and a cuddly bear
adults get treats too - of the culinary variety
rosa alpina boasts st hubertus , a stunning michelin - starred restaurant , where chef norbert niederkofler uses seasonal vegetables ( no tomatoes in winter ) and 90 per cent local produce
romilly and i sank into a neat routine : a walk after breakfast , a swim after lunch
the peace was enough to move me to tears
for my daughter to experience so little intrusive sound apart from cockerels , cowbells and church bells was bliss
my ideal partner ( apart from my partner ) on the trip would have been my mother
the walks here are challenging enough to invigorate but easy enough to be a comfortable , clare balding - type ramble
i began to wonder if romilly would grow up craving a life of outdoor activities , of escaping and exploring
as a quote from fred astaire painted on the wall of the pool said : ' old age is like everything else - to have success in it you have to start young
