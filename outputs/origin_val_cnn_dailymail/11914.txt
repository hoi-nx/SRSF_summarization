it looks like something from outer space , but the ' alien of the deep ' is found much closer to home
with its fleshy snout , nail - like teeth and flabby pink body it would n't look out of place in a science fiction film , but the rare sea goblin shark described as an ' alien of the deep ' has been found off australia 's southeast coast and delivered to the australian museum in sydney
the prehistoric - looking goblin sharks live on deep sea bottoms and little is known about their lives
the shark had died by the time it was handed over , but it was still a priceless asset as only four of them have been acquired by the sydney museum - the first two collected back in the 1980s
a goblin shark with a long flattened snout covered with pores is shown at the australian museum ' it 's pretty impressive , it 's not hideous it 's beautiful , ' said the australian museum 's fish collection manager mark mcgrouther , who described its teeth as looking like ' little daggers '
' they are not caught terribly often
they are not encountered terribly often at all
' the latest was picked up by a fisherman in january
it was found near eden , off australia 's southeast coast , at a depth of about 200 metres and delivered in excellent condition to the museum
the australian museum 's fish collection manager mark mcgrouther shows the jaws of a goblin shark in the sorting lab in sydney mark mcgrouther said he was ' thrilled ' to handle the shark , which is found in the pacific , atlantic and indian oceans
the species , whose scientific name is ' mitsukurina owstoni ' , is thought to be a living fossil dating back some 125 million years
the animal 's jaw mechanism , which shoots forward when it detects prey and then retracts under its fleshy , spade - shaped snout , was what fascinated mark mcgrouther the most
its fleshy snout , nail - like teeth and flabby pink body makes it stand out from the crowd ' i suspect because it has got soft , flabby musculature , it does n't need much energy ... so it will swim slowly over the bottom just using its snout like a metal detector , ' he said
' it will be sweeping over the bottom and when it detects a small fish , or a crab or a squid it will shoot those jaws out ' wham ' and capture whatever it is
' it will spear it with those sharp pointed teeth and then just wolf it down whole
' the australian museum shows off a goblin shark , a rare sea creature described as an ' alien of the deep ' the latest goblin shark specimen , from which tissue samples have been taken for genetic testing , will be preserved by the museum and made available for research .
