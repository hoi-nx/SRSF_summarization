new york crews searching at the site where a building exploded in new york 's east village found two bodies in the rubble sunday
the victims ' remains have not yet been officially identified , but authorities believe they are the two people who were reported missing after thursday 's blast , new york fire commissioner nigro told reporters
the men reported missing last week , nicholas figueroa and locon , were thought to have been at a sushi restaurant at the time of the explosion
crews are still searching the scene , nigro said , even though it 's unlikely there are other victims
three buildings collapsed and four others were damaged thursday by the explosion and raging gas - fueled fire that followed
nigro declined to discuss details about what caused the blast , saying an investigation is ongoing
investigators are looking into whether a gas line was " inappropriately accessed " at the building where the explosion occurred , new york mayor bill de blasio told reporters friday
gas utility inspectors checking on work in the building 's basement left the premises about 30 minutes before the explosion
in august , con edison shut off gas lines at the building for 10 days after discovering they 'd been tampered with , according to alfonso quiroz , a spokesman for the utility
images from the scene before last week 's blast , the restaurant 's owner had smelled gas and contacted the building 's owner , but did n't contact authorities
that was a " major mistake , " new york emergency management commissioner joe esposito said sunday
" they should have called 911 , " he said
" we do n't know what the outcome would have been
but that 's what they should have done
" nicholas figueroa 's body was one of those recovered from the rubble sunday , family spokeswoman awilda cordero told cnn affiliates ny1 and wabc
" thank you to everybody for all the effort they did , " she said
" yes , it is nicholas figueroa
" nicholas figueroa , who had recently graduated from college , was on a date at the sushi restaurant and went to the back to pay when the explosion occurred
the family is devastated , she said , but relieved to learn that his body was found
" they 've been waiting and waiting
... this is just the beginning of doing something that they needed to do , " she said
locon , an employee at the restaurant , was reported missing by his brother , police sources said last week
" i saw that young man every day , every single day we had a chat to say ' hello how 's business , ' " schumacher , who owns a grocery store near where the explosion occurred , told wabc
" kid worked hard for his family " schumacher said
