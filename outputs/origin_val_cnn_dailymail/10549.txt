evans starts a six - match ban for spitting on monday night even though the united defender continues to protest his innocence
evans would have played in monday evening âs fa cup quarter - final against arsenal but he will also miss the semi-final in april should united win
a disciplinary panel ruled that evans and newcastle rival papiss cisse had spat at each other in an incident missed by referee anthony taylor
evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the newcastle striker , who then retaliates evans and papiss cisse clash near the half - way line at st james â park following the unpleasant exchange united defender evans received a six - match ban from the fa cup after the ugly incident tempers threatened to boil over as team - mates from newcastle and united gathered following the incident arsenal ( h ) monday night , fa cup * ; tottenham ( h ) march 15 liverpool ( a ) march 22 aston villa ( h ) april 4 man city ( h ) april 12 chelsea ( a ) april 18 ( * possible replay or fa cup semi-final could mean he is available for the chelsea game ) papiss cisse admitted the offence and apologised but evans insisted he had not done anything wrong
the fa cup disagreed and , in a statement , said : â mr evans denied the charge but it was found proven
â the incident , during united âs 1 - 0 win at st james â park on wednesday , was not seen by referee anthony taylor or his assistants , but was caught on tv
a three - man panel of former referees reviewed the footage last thursday and agreed the players should have been sent off , prompting the fa cup to bring a charge
an independent regulatory commission heard the charge and decided both players should be banned
papiss cisse , 29 , pleaded guilty and issued an apology for his part in the incident
he was suspended for an extra game as he was banned in december for elbowing everton âs seamus coleman
by contrast , evans , 27 , had denied the charge on thursday , saying : â i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at papiss cisse
â there is no right of appeal so evans will not be able to contest the decision by the three - man panel
