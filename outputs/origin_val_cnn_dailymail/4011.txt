a man who has fathered 34 children with 17 different women has landed his own reality series , which is due to start airing on oprah winfrey 's own network in september
jay williams , from atlanta , previously featured in an episode of iyanla : fix my life , another of the channel 's hit shows , which sees spiritual life coach iyanla vanzant , trying to help different people all struggling with various aspects of their lives
the untitled new series will follow the seemingly irresponsible father as he tries to establish new connections with his children , who are thought to be aged between three and 27 , and their mothers
any fans of iyanla 's show could n't fail to recognize jay williams - who was one of the series ' most controversial characters
when the video producer appeared on the show in september last year , he was lambasted by the life coach for failing to undergo a vasectomy - despite fathering so many children , who had , as of october 2014 , already made him a grandfather three times
' so let me ask you this question , jay williams , ' iyanla said during the episode
at any point , did it dawn on you this is too much ? ' the straight - talking life coach also forced jay williams to sit down with four of his children and explain to them why he had ' dropped them ' and failed to live up to his responsibilities as a father
' i would like to confess that i absolutely did not love or care for myself at all , ' he explained to the group of four
tough love : the straight - talking life coach demanded that jay williams own up to the mistakes that he has made , both as a father and as a man no trust : four of jay williams 's children appeared on the show ( pictured ) when their father tried to offer up an explanation for his behavior and apologize for not being there for them ' i have not honored your mothers as women the way that i should have
i would never say willingly , but i absolutely fell short on my responsibilities to you as a provider , at times
' and the biggest thing that i would like to confess is that i absolutely did not live up to be the true man that i am and the father that you really have
i am responsible for the reason why each and every one of you absolutely do n't know me
' but despite jay williams insisting that his sentiments were completely and utterly heart - felt , it seemed his sentiments came too little too late for some of his children
' i just want you to know that i really do n't care anymore , ' one of his daughters told him
' i 'm just not buying it
' ironically , despite admitting to fathering numerous children , jay williams insisted to iyanla throughout the show that he did use condoms - and even added that , had he chosen not to use contraception , he ' probably would have had 200 kids '
indeed , jay williams went as far as to say that he was ' happy ' about the number of children that he had fathered , remarking that he had n't chosen to get a vasectomy because he ' did n't want one ' .
