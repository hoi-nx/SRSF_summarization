customers of internet service provider iinet say unlimited access to netflix has slowed their internet connection since its launched in australia last week
iinet says on - demand streaming service netflix now accounts for 15 per cent of its consumer traffic , thanks to a partnership that allows customers to watch as much netflix content as they like without it counting towards their monthly data quota
but iinet said any problems with internet connections were not being caused by the rise in netflix users , instead blaming slow speeds on disruptions to the telstra network , the herald reported
' internet has been unusable in the last few days
yay for unmetered netflix @ iinet but also thanks for the congestion , ' one user wrote
another posted : ' so # netflix is 1/7 of iinet 's traffic
helps explain why internet slowness is even more s * * * ty than usual
' but iinet chief buckingham said any slow speeds customers were experiencing were due to issues with telstra 's copper network
' we are having countless mass service disruptions on the telstra copper network right now , so it might be people caught up in those who are commenting , ' mr buckingham told the herald
telsyte senior tech analyst gedda said it was possible that the netflix launch had hit iinet 's internet speeds
netflix will stream season three of its original series orange is the new black when it premieres on june 12 ' that sounds like a bit of buck passing by iinet , ' mr gedda told daily mail australia
' it is possible that iinet is feeling the heat of the netflix launch
' because it 's a new service in the local market and has attracted a lot of publicity , the more people that subscribe puts more load on the network
' telstra spokesman carey said the company could not comment on the performance of the iinet network or any congestion it may be experiencing
' iinet is responsible for the end - to - end management of their network and iinet customers need to contact them if they are experiencing problems , ' mr carey told daily mail australia
' a " mass service disruption " refers to a fault on the copper line , not the kind of congestion on a network that it is being reported iinet is experiencing
' daily mail australia has contacted iinet for comment
netflix is the premiere home for season three of the political drama , house of cards
