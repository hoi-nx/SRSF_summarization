chelsea manager mourinho no longer feels the need to implement a ' confrontational leadership ' style with his players because their season is going largely to plan
the 52 - year - old portuguese returned to stamford bridge for his second spell in charge last season but got off to a disappointing start by his own high standards and failed to win any silverware in 2013 - 14
this season , however , chelsea have already won the league cup and boast a six - point advantage over manchester city at the top of the premier league table with a game in hand
chelsea boss mourinho has revealed he has ditched his ' confrontational leadership ' style the portuguese tactician insists he has had no reason to ' provoke ' his players during the current campaign ' this season i do n't need confrontational leadership - last season i felt i needed it a few times , ' mourinho told reporters
' basically , it 's when you are ready to provoke your players to try to create some conflicts with the intention to bring out the best of them
' in this moment i do n't think i need that with this group because things are going in the direction i want
' it has not been all smooth sailing for mourinho this season , however , as chelsea were knocked out of the fa cup by league one ( third tier ) bradford and were eliminated in the last - 16 of the champions league by paris st germain
' obviously you can say " but you lost in the champions league " , or " you lost against bradford " , ' mourinho said
chelsea playmaker eden hazard has matured into a ' great player ' , according to mourinho ' but globally , generally , the way they work , the way they behave , the way they live together , their motivations , their responsibilities , their frustrations , the way they react to the negative moments , the way they react to the positive moments , the absence of complacency , all this is going well
' so i just need to be present
i do n't need to be a big leader , or even try to find strategies as a leader
' belgian forward eden hazard felt the wrath of mourinho 's ' confrontational leadership ' style last season after neglecting his defensive duties during chelsea 's champions league semi-final exit to atletico madrid
eden hazard , however , has been chelsea 's standout player this season but mourinho said he is unsure if the 24 - year - old 's development is down to the criticism he received
' i do n't know if it was that or it was his maturity coming , his level of ambition , ' he said
' i just think that was a natural evolution
' he wants to be the best , to improve his game , score more goals
i still call him a kid but he 's a man
he 's a great player
