when it comes to teaching children about manners , safety or even sex , most parents do n't hesitate in making sure their offspring have a good understanding ( no matter how awkward they may find it )
however , despite the huge importance placed on financial education , more than half of uk parents admit they find it difficult to talk to their kids about money , and are avoiding the topic for as long as possible
a report from the government âs money advice service found parents are simply leaving it too late , claiming children start forming money habits from as young as seven , whereas mums and dads leave discussing savings from around nine
financial education truly begins at home , so what can parents do to help their children get to grips with finance ? here , financial journalist and founder of blog mummymoneymatters.com kalpana fitzpatrick reveals her top seven tips
start young start talking to your child about money from as early an age as possible â five is not too young
it 's important for parents to make the lesson appropriate for their child 's age
with a son or a daughter who is five years old , mums and dads can start talking to them about different types of coins and let them pay for things when out shopping , so they get used to handling money , or play shops with them at home using pretend cash
open a savings account opening a dedicated savings account for your child is great way to show them how their money can grow , and can also help start conversations about how long it may take to reach a certain amount of money
it will also start to teach them the very basics on investments and savings
let them make mistakes it is important to give your children an allowance and let them use it as they choose
yes , they may well make what you consider to be the wrong choice , but they will learn from those mistakes , which is important for their financial learning curve
it is better for them learn from small amounts now at a young age , rather than bigger amounts when they are older when the consequences would be far more serious
be confident parents should remember when teaching their children about money , that they are helping them to learn a lifelong skill - so confidence is a must
some mums and dads are afraid to broach the subject , uncertain that they will be saying the right things , or feeling out of their depth
it 's important to start with the basics , and remember that any glimpse into handling financial matters that parents can offer their children will stand them in good stead for the future

pay for chores rewarding children for work around the house is the perfect way to teach them about earning money
whether it 's doing the washing up , washing the car or tidying their room , giving them a little cash for them to save or spend as they wish will introduce them to the working world
parents could also ask their children to think about and work out how many times they would have to , say , wash the car to pay for the xbox they so want , so they are familiar with the value of money
make it gradual parents should introduce their child 's financial education gradually - if mums and dads have n't spoken before about savings and how to use money , do n't jump in with one long chat , as it will become boring and feel like a chore to them
introduce it gradually , making it a fun thing rather than a serious lesson , and make sure it 's ongoing , developing your child 's awareness as their familiarity with money grows
be consistent although most parents give their children a sum of pocket money , only 36 per cent of mums and dads say they do so on a regular basis
being irregular and offering varied amounts can actually make it harder for children to learn about budgeting
for parents giving their child pocket money , do so on the same day , with the same amount , and discuss with them , in a lighthearted way , what they can buy with that money , or what happens when they pop it into their piggy bank - the amount they have doubles by the following installment
according to child psychologist dr elizabeth kilbey , it can be ' very empowering ' to give your children skills and confidence with money , so that they do n't have to face money worries in the future
this year âs theme for this week 's global money week is â save today , safe tomorrow â â parents can be part of helping children achieve this .
