zoolander stars ben and owen have collaborated with italian label valentino for the second time this month , posing for a unique fashion shoot in front of the eiffel tower in paris , just weeks after they stormed the catwalk at the brand 's paris fashion week show
many zoolander fans were overjoyed when the pair stepped out to close the valentino runway show earlier this month , in the guise of their iconic characters hansel and hansel
but now the comedic duo have taken the unlikely collaboration off the runway in order to pose up for a quirky print campaign , which is believed to have been shot around the same time as the catwalk show
and we just ca n't get enough
the other creative duo , valentino designers , maria grazia chiuri and pier paolo piccioli , have really breathed new life into the iconic brand and we 've been swooning over their collections for the last few seasons
we 've fallen head over heels for their ethereal gowns and been floored by their rainbow bright stripes this season

both dresses are really conveying that 1970s vibe we 're all rocking right now

' i was a little surprised , ' the 49 - year - old said about the reaction
