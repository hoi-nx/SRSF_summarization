lawyers for a transgender inmate convicted of murder asked the u.s. supreme court monday to overturn a ruling denying her request for sex - reassignment surgery
a federal judge ordered the department of correction to grant the surgery to kosilek in 2012 , finding that it was the ' only adequate treatment ' for kosilek 's severe gender dysphoria , also known as gender - identity disorder
that ruling was overturned in december by the 1st u.s. circuit court of appeals
supreme court appeal ? convicted murderer kosilek , born kosilek , is fighting to overturn a ruling that denied her request for a sex - change surgery
before and after pictures of kosilek as a man on the left in 1990 , and living as a woman on the right in 1993 lawyers with gay & lesbian advocates & defenders told the associated press they asked the supreme court to grant a hearing or to reverse the ruling by the appeals court
they argue that the appeals court did not find ' clear error ' in the judge 's ruling granting the surgery and therefore had no legal basis to overturn it
kosilek , born kosilek , is serving a life sentence for killing spouse cheryl mccaul in 1990
now 65 , kosilek has fought to get the surgery for two decades
in 2002 , judge wolf found that the treatment kosilek was receiving in prison was inadequate , but stopped short of ordering the surgery , finding that the department of correction had not violated her eighth amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment
victim : kosilek was convicted in 1990 of murdering her wife cheryl mccaul ( pictured ) after that , prison officials began to provide hormone treatments , electrolysis to remove facial hair , female clothing and personal items
in 2005 , kosilek sued the department of correction again , arguing that the surgery was a medical necessity
in 2012 , wolf became the first judge in the country to order sex - reassignment surgery as a remedy for an inmate 's gender - identity disorder
courts in other states have ordered hormone treatments , psychotherapy and other treatments , but not surgery
wolf found that the department of correction had violated the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth amendment by providing inadequate medical care to kosilek
a three - judge panel of the 1st u.s. circuit court of appeals upheld wolf 's ruling , but the state appealed , citing security concerns about protecting kosilek from sexual assaults if she completes her gender transition
she is currently housed in an all - male prison , but hopes to be transferred to the state 's women 's prison after the surgery
in december , a divided appeals court overturned the ruling by a 3 - 2 vote
kosilek 's lawyers argue that the appeals court overstepped its bounds and essentially re-tried the case
' their role is to defer to the trial judge on issues of fact , ' said jennifer levi , director of the transgender rights project of glad , the boston - based legal group that brought the lawsuit that led to massachusetts becoming the first state in the country to legalize gay marriage
' the meaning of the eighth amendment is only as rich as its application , so those words that require prisons to provide adequate medical care are hollow if you have a district judge that makes the kind of careful fact findings that judge wolf did who is then reversed on appeal without a demonstration of the error in his facts , ' levi said
kosilek 's lawyers also argue that the eighth amendment prohibits prison officials from denying necessary medical treatment to an inmate for non-medical reasons , including security concerns
a message seeking comment was left monday for the department of correction
it is unclear when the supreme court will decide whether to hear the case
the court receives between 7,500 and 8,000 new cases in a term and agrees to review roughly 1 percent of those appeals .
