mr young wrote in a facebook post : â the scorpion had already done its work on me and stung me three times
â i jumped out of my chair in a huge commotion and it fell out of my shirt on to the chair
â he was travelling with friend brendan dawson walsh , who thought it was a prank until he saw the scorpion on the plane âs floor
after they alerted flight attendants , the scorpion was found under mr young 's seat cushion and killed as the plane aborted its five - hour journey and returned to bogota last friday
