brook is giving khan 48 hours to commit to a battle of britain at wembley stadium on june 13 , or else he will find another big name to be given the special k treatment this summer
khan says sorry but he will be fighting in american next month , although he will oblige brook in due course
brook âs promoter hearn does not believe khan is scared of his man but said : â khan âs family are not certain he would win the fight and realise that if he were to lose it would be game over for their boy
â brook celebrates after beating jo jo dan during their ibf world welterweight title fight in sheffield there was a whiff of mayweather in the saturday night air in sheffield after brook flexed the vivid scar in his left leg and vexed his six months of anxiety since that machete attack on an inadequate challenger for his ibf world welterweight title
by keeping the world waiting for five years , the money man and the pacquiao have built their rivalry into a half - a - billion - dollar bonanza in vegas on may 2
by keeping the british on tenterhooks for another 12 months , brook and khan can crank up the ante way beyond what hearn describes as â the biggest pay - day of their lives
â brook has called out khan for the ' battle of britain ' and gave the boxer 48 hours to commit just so long as neither of them is beaten in the interim
that risk will be difficult to evaluate until they each identify their next opponent
brook is going to vegas to celebrate his 29th birthday by watching floyd and manny contest - the richest fight of all time
he will throw down the gauntlet to the winner but has more realistic alternatives
brook knocks down jo jo dan for the first time during the one - sided fight at the motorpoint arena they include mexican legend marquez in front of 40,000 of brook âs neighbours at sheffield united âs brammall lane football ground or tex-mex slugger rios in the manchester arena or london âs 02
khan is hoping to announce a foe for somewhere in american sometime next month
ideally puerto rican icon miguel cotto at catch - weight , maybe controversial adrien broner , or the less compelling recent mayweather victim chris algieri
in truth â impressively though brook proved his full recovery from that bizarre machete attack in tenerife six months ago â any of the above would provide sterner opposition than the canada - based romanian he employed as a punch - bag in the motorpoint arena this weekend
the welterweight knocked jo jo dan around the ring like a rag doll and wants a big one against khan jo jo dan became yo yo dan as he went down and up four times in the four one - sided rounds which ended in the inevitable stoppage
as a homecoming party for brook after winning his world title in the american then almost losing his life in that deeply scarring assault , it was fun for all concerned except the hapless gent in the other corner
desperate dan reeled around like a drunk as special k had him for breakfast , lunch and dinner at one sitting
brook sends jo jo dan flying for a third time and then knocked him down a fourth before it was stopped brook âs first right - hander wobbled him
more of the same dropped him in the second round
he somehow stayed upright in the third but the punishment was unrelenting and down he went twice more in the fourth
the final knock - down came a split - second before what proved to be the final bell
american referee earl brown conducted the required standing eight - count before ushering jo jo dan into his corner and then refusing him permission to come out again
not brook âs fault since this was his mandatory challenger and he was right to point out that jo jo dan had not been stopped before
wembley stadium has been booked for the fight by hearn but its remains to be seen if khan accepts although that does beg serious questions of the ibf rankings procedures
jo jo dan reeled around like a drunk in the ring and it is arguable that brook might have found a tougher rival in the pub round the corner
brook now rates himself up there with mayweather , pacquiao and khan among welterweight royalty
hearn concurred with that opinion , saying : â when brook first came to me his father told me he would beat mayweather one day
now he is just one more big win away from fighting floyd
â that victory will be easier to realise than the super fight in vegas , since anything other than an anti-climax on may 2 seems certain to result in a second - fortune rematch for mayweather and pacquiao in the autumn
jo jo dan had no answer to the power and speed of brook whose recovered well from his stabbing but against whom ? marquez is easing his ruptured knee back into training but is not certain to box again and will be expensive to bring to sheffield if he does
so the greater likelihood is rios
brook and his towns - folk would prefer it to be his fellow brit
when he took the microphone to ask who they wanted him to beat next , the packed crowd roared : â khan , khan , khan
â brook celebrates after beating jo jo dan during their ibf world welterweight title fight hearn would love that , too , and he believes it is also what the british fight fans desire
but he says : â if we do nât start talking for real in the next couple of days it will be too late for june 13
and i âm not expecting my phone to ring within 48 hours
they have already said that our fight will happen â but not next
â brook can rest easy on his world title and a left leg repaired by nuclear medicine
having done all that was required of him to stay unbeaten all he needs to do now to bring the big bucks rolling in is stay out of trouble .
