when ingested , it can cause bradycardia - slowing of the heartbeat
in severe cases , this can lead to heart failure
it also affects the nervous system causing nausea and dizziness and if absorbed through the skin , can lead to extreme difficulties in breathing and eventual coma or death
t - butanol used a pesticide , t - butanol is a carcinogen and highly toxic
if ingested it can also cause neurological damage

' star pubs and bars - the firm that owns the coach and horses - is now planning to sell the venue to amber taverns who plan on investing up to Â£ 500,000 to make the venue into a ' community pub '
the firm said it will complete the purchase of the pub and , subject to planning , aims to have it revamped , up and running by july
the meeting heard how gill , who did not attend the meeting , has no hand in running either premises
andrew cochrane , solicitor from star pubs and bars , the company that owns the building , said : ' mr sukhdev singh gill was the tenant and dps ( designated premises supervisor )
' obviously it 's immensely regrettable that mr sukhdev singh gill has chosen to go down that line stocking vodka that was substandard and dangerous

' the application to revoke the licence for chaplains was adjourned .
