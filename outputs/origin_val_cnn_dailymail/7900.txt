very few of us have lives interesting enough to warrant streaming them live on twitter , but a new app gives us the option - just in case
meerkat effectively turns your phone into a portable webcam and lets you broadcast live footage of whatever you point your handset 's camera towards
and because it connects with twitter , users already have a dedicated audience
meerkat effectively turns your phone into a portable webcam and lets you live stream whatever you point your handset 's camera towards
it has a simple premise : press the stream button , point the phone 's camera at a scene and a link to stream is automatically tweeted from a connected account the app was built by architecture student ben rubin and was on display at this week 's sxsw festival in austin

there is also a schedule button to start recording at a later time
this tweet is posted with a [ live now ] message
an optional # meerkat tag is added to the end of the tweet to make it easy to find
that user 's followers can reply and retweet the link , to get more people involved , and watch it through the app or on a desktop browser
so far , streams have included us chat show host jimmy fallon rehearsing a monologue for the tonight show and live streams of sports
other more mundane , and in some cases disgusting , streams have included people riding on a bus or even picking their nose notably , some of these sports streams have been live from the event while others have simply been a live stream of the sport on the user 's tv
this means that people who ca n't afford a cable tv subscription could watch a game online
the top searches on twitter include # meerkat and # meerkat live sports ( shown ) so far , streams have included us chat show host jimmy fallon rehearsing a monologue for the tonight show , spotify streaming a live spin class with dj and live streams of sports
when meerkats first launched last month it imported a user 's twitter followers as well as showed who they were following
however , this was said to have annoyed twitter and the social network cut off meerkats 's access to this service
twitter recently bought a live - streaming service called periscope which is a direct rival to meerkats
meerkat has found a way around this though by adding a search feature that lets users find their favourite twitter users
notably , some of these sports streams have been live from the event while others have simply been a live stream of the sport on the user 's tv
this means that people who ca n't afford a cable tv subscription , for instance , could watch a game through someone 's twitter feed

it is unclear how this would affect licensing and broadcasting laws and mailonline has asked a lawyer and broadcasters for comment
sky told mailonline that it : ' focuses on preserving the value of its investment in sports broadcasting rights and , as part of this , will monitor new technologies and digital distribution methods that become available
' we work closely with our rights holder partners to , where appropriate , address unauthorised use

the app promotes itself as a tool for citizen journalists to broadcast live footage of news events , for example
this cuts out the need to film a video and upload it to youtube , for example
mr ben rubin told business insider his favourite use of the app was live bbc reporting from protests in ferguson
there is no limit on the length of stream but once the stream has ended it is automatically removed from meerkats 's servers - similar to jhow snapchat works
this means the stream is saved on the user 's phone but ca n't be accessed on the cloud via the link

at the moment the free app is only available on ios ( pictured ) but mr ben rubin has said the team is working on developing an android version as of the 15 march , more than 91,000 so - called meerkats - or live streams - have been tweeted , generating more than 293,800 views and 102,600 retweets according to statistics from simply measured everything that happens on meerkat happens on twitter
streams will be pushed to followers in real time via push notifications
people can only watch it live
watchers can restream any stream to their followers in real time
scheduled streams will be distributed in the community by their subscribers
your own streams can be kept locally on your phone , but never on the cloud
everyone can watch on web
but people could use screen capturing software during the stream if they wanted to record and keep it
and , in theory , the app raises privacy concerns especially if live footage features people being filmed either surreptitiously or by accident without permission
there is also the wider issue of hacking
if a hacker was able to take control of a user 's phone and camera they could use the service to live stream any footage they wanted
of course , this is an issue that affects a wide range of apps , and not just meerkat , but its immediacy and live nature highlights the problem more than on other services
there is also potential for pornographic footage to be streamed
meerkats 's terms of service does n't address this directly but explained : ' you are responsible for your use of the services , for any content you post to the services , and for any consequences thereof
' the content you submit , post , or display will be able to be viewed by other users of the services and through third party services and websites
' you should only provide content that you are comfortable sharing with others under these terms
' in its rules it also says simply : ' be kind
