they have urged other couples to invest time in their marriage as a preemptive measure , ' before it 's too late ' ' wrapped up in just getting through each day , the parents have little time left for each other , and the communication breakdown begins
' marina has been keen to stress the importance of communication in a successful marriage , and has said she can see how couples can easily get so busy that they leave no time for each other
whilst many of her toddler - raising friends agree that marriage counselling is a good idea , marina suggested that most couples who receive therapy make the decision too late
long periods apart : marina has suggested that many couples become increasingly busy during parenthood , and leave little time for each other often , marina says , this is due to a lack of time
she added : ' we spend a day deliberating about which sofa to buy , but we ca nât relinquish an hour for the sake of our marriages ? ' and the fogles ' marriage has faced more challenges than most in recent years

although the initial therapy was focused around dealing with their grief , the pair now see their counsellor regularly about their relationship
they rarely argue , marina says , but when they do , they can be particularly hard to get over
the house is the thing they say they 're most likely to row about - and a confrontation can often take them weeks to recover from

moving forward : marina is using her experiences of motherhood in her own pregnancy clinic in south kensington advising other mums - to - be ' i âd argue our emotional wellbeing is significantly more important than our cars , eyes or teeth , ' says marina
' if you can learn how to be strong while the going is easy , you will be better equipped for the more challenging terrain when it comes
' it was the difficult experience of childbirth that also prompted marina to open her pregnancy clinic the bump class
the mother - of - two now runs her south kensington - based clinic along with her sister , chiara hunt , and the pair aim to guide pregnant women through what can be a daunting time
the idea is that women often have very similar experiences during childbirth and they can benefit from sharing their journey with others .
