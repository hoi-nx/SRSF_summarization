some say that certain people ca nât see the forest for the trees
but a skier in kiroro , japan proved that you ca nât always see the trees for the ski slope either after one appeared to come out of nowhere and wipe him out on a mountain
videoed skiing towards a slight lip in the piste , the skier gets a remarkable amount of air as he propels himself into a forward flip
but as quickly as the footage begins looking impressive , it begins looking painful as he ploughs straight into a tree upon landing
the failed stunt is repeated twice more in slow motion , which shows in greater detail the moment the man spots the tree and braces for impact
crashing into it , the tree âs branches sway violently and its entire dusting of snow disappears into the atmosphere
the skier approaches a slight gradient in the slope before he jumps up into the air to attempt a foward flip a close up shot of the man in the tree shows how tangled within it he is as one of his skis looks genuinely stuck
he looks relatively okay however considering the force in which he collides with it
the clip concludes with a doctor at the hospital utilising a rather ingenious app that translates his japan into english
hurtling through the air the skier gains a surprising amount of height and initially appears to be pulling off an impressive flip he asks the man : â are you dizzy ? â to which he replies with a nod , circling his face with his hand as if to indicate where he is feeling pain
the doctor , now sitting in front of what seem to be x-rays of the man âs skull , then appears to say : â three days â
perhaps suggesting the amount of time the man should refrain from skiing for
the man realises his mistake while hurtling through the air and braces himself for the impact of the crash while not an obvious place to ski , japan has some 600 ski resorts and some impressive sites including niseko , known for its international clientele
japan slopes are not as steep as some of the better known places to ski , but they are generally much cheaper to enjoy
and because of the lack of tourism to the skiing areas , they are sometimes occupied by only a handful of people
watch out for that ... the man crashes into the tree and becomes tangled within it as its branches sway violently
