a single mother has revealed how she fell for an online charmer who trawled dating websites looking for available women â so he could steal from them
gosney , from ipswich , suffolk , hoped olley , who she knew as danny , would be the man of her dreams when she found him on plenty of fish
but the 45 - year - old thief went on to steal her car â and she only found out when she spotted it in the forecourt of a dealership weeks later
gosney , pictured with her daughter somer , 11 , met olley , who was jailed for three years after stealing the mother - of - three 's car , on the website plenty of fish olley told miss gosney he was taking her car in to be repaired - she then saw it for sale the mother - of - three was on the bus , looking out of the window , when she saw the peugeot
miss gosney , 45 , contacted the police and it emerged olley was a prolific thief who hunted for prey on dating websites so he could plunder from them
speaking for the first time since olley was convicted of theft , miss gosney has told how she will never go online dating again
she wanted to warn other women not to be lured in by olley , who tricked at least four others and was described as â a cautionary tale for vulnerable women â by judge david goodin
miss gosney told how she met olley in january 2013 after moving from warrington to essex
after a few weeks of dating , she introduced olley , who said he was a mechanic , to her children ryan , 27 , ellis , 22 and somer , 11
after convincing miss gosney that her car was broken , olley went on to blag a further Â£ 500 from her , which he claimed was needed to cover the cost of the repairs
â i do nât have a clue about cars and he seemed to know what he was talking about
he flipped the bonnet up and looked horrified at what was underneath , â she said
â he listed things that needed repairing and it sounded like it was going to cost a fortune
i told him i could nât afford it , so he offered to fix it for me at the garage where he worked
â although we âd only been dating a few weeks , i trusted him
he seemed so genuine , like he was just happy to help
â miss gosney , who works in a salon , handed over her keys to olley , who later demanded Â£ 500 from her to cover the cost of car parts needed to fix the vehicle
miss gosney said she was forced to get the bus to and from work after olley took her car but two weeks later , she still did not have her car back
â i knew something was nât right , â she explained
â i kept asking him where my car was and he just made up excuses
he told me there was more wrong with it than he first thought and that it was taking him longer than expected
â i had to get the bus to and from work , and to pick my daughter up from school
â when he asked for money to pay for car parts , i thought it sounded expensive
but by that point , i was desperate for my car back , so i gave him the money hoping it would hurry things up a bit
â four weeks later , miss gosney âs suspicions grew when she had not seen olley in days and struggled to get hold of him
he told miss gosney , who has since moved back to warrington , that he was in hospital being treated for diabetes
gosney , pictured with her daughter somer , said she felt ' stupid ' for not realising olley was a fake but miss gosney âs patience ran thin and she reported him to the police , only to discover he was already wanted in connection with conning other women out of cars and money
â they told me he âd served a prison sentence in 2012 for similar crimes
i felt so stupid for not realising he was a fake , â she said
â he even stole from my little girl because her nintendo dsi was in the car âs glove compartment when he took it
she never got it back
â amazingly in march 2013 , weeks after reporting olley to the police , miss gosney spotted her car for sale in a car dealership , while on the bus home from work
she said : â it was on sale for Â£ 600
i could nât believe it
he âd had the nerve to steal my car from me , then sell it to my local car dealership
miss gosney reported olley to the police , only to discover he was already wanted in connection with conning other women out of cars and money â i contacted the police and they managed to get it back for me
but i âd been without a car ages by then and was still out of pocket Â£ 500
â in may 2013 , olley appeared at chelmsford crown court and admitted four charges of theft against miss gosney and another woman , who he âd stolen Â£ 70 from which belonged to her eight - year - old son , and her young daughter âs phone
he was jailed for three years
since then , olley has appeared in court again in october 2013 to face similar charges against other victims and has been jailed for 46 months
miss gosney said : â i âm still embarrassed for not realising danny was a fraud
i really liked him and thought he was a decent man
but he took advantage of me and so many other women
â the whole experience has put me off online dating
i âve met someone new now â and did nât meet him online
â i hope my story will serve as a warning to other women , to steer clear of danny
â you âll only end up paying for him to break your heart
