' when the giant panda sunk its teeth into my leg the pain was indescribable
blood was everywhere , ' said mr quanzhi
pandas have a ' cuddly ' reputation but can be territorial
they have strong jaws which enable them to strip bamboo but this also means they can deliver a powerful bite
the incident took place on march 1 last year when the panda wandered into a village near longnan city in gansu province
locals attempted to capture the animal only for it to flee them and run into mr quanzhi 's land
mr quanzhi , who is in his 60s , added : ' i was working at home and saw many people running in my direction , looking closer i could see a mud - covered panda being chased
' as the animal saw mr quanzhi was blocking its path he sunk its teeth into its leg until someone threw a coat over it
the panda fled and disappeared after being seen wandering around in the mountains for more than half an hour
locals realised mr quanzhi was seriously injured and he was taken to qingchuan county people 's hospital , which was more than 10km away , for emergency treatment
the next day mr quanzhi had to endure a seven hour operation to repair the broken bone in his leg and stem a ruptured vein
he was in hospital for two months
because of his family 's financial circumstances the village council and the forestry bureau borrowed 70,000 yuan ( Â£ 7,500 ) and 30,000 yuan ( Â£ 3,000 ) respectively

' after so much suffering and over such a long period of time part of his leg muscles have slowly shrunk and this has led to him not being able to walk on his leg and no longer being able to look after himself
' mr quanzhi was told that because his recovery has been unsatisfactory he is likely to need further surgery and may need to have his leg amputated
he took the provincial forestry department , longnan city 's county forestry bureau and the whitewater river national nature reserve administration , home to around 100 wild pandas , to court

' although giant panda 's are generally docile , they are still wild animals , and are territorial , ' director of the giant panda protection and research centre of china , zhang hemin
' pandas rarely ever attack people , but if people enter their territory they will attack in self - defense as a warning
' the animals are an important draw for tourists in china , and several are rented out to zoos
they have also been known to attack people in the past
in 2008 a panda mauled a 20 - year - old man who scaled a 6ft tall barrier to climb into its enclosure at a zoo in southern china
the panda was apparently scared by the intruder and bit the man on his arms and legs .
