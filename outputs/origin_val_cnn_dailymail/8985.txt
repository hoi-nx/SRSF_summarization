jailed for a year : burton agreed to say he was behind the wheel when 14 other motorists were caught flouting road regulations more than a dozen drivers paid one man to accept their points for offences - before police realised what had happened when they saw his licence had 49 points , a court has heard
burton , 45 , of newcastle , agreed to say he was behind the wheel when 14 other motorists were caught speeding , flouting a red light , driving without a seatbelt or using a mobile in the car over a six - year period
police only became suspicious when it was realised that burton had 49 penalty points on his licence - the majority of which were not his
officers noticed that they had received many notices of intended prosecution - sent when a vehicle is seen or photographed committing a driving offence - naming burton
a huge amount of documentation relating to him between 2006 and 2012 was then reviewed , and the scam was uncovered
drivers are generally banned from the road when they accrue 12 penalty points
but now , six of the group have been jailed and most of the others given suspended sentences after admitting perverting the course of justice at newcastle crown court
one of them had his sentencing adjourned
the 13 men and one woman include a council worker , retired royal navy refrigerator engineer , roofing business owner , scaffolder and director of a construction company
judge deborah sherwin said the seriousness of their actions was evident from the case against politician chris huhne , who tried to cover up swapping speeding points with his ex-wife in 2003

i accept their remorse has been demonstrated
â i accept they âre isolated incidents , unlikely to be repeated
i also accept that , at the time , it was not appreciated how seriously the court would view this offending
â you would come to realise how seriously that court takes matters such as these by press articles into the case of chris huhne and his ex-wife vicky pryce in 2013
â dunnen , prosecuting , said after the 14 drivers were caught breaking road regulations , they got in touch with burton and he agreed to take their points for them

that person then has to state whether they were driving the vehicle at the time and , if not , who was
the recipient then has to sign , date and return the notice
council worker : susan latimer , 53 , was given a six - month prison sentence , suspended for 12 months the court heard that , when each of the defendants received their notices of intended prosecution , they named burton as the driver at the time of the offence
mr dunnen added : â police began investigating this matter as a result of a large number of occasions they received a notice of intended prosecution naming burton and a large quantity of documentation relating to burton between 2006 and 2012 was then reviewed
â photos taken by speed cameras also showed burton was not in fact driving some vehicles at the relevant time
there was also one incident where further details emerged from mobile phone exchanges between the defendants burton , david tate and kenneth walker
â mr dunnen said that one text message , sent by kenneth walker to david tate , in january 2012 said : â i need the guy âs full details who is taking the points asap , mate
