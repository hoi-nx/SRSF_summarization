but as the pup is scratched around a tickly spot on his neck he suddenly puts his paws up over his eyes
as soon as the tickling stops , the dog releases his legs down
but when his neck is touched again , he takes his paws back up apparently crying with ' laugh - fur - ter '
the pet 's owner can be heard giggling as she watches the adorable scene play out
' our puppy hates her neck being touched , ' the filmer later wrote online
