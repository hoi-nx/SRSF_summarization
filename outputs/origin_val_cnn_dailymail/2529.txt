a gm â super spud â claimed by scientists to be healthier to eat , cheaper to grow and better for the environment could be field tested in british next year
but plans for the trials were condemned last night by critics who argue that genetically modifying crops to create â frankenfoods â could threaten natural ecosystems and human health
scientists at the publicly funded sainsbury laboratory in norwich are hoping to develop the potato using eight genes from other varieties
scientists claim to have be close to engineering a gm â super spud â which is healthier to eat , cheaper to grow and better for the environment
a stock image of non gm potatoes is pictured they claim this will reduce the risk of potentially harmful acrylamide chemicals forming when potatoes are fried â a problem that has been linked to cancer
the added genes will also protect against potato blight , which costs british farmers Â£ 60million a year in losses and use of fungicides , and nematode worms
professor jonathan jones , who is leading the project and is already in negotiations with the us firm simplot to commercialise the potato , said gm technology is the only way to achieve such results
but field trials , which the scientists hope to begin in 12 months â time , will first have to be approved under tough eu regulations and are likely to attract protesters , requiring them to be conducted behind high fences
anti-gm groups said last night the project was a waste of taxpayers â money and even if the scientists â claims were proven , consumers would never want to buy the resulting food
critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create â frankenstein foods â could damage natural ecosystems
a stock image of a protester is shown professor jonathan jones and his team have previously developed a potato which , after three years of trials , was shown to ward off blight and increase yields
they sold the results of that research to simplot and are looking to develop the idea by introducing further genes
peter melchett , of the soil association , said : â a previous gm potato , launched in 2009 , was claimed to be the answer to the blight disease common in the british potato crop
â now we âre told that wo nât work , and a gm potato needs up to eight different gm characteristics to be useful
â as with other gm research , this is a complete waste of time , money and scientific expertise
â liz oâneill , of the campaign group gm freeze , said : â blight is very good at evolving â this might just force a faster evolution of the disease
â although there have been field trials in the past , no gm food has ever been commercially grown in british because of european regulations that make it difficult to get licences
it means that although british researchers are leading the way in developing gm technology , the end results are usually snapped up by foreign firms
professor jonathan jones said gm â has been shown to be safe â , and before the potato could be sold , it would need extensive testing and authorisation from eu bodies such as the european food safety authority
he added : â some people have concerns about us partnering with industry , but as research scientists we â¦ need commercial partners if the public are to gain the benefits of our research
â professor jonathan jones , who is leading the project said the new potato â aims to be better for the environment , reduce production costs , reduce waste and also be healthier â
he hopes to conduct field trials in just 12 months time
a stock image of a field of potatoes is shown suspicious research : professor gilles-eric seralini , who authored a study claiming gm gives you cancer , is backed by a homeopathy group the myth : food that has been genetically modified may be harmful to humans
and that does nât include many more made with milk or meat from animals given gm feed
there has yet to be one case of any ill - effect
the myth : trials show gm feed may cause cancer or stomach problems in animals
the truth : the author behind the â bogus â research fuelling this claim , prof gilles-eric seralini , is closely linked to and funded by leading members of a homeopathy group which believes bone cancer can be cured with water and minute quantities of magnesium
the research has been attacked by every major scientific institution in the field , including the food standards agency
the myth : gm strains will cross-pollinate and so â contaminate â other crops and man will have irrecoverably interfered with the stuff of life
others like potatoes are cultivated via tubers , so pollen is not an issue for them either
as for rice , it âs also mostly self - pollinating
the myth : organic food is safer
the truth : the food standards agency says there âs no evidence â and furthermore , germs from manure create risks of their own : an e. coli outbreak in organic beansprouts in germany killed 50 people in 2011 and last month in the us 100 people contracted the serious liver disease hepatitis a from organic berry yohurt
the myth : gm will lead to a stranglehold by multinationals like monsanto
the truth : many gm crops have been developed by universities and are not patented
the full cost of developing golden rice , which will remedy the vitamin a deficiency which kills and blinds millions of children per year , is being met by the charitable project behind it .
