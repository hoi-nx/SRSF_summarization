clegg today challenged the tories come clean about where the axe will fall , just 24 hours after the coalition ended
the lib dems leader accused cameron and osborne of ' trying to pull the wool over your eyes ' by promising to protect the nhs without spelling out how he will pay for it
he said that only the lib dems have promised to find the Â£ 8billion which nhs chiefs say will be needed by 2020 , and how the money will be found
lib dems leader clegg , who tried his hand at making pancakes at a panasonic manufacturing site in cardiff , took aim at chancellor osborne , who spent the day making making dough at a pizza express in hove simon stevens , the head of nhs england , has warned that by the end of the decade the health service will need an extra Â£ 8billion - a - year
mr clegg boasted that he would ensure the nhs got the money , but he said labour had not made that pledge and the tories ' try to give the impression they have , but they have n't '
at an election campaign press conference at the national liberal club in central london he said : ' we know the conservative wo n't ask the wealthiest to pay a penny more so every spending commitment they make has to be met by deeper and deeper cuts elsewhere
' so , osborne , jeremy hunt - where will the axe fall ? soldiers , schools social workers ? the only people the tories have said they will protect are their friends in big business and in big houses
' the conservatives are trying to pull the wool over your eyes by not telling you how they will give the nhs the resources it needs
' mr osborne was visiting hove on the south coast as a row raged over spending cuts planned after the election the tories have promised to give the nhs the money it needs , but the lib dems say they have not been clear about where the money will come from mr clegg added : ' the dividing lines of this election are becoming clearer by the day
the conservative will cut too much , labour will borrow too much
excessive cuts or excessive borrowing
it 's a dismal choice
' what you want is a balanced budget and stronger public services
that 's what the lib dems offer
' the lib dems were the first to publicly commit to providing ' in full ' the extra Â£ 8 billion a year the nhs boss says it needs by 2020
the party promises to repeat the Â£ 2 billion annual ' down payment ' announced by mr osborne each year to 2020 and add Â£ 1 billion from a tax squeeze on high earners and ending the conservative ' shares for rights ' policy
but the bulk of the extra is slated to come from increasing public spending in line with economic growth after eliminating the structural deficit in 2017 - 18
mr clegg used a press conference at the national liberal club to claim only the lib dems have spelt out how to fund Â£ 8billion extra for the nhs mr clegg said the lib dems would be ' pretty specific ' about exactly where the party 's preferred tax rises would hit by the time voters go to the polls the lib dems today pledged an extra Â£ 2.5billion for mental health care to end ' decades of institutionalised discrimination ' in the nhs
clegg said his party had proved they were serious about the issue by campaigning ' remorselessly ' in government for improved services , with some success
some Â£ 250 million over five years will be spent on services for pregnant women and mothers dealing with depression
this would include eight new mother and baby units providing inpatient care and 40 new community services helping new mothers adjust to life at home with a newborn
new waiting time standards will be introduced for people in crisis and for conditions like bipolar disorder so that those who are ill know how long they have to wait
the funding would also mean hundreds of thousands more people will get access to talking therapies for anxiety and depression
a commitment to boost funding for health , with a particular focus on mental health , will be on the front page of the lib dems election manifesto , indicating it will be a key priority in any coalition talks after the general election
felicity dormon , senior policy fellow at the health foundation charity , said well - targeted extra funding for mental health could improve the quality of nhs care but questioned what other areas of health would lose cash as a result
however , this raises questions about what happens if the economy does not grow as rapidly as hoped
mr clegg said it was ' perfectly legitimate ' to base policy on current projections
' you can only operate on a set of assumptions
that 's what any economist does
since i ca n't tell you precisely in the future what is going to happen , i can tell you that we base our plans on the predictions that are given independently by the office of budget responsibility , ' he said
asked what the plan would be if growth was slower , he said : ' well , what do i do if the world comes to an end next tuesday ? ' the greatest threat to ongoing growth in the british economy is that we do n't continue the balanced approach to fiscal consolidation and maintain the stability which has led to far greater growth than many predicted
' mr clegg went on : ' ed miliband , cameron , it 's time to come clean : will you or will you not give the nhs the Â£ 8 billion a year by 2020 that it needs and tell us how you plan to fund it ? ' the lib dems have
if you care about the nhs as much as you claim to , you should too
' mr clegg said the lib dems would be ' pretty specific ' about exactly where the party 's preferred tax rises would fall by the time voters go to the polls
it says Â£ 6 billion of the cost of balancing the books should come from increased tax - with the same sum found from a clampdown on tax dodgers , Â£ 12 billion in whitehall cuts and around Â£ 3.5 from a squeeze on welfare
' i accept the challenge that we should show how that Â£ 6 billion is arrived at in additional taxes but i think we have already provided far more detail than any other party in the early stages of this election campaign , ' mr clegg said
' on taxes we will be pretty specific
