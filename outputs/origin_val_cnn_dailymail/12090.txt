stuart hogg has whipped up a storm ahead of saturday âs twickenham clash by insisting england have â no respect â for scottish rugby and are â all about themselves â
the scotland and lions full - back believes his country are very much perceived as second - class competition south of the border - and his thoughts echo those of skipper greig laidlaw who claims â england do nât rate scotland very much â
both players are bottling up their frustrations for the calcutta cup clash , with stuart hogg hoping to silence the critics with scotland âs first victory of this year âs six nations following defeats to france , wales and italy
stuart hogg claimed england have ' no respect ' for scottish rugby ahead of saturday 's twickenham clash stuart hogg breaks away to score the opening try during the six nations game against wales in february stuart hogg ( centre ) wants to record scotland 's first win of the tournament against england at twickenham â the english are a fantastic team but they âre pretty much all about themselves at times , â stuart hogg told sportsmail
â they do nât really respect us and we find that pretty frustrating
there will be a certain number of people that do respect us but , no matter how good our performance is , on the whole they do nât
â we âre not really in a position to make them respect us when we âre zero wins from three , so for that to happen we need to go down there and shut them up with a great performance and a big win
â stuart hogg revealed that his frustrations were exacerbated during glasgow warriors â european champions cup ties with bath earlier this season when the pro12 side won 37 - 10 in the first leg at scotstoun before narrowly losing 20 - 15 in the reverse fixture at the rec. asked to explain his comments about the lack of respect , the 22 - year - old borderer said : â there are loads of different things
take bath , for instance , in the european games
we pummelled them at home in glasgow and almost beat them down there , yet their coach never once mentioned us after the games
â after they went through , they said they had a tough pool with toulouse and montpellier , but never once mentioned us
that kind of sums it up for me and , with the way the lads go on with greig laidlaw down at gloucester , it âs quite clear that they do nât respect us
â meanwhile , england centre brad barritt is a doubt for saturday after injuring his ankle in saracens â 26 - 17 win at wasps on sunday
stuart hogg clings to the ball in scotland 's 22 - 19 defeat against italy in their last six nations game brad barritt injured his ankle in saracens ' win over wasps on sunday and is now a doubt for england brad barritt seemed destined for a recall against scotland , with luther burrell unable to train last week , but the 28 - year - old limped away from the ricoh arena after wasps fly - half andy goode landed heavily on his right leg
saracens â director of rugby mark mccall said : â it seems to be his ankle
the knee seems to be okay
i âm sure he âll be close to selection for england next weekend , so fingers crossed it âs not as bad as it looked
â if brad barritt is fit to play , he is set to rejoin the back line along with harlequins full - back mike brown
up front , northampton âs courtney lawes is expected to come into the second row in place of george kruis .
