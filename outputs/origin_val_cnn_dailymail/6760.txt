this is the heart - warming moment two young african elephants locked trunks in a touching embrace that was caught on camera
the very public display of human - like affection was photographed by matthysen at the kariega game reserve , east of port elizabeth , south africa
it occurred while a herd of nearly 30 elephants playfully chased each other and rolled around on the floor at the popular tourist destination
photographer matthysen said two young elephants locked trunks , like humans would hold hands , in a touching embrace matthysen , who works as a photographer for the reserve , said he is used to seeing the young elephants act in a playful manner , but their affectionate behaviour took him by surprise
as matthysen and a group of visitors looked on , two of the elephants stopped chasing each other and entwined their trunks in a loving gesture
at one point it appeared as if they were â kissing â
the 37 - year - old photographer said : â the mood in the herd seemed â excited â
we moved out to a safer distance - about 50 metres ( 164ft ) - away when one of the younger bulls , about eight years of age , started chasing a younger bull
the heart - warming moment occurred as a herd of nearly 30 elephants playfully chased each other and rolled around on the floor â what we first thought to be aggression , turned out to be all playfulness
â soon a number of younger bulls and cows started to play around
they pushed , head butted and rolled onto each other for quite a few minutes
â soon after , it looked like they were embracing each other , with gentle touches to the faces with their trunks
â matthysen , the game reserve 's photographer , said the elephants ' affectionate behaviour caught him by surprise he said two of the elephants locked trunks like humans would hold hands
â i quickly focused my camera on them , to capture the â loving â moment
â i am very happy with the sighting and images
this just shows us how these giants , that can be so dangerous and so aggressive , can in fact be so gentle and loving animals
