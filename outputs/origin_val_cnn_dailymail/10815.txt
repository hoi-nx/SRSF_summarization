president obama said tuesday that he has a ' businesslike ' working relationship with israel prime minister bibi , but that the two men have virtually irreconcilable differences in their approaches to establishing a palestinian state as a road to middle east peace
' we believe that two states is the best path forward for israel 's security , for palestinian aspirations , and for regional stability , ' obama said during an afternoon joint press conference with afghanistan president ashraf ghani ahmadzai
' that 's our view , and that continues to be our view
' bibi , he said , ' has a different approach
' ' and so this ca n't be reduced to a matter of , somehow , " let 's all hold hands and sing kumbaya " , ' the president told reporters in the east room of the whtie house
' i took him at his word , that that 's what he meant , ' obama said , later saying of prospects for a two - state solution that ' that possibility seems very dim
' ' we 'll continue to engage the israel government as well as the palestinian , ' he insisted , ' and ask them â where are they interested in going ? and how do they see this issue being resolved ? ' ' but what we ca n't do is pretend that there 's a possibility of something that 's not there
and we ca n't continue to premise our public diplomacy based on something that everybody knows is not going to happen , at least in the next several years
bibi had said in 2009 that he would be willing to endorse a ' demilitarized ' palestinian state as long as it recognized israel 's right to exist
but his pledge barely a week ago seemed to erase that option
after the election , bibi clarified his campaign promise about never allowing a palestinian state to take root
' i said that the conditions for that today are not achievable for a simple reason , ' he said during a fox news channel interview
' mahmoud abbas , the leader of the palestinian , rejects consistently the acceptance of a jewish state
he 's made a pact with the palestinian terrorist organization hamas that calls for our destruction
' ' and the conditions in the middle east has changed to the point where any territory you withdraw from is immediately taken out by iranian backed terrorists or by isis
' ' right now we have to get the palestinian to go back to the negotiating table , ' he added , ' break their pact with hamas and accept the idea of a jewish state
' distraction : the president was in the east room with afghanistan president ashraf ghani ahmadzai to talk about a potential troop withdrawal , but talk of israel occupied nearly 20 minutes of the press conference ' aspirations ' of mahmoud abbas : while palestinian - aligned terrorists call for the destruction of israel , obama aims to create conditions for the palestinian authority 's peaceful coexistence with israel obama declared on tuesday that those conditions were unworkable
' he pointed out that he did n't say " never " , ' the president said of bibi 's apparent flip - flop
' but that there would be a series of conditions in which a palestinian state could potentially be created
' ' but of course the conditions were such that they would be impossible to meet any time soon
' obama brushed off a follow - up question from a reporter about whether his administration would try to force the issue through the united nations security council , where the u.s. has for decades blocked measures designed to establish a palestinian state despite israel 's objections
he said he would wait until bibi assembled his new coalition government before decidign whetehr to take action
obama also took pains to clarify that any reassessment of u.s. - israel relations would n't have an impact on defense arrangements with tel aviv
' our military and intelligence cooperation with israel will continue â unabated , unaffected â and we are absolutely committed to ensure that the israel people are safe , ' he said , ' particularly from rocket attacks and terrorist attacks aimed on civilians
