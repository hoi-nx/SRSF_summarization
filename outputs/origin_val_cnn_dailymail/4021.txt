leaks by the america traitor edward snowden have â damaged â intelligence agencies across the world and drained vital resources from mi5 , mi6 and gchq , theresa may warned last night
the home secretary made a scathing attack on the harm caused by the fugitive â who stole 1.7 million top - secret documents from america âs national security agency and gchq
the secret techniques revealed by the subsequent leaks to the guardian newspaper have made it easier for terrorists , jihadis and organised criminals to avoid detection
leaks by the america traitor edward snowden ( pictured ) have â damaged â intelligence agencies across the world theresa may has warned last night , it emerged vital safe houses had also been lost
security officials have had to abandon buildings used to house top - secret sources for fear they have been compromised â at huge cost to the britain taxpayer
in evidence to mps , home secretary mrs may said : â i assess and so does the director general of mi5 that the edward snowden leaks did cause damage
â it has had an impact on the ability of our agencies to do the work they need to do
it would be fair to say it has had an impact not just on agencies in the britain
â if work has been done to try to mitigate the impact , that uses resources â
tory mp michael ellis , a member of the home affairs select committee , said : â it is clear to me the damage edward snowden has done is monumental
â not only has he jeopardised national security by his leaks , but he has also put people at risk and it is clear that he has also caused considerable financial loss
â it came amid new revelations about the extent to which britain extremists are attempting to travel to syria to join islamic state
mrs may said that - in the few weeks since the law was changed â five suspected jihadis had been subjected to a new power allowing for the seizure of their passports
police are now assessing whether the extremists can be charged with any criminal offences
security officials say is has seized on the edward snowden leaks and has passed on information to its operatives â making it harder to track them down
the home secretary ( pictured ) made a scathing attack on the harm caused by the fugitive â who stole 1.7 million top - secret documents from america âs national security agency and gchq al qaeda is also known to have pounced on the leaks
the terror group âs senior operatives have changed the way they communicate to avoid detection
they have also produced a video tape handed to extremists , passing on tips
the chilling seven - and - a - half minute video â which includes news footage of edward snowden âs massive security breach â provides detailed graphics on how extremists can avoid being trapped by â fbi secret spying technology â when communicating
it also claims to identify technology companies who are co-operating with the britain and other countries so they can be avoided
there is a list of software packages which can be used to try to thwart gchq and the intelligence agencies
at the same time , gchq has lost track of some of britain âs most dangerous criminals because of the way the fugitive exposed its operations
intelligence officials had to stop monitoring drug gangs , paedophiles , human traffickers and money launderers
up to a quarter of crime gangs are believed to be going undetected , sources have said
in other cases , gchq has toned down or abandoned surveillance amid fears that the tactics are too easy to spot and could force criminals to â go dark â and fall off the radar completely
among the gangs left able to operate unhindered was a drug - smuggling ring which had continued to bring class a narcotics into britain
ex-mi5 boss jonathan evans said the edward snowden revelations have left britain less able to protect itself at a time when the terrorist threat from islamist fanatics is surging
former security minister lord west said : â since the revelations of the traitor edward snowden , terrorist groups â in particular isil ( islamic state ) â have changed their methods of communications and shifted to other ways of talking to each other
â consequently there are people dying who actually would now be alive
â gchq has also warned that some companies had begun advertising internet products that were supposedly â snowden compliant â
edward snowden , who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in hawaii , tricked colleagues into giving him passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in america history
the defence contractor claims he had to act because the america and other western government âs policies were a â threat to democracy â
he fled to hong kong , then russia , where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location but last week , parliament âs intelligence and security committee cleared gchq of carrying out mass surveillance of the public using vast trawls of internet traffic
devastatingly , it said the central claims made by the guardian newspaper - that gchq had â blanket coverage â of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages - were wrong
in reality , it said , gchq can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a â tiny fraction â of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process
the committee concluded that the only items seen by analysts were those of the â highest intelligence value â , and these amounted to several thousand a day .
