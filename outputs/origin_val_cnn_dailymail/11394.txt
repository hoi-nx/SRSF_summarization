' our investigation has been lengthy because we have had to spend time regaining the confidence of women who had been badly let down by someone they should have been able to trust , precisely at a time when they needed him the most
' darren heath was manipulative and calculating while he was offending and that is one of the reasons he was able to carry on doing this over a number of years
