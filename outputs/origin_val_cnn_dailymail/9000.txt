they say a picture is worth a thousand words , but this one will be worth a thousand years
jonathon keats , a conceptual artist and journalist , plans to capture the world 's longest photo exposure , petapixel reports
a camera filled with oil paint instead of photographic film will capture the 1,000 - year - long exposure of tempe , arizona
jonathon keats calls this and similar creations ' deep time cameras
' exposure : jonathon keats ( photographed ) , a conceptual artist and journalist , plans to capture the world 's longest photo exposure , a 1,000 - year - long exposure of tempe , arizona the camera , with a 24 - karat gold plate on its front , will be installed three feet above ground at the arizona state university art museum 's sculpture garden trellis after it is unveiled friday at the museum
the camera will be pointed at the city 's skyline , capturing how civilization changes over the next 1,000 years
over time , the color in the paint will fade where the light enters the camera the brightest , slowly -- very slowly -- creating an image of the tempe skyline in red and white
the experiment will be finished in spring 3015 and the museum will hold a month - long exhibit when the project is complete -- if everything goes according to plan in the next 1,000 years , of course , slate reports
' the first people to see this picture will be children who have n't yet been conceived , ' jonathon keats told petapixel
' they 're impacted by every choice we make , but they 're powerless
if they ca n't influence our decisions , at least they can bear witness
' camera : the camera , with a 24 - karat gold plate on its front , will be installed three feet above ground at the arizona state university art museum 's sculpture garden trellis after it is unveiled friday at the museum this experiment will be one jonathon keats wo n't live to see , neither will his children , nor his children 's children , nor his children 's children 's child - okay , you get the point
but jonathon keats told petapixel that he does n't mind being not being able to attend the exposure 's unveiling in 3015
' i 'll be dead , ' jonathon keats said
' but i do n't regret it at all
for me , it 's much more interesting to be here today , seeing the behavior of people who know they 're being watched by the unborn , and also to be watched myself , living vicariously as a future memory of the next millennium
' jonathon keats told slate that the resulting photos wo n't be confusing , but will require a bit of interpretation to deconstruct what is recorded in the photo
skyline : the camera will be pointed at the city 's skyline ( photographed ) , capturing how civilization changes over the next 1,000 years he told petapixel that the photograph will not only show tempe 's skyline , but will illustrate how it develops over time
' for instance , old houses torn down after a couple centuries will show up only faintly , as if they were ghosts haunting the skyscrapers that replace them , ' jonathon keats said
jonathon keats told slate that he ca n't guarantee that the picture will be perfect or even perceptible
in fact , he said , it may take multiple attempts to get the exposure just right -- that could take thousands of years
but he said he does not see that as a fault
' a total failure photographically could still be a success conceptually , ' he said
jonathon keats said he chose tempe because it is representative of urban expansion throughout the united states
he said he plans to install a second camera in massachusetts .
