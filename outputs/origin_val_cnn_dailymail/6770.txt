manchester united and belgium midfielder fellaini has picked his ultimate five - a - side team fellaini , pictured during a photshoot for new balance football , has been in excellent form in recent weeks former everton star fellaini includes one of his manchester united team - mates in his dream five - a - side team he impressed in manchester united 's 2 - 1 win over liverpool at anfield on sunday and has now linked up with his international team - mates ahead of their forthcoming euro 2016 qualifiers against cyprus and israel
fellaini , however , was unable to accommodate the likes of belgian pals eden hazard , vincent kompany or courtois in his ultimate fives team
he failed to find room for himself and the likes of wayne rooney , angel di maria and robin van persie too
yet he did manage to select one manchester united colleague in his fearsome starting line - up
sylvain distin is fellaini 's best friend and he says the everton defender is a great player fellaini 's manchester united team - mate david de gea has been in superb form this season and gets a place in goal real madrid midfielder zinedine zidane nets a superb volley against bayer leverkusen in 2002 ' the keeper ? i play with good keepers , it is hard to pick ! ' said fellaini , speaking exclusively to sportsmail as part of the launch for the first new balance football advert
' but the keeper i choose ... it has to be ( david de gea ) david de gea
i need a defender too , so i will choose sylvain distin
' he is my best mate and a great player as well
and then it has to be ( zinedine zidane ) zinedine zidane , ( lionel messi ) lionel messi , ( cristiano ronaldo ) cristiano ronaldo
' it is no surprise to see lionel messi ( above ) and cristiano ronaldo ( below ) in fellaini 's five - a - side dream team indeed a formidable five - a - side team and one the towering belgian can not fit himself into
although eden hazard fails to make the cut , fellaini believes the chelsea star has been the best player in the premier league this season
jose mourinho 's side have a six - point lead at the top of the table , with a game in hand and fellaini expects his compatriots courtois and eden hazard will be toasting glory in may
' at the moment , eden hazard has been the best player in the premier league , ' said fellaini
