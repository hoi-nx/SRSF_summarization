question : the past few years have been awful : my husband left me for his pa
i felt dowdy and middle - aged , so embarked on a programme of exercise and dieting
even so , i was amazed when a trainer at my gym , who âs 27 ( i âm 49 ) , asked me on a date
i want to say â yes â , but i fear it âs undignified and that my body will repel him
what should i do ? rowan advises a woman who has been asked out on a date by her younger gym trainer ( picture posed by models ) answer : i have a friend who swears the best way for any middle - aged woman to make a decision is to ask themselves : â what would madonna do ? â the queen of pop would never let a trifling thing such as dignity stand between her and a hot young man
nor did the director of 50 shades of grey , sam taylor-johnson , put decorum before personal happiness when she wed a much younger actor
would it have been more seemly to deny herself an unbelievably handsome husband just to ensure the more censorious members of our society were nât scandalised ? of course , this kind of chutzpah is far easier to talk about than achieve
it comes more naturally to celebrities than mere mortals
but that does nât mean you ca nât borrow a little bit of that erotic entitlement
this man has gone out of his way to pursue you
it âs also a bit daft , under the circumstances , to be fretful about your body
if he works in your gym , then surely he âs got a good idea of your physique
the simple fact is that he fancies you rotten
in short , why do nât you do this man a favour and take his request seriously ? if he âs interesting and sexy , you should simply assess him for these qualities
treat him like any other man who might have the good sense to ask you out
please say â yes ! â â perhaps with the addendum : â because i âm worth it ! â
