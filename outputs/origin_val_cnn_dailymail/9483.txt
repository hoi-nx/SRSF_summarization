the britain crew of the new james bond film triggered an international air safety alert by going on a drunken rampage aboard the official 007 jet
last night , the producers of the forthcoming spectre film confirmed that they were investigating the ' intimidatory and frightening ' behaviour on board the privately chartered plane flying from stansted airport in essex to mexico city 11 days ago
last night , a worker at toluca airport in mexico city said the mayhem had left the interior of the plane looking like a ' pack of wild animals ' had gone through it
the source added that vomit had been left inside the toilet and on the floor outside
the producers of the forthcoming spectre film , starring monica bellucci and craig , confirmed that they were investigating the ' intimidatory and frightening ' behaviour he also claimed the airline had to bring in a specialist firm to clean the plane at a cost of 20,000 pesos â about Â£ 1,000
the incident will prove embarrassing for eon , which only yesterday launched a glossy trailer for the new Â£ 190 million movie , which will again star craig as 007
about 150 of the film 's crew , including cameramen , technicians and stunt men , were on their way to mexico city to film some of the most spectacular action sequences , including one that takes place during mexico city 's macabre day of the dead festival
it is understood that neither craig nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet , which landed at toluca airport for the two - week shoot on march 18
hi fly , which has told eon that its staff breached the conditions of the charter , will deploy extra security at the airport to ensure that no passengers arrive drunk for the jet 's return journey to the britain on wednesday
the airline has agreed to fly the crew back to britain only on condition that no alcohol is served or consumed on board
the privately chartered plane ( pictured ) was flying from stansted airport in essex to mexico city 11 days ago members of the film crew removed a safety pin from one of the aircraft 's doors - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage eon , led by michael and his stepsister barbara , have now told staff that the flight will be ' dry '
however , in a twist worthy of the james bond films , it is unclear whether the us watchdog , the faa , is investigating the incident
on friday night , spokeswoman laura brown confirmed that the incident was ' under investigation ' but declined to comment further after being given a detailed account of the reckless behaviour on the plane
but the following day her colleagues denied any such probe was under way
the faa has some jurisdiction over international airspace around the us , which could have been passed through by the 007 film crew 's flight
a spokesman for eon last night confirmed it was conducting an internal investigation to find out exactly what had happened
but the mail on sunday understands that michael and barbara read the riot act to staff at a production meeting held shortly after the plane 's arrival in mexico city
they have also apologised to horrified air crew members
one source , who asked not to be named , said : ' michael and barbara have both made it very clear that this sort of behaviour is unacceptable and should never be allowed to happen again
it is understood that neither craig ( pictured ) nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet some of the film 's crew vomited and urinated in the aisles and verbally abused cabin crew - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage ' the behaviour of a handful of crew members got out of hand and made things very unpleasant for their fellow passengers
' eon has apologised to all the crew members who had to endure this intolerable behaviour
' airline expert chris yates said last night that ' it was entirely possible ' that the removal of the safety pin could have caused the door to open
he said : ' the pin is part and parcel of the locking mechanism on the aircraft door
essentially , if you remove it there is a possibility that you could potentially open the door and decompress the cabin
' however , while the risk was real , he added that in all likelihood the door would have been held shut by the speed of the plane moving through the air
hi fly , which is based in lisbon , leases its 12 airbuses to governments , companies and individuals
last night , a spokesman declined to comment on the incident
he said : ' this particular flight from the britain to mexico city was a private charter , not open to the public
we have an obligation towards the privacy rights of our clients and therefore we are unable to comment
' a spokesman for eon said : ' we are investigating the matter so can not comment further at this time
' spectre is the 24th movie in the james bond franchise and co-stars christoph waltz , ralph fiennes and monica bellucci
it is due to open in britain in november .
