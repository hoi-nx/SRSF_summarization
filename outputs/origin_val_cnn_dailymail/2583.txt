military chiefs should resign over defence cuts before uk troops become us âs â cannon fodder â , politicians and former top brass warned last night
tory mp colonel bob stewart , a member of the defence select committee , called for the joint chiefs of staff to sacrifice their careers over plans to slash defence spending despite growing threats from russia and islamic state
speaking at a meeting of the uknda ( uknda ) , he said the generals should make the people they command their priority and resign on principle , instead of focusing their efforts on â getting another star â
colonel bob stewart , a former uk commander in bosnia , said britain 's military forces were in a ' parlous state ' and could not take any further cuts later he said he was considering resigning himself , from either his seat or the select committee , adding : â i âm thinking about it to be honest â but that wo nât make any difference
â his comments came as it emerged more than 6,000 uk troops are preparing to deploy under the command of an us unit as part of a high readiness reaction force
fresh details emerged of future military operations after the head of the us army , general raymond odierno , said he was â very concerned â about uk defence cuts
he told the britain will be demoted to a more junior role in future campaigns if spending is inadequate
david cameron has resisted calls to make a public pledge not to cut military spending below 2 per cent - but had insisted he will not cut the size of the army any further former defence secretary liam fox has urged the government not to cut military spending below 2 per cent and yesterday , sir michael graydon , former head of the raf , said the idea of a uk brigade working under a 20,000 - strong us division was â humiliating â
air commodore andrew lambert added : â the trouble with this is you provide the man power but with none of the authority
why should we provide the man power â some people might call it cannon fodder â when what we would like to do is have a seat at the top table ? â during the meeting , former military top brass put pressure on the government to commit britain to meeting the nato target of spending at least 2 per cent of national income on defence beyond 2016 â a prospect which looks unlikely
in a blistering attack on uk military spending â which has diminished as russia âs defence capabilities increase â sir michael graydon added : â it is token already and if we start cutting it any more it becomes laughable
â colonel bob stewart , who commanded un forces in bosnia , said : â if we are really [ in ] a parlous state in defence , why are the joint chiefs of staff not tendering their resignations ? â they should actually put their responsibilities to the people who they command as their top priority , rather than getting another star
â a damning report published by the uknda said that if britain is forced into a conflict with russia , our force levels are â pitifully small â compared to those at the end of the cold war
an mod spokesman said : â we will meet the 2 per cent nato spending target this year and next and have also committed to spending Â£ 163billion on equipment and equipment support to keep britain safe
â general raymond odierno , the chief of staff of the us army , last week warned he was ' very concerned ' about the scale of the coalition 's military cuts
