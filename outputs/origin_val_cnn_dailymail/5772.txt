a black female police officer who previously acted as a bodyguard for the kate middleton is suing a police force because she claims she was sacked after accusing another officer of racism
ricky haruna claims she was sacked for gross misconduct after she claimed a police sergeant at the met had racially harassed her
ms haruna claims that after she made the allegation sergeant boyle convinced an elderly woman with dementia to make false claims of fraud against her
this led to haruna being hauled before a misconduct panel and dismissed , only to be reinstated after a successful internal appeal
ricky haruna joined the met in 2002 and one of her jobs was escorting kate middleton before she married the 39 - year - old is now suing the met for race discrimination and wrongful dismissal for the way it handled her case , with her previous claims of racism not forming part of her own misconduct hearing , the central london employment tribunal was told
she claims that although the dps ( dps ) was aware of the race allegations she had made , these were not put before the police misconduct board
ms haruna joined the met in 2002 and one of her duties was escorting kate middleton before she married prince william and became the kate middleton
during her career she saved two people 's lives and received two commendations
ms haruna claims she experienced racism from her police colleagues in 2010 , and also reported that sergeant boyle racially harassed her
following her allegation an elderly woman came forward and accused haruna of fraud
this led to what ms haruna refers to as her ' malicious arrest ' in april 2013
ms haruna appeared before a misconduct panel and - despite the cps saying the fraud allegation was untenable and they would not be bringing charges in september 2013 - she was disciplined and sacked last june
but in february she was reinstated with full pay after a successful internal appeal against her dismissal
davies , representing ms haruna , said in his skeleton argument : ' prior to her dismissal , the claimant had complained of racism on several occasions
she also claimed that she was being harassed and victimised ... the dps were aware of that allegation
' however , the dps failed to put this relevant evidence before the police misconduct board
' he added that ms haruna did not raise these claims herself because of ' bad advice ' from the police federation , the dps had a ' clear duty ' to do so
he said that in light of panel not having any knowledge of the evidence of discrimination , it made the ' wrongful decision ' to dismiss her
mr davies said : ' we do say ps boyle is racist and that this sorry saga began when he pressurised a very elderly lady with dementia to make a formal complaint of fraud against the claimant
' he added that ps boyle 's questioning of the woman , who also imagined that ms haruna had had an abortion and that lord russell had bought her a house , caused her to become ' very upset '
ms haruna was reinstated in february this year it is not argued that the misconduct panel was prejudicial , but that the wrong decision it made was rendered discriminatory by the racist motivation of the dps and / or ps boyle
mr davies also drew attention to the employment tribunal of black police officer pc in which the met admitted it had a written policy to ensure that no discrimination complaint was successful
ms howard won Â£ 37,000 in her race and sex discrimination claim
however louise chudleigh , representing the met , said once the the cps had decided to not take any action against ms haruna for the fraud allegations , the matter was dealt with as a disciplinary issue , leading to her dismissal
she said ms haruna could not have a wrongful dismissal case because she had been reinstated
she further argued that the pc could not bring race claims because the panel that dismissed her was protected from discrimination claims by judicial immunity proceedings
but mr davies said it would be ' absurd ' if the officer could not bring her discrimination claim because he said ' even the mps has accepted that the decision was wrong and given the importance of tackling discrimination in society and in particular the police
' employment judge harjit grewal reserved her judgment on whether ms haruna can bring a case of wrongful dismissal and race discrimination against the met
another preliminary hearing has been scheduled for april 30 .
