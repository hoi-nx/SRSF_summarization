a hound called coco has become caught up in a remarkable international custody battle after being â rescued â by a couple who are now facing a lawsuit from a woman claiming to be the rightful owner
coco was found wandering a beach in aruba , in the caribbean sea , last october by husband and wife lisa and dan oâconnell , who claimed she was in shocking condition
the oâconnells , from north attleboro in massachusetts , said that they thought she was a stray
she has set up a facebook page to support her claim ms oâconnell told wbz-tv : â she was dehydrated , she seemed hungry , she seemed sad
she absolutely looked like a dog that nobody was caring for
â husband dan added : â the dog had many ticks on it and its paws were raw , either from the hot sand or the hot asphalt
â they both claim that the dog was nât wearing a collar and that no other form of identification was visible
believing that they were being good samaritans , they called a vet to get the dog treated then contacted an aruba animal rescue centre to help process adoption of coco
however , when they returned from their vacation they received a message from an aruba resident called hajdinyak who told the oâconnells that coco was actually hers â and called whitey pinky
the oâconnells launched a crowd - funding page to help pay their legal bill and keep the dog stateside ms hajdinyak , in a facebook page to support her claim , said that whitey pinky â only lives two minutes from the beach â and is used to going there â with her best friends buddy and wolly , which live just next door ' that they ' all know their way home â
as well as posting photographs and videos of the dog on the page , she published emails that she âd written to the oâconnells , describing how she found her in 2011 at the front of her house and adopted her
she wrote : ' [ whitey pinky ] loves running , hiking , walking , swimming , bicycling , being on a boat , catamaran or jetski , driving in the car ; there is nothing she does n't want to be part of ! ' she claims that the dog was ' confiscated ' within two days by the o'connells , leaving little time for a proper search , but they argue that hajdinyak waited two weeks before she began looking for her
the oâconnells remain determined to keep coco , who they âve become very fond of
they believe that returning her â would put her life in jeopardy â
now both sides have brought in lawyers in a bid to secure custody of the animal and the case is set to be settled in court
the oâconnells launched a crowd - funding page to help pay their legal bill , which has reached several thousand dollars .
