khan says he would love to fight broner in his next bout
the bolton boxer had hoped to take on floyd mayweather but the pound - for - pound king will instead meet manny pacquaio in a $ 300million mega-fight on may 2
and now it seems khan has set his sights on facing the man dubbed by many as the new floyd mayweather
khan ( left ) says he 'd love to fight broner after the american said he 'd be ready this month broner , a former three weight world champion , won a unanimous points decision over john molina jr on saturday as he continued to rebuild his reputation after losing his undefeated record two years ago to maidana â who then twice fought and lost to floyd mayweather
so comfortable was the john molina jr fight for broner that on tuesday he said he would be ready to face khan ' at the end of this month '
writing on instagram , broner said : ' no disrespect to virgil hunter he is a great coach and i got endless love for him but me and khan can fight at the end of this month i have n't taken any punishment i 'm back in the gym and ready to make a fool out of anybody # aboutbillions # abonnbc ' khan appeared to laugh off broner 's claims on twitter before going on to tweet : ' would love to fight @ adrienbroner next ! # khanvsbroner lets make it happen
' broner won a unanimous points decision on saturday but says he copped little punishment and is in the gym on monday , broner even suggested he would be prepared to come to england to fight khan
' i ca n't wait
i 'd even fight him at wembley , ' broner told boxingnews24
last year floyd mayweather hit back at khan 's claims he was running scared and told him to prove his credentials by beating broner on the undercard of his first fight with maidana
floyd mayweather hit back at khan 's claims he was running scared but chose to fight manny pacquaio floyd mayweather tweeted : ' i do n't have an easy fight on may 3 , 2014 , so i ca n't overlook @ chinomaidana but @ amirkingkhan , if you and @ adrienbroner end up fighting each other on my show and you win ( which you wo n't ) ... i 'll fight you
' the fight never materialised then with khan instead going on to beat luis collazo and then devon alexander
but with no opponent named for his next fight , the proposition of fighting broner may now appeal to khan .
