murray is not sure about bjorkman 's dancing but is confident the sweden will prove a valuable addition to his coaching team
the 42 - year - old is to join murray for a trial week at some point in the next month with a view to working with the scot on a permanent basis alongside his main coach amelie mauresmo
the exact timing of that week is up in the air because bjorkman is currently competing on let 's dance , the sweden version of strictly come dancing

' with amelie mauresmo only committed to working with murray for 25 weeks a year , the world number four has made finding an additional coach a priority
the role had been filled under ivan lendl and then mauresmo by his long - time friend dani vallverdu until the pair went their separate ways at the end of last season
the aim will be for bjorkman to travel with murray during the weeks when amelie mauresmo is unavailable , while they will also work together at certain times of the year
murray said : ' we 've agreed for him to work with us for a week just to try and see how it goes
normally when i 've started working with coaches i 've done that
' i know him very well from when he played
he was one of the older guys when i came on the tour and he was very good to me
he 's a very nice person , good sense of humour
and he was an exceptional tennis player who made the most of his ability
former world no 4 bjorkman will join up with team murray for a trial week as assistant coach ' a lot of sweden turn out to be good coaches
they 've got a good mindset , they 're very calm individuals and extremely hard workers
hopefully when we try it out together it works well
' bjorkman reached number four in the singles rankings and number one in doubles , winning nine grand slam titles
since retiring in 2008 he has worked in the media , as a coach with sweden 's davis cup team and behind the scenes at the atp tournaments in bastad and stockholm
he becomes the latest sweden to take up a high - profile coaching role in men 's tennis after magnus norman , who guided stan wawrinka to the australian open title last year , and roger federer 's part - time mentor stefan edberg
bjorkman agreed with murray 's assessment of sweden strengths but also said he hoped to bring energy and fun to training sessions

' when murray came along , he was going to be the new superstar , i met him straight away and we connected well
' he 's a great guy , great sense of humour
both of us like to have a little bit of a trash talk , we are interested in other sports
the only negative was he beat me twice
but i 'm really looking forward to it

' i really like the way she believes murray should play and how they 've been working
