a new united states department of justice report on ferguson 's police and courts could not be more clear : change is needed
the 102 - page report details widespread and systemic discrimination against blacks at the hands of officials -- painting probably the clearest picture yet of what the rule of law looks and feels like in the missouri city
the report is scathing in its critique , and clear about what needs to happen next , but it does n't address the question : who , if anyone , is responsible for what took place ? are individual officers to blame ? is the police chief ? what about city officials who repeatedly pushed police to increase revenue through ticketing , resulting in disproportionate targeting of african - americans ? writing for cnn , criminal defense attorney mark o'mara argues in favor of gutting the entire police department , and starting from scratch
so far , one person has been fired ; two more are on administrative leave
are more heads likely to roll ? " when the attorney general said that the united states department of justice has made certain recommendations , those are n't necessarily just recommendations
the ferguson police department and municipal courts will have to reform
this is a must - do situation
we 're talking about wholesale reform , " said cnn legal analyst sunny hostin
" and i would be very surprised that any of the leadership remains
" mayor knowles said the two employees on leave are awaiting the results of an internal investigation
" united states department of justice officials informed the city of ferguson that a review of city emails uncovered explicit racial bias by three individuals who are employed by the city of ferguson police department
let me be clear : this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the ferguson police department or in any department in the city of ferguson , " he told reporters wednesday
" the three individuals were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation
one has since been terminated
" a source said the two employees " will not survive the investigation
" cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin criticized the mayor 's response , seemingly suggesting that more needed to be done in the wake of the united states department of justice report
" you read this report , and , one officer loses his job ? you know , you translate the bureaucratic gobbledygook of the mayor , that 's all that happened there , " he said
surprisingly to some , controversial police chief tom jackson remains at the helm
although the report is limited to correcting action going forward , people affected by past abuses do have the option of filing civil lawsuits against specific individuals
such cases are not easy to bring , according to peter joy , a law professor at washington university in st. louis
" in a court of law , the findings of this report would n't even be admissible , " he said
" basically , you 'd have to prove each allegation
" joy gave an example of person who paid a $ 100 fine that was unjustly levied
finding lawyers who would take an individual case like that would be tough , he said , because there is no guarantee they could recover on behalf of their client , and the amount of damages could very widely
practically , that person may be out of luck
but if the united states department of justice gets its way , illegal or improper behavior on the part of police and courts in ferguson could soon be a thing of the past
" it is time for ferguson 's leaders to take immediate , wholesale and structural corrective action , " said attorney general eric holder
" the united states department of justice reserves all of its rights and abilities to force compliance and to implement basic change
nothing is off the table
" cnn 's sara sidner contributed to this report .
