the knowledge that your son has committed murder is more than any mother should have to bear
for one mother though , the news was even worse - the victim was her own mother
in 2008 , franky regan lamb faced the news that her 21 - year - old son rakeim had fatally stabbed her mother , pat regan , in her own home , in leeds
rakeim , who had become heavily involved in gang and drugs culture , killed his grandmother whilst under psychosis
his mental state seriously deteriorated after his pat 's son - had died five years earlier and he became heavily involved in the drugs scene
rakeim had been close to his uncle and looked up to him - something that had always worried his family who felt that danny , a notorious drug dealer , might be a bad influence on him
danny , who mixed in such a dangerous crowd that he often wore a stab vest and carried a firearm , was shot to death in 2002 , following what was thought to be an altercation about drugs
following her son 's death pat went on to be a staunch anti-gun activist and , according to franky , had a close relationship with rakeim
murdered pat regan ( right ) was an anti-gun campaigner , pictured here with fellow campaigner michelle forbes outside downing street in 2008 slain uncle : pat 's son danny was murdered in 2002 in what was thought to have been an altercation over drugs she said : ' if he was in trouble , he 'd go to my mum probably more than me because my mum had probably dealt with it better
he was her grandson - they were just really close
' despite this closeness the family began to seriously worry about rakeim as he slipped deeper into a world of gang violence
his uncle shane admitted : ' we had worries about him , because it seemed that he was impressed with , kind of gang culture or the big man in the area and all that kind of stuff
' you know , there was a lot of that around us at the time and we were just , kind of like , saying , " you do n't need to be focused on that kind of stuff
you need to focus more on your education , your music " - you know , things that are quite playful , things that are positive
' do n't look at the negative and do n't be , you know , tempted to follow that kind of lifestyle
' sadly , there was nothing the family could do to help him and as rakeim started to dabble more and more in drugs , his paranoia started to increase
franky said : ' he kind of lost his way a little bit and i , kind of , guess he dabbled in drugs in his teenage years , in ecstasy , cocaine , and i used to say to rakeim , " you have n't got the mind - set to get through stuff like that , you know , take ecstasy and things like that
it 's not good for you and it 'll bring you down
" ' he would go , " i know mum , i do n't do it any more
" ' rakeim 's uncle shane regan showed off a selection of pictures of his mother
he says he has not been to see his nephew since he fatally stabbed his mother shane said : ' he was having thoughts of people turning into reptiles , aliens , he was having these kinds of thoughts
' people 's eye colours were changing , you know , to these luminous colours
he threatened my brother to say that he was going to stab him in his neck
' it was like he was almost possessed with something that he wanted to be
he wanted to be a hard man , he wanted to be tough , he wanted to be fearless
' he wanted to be this character that was n't him and my mum was like , " well , i let him go out tonight , god knows what 's going to happen to him
" ' finally - following an incident in which rakeim was found stumbling around a park near his home in a state of psychosis - he was taken to hospital
it was to prove too little , too late
the day after his release pat , who had taken rakeim in , went missing
she was meant to attend an anti-gun event being hosted by shane but the alarm was raised when she failed to show up
shane was horrified when he was called to his mother 's house after she failed to show up to an anti-gun meeting that he was holding , only to find out that she had been killed
shane was eventually called to come down to his mother 's house , where he learned the devastating news that pat had been stabbed to death
franky said : ' i was hysterical
i would give anything , you know , to have my mum back
you know , to hear that call , i 've had that call before about my brother , about my younger brother
' worse news was to come when the family made the horrifying discovery that it was rakeim behind the killing
however , franky has come to understand that it was his mental health problems which made him act the way he did
' the realisation that your son 's done what he 's done , it 's just gut - wrenching
i never felt , " you horrible , horrible person
" i never felt that
' part of me sometimes thinks , " would it be easier to dislike , not love rakeim if he had n't been a drug addict and he 'd have killed her because he wanted money for drugs or something , or he was just a nasty person ? ' because he was n't , and it was the mental health , and he loved his grandma , and he was n't a bad person , it just makes it that much harder knowing that - what a nice lad he was
' having pleaded guilty to manslaughter rakeim is now detained indefinitely under the mental health act and franky goes to visit him on a regular basis
she said the first encounter was difficult : ' first seeing him , where he was , it was heartbreaking
i did nât know if he âd remember , and he remembered what he âd done but he was still in a psychotic state
' he was still delusional about what he âd done and how he âd done it , and to go and sit and listen to your son , your baby , saying this about what he âs done to his grandma and your mum is the worst
' however , shane has mixed feelings about whether he will see him again : ' personally i âve not seen rakeim since the day that he got sentenced
' i just found it difficult to find a way to look in his eyes and speak to him about it
i dream about looking him in the eye , i have dreams of seeing him , i have this mixed emotion when i see him
' i want to run up to him and give him a big hug and say , â do you know what , i love you , â and then i start to doubt that he did do it by accident
