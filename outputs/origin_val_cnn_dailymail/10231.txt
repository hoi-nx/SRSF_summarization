mr clegg , who was joined on stage by his wife miriam , said there was nowhere in the world like the britain ' nowhere as gutsy , nowhere as hopeful , nowhere as welcoming '
' we are a small island , but we are a big , big country , ' he added
but he warned this was threatened by labour and the conservatives abandoning the centre ground
after years of austerity , he insisted there was now ' light at the end of the tunnel '
' while the job of fixing our economy is not over yet , the end is in sight
' he said austerity could end in three years ' time , but claimed that the tories wanted to continue cutting public spending far beyond what was necessary

he launched the direct attack on his coalition partners by claiming they posed a threat to education by refusing to protect pre-school and college funding
it 's in their dna , ' he said
the lib dem and tories have clashed over mr osborne 's plan to rule out any future tax rises and tackle the deficit through cuts alone , including taking another Â£ 12billion out of the welfare budget
mr clegg claimed this would mean eight million families on the lowest wages would be Â£ 1,500 worse off
he said the tories had refused to target the wealthy , describing them as ' their friends in big business and big houses '
' they 're not even pretending they want us to be " all in this together " any more
' the conservative plan for the next government is an ideological lurch to the right
' they have gone from being the self - proclaimed heirs to blair to farage in white tie
' and yet they have the gall to say they are staying on the road to recovery
' they are not staying on the road , they are veering off it
' ms gonzalez durantez hugged her husband before joining him on stage after the keynote speech clegg , pictured with ms gonzalez durantez after the speech , also turned his fire on the labour , claiming the most interesting thing they have done is ' buy a pink van ' a lib dem delegate falls asleep clutching a pile of leaflets during the opening of the session this morning he said mr cameron and mr osborne can not have it both ways , claiming the government has done the right thing and then calling for drastic changes
' either we are doing the right thing or we are n't
if we are then why wo n't you stick with it ? ' i 'll tell you why : because left to their own devices the conservatives will cut public services , take away support from the poor and look after their own kind in a way they have n't been able to do in this government because we were there to stop them
' he also turned his fire on the labour , claiming the most interesting they have done is ' buy a pink van '
he said ed miliband 's pledge card to voters , launched yesterday , contained Â£ 70billion of extra borrowing
' it 's not a pledge card , it 's a credit card and you , me and every other britain taxpayer will be paying the bill for years to come
' he warned the liberal values of modern britain would be under threat if either the tories or labour attempted to govern with the support of a ' rag tag mob ' of mps from ukip or the snp
despite dire polls suggesting lib dem could lose more than half of their seats , mr clegg insisted his party was ' here to stay '
the lib dem leader walks with his wife ahead of his keynote speech on the final day of the party 's spring conference in liverpool he ruled out being part of a formal coalition deal involving either the snp or ukip , although aides would not reject the idea of those parties being involved in a looser confidence and supply arrangement
the deputy prime minister said : ' just like we would not put ukip in charge of europe , we are not going to put the snp in charge of britain - a country they want to rip apart
it 's just not going to happen
' he insisted : ' only the lib dem will keep britain on track and govern for the whole country
' we have shown that we are prepared to put the national interest first , even if it means taking a hit to our short - term popularity
' and we will continue to put the national interest first
if others wo n't stand up to the growing mood of divisive populism , we will
' after the speech clegg , who ruled out entering a coalition with snp or ukip after the election , raised his arms in the air he said the story of the next five years must be one of hope
' if you are thinking of voting conservative but are worried that they wo n't be fair â do n't do it
' if you are thinking of voting labour but are worried they will ruin the economy â do n't do it
' if you think a vote for ukip , or the greens , or the snp is harmless â it is n't
' if you want a stable government that wo n't lurch to the extremes of left or right , you have to vote for it
' if you want a stronger economy and a fairer society , you have to vote for it
' if you want a government that will create opportunities for everyone , vote lib dem
' this is a fight for our future , for the decent values of our country â we can and we must win
