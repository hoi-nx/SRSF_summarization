longreach in central west queensland is famous for qantas , also known as the flying kangeroo , but another airborne animal is nowhere near as popular
grasshoppers in ' plague proportions ' have destroyed hectacres of land in longreach in recent days after a severe drought there
â you walk out on your garden and they just swarm up from the lawn â one local told 7news
they are finally moving on but they have laid eggs and left devastation behind
the locusts have destroyed any greenery they can find , chewing up the leaves and lawns , and stripping trees bare
' it 's at plague proportions here , ' another local said
although some insects thrive in moist conditions , heat and drought can be the ultimate survival conditions for the likes of grasshoppers
they are the most most common insects that cause problems during periods of heat and drought
the australian plague locust commission told abc news it has been monitoring the situation , but there was no plague
all that 's left on the tree is the fruits as the grasshoppers ate all the foliage â what we have got is some areas where there is a localised , high - density infestation , ' spokesman chris adriaansen said
â but the extent of the infestation certainly does not qualify the current population levels to plague proportions
â we have been watching that population very closely , obviously
we have our own field staff based at longreach and they are very aware of what is in that area
' heat and drought can be the ultimate survival conditions for the likes of grasshoppers even if the grasshoppers are about to move on they still have left a calling card that could prove disastrous in the future
â what we will see now is that those adults that are still in condition to do so will lay some eggs , " he said
â we would expect that within the next two to four weeks we would start to see the third generation of nymphs coming out of the ground
â that generation and the extent and the density of that generation will determine what if any control is implemented
' another worry are kangeroos looking for food with groups of 25 - 30 coming in groups in and around the town
until the grasshopper infestation it was the flying kangeroo that longreach was famous for after one of the founding centres for qantas , the australian domestic and international airline
one of the airline 's original hangars remains in use at the longreach airport and is listed on the australian national heritage list
the town is now the home of the qantas founders outback museum
groups of kangeroos have been seen in and around the town searching for food
