the captain of the germanwings plane which crashed into the alps tried to break down the cockpit door with an crowbar after his co-pilot locked him out , it emerged on friday
co-pilot lubitz is believed to have deliberately flown the airbus a320 into the side of a mountain after locking the captain out of the cockpit , killing himself and all 149 others on board
the flight recorder showed that patrick sonderheimer repeatedly knocked on the door of the cockpit as the plane began to descend
but he resorted to using a crowbar to try and get through the armoured panel as the plane plunged fatally towards the alps
but it emerged last night that the only axe on the plane would have been in the cockpit , meaning it was out of reach of the captain
the latest revelation came after the final moments of the flight , were described in horrific detail by marseille prosecutor robin
data extracted from the black box recorder shows that co-pilot - 28 - year - old german lubitz - locked the captain out of the cockpit and intentionally destroyed airbus a320 on tuesday
mr robin said : ' the intention was to destroy the plane
the plane hit the mountain at 700kmh ( 430mph )
' i do n't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds '
mr robin said that earlier in the flight lubitz 's responses , initially courteous , became ' curt ' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane
the captain - named by local media as german father - of - two patrick sonderheimer - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter
mr robin said : ' we hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something
' so the co-pilot is on his own , and it is while he 's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane
' at this altitude , this can only be done voluntarily
we hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in , speaking through the intercom system , but there 's no answer from the cockpit
' the pilot is heard asking the co-pilot to take over and it is assumed the captain left the cockpit ( pictured ) and ' went to the toilet or something ' obliterated : search and rescue teams sift through the wreckage of the germanwings plane on wednesday debris from the jet , operated by lufthansa 's germanwings budget airline , was found near barcelonnette mr robin said lubitz ' voluntarily ' refused to open the door and his breathing was normal throughout the final minutes of the flight
8.55am - the airbus a320 takes off from barcelona , spain , and is expected to land in dusseldorf , german , approximately 90 minutes later
it is carrying 150 people : 144 passengers and six crew members
a transcript recovered from the black box of the plane 's final 30 minutes reveals that for the first 20 minutes the two pilots talk in a ' normal fashion ' , according to mr robin
preparation for the plane 's arrival can then be heard in the cockpit
it is at this point the pilot asks mr lubitz to take over , a chair is pushed back and the door closes
co-pilot mr lubitz uses the flight monitoring system to start the plane 's descent , an action which can ' only be done voluntarily '
through the on - board intercom system , the pilot is heard trying to regain entry to the cockpit , but there is no answer from mr lubitz
the pilot then knocks on the door , again getting no reply
9.30am - air traffic controllers get no response from the plane after they attempt to make contact
it is at this time that the plane reaches a height of 38,000ft , according to flightradar24
9.30am - 9.40am - the plane drops from 32,000ft to 6,175ft , where flightradar24 logs its final position on radar
all that can be heard from the cockpit from this moment until the plane crashes is the co-pilot breathing , apparently normally
during this descent , the pilot can be heard trying to break the cabin door down and alarms go off - indicating the plane 's close proximity to the ground
a first crash is audible , but the final impact happens several moments later
during this time , no distress signals are sent out
passengers are only heard screaming during the final few moments of the recording , implying they were initially unaware anything was wrong until just before the plane crashed
he said : ' his breath was not of somebody who was struggling
he never said a single word
it was total silence in the cockpit for the ten past minutes
' air traffic control at marseille asked for a distress signal , but there was still no response , said mr robin
he added : ' so the plane becomes a priority for a forced landing
' control asks other planes to contact this airbus a320 and no answer is forthcoming
' there are alarm systems which indicate to all those on board the proximity of the ground
then we hear noises of someone trying to break into the door
' the door is reinforced according to international standards
' mr robin went on : ' just before final impact we hear the sound of a first impact
it 's believed that the plane may have hit something before the final impact
' there is no distress signal or mayday signal
no answer was received despite numerous calls from the tower
' lubitz had just 600 hours of flying experience after joining germanwings in 2013 straight from training
he was , however , highly regarded , having won an award from the federal aviation administration in 2013 for his outstanding flying skills
the investigation is now a full - blown criminal enquiry
the plane was carrying six crew and 144 passengers , including 16 german teenagers returning home from a school trip , who had reportedly won the trip in a lottery of their classmates
it was the deadliest air crash on the france mainland since 1974 when a turkish airlines plane crashed , killing 346 people
