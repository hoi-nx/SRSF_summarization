nike âs â just do it â slogan is undoubtedly a killer line â and now it âs been revealed that the inspiration for it came from an actual killer
the phrase , first used in a nike advert in 1988 , was pitched to the firm by advertising executive dan wieden , who admitted that it was borrowed from something a utah murderer uttered as he faced a firing squad
the condemned man in question was gilmore , who was sentenced to death in 1977 for robbing and murdering two men in utah the previous year
the phrase inspired one of the most successful advertising slogans of all time he chose to be executed by firing squad and it was reported that he said â let âs do it â in the moments before he died
mr dan wieden , speaking at an advertising conference in cape town in february , said that he recalled this line in 1988 just before he had a crunch marketing campaign meeting with nike bosses , and decided to suggest a slightly altered version as a slogan
this week mr dan wieden , co-founder of advertising agency wieden + kennedy , repeated the story to dezeen magazine
he described how he was worried that an upcoming series of five tv adverts lacked cohesion , because they all had a different feel to them
he felt they needed a tagline to tie them all together
his company had been parachuted in by nike to help them counter-attack rivals reebok , who had just announced bigger profits
dan wieden ( pictured ) revealed that the slogan ' just do it ' was borrowed from the last words of utah murderer gilmore mr dan wieden said : â we â¦ came up with five different 30 second spots
the night before [ a meeting with nike ] i got concerned because â¦ there was n't an overlying sensibility to them all
some were funny , some were solemn
so i thought â¦ we need a tagline to pull this stuff together
â i wrote about four or five ideas
i narrowed it down to the last one , which was " just do it "
the reason i did that one was funny because i was recalling a man in portland
â he murdered a man and a woman , and was put before a firing squad
and they asked him if he had any final thoughts and he said : " let 's do it
" and for some reason i went : " now damn
how do you ask for an ultimate challenge that you are probably going to lose , but you call it in ? " so i thought , well , i did n't like " let âs do it " so i just changed it to " just do it "
â at first , he recalled , nike hated the idea , but he won them round and the slogan appeared at the end of an advert featuring 80 - year - old runner walt stack
it is now one of the most famous slogans in the world , described by campaign magazine as â arguably the best tagline of the 20th century â .
