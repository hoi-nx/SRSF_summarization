the bank risks being dragged into a criminal investigation into how it propped up ailing lenders during the financial crisis , it emerged last night
the central bank supplied high street lenders with emergency funds in 2007 and 2008 through so - called money - market auctions to stop the banking system freezing up as the credit crunch intensified
but it last year instructed a leading barrister to look into whether any of its staff knew of , or even participated , in attempts to rig the auctions
the bank ( pictured ) risks being dragged into a criminal investigation into how it propped up ailing lenders during the financial crisis the bank has since passed on the results of the inquiry by lord grabiner to the serious fraud office which is now examining the findings
the serious fraud office said it was â investigating material referred to it by the bank concerning liquidity auctions during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 â
it is thought that the probe could lead to a full - blown criminal inquiry â although it is unclear whether such an investigation would focus on bank officials or traders outside the central bank
an official criminal investigation would be a blow to the reputation of the bank following a series of scandals that have rocked the financial sector
senior tory mp andrew tyrie , who chairs the treasury committee in the commons , said the bank was right to refer inquiry to serious fraud office in a statement last night , the bank said : â following the confirmation by the serious fraud office that it is investigating material referred to it by the bank , the bank can now confirm that it commissioned lord lord grabiner to conduct an independent inquiry into liquidity auctions during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008
â following the conclusion of that initial inquiry , the bank referred the matter to the serious fraud office on 20 november 2014
â given the serious fraud office investigation is ongoing , it is not appropriate for the bank to provide any additional comment on the matter at this time
â senior tory mp andrew tyrie , who chairs the treasury committee in the commons , said the central bank was right to refer the findings to the serious fraud office
he added : â we must now await the outcome of the serious fraud office âs work
the sooner their findings are published the better
â the bank launched the money - market auctions during the financial crisis in an attempt to ensure that high street banks could continue to lend to households , businesses and each other
the investigation into the auctions comes as the central bank faces increased scrutiny over its governance and oversight of the financial system
a separate inquiry by lord grabiner into the rigging of the foreign exchange markets cleared bank officials of any wrongdoing
the bank revealed on tuesday it has uncovered 50 instances of market manipulation and that 42 of them have been handed to the financial conduct authority .
