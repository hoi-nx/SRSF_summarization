' u sound hot i wish i nva done that to u to late ' ( sic )
that 's the text message a remorseful new zealand criminal sent to a university of otago student after he broke into her car
and it was just the beginning of remarkable banter which culminated in the apologetic thief returning a swag of stolen goods - including handbags and identity cards - to mcdonald , 20 , and her four friends
dunedin residents ms mcdonald , kerr , kate randhawa , briar middleton and olivia van diepen visited christchurch for a mutual friend 's 21st birthday on march 14
pictured ( l to r ) : kerr , mcdonald , olivia van diepen , briar middleton , kate randhawa , all age 20 , were attending a mutual friend 's 21st birthday in christchurch when ms mcdonald 's car was robbed the beginning : mcdonald decided to open up her conversation by taking a different tack - ' hope the tampons and condoms come in handy '
as the conversation continued , the crook began to reconsider
' u sound hot i wish i neva dne tht to u nw bt to late ' ' next tym take ya bags with ya ' : the criminal warned the girls not to leave their handbags unattended in a vehicle on future occasions the next day the ' very hungover ' students went sightseeing in town , leaving their handbags in plain sight inside ms mcdonald 's car
when they returned they discovered the car 's locks had been picked and their possessions taken
they were preparing to make a police report when they realised ms kerr 's nokia n100 was among the stolen goods
' so i 'm like , " oh , why do n't we try texting them ? " nothing will probably happen , ' ms mcdonald said
ms mcdonald drafted a series of text messages aimed at the criminal
she did not rail over her stolen possessions , instead taking a different tack - telling the crook she hoped he enjoyed his new condoms and tampons
to her surprise , the robber replied
' ( he was ) so funny
we had a good convo , ' ms mcdonald told daily mail australia
' we became friends and ( he ) became quite remorseful of the fact ( he 'd ) taken all our stuff
' il add u on fb one day lol ' : after returning ( most ) of the girls ' items , the crook pledged to add ms mcdonald on facebook
she told daily mail australia she hopes he comes forward the students used text messages to sweet talk the thief and get back their stolen mobile phone and cards following a phone conversation , the sorry criminal informed the women he would leave their items at a look out near spencer beach holiday park in christchurch
they were overjoyed to find everything there hours late , with the exception of some of their money and kerr 's stolen phone
' i guess once you put a face on the person you 've stolen off it 's hard to imagine that they 're not hurt from what you 've done , ' ms mcdonald said
' most people would n't be able to contact the people who took their stuff
' we just did n't imagine he would actually reply '
the thief has not made contact since , despite promising to add them on facebook in the future
' i hope the guy sees all this and comes forward so we can thank him , ' ms mcdonald said
' and get him to pay for my munted car lock - ha ! ' .
