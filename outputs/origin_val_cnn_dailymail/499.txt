murder suspect durst grinned and stretched out across the backseat of a police car as he was driven to jail in handcuffs on tuesday
durst , 71 , appeared before a judge for a second straight day in his prison - issue , orange jumpsuit to face drug and weapons charges in new orleans , la
authorities found more than a quarter - pound of marijuana and a revolver in millionaire durst 's hotel room when he was arrested over the weekend , a prosecutor said tuesday
durst was expected to be held at a la prison for several more days before being extradited to la where he has been charged with the first - degree murder of his friend , susan berman
durst was rebooked on charges of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm , and possession of a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance , a small amount of marijuana on tuesday and despite the fact the frail 71 - year - old is behind bars , his family is so scared of him that they have taken out a restraining order
a new orleans judge has approved an order of protection , preventing durst from contacting his brother douglas , head of $ 1 billion , family business durst corp , and other members of his family
durst , who is worth an estimated $ 100 million , has been suspected in the disappearance of his first wife and he won an acquittal on a murder charge in texas
in a documentary about durst 's troubled life , he mumbled about how he ' killed them all , ' providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series
but a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote
it was revealed on tuesday that the final episode of hbo 's six - part series , the jinx , drew more than a million viewers on sunday evening - more than double the audience from the week before
analysis linking a letter durst wrote to his friend susan berman a year before her killing with one he said ' only the killer could have written ' to point police to her body was the key new evidence in the long - dormant investigation into the 2000 killing , the official not authorized to speak publicly told the associated press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing
durst , 71 , was charged monday in los angeles with first - degree murder in the shooting of susan berman , the daughter of a prominent las vegas mobster
he could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime
he waived extradition in new orleans , but authorities there charged him late monday with being a felon in possession of a gun because he had a revolver when he was arrested there saturday
assistant district mark burton said they found the pot and gun in his hotel room
attorney dick deguerin said he wants a hearing in la as soon as possible to contest the arrest
' the warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact , ' he said
' we want a hearing as quickly as possible so mr. durst can go to california and face trial as quickly as possible
' the judge in new orleans , magistrate harry cantrell , scheduled another hearing for next monday
presented with the two letters in the finale of ' the jinx : the life and deaths of durst ' that aired sunday on hbo , the eccentric heir blinked , burped oddly , pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer
then he stepped away from the tense interview and went to the bathroom , still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next
durst was arrested on saturday afternoon in new orleans after police in los angeles turned up new evidence in a 15 - year - old murder durst was back in police custody after an hbo show , the jinx , appeared to show him confessing to three murders in an unguarded moment
the high - profile eccentric is pictured on tuesday being driven to jail ' there it is
you 're caught ! ' durst whispered before the sound of running water is heard
' what the hell did i do ? killed them all , of course
' that moment did n't just make for a captivating ending to the documentary on the eccentric life of an heir to a new york real estate fortune , it could also provide additional evidence for prosecutors
susan berman was found shot execution - style outside her home in la in 2000
her friend , durst , was charged with her murder on monday the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the bathroom recording was not presented to prosecutors before charges were filed because detectives were still trying to determine if the recording was tampered with in any way
but legal experts said the audio and other parts of the interview could become key evidence
' any statement that the defendant makes that they want to use against him , they can use against him , ' said andrea roth , a law professor at the university of california , berkeley
kerry lawrence , a defense attorney in westchester county , new york , said durst 's lawyers will have to try to explain away his comments , perhaps dismissing them as a joke
' prosecutors would argue it was a candid moment of self - reflection , and i assume will argue that he knew he was still being recorded , and this was either said in jest or he was being facetious or sarcastic or was being provocative , ' lawrence said
' i do n't think it 's quite the smoking gun
' durst â still worth millions despite his estrangement from his family , whose new york real estate empire is worth about $ 4 billion â has maintained his innocence in three killings in as many states
when durst approached the filmmakers and agreed to go on camera , against the advice of his lawyers , he had already weathered one murder case , winning an acquittal in a gory galveston , texas , dismemberment case by claiming he shot his neighbor in self - defense
he was still suspected in the killing of susan berman , whose father was a las vegas mobster associated with bugsy siegel and meyer lansky , and the disappearance of his wife , kathleen , who was declared dead long after she vanished in new york in 1982
durst 's first wife , kathleen mccormack ( pictured left ) , has been missing since 1982
her brother , jim mccormack , said on tuesday that following the hbo show he hoped durst would have an ' epiphany of conscience ' and tell them what happened to his sister susan berman , 55 , was shot once in the back of the head at her home near beverly hills shortly before new york investigators planned to question her about kathleen durst 's disappearance
the documentary showed filmmaker jarecki confronting durst with a copy of an anonymous letter that alerted beverly hills police to look for a ' cadaver ' at susan berman 's address
durst offered that whoever sent it was ' taking a big risk
you 're sending a letter to police that only the killer could have written
' then , in the final episode , jarecki revealed another envelope , which durst acknowledged mailing to susan berman , that has similar writing in block letters and also misspelled the address as ' beverley
' ' i wrote this one but i did not write the cadaver one , ' durst said
but when shown an enlargement of both copies , durst could n't distinguish them
