the u.s. could face a shortage of 90,000 doctors by 2025 as it struggles to cope with an older , sicker population and increased demand from affordable care act , a new report has warned
the dire need for doctors , particularly surgeons treating diseases common among elderly people , such as cancer , was revealed by the aamc on tuesday
' the doctor shortage is real â it 's significant â and it 's particularly serious for the kind of medical care that our aging population is going to need , ' said kirch , ceo and president of aamc , which represents medical schools and teaching hospitals across the country
in its 2015 report , the association found that even though the supply of doctors will increase between now and 2015 , the demand for physician services will fast out - grow this supply
struggle : a graph shows the predicted demand for doctors compared to the predicted supply between 2013 and 2015
the demand is thanks to the affordable care act ( affordable care act ) and retail clinics , among other factors problem : the greatest shortage will be for surgeons , particularly those treating diseases among the elderly the number of physicians is expected to grow by nine per cent over the next ten years , but the demand for healthcare services could grown by up to 17 percent
it predicted there could be a shortfall of between 46,100 and 90,400 doctors in 10 years ' time and , of these , there could be a shortage of as many as 63,700 non-primary care physicians
this is also considering how retail clinics and outpatient centers are turning more to nurse practitioners , physician assistants and other professionals instead of physicians , the report noted
when looking at the cause behind the increased demand , the association pointed to increased life expectancy
' an increasingly older , sicker population , as well as people living longer with chronic diseases , such as cancer , is the reason for the increased demand , ' kirch told the washington post
the number of people over the age of 65 will soar by 40 percent by 2025 , he said
the association also noted that the implementation of the affordable care act will likely increase demand
but it will do so only minimally - increasing the need for doctors by two per cent
' the trends from these data are clear , ' kirch said in a statement
' the physician shortage will grow over the next 10 years under every likely scenario
demands : the aamc , which compiled the report , has called upon the government to pay to train 3,000 more physicians a year in a bid to meet the growing demand ' because training a doctor takes between five and 10 years , we must act now , in 2015 , if we are going to avoid serious physician shortages in 2025
' he called for more efficient care and more federal support to train at least 3,000 more students a year - at an estimated cost of $ 1 billion a year
the association did note that the shortfalls are n't as bad as predictions in the past ; in a 2010 study , they said there would be a shortage of 130,600 physicians
the difference in predictions is thanks to revised population numbers and the slight rise in doctors completing medical school
the aamc , which is based in washington , d.c. , represents all 141 u.s. medical schools and 17 in canada , and 400 major teaching hospitals and health systems .
