she married a man whose first wife mysteriously disappeared
and she stood by him even after he admitted killing a neighbor and chopping up the body
but who is debrah , the wife of millionaire heir durst ? and what role has she played in his life ? debrah has n't spoken publicly since her husband 's arrest in new orleans over the weekend , and cnn was unable to reach her for comment
in " the jinx , " the hbo documentary about durst 's life , she appears in a police interview from more than a decade ago
the series also includes excerpts from jailhouse recordings of phone conversations between durst and charatan
debrah says she met durst in 1988 , six years after his first wife went missing
the two were married in a rushed ceremony just weeks before durst 's longtime friend susan berman turned up dead in beverly hills , california
this week , the los angeles county district attorney 's office charged durst with first - degree murder in that case
it 's an accusation he has long denied
he also has said he had nothing to do with his first wife 's disappearance
in a 2003 trial , he admitted he 'd shot a neighbor in galveston , texas , and dismembered the body , but was acquitted of murder after arguing he 'd acted in self defense
recorded jailhouse calls from durst 's imprisonment during that case suggest that debrah was his rock
" am i supposed to be smiling or am i supposed to be grim ? " durst asks in one conversation discussing how he should appear during his trial
charatan quickly replies , " i would just have as close to no expression , yeah , that 's what i think
" she was also a driving force behind the decision to fire attorney kennedy , a lawyer durst 's wealthy real estate developer family had tapped to handle the case
the insanity defense kennedy was planning to use , she said at the time , could have meant both durst and debrah were cut out of the family fortune
" what he does n't want is me to get any of the trust money later on , since i 'm not your wife because you were incompetent at the time , ok , that means they are the only ones who can make your decisions , " she says in another call
like durst himself , debrah is a powerful player on the new york real estate scene
" she 's not some opportunistic woman who came into bob 's life for monetary gain
she was very successful , a millionaire several times over long before she met bob , " said korangy , publisher of therealdeal.com
susan criss , the retired judge who presided over the 2003 trial , said from listening to hours of tapes and testimony that it 's clear that charatan is motivated by financial gain
" it 's very clear that she only cares about the money , " criss said
some former friends and employees described debrah in less than glowing terms
former employees have successfully sued her for failing to pay commissions
according to sources , she only briefly lived with durst and they are now separated , though still married
why does n't the hbo documentary feature any more recent interviews with her ? debrah did n't want durst to participate in " the jinx , " korangy said , and she has n't spoken with him since it started airing
