the effigy , which was designed by engraver jody clark , is only the fifth official coin portrait made during the queen 's 63 - year reign and replaces the current one , which first appeared in 1998
commissioned in 1820 by george iv , the diadem , which is most often seen during the state opening of parliament , has 1,333 diamonds and 169 pearls , arranged in rose , thistle and shamrock designs to represent england , scotland and ireland
like its owner , the diadem also has a long history of appearing on coins and bank notes , having appeared on currency belonging to the british , australia , canada and the british caribbean territories among many others
the new portrait was chosen from a selection of anonymously submitted designs , with creator jody clark becoming , at 34 , the youngest engraver ever to create a royal coin portrait
likeness : the new portrait is an updated version of the ian rank-broadley design , created in 1997 creator : 34 - year - old engraver jody clark , from the lake district , created the winning design new look : the new coin portrait is only the fifth to be produced during the queen 's reign , with the first in 1953 ' i really liked the four previous coin portraits - each one is strong in its own way , ' says a delighted mr jody clark
' i hope that i âve done her majesty justice and captured her as i intended
' the news that my design had been chosen was quite overwhelming , and i still ca nât quite believe that my royal portrait will be featured on millions of coins
' speaking about the decision to award mr jody clark the job , kevin clancy , director of the royal mint museum , said the judging panel âs decision was ' pretty unanimous '
mr jody clark , who is originally from the lake district , says his family are ' really proud ' , adding : ' they âve had to keep quiet about this
' it âs going to be hard to top this
it âs going to take a while to sink in
i âm really happy with how it âs turned out
i can only hope everyone appreciates it
' the first coin portrait of the queen 's reign appeared in 1953 , shortly after she took the throne , and was designed by mary gillick
heading for your wallet : the new coin will be introduced this year although the four subsequent designs show her wearing a crown , her first portrait showed a fresh - faced young queen wearing nothing more than an evergreen wreath
that all changed when a new coin portrait entered circulation in april 1968 , which showed a sterner version of the queen in the george iv diadem
the image , which was designed by arnold machin , was replicated on stamps and remains one of the most famous portraits of the queen ever created
in 1985 came another new coin portrait , this time by maklouf who once again showed the monarch in the george iv diadem
unusually , the new portrait proved controversial with maklouf accused of making the effigy ' flatteringly youthful '
unimpressed , he swiftly hit back at critics , telling them his intention had been to create something ' regal and ageless '
for the fourth coin portrait of the queen , which replaced maklouf 's design in 1997 , her majesty chose to wear the magnificent girls of great britain tiara
the gem , which was made for queen mary on the occasion of her wedding in 1893 , is one of the most spectacular in the royal collection and features 13 brilliant - cut diamonds as its centrepiece
along with its appearance on the 1997 coins , it was also worn by the queen to marry the duke of edinburgh in november 1947
