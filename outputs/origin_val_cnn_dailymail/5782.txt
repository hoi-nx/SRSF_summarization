after a two - and - a - half year legal battle , mr bailes , 58 , has won a five - figure sum from first , which fired him for â gross misconduct â in june 2012
to clear his name , the grandfather - of - three spent Â£ 440 on a more accurate hair follicle test through his gp â which proved he had not had drugs in his system for at least 90 days
despite this first refused to reinstate him
it must now pay out after its appeal against a court ruling of unfair dismissal failed
bailes has won a five - figure payout from first after he proved that a saliva test which got him sacked for taking drugs was incorrect mr bailes and his wife , rita , had to borrow money from friends and family to cover mortgage payments while they took the company to an employment tribunal , which ruled he was wrongly dismissed and condemned first âs â flawed investigation â
last night mr bailes said : â we âve been left feeling stressed , incredibly worried and upset , all for something i did nât do
â i âm sure first do nât like the fact that the little man took them on and beat them â¦ but i was accused of doing something i knew i had nât done and i was determined to fight back
â mr bailes , from bristol , was asked by first to take a saliva test in may 2012 after an anonymous complaint that he had driven under the influence of cannabis
he had not washed his hands before the test and had eaten his sandwiches after counting the cash , increasing the likelihood of the drug being transferred to his mouth
mr bailes said : â i had nât smoked cigarettes for 16 years and i have never taken drugs in my life
i took the test and ten days later it came back with cocaine
i could nât believe it
â following his dismissal , mr bailes âs family found a daily mail article about traces of illegal drugs on bank notes
during the tribunal an expert witness presented evidence that the positive result was down to â sample contamination â from the money mr bailes handled
a study by the forensic science service in 2010 found that almost every uk bank note in circulation is likely to contain traces of cocaine
most bank notes now have traces of cocaine contamination is believed to occur within weeks of notes entering general circulation
notes are either contaminated by coming into contact with someone who has used cocaine , or other bank notes that contain traces
experts said notes are no longer routinely tested to identify drug users and dealers because most contain background traces of cocaine
the number of notes detected is said to be an indicator of the prevalence of cocaine use in the uk
scientists found one in 20 notes gave very high readings for cocaine , showing they were likely to have been handled by dealers
a study by msa ( msa ) , based in bristol , tested 500 banknotes in circulation in london and found just four did not contain traces of cocaine
banknotes are more likely to be contaminated with cocaine rather than heroin or ecstasy which degrade more rapidly
traces of cocaine use in the uk is now believed to be so widespread it is found in the water supply , tests by the drinking water inspectorate found last year
employment judge christa christensen said : â the respondent [ first ] was aware that bank notes in general circulation are or could be contaminated by cocaine
' this in turn means that it was incumbent on the respondent , as part of a reasonable investigatory process , to investigate the possibility that that reality may have some significance to the claimant âs positive cocaine drug test
â a first west of england spokesman said : â we believe that we followed due process throughout
â the 55 - year - old had been a first bus driver for 22 years and previously had an unblemished record
