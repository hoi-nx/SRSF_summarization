when rachel abbott sold her successful media company for Â£ 5 million , she set herself two goals : to embark on a new career as a novelist and to find a dream home in italy
with no previous writing experience , rachel abbott knew the former would be tricky â but what she had nât counted on was how difficult it would be to crack the latter
despite viewing countless properties in tuscany , she and husband john were left disappointed until they discovered a ruined 15th century monastery in neighbouring le marche
instantly smitten , they swapped their home in the pennines for one in the apennines
dream home : rachel abbott and her husband viewed countless properties in tuscany before discovering the monastery in neighbouring le marche resurrected : the couple paid just Â£ 150,000 for the monastery in 2000
pictured : the ruins of the monastery â when we went to italy we knew what we wanted â an ancient building that had been completely modernised , â says rachel abbott , 62
â there were lots that fitted the bill but something about them did nât click â they were nât right
â then , finally , an estate agent took us to this place and we just knew â¦ â all that remained of the monastery was the chapel â minus the roof â and the oratory
yet the couple were mesmerised by the building and its location
â it had views to the adriatic in one direction and the mountains in the other , â says rachel abbott
â we got such a sense of peace and tranquillity
â the region also excited them
whereas tuscany is teeming with wealthy second - home - owners from britain , le marche is the â real italy â â a place where they could mix with the locals
back in its glory : after a two - year restoration project , which set the couple back a further Â£ 1 million , the monastery was transformed into a modern eight bedroom home luxurious : the property also boasts seven en suite bedrooms , a swimming pool and a five - hole golf course

luckily , the old building had survived until the 1960s , so they were able to find photographs , enabling their architects to recreate the style of original
they covered two layers of stone used for the walls in terracotta tiling , just as would have been done in the 15th century , and windows were installed exactly where they were in the pictures
behind the facade , the couple built a modern eight - bedroom home with seven en suites , a swimming pool and , for john âs benefit , a five - hole golf course in the five acres of grounds
price â¬ 2.5 million ( Â£ 1.8 million ) location near treia , le marche bedrooms 8 unique features converted 15th century monastery , swimming pool , five - hole golf course , five acres it was only in 2005 , when they were fully ensconced in the old monastery , that rachel abbott turned her attention to her second ambition â to become a successful writer
she had been toying with an idea for a psychological crime thriller for some time , and by 2010 she had finished her first work , only the innocent
then , however , she was faced with another problem : how to find a publisher
rachel abbott did not fancy the anguish of rejection , so her solution was to self - publish on amazon instead
at first her novels sold at the rate of only six a week
â then i thought , â this is crazy
i know about marketing , i âm going to make this book sell
â â i set up a twitter account , which now has 12,500 followers , and emailed every blogger and reviewer i could find
i spent countless hours on forums and facebook
as a result i changed my life
â rachel abbott âs subsequent success has been astounding
a first novel is thought to have done well if it sells 3,000 copies â only the innocent and follow - up books the back road and sleep tight have together sold a million
all three have been no 1 bestsellers on amazon âs kindle store , and rachel abbott now outsells many well - established authors
price tag : the couple have now put the property on the market for â¬ 2.5 million ( Â£ 1.8 million )
pictured : one of the bedrooms life in italy has gone well , too
the couple have made money by letting out the chapel as a venue for upmarket weddings
and with children from previous relationships visiting them , rachel abbott and john âs house has often been buzzing with guests â just as she had planned
but now they have put their home on the market for â¬ 2.5 million â about Â£ 1.8 million â and want to move to the channel island of alderney
â we already rent a flat there , â says rachel abbott
â it âs a wonderful place â friendly and virtually crime - free
as much as we love italy , we now want to buy a property there
