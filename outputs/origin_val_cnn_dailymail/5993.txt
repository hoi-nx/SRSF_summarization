tribute : scrawled images of mr spock have started appearing on canadian $ 5 bills , with star trek fans defacing the former prime minster in honor of actor nimoy
long - running tradition : the act of giving sir wilfrid laurier - who was head of government from 1896 to 1911 - spock 's pointy vulcan ears , sharp eyebrows and signature bowl haircut is apparently nothing new a spokeswoman from the central reserve , josianne menard , said tuesday that scribbling on the blue bills is inappropriate because it defaces a symbol and source of national pride
josianne menard warned defaced bills may not circulate for as long and risk being rejected by retailers
' there are important reasons why it should not be done , ' she noted
however , canadian 's central bank confirmed this week that it is not illegal to deface or even mutilate banknotes
following nimoy 's death friday , social media users posted their own versions of sir wilfrid laurier 's vulcan makeover to honor the actor
but following the death of 83 - year - old nimoy ( seen here in a 1982 episode of star trek ) last week from lung cancer , amateur artists have been out in force , even triggering a reaction from the national bank ' spock your $ 5 bills for nimoy , ' a group called the canadian design resource tweeted alongside its depiction
images of the altered bills circulated widely online and attracted international media attention to something many canadian had never seen before - although for others , it was hardly a new frontier
calgary artist tom bagley , who posted his own spock-laurier hybrid on facebook and flickr after nimoy 's death , described it as a traditional bar trick to impress the waitress
' i always thought it was ok as long as the numbers were intact - it still counted as money , ' he said
' that 's what i heard
because stuff happens , like say you spill spaghetti sauce all over it or something like that
' ' spocking fives ' even has its own identity on facebook , where canadian are encouraged to post their revision of sir wilfrid laurier âs face
a description accompanying the page - founded in 2008 - states : ' the origins of this mysterious tradition are shrouded in secrecy , although it is widely believed to be totally awesome
