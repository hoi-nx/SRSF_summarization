the british had also looked into building a railway between burma and thailand but the route of the line - through hilly jungle terrain divided by many rivers â was considered too dangerous and difficult to undertake
nonetheless , after the japanese invaded burma in 1942 , they used forced labour involving nearly 200,000 asian civilians and 60,000 pows to work on building the railway
of these , about 90,000 civilians and 12,600 pows died from disease , malnutrition and beatings
last year patti sold at auction an extensive collection of books relating to military history and the railways in the far east which her late husband used for research on his autobiography
