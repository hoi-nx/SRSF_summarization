mobile phone bills should begin to fall after a watchdog ordered telecoms companies to slash the cost of calling another network
for years , mobile users have faced extra charges for so - called ' cross-network ' calls to friends , family and colleagues who have a different provider
the charges , known as the ' mobile termination rate ' , is passed on to the customer who made the call , but also affect calls made from landline operators such as bt and talktalk
for years , mobile users have faced extra charges for so - called ' cross-network ' calls to friends , family and colleagues who have a different provider at the moment , these charges add 0.826 pence a minute to the usual cost of calls
however , ofcom said yesterday that operators must slash them by more than 40 per cent over the next two years
by april 2017 , mobile companies will be allowed to only charge 0.475 pence per minute extra
howett , a telecoms analyst at ovum , said : ' this is a good thing for the consumer
the main benefit will be to customers making calls from a fixed line , where fees are stubbornly high â¦ so it is particularly good for the elderly
' ofcom research has shown that older customers tend to use landlines much more than younger people
according to official figures , the vast majority of the population â 93 per cent â owns a mobile , and around three - quarters have both a landline and a mobile
last year , around 16 per cent of adults in the uk relied solely on their mobile , and did not have a landline at all
mobile operators have spent years lobbying to keep the mobile termination rate in place , helping to fatten their profits
the rates have been steadily reduced since the 1990s , when they were as high as 25p per minute , as mobile technology became more efficient and costs to the networks fell
however , yesterday the network operators expressed disappointment over ofcom 's decision to cut them further , and issued a veiled threat they could increase other charges to make up for the reduction
last year , around 16 per cent of adults in the uk relied solely on their mobile , and did not have a landline a spokesman for ee said : ' the proposed implementation puts at risk future investments and our ability to offer customers the lowest possible prices
' a telecoms source said that mobile phone companies would not be able to offer the same level of service if they do not get as much income from customers
operators would face a choice to either allow the standards of their network and customer services to slip , or to recoup the money they have lost by increasing charges elsewhere
a spokesman for o2 added : ' there 's no such thing as a free lunch
mobile operators invest billions of pounds in their networks
the cost of handling calls from other operators comes at a cost and needs to be recovered from those operators
' mr howett said : ' the charges are based on the old - world of ancient switch networks
[ it is time to ask ] whether the system is still relevant '
mobile operators , however , said they were pleased that ofcom has given them two years to reduce the charges , as they had feared they would have to slash them overnight
david hickson , of the consumer campaign group , fair telecoms , predicted that ofcom would continue slashing the charges for cross-network calls
' landline users have effectively been subsidising mobile users for years
that has to go away , ' he said
mr howett added that ofcom would keep pressure on mobile companies to pass as much of the savings as possible to customers .
