terry has launched an extraordinary defence of chelsea 's bully - boy tactics
nine chelsea stars - including captain terry - surrounded the referee to successfully get paris saint-germain striker ibrahimovic sent off for a lunge on oscar in their champions league defeat
but terry has attempted to excuse the players ' behaviour and insisted it was simply retaliation for paris saint-germain 's antics
chelsea 's players surround referee bjorn kuipers as he sends off ibrahimovic ( second right ) in the first half of the blues ' defeat terry ( centre ) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following ibrahimovic 's first - half challenge in the second leg clash the referee is almost completely hidden from view as the chelsea players make their case as they gained an early advantage he said : ' if i have to run 20 , 30 yards , it does n't look great but when you 're standing back and seeing five or six of their players surrounding the ref , for me i think i support my team - mates
' and once i go , four or five go with me
it does n't look good at all but that 's part of the game
we 'll match it if people want to mix it , that 's part of our game as well
' there was an awful lot going on but â i do n't think anyone got caught up in it
' once they 're charging the ref , the only thing we can do is respond
you ca n't as a group of players let them surround the ref , trying to get our players booked

ibrahimovic branded them ' babies ' for their reaction to his tackle on oscar which persuaded dutch referee bjorn kuipers to send him off half an hour into the 2 - 2 draw at stamford bridge
on tv , jamie carragher called the pressure they put on the officials ' disgraceful ' and said it came from manager mourinho , while graeme souness said oscar 's play acting was ' pathetic '
' coming from them ? ' , was terry 's initial response
the chelsea captain added : ' i do n't want to get involved in a row but as a group it 's difficult
it 's there and you have to stick up for your team - mates
' the fans want to see that and that 's the same with every side
every other side is as bad as each other
it 's part of the game
it 's maybe an excuse they 're looking for but certainly not from our point
' it made for a disappointing night for mourinho 's players , dumped out on away goals despite leading twice and left to focus on the title race
ibrahimovic called chelsea ' babies ' for their reaction to the challenge which led to his dismissal but he has the last laugh as paris saint-germain progressed sportsmail columnist and sky sports pundit jamie carragher said the pressure chelsea put on the referee was ' disgraceful ' jamie carragher , thierry henry ( centre ) and graeme souness disect chelsea 's exit from the champions league on sky sports terry said : ' we have to pick ourselves up and go again at the weekend now
we 've got another big game against a very good southampton side
' we 've got the capital one cup in the pocket and the premier league is a massive one to go for
we 're a few points clear and we need to keep that gap and maintain it
we can only do that by responding and doing that the right way and coming back here and picking up three points
' the manager said then if we can win the capital one cup and the premier league , it will be a very successful year
there is an awful lot to do but it 's in our hands and we have to respond
we 've got four or five days until sunday 's game
' [ we will have a ] couple of days warm down , train and then pick ourselves right back up
as a group of players , there 's enough experience in the squad to rally round and get everyone going again
' there will be no english teams in the last eight of the champions league unless arsenal or manchester city can overturn first leg defeats next week in monaco and barcelona respectively
terry said : ' we 've had our fair share of maintaining interest for english sides in the competition over the years
it 's disappointing to go out early
it 's different for us , we 're normally in the hat for the next round for sure but from the club 's point a view and the players and the fans , we 're obviously really disappointed
' they probably deserved the win and going down to 10 they were probably the better side as well
so i wish them good luck and we regroup and go again in this competition next season
