a homeowner checking his house after tenants moved out found the property had been rigged with explosives set to detonate with the flip of a light switch
lendel williams was inspecting the house in milton , massachusetts on tuesday as he prepared to sell the home when his electrician came across the suspicious device in a bedroom closet
they called police and it was successfully deactivated a few hours later
' i am angry , ' lendel williams told reporters outside the home on tuesday night
' i just ca n't believe people can really do that to be quite frank with you
the mechanism involved a gallon of a flammable substance with wires snaking out of it and around the house
the end of the wire led to a light switch
' we believe the intention was that if someone flipped the light switch on where it ended , the device would have exploded , ' milton police chief richard wells said
' it took some work to put it in there
' authorities said the intricate system could have caused ' significant destruction ' if it had been set off and could have even resulted in a loss of life
police have not yet named any suspects and said they are considering anyone with access to the house as a person of interest in the case , wcvb reported
