saudis is leading a military campaign against shiite rebels in yemen , bringing the wider region directly into a complex conflict that has festered for months
the saudis say they want to restore the yemen government , a key u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda , which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year
" having yemen fail can not be option for us or for our coalition partners , " said adel al-jubeir , the saudis ambassador to the u.s. , referring to the other nations in the region supporting the campaign
here are answers to key questions about the escalating conflict in yemen
analysts say it can be summed up in one word : iran
the saudis " perceive this as a threat from the iran , " said cnn military analyst lt. col. francona
" they look at the shiite houthis as nothing more than a proxy iran force , just like we can look at hezbollah as a proxy iran force in southern lebanon
" analysts say that shiite - majority iran and sunni - dominated saudis are locked in a strategic contest for influence across the middle east
now , the epic chess match has spread into yemen , saudis 's southern neighbor
" what they do not want is an iran - run state on their southern border , because they already feel they 've got enough problems on their northern border , " said francona , a retired u.s. air force intelligence officer
iran , northeast of saudis , is considered to exercise powerful influence within the regime of president bashar al-assad in war - torn syria and within the shiite - led iraq government
the saudis and other gulf nations appeared to make an implicit reference to iran in a statement about the start of the military campaign , describing the houthi militias as " backed by regional powers " that are aiming for " hegemony " in yemen
the iran government , for its part , condemned the offensive , calling for an immediate halt to saudis - led airstrikes , state media reported
the chaos in yemen appeared to be careering toward a full - blown civil war
the shiite houthis , whose power base is in northern yemen , started protests against the central government in the capital , sanaa , last summer
but they stepped up their campaign in september , seizing multiple government buildings
attempts to strike political deals between the two sides had no effect , and the shiite houthis pushed into other areas of the country
the crisis intensified in january , when the shiite houthis displayed their clout by storming the presidential palace and putting president hadi under house arrest
hadi escaped to the southern city of aden in february and declared that he remained the legitimate president
since then , hadi 's supporters have repeatedly clashed with the shiite houthis and their allies , prompting the united nations to warn of an impending civil war
the shiite houthis also have support from forces loyal to hadi 's predecessor , former president ali abdullah saleh , who resigned in 2012 after months of arab spring - inspired protests
the deepening chaos has led many governments to pull embassy staff out of sanaa
the u.s. recently withdrew its remaining special forces in yemen , dealing a blow to counterterrorism efforts in the country
rebel forces captured parts of aden and a nearby airbase wednesday
early thursday , the saudis - led strikes began
the airstrikes appear to be only the start of the campaign
saudis has also pledged 150,000 soldiers to the coalition that 's intervening in yemen , the saudis - owned al-arabiya tv network reported thursday , raising the possibility of a ground offensive
" the airstrikes will be the kickoff of the campaign , " francona said " they 'll want to knock down the air defenses and create a corridor with which they can move their troops in there
" it was n't immediately clear if other nations in the coalition were offering any ground troops
a ground offensive is n't a decision that saudis king salman bin abdulaziz al-saud would take lightly
" saudis , all these years , has avoided sending troops into yemen
it 's a quagmire for the saudis , " cnn intelligence and security analyst bob baer said in january
beyond the military campaign , the saudis and their allies say they want to find a political solution for the violence - plagued nation
the aim is to bring back yemen 's " security and stability through establishing a political process , " said a statement from saudis , the uae , bahrain , qatar and kuwait
al-jubeir , the saudis ambassador to the u.s. , said u.s. forces are not involved in the airstrikes
but francona said he thought the u.s. most likely assisted with information needed to pick out targets
" the saudis do n't have the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capability to determine all of these targets , " he said
" they 've had to have had some help , and i think it probably came from us
" arab and senior obama administration officials tell cnn that an interagency u.s. coordination team is in saudis
the sources said the saudis have not specified what they want yet , but will probably ask for u.s. air support , satellite imagery and other intelligence
" we can help with logistics and intelligence and things like that , but there will be no military intervention by the u.s. , " a senior administration official said
a saudis adviser told cnn that 10 countries are involved in the coalition : saudis , the uae , bahrain , qatar , kuwait , jordan , egypt , morocco , pakistan and sudan
but it was unclear how many of those countries other than saudis were taking an active military role
the saudis adviser told cnn that the uae , bahrain , kuwait and qatar had contributed fighter planes to the operations
it brings another disturbing angle to the conflict
yemen is home to aqap , considered by u.s. officials to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network
the sunni muslim extremist group , also known as aqap , has taken advantage of yemen 's weak government to plan and launch terrorist attacks against the west
operating from its heartland in central yemen , it considers both the shiite houthis and the pro- u.s. yemen government as its foes
houthi forces have clashed with aqap and its allies in central yemen
and bomb attacks have repeatedly hit shiite gatherings in the capital
there are also concerns about isis ' growing influence in yemen
the sunni militant group that controls large areas of iraq and syria claimed responsibility for attacks on shiite mosques in sanaa that killed more than 130 people this month
aqap and isis looked set to be " the big winners " from the deepening chaos in yemen , cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank said wednesday before news of the saudis airstrikes emerged
but the big question now is whether the saudis - led coalition will take any action against the sunni terrorist groups
