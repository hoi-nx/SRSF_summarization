india took apart a diligent but limited ireland attack to sweep to an untroubled eight - wicket victory at seddon park on tuesday which confirmed they will top pool b in the cricket world cup
after dismissing ireland for 249 with an over to spare when their spinners established a stranglehold on the top - order batting , rohit sharma and shikhar dhawan played themselves in for a token couple of overs
they then launched a full - blooded attack , alternating flowing drives with explosive pulls while also pushing around the ball for comfortable singles

after scoring five further runs he was dropped again off the unlucky mooney , this time at backward point when captain william porterfield parried a stinging cut but was unable to hang on to the rebound
those were the only times the irish bowlers looked like taking a wicket and the duo took the score to 174 when rohit sharma chopped medium pacer stuart thompson on to his stumps and was out for 64 from 66 balls
with the indian supporters making a tremendous din , shikhar dhawan took a single to complete his eighth one - day century from 84 balls with five sixes but was then caught off the following ball he faced from stuart thompson
virat kohli ( 44 not out ) and ajinkya rahane ( 33 not out ) took their team to victory with 13.1 overs to spare
william porterfield elected to bat on a warm afternoon before a capacity crowd of 11,000 packed into a picturesque ground in new zealand 's fourth largest city and all seemed set fair for the irish when the captain and paul stirling put on 89 for the first wicket from 15 overs
ms dhoni turned to his spinners and ravi ashwin , ravindra jadeja and raina responded by first frustrating then dismissing the irish batsmen who found boundaries hard to come by after the initial flurry
paul stirling ( 42 ) lofted a simple catch to long - off off ravi ashwin 's bowling and ed joyce was bowled for two trying to cut a ball from raina which was too full for the shot
