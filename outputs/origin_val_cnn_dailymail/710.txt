these are the stomach - churning images captured when a fearless teenager scaled a 700ft hong kong skyscraper without using any safety equipment
daredevil andrej ciesielski , 18 , strapped a go-pro camera to his head before climbing the manulife plaza , located in causeway bay
when at the top of the 50 - storey block , the adrenaline junkie from munich , germany , stood on the side of the huge building to capture spectacular footage of the city below
he said : ' the tricky thing about this building is that it 's a commercial office so it 's well secured
at the top there is a big spire that is absolutely amazing
' i had to climb this one alone because my friend who was on the trip with me was afraid he would get caught and arrested
daredevil : the 18 - year - old completed the climb to the top of the 700ft building without any safety equipment , and wearing ' good shoes with good grip ' fearless : the teenager from munich looks over hong kong from the top of the manulife plaza
he said climbing makes him feel ' so free ' ' when i 'm ' roof - topping ' it 's not the height i 'm thinking about , it 's the police
i 'm not thinking about falling , i 'm just thinking about getting caught
' after this particular climb i was paranoid for the entire day that i 'd been caught on the security cameras but fortunately i was n't
' i did n't use any safety equipment , just some good shoes with a good grip
' my parents like the end result , they enjoy looking at my pictures but they are n't very happy about what i do
they do n't like watching the videos because they 're scared i could fall one day
' when i 'm climbing though i just feel so free
it makes me really happy
i know some people will struggle to understand that but for me it 's freedom and i do it because i love it
