others suggested that mentioning kenya in his tweet was racist

he said : ' i conducted a poll - it was like ten guys
in every situation - it does n't matter the ethics scenario or the social scenario - when i say , " hey , what if i ran for president ? " it 's a hundred per cent
' ' guess who my vice president is ? my dad
' it would be charlie sheen and sheen 2016
running on a platform of truth and transparency
' love : president obama is an avid basketball fan and has been making his annual ncaa selections since 2009 the actor is a so - called 9/11 ' truther ' who believes in a range of implausible conspiracy theories surrounding the attacks 2011 attacks on the twin towers and the pentagon
president obama predicted that kentucky will remain undefeated during the ncaa tournament and will win the title
the president is a massive basketball fan and has delivered his ncaa selections live on espn since taking office
however , despite the president 's familiarity with basketball , he has not picked the correct national champion since his first year in office when north carolina won in 2009
in 2010 he backed kansas , who went out to north iowa
in 2011 , the president once again backed kansas , who were defeated in the south west final
in 2012 , mr obama switched to north carolina , who were defeated by his previous team kansas
in 2013 , he backed indiana , who were defeated by syracuse in 2014 , the president threw his support behind michigan state who were defeated by connecticut in the eastern regional final 2015 : kentucky ' i think kentucky is going to take it , ' obama said later in the day
' but , you know , i have n't won since my first year in office
... so i would n't necessarily take my bracket and copy it
' in 2009 , he accused the united states government of being involved in the attacks which claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people
he said that president obama should reopen the investigation into the attacks
charlie sheen accused the commission established to investigate the atrocity as a ' whitewash ' , claiming that ' the official 9/11 story is a fraud '
he said the attacks were being used ' as the pretext for the systematic dismantling of our constitution and our bill of rights
' charlie sheen argued that former president george w bush used the 9/11 attacks as a pretext to justify his subsequent invasion of iraq
he also accused the cia of being in league with the then al-qaeda leader osama bin laden
he said : ' we can not allow governments to continue to advance their political agendas by exploiting forged pretexts ... the establishment is upset that the population is waking up to false flag terror
' charlie sheen first questioned the events of 9/11 in 2006 when he said : ' it seems to me like 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75 per cent of their targets , that feels like a conspiracy theory
it raises a lot of questions
' in 2011 , he voiced doubts about whether president obama was born in the united states
' for starters , i was f * * * * * born here , how about that ? and i got proof ! nothing photoshopped about my birth certificate , ' he said .
