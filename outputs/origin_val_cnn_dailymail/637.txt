a sweden football team has told of how they narrowly escaped death after a last - minute decision against booking their players on flight 4u9525
four lufthansa subsidiary flights left barcelona around the same time on tuesday morning and division 1 team dalkurd , from borlã¤nge , central sweden , had players on three of them
the team had initially planned to travel on flight 4u9525 to dusseldorf , but instead split the team over the three remaining flights from barcelona , via germany
all 144 passengers , including two babies and 16 teenagers from a germany high school , and six crew members lost their lives
the airbus a320 ploughed into the mountainside in a remote region of the alps en route from spain to germany at more than 400mph
' we were supposed to have been on that flight
we checked in with all of the passengers
it 's surreal , ' dalkurd 's sports chief kizil told aftonbladet
' when we got to the airport in barcelona there were four flights leaving that time , flying north over the alps
all 144 passengers , including two babies , 16 teenagers and six crew members lost their lives video from the scene of the crash shows debris of the germanwings at the crash site crews in the first helicopter to reach the site said they had seen no survivors and found chunks of plane ' four flights and we had players on three of them
let 's just say we were very lucky
' dalkurd , formed in 2004 by kurdish immigrants , play in sweden 's division 1 , the third level of sweden football
the team had been on a week - long training camp in barcelona and were flying home
mr kizil told the newspaper how they had tried to fit the entire team on the germanwings flight , but that the connection time in dusseldorf to continue their journey home to sweden was too long
instead they split the team onto the three other flights , with one group flying via mã¼nchen and two others via zã¼rich
mr kizil said the players are still shocked , and that their thoughts are with the families of the victims
' all the people on that plane were at the same check - in as us
we also flew with a subsidiary to lufthansa , so everyone went to the same gates
