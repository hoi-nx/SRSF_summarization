one of the biggest concerns for owners of electric cars is that their battery could run out at any moment , leaving them stranded with no recharging station nearby
so - called ' range anxiety ' is a fear that has apparently plagued some owners of tesla âs model s vehicle , but now ceo elon musk has revealed he has a solution
in a tweet he said he would reveal a way to tackle the issue at a conference on thursday , and while no further details are known , it seems the smart money may be on either navigation software that shows the best route to a charging station or an update that boosts the car 's battery power
california - based tesla is to announce a software update on friday
elon musk revealed it would be for the ' entire model s fleet ' in a tweet
this suggests it may be a trick to boost the battery power of the car ( model s pictured in a promotional shot )
others have suggested it could be new turn by turn navigation software in the tweet musk said : â tesla press conf at 9am [ pacific time , 4pm gmt ] on thurs
â about to end range anxiety â¦ via ota software update
â affects entire model s fleet
â running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past
earlier this month ford unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining , it bases its predictions on your unique driving style
the myford mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house
the app was announced at mobile world congress in barcelona and currently works with a selection of ford âs electric and hybrid cars
that elon musk says this is a software update seemingly rules out one theory , namely more of tesla âs â supercharger â stations being added
however , the fact that it affects the entire model s fleet may also pour cold water on the â turn by turn navigation â theory
this is because not every car has the ability to have such a feature , so unless elon musk is planning to upgrade those that are not with new hardware , this may seem unlikely
several outlets have been reporting that the answer may lie in some trickery with the car âs software that can boost the battery power
in a survey for consumer reports in 2012 , 77 per cent of respondents said limited range was their biggest concern with electric cars
the official range of the model s at the moment is up to 310 miles ( 500km ) , which is apparently not enough to quell range anxiety for some drivers
that elon musk says in his tweet ( shown ) this is a software update seemingly rules out one theory , namely more of tesla âs â supercharger â stations being added
however , the fact that it affects the entire model s fleet may also pour cold water on the â turn by turn navigation â theory - as not all the cars have this ability only certain models of tesla 's model s car have the ability to charge their car quickly at the company 's supercharger stations , which tesla lets owners of the model s use for free
however , the stations are quite few and far between , especially in the uk , at the moment cnn noted that , last year , tesla upgraded its tesla roadster electric car , increasing its range from 245 to 400 miles ( 395 to 645km ) on a single charge
this was via a lithium battery pack upgrade and , at the time , elon musk tellingly tweeted : â should mention that a battery pack upgrade is not coming soon for the model s , but it obviously * will * happen long - term
â elon musk has since deleted that tweet , though - perhaps in anticipation of this latest announcement
â elon musk said that all model s cars will get the update - if so , that points to battery optimisations , a power - saving mode or smarter navigation , ' added engadget
software updates to the model s are nât unprecedented , either ; in january , an update increased the speed of the top - of - the - line p85d via use of â insane mode â - enabling the car to go 0 to 60mph ( 97km/h ) in 3.2 seconds , compared to the usual 5.9 seconds
but aside from speculation , there is nât much that can be done except wait to see what exactly elon musk will reveal on friday
