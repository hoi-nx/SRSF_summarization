fa chairman greg dyke will continue on the attack over his homegrown players campaign by taking the controversial issue to the fa council next week
greg dyke will be giving the presentation to councillors that he was unable to make at last week âs premier league meeting
he is looking for big support from the chamber in his battle with the premier league to increase homegrown numbers from eight to 12 players in top - flight squads
greg dyke has also been in combative mood with two other opponents â wales and fifa president sepp blatter
greg dyke speaks to premier league chief richard scudamore ahead of his fa council meeting the fa chairman wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs from eight to 12 speaking at the official wembley function before the lithuania game , greg dyke described them as a small footballing nation who he hoped would not cause as many problems as another â small footballing nation
wales â had been doing
this was a reference to wales opposing a team gb football side at the olympics , david gill âs right to the british vice-presidency on the fifa executive and the arrogant anti-fa slurs from the fa of wales âs loose cannon president trefor lloyd-hughes
greg dyke suggested that gareth bale 's wales were a ' small footballing nation ' causing problems sepp blatter also said that gill âs main target in zurich should be the â little bald chap sitting at the other end of the table â
greg dyke was also in the mood to attack his own organisation â complaining that the vase the fa always gave their wembley visitors as a gift was not the best
an fa spokesman said greg dyke âs speech was meant to be light - hearted and the sensitive faw did not bite for once
' little bald chap ' sepp blatter should be david gill 's first target at fifa , according to greg dyke lt âs hard to see how the fa , who are looking for 15 per cent cuts across the board , can justify the extra expense of booking separate hotels on away trips â one for the england team and key support staff and another for the rest of the fa entourage â especially as they stay in the same accommodation when in england
the twin booking was brought in after the world cup where manager hodgson felt the presence of the fa âs huge travelling party was a distraction on match days
england boss hodgson has asked for separate hotels for the team and entourage on away trips hodgson has confirmed that harry kane will start alongside wayne rooney in tuesday 's friendly with italy however , the post-world cup promise the fa made that england would spent most of their time preparing for matches at Â£ 120million st george âs park in the staffordshire countryside has not materialised
the grove hotel outside watford is still utilised more often because of its proximity to london

but an er2015 spokeswoman claimed there will be more job opportunities posted this week
england rugby 2015 chief executive debbie jevans has departed for ' unexplained personal reasons ' one of debbie jevans âs first acts on arrival in 2012 was to select the england ball at the world cup draw when boris johnson and his advisers had expected him to do so
