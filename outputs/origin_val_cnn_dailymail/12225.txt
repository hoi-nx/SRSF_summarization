latest developments : transponder data shows that the autopilot on germanwings was reprogrammed by someone in the cockpit to change the plane 's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet , according to flightradar24 , a website that tracks aviation data
police searched germanwings co-pilot andreas 's apartment in dusseldorf , germany , on thursday , the city 's police spokesman said in televised comments
a team of five investigators went " through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot 's motivation might have been , if he did indeed bring the plane down , " police spokesman markus niesczery said
full story : the co-pilot of germanwings flight 9525 purposely crashed the plane into the french , killing all 150 people on board , officials said thursday
" we at lufthansa are speechless that this aircraft has been deliberately crashed by the co-pilot , " said spohr , ceo of lufthansa , which owns germanwings
marseille prosecutor robin said the co-pilot , 27 - year - old germany national andreas , apparently " wanted to destroy the aircraft
" it 's unknown whether andreas planned his actions , robin said
but he " took advantage " of a moment in which the pilot left the cockpit and " activated the descent , " which can only be done deliberately
new details released thursday appeared to support the startling revelation that someone set the plane on a crash course
transponder data shows that the autopilot was reprogrammed during the flight by someone inside the cockpit to change the plane 's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet , according to flightradar24 , a website that tracks aviation data
the plane 's cockpit audio recorder captured horrific sounds
the captain , somehow locked out of the cockpit , can be heard banging on the door , robin said
and screaming can be heard on the audio recording for the final few minutes of the flight
for those on board when the plane plunged into the mountains , robin said , death was instantaneous
who was co-pilot andreas ? police searched andreas 's apartment in dusseldorf on thursday , looking for clues about his possible motive
a search is underway for the plane 's second " black box , " the flight data recorder , which could shed more light on the plane 's final minutes
and the french government has asked the fbi to help investigate the crash , a law enforcement official said
investigators so far say they 're baffled about why andreas would have crashed the plane lufthansa does " not have any clues , " spohr said
the picture of the plane 's final minutes comes largely from what was discovered in the mangled cockpit voice recorder
the pilot and co-pilot had normal exchanges during the beginning of the flight , robin said
when the pilot stepped out to go to the bathroom , he asked andreas to take over
it 's unclear whether the pilot entered a code to try to get back into the cockpit when he returned , or whether andreas " put the lever on lock , " which would have prevented the code from working , spohr said
the most plausible explanation of what happened next is that andreas , " through deliberate abstention , refused to open the cabin door ... to the chief pilot , and used the button " to cause the plane to lose altitude , robin said
the disaster is not being described as a " terrorist attack , " and the killing of 150 people would generally not be described as a " suicide " either , robin said
spohr agreed : " if a person kills himself and also 149 other people , another word should be used -- not suicide , " he said
andreas was not known to be on any terrorism list , and his religion was not immediately known , robin said
5 cases of pilots intentionally crashing he had been with germanwings since september 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time , the company said
andreas had trained at the lufthansa flight center in bremen , germany
he only had about 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft he was flying , but he had all the necessary certifications and qualifications to pilot the aircraft alone , the prosecutor said
he had passed medical tests , spohr said
the audio recording showed his breathing to be steady , with no sign that he had a heart attack or other medical issue
lufthansa does not have standard psychological testing for pilots once they are hired , spohr said
the company considers an applicant 's psychological state when hiring , he said
the co-pilot was " fully qualified to pilot the aircraft on his own , " robin said
a man in montabaur , germany , who belonged to the same flight club as andreas , said he could n't believe it
" the way i know andreas , this is inconceivable , " peter ruecker said
an 8 - minute descent to death relatives and friends of the victims traveled on special lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished
seyne - les - alpes , a nearby town , is serving as a staging post
mayor francis hermitte predicted that 200 to 300 people would come to the area thursday
most are not expected to stay overnight , he said
but in case they do , he said , local residents have offered accommodations for them
lufthansa is providing " financial support " to relatives of the victims , spohr said
he declined to go into details
the families of the two pilots are also in france , robin said , but they are not in the same place as the passengers ' relatives
the bodies of the crash victims will not be released to family members until all dna identification work has been done -- a process likely to last several weeks , he said
while some human remains have been recovered , many have not
the task is treacherous for search crews working on steep slopes in icy weather
workers were dropped by helicopters and tied together for safety
