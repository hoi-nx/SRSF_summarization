avian cholera is thought to have killed at least 2,000 snow geese that fell dead from the sky in idaho while migrating to nesting grounds on the northern coast of alaska , wildlife managers said monday
dozens of idaho department ( idfg ) workers and volunteers over the weekend retrieved and incinerated carcasses of snow geese found near bodies of water and a wildlife management area in the eastern part of the state , said agency spokesman gregg losinski
illness ? avian cholera is suspected in the deaths of at least 2,000 snow geese that fell dead from the sky in idaho , like the one seen here avian cholera is believed to be the culprit in the deaths mostly because of the way the birds died , he said
' basically , they just fell out of the sky , ' gregg losinski said
he said biologists were awaiting results from a state wildlife lab to confirm the birds died of the highly contagious disease , which is caused by bacteria that can survive in soil and water for up to four months
humans face a small risk of contracting the disease but the more immediate threat is to wildlife in the vicinity of contaminated carcasses , gregg losinski said
about 20 bald eagles were seen near areas where snow geese carcasses littered the ground but a lengthy incubation period makes it unclear if the eagles were infected and would carry the ailment elsewhere , said gregg losinski
it was not known where the snow geese â named for their white plumage and for breeding in the far northern corners of alaska , canada , greenland and siberia â contracted avian cholera during a migration that saw them wing north from wintering grounds in the american southwest and mexico , he said
outbreaks like the one found affecting the migrating snow geese in idaho occur periodically in the united states and elsewhere , gregg losinski said
loskinki said in a monday news release ' the carcasses of a small number of snow geese were first reported at camas national wildlife refuge near dubois , idaho
closer inspection on friday found higher numbers of dead birds at the mud lake wma area near terreton , idaho and a lesser amount at market lake wma near roberts , idaho
' upper snake regional supervisor schmidt said in the release that avian cholera has appeared before
' outbreaks of avian cholera have occurred sporadically in the region over the past few decades , ' he said
schmidt also said that ' the important thing is to quickly collect as many of the carcasses as possible , to prevent other birds from feeding on the infected birds
' the idfg said anyone who sees dead birds should not touch them , and contact the upper snake regional office by dialing 208 - 525 - 7290
avian cholera is the most important infectious disease affecting wild waterfowl in north america , according to the u.s. geological survey
' death may be so rapid that birds literally fall out of the sky or die while eating with no previous signs of disease , ' the agency said of the disease on its website
' sick birds appear lethargic , and when captured may die within minutes
' it said that infected birds may swim in circles , experience convulsions , swim in circles , fly upside down , exhibit mucous discharge from their mouths , have blood - stained or yellow droppings , and display soiled or matted feathers on parts of the body
