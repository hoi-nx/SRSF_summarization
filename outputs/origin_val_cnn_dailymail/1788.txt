leicester city manager pearson has risked an fa charge after an astonishing blast at â arrogant â referee mike dean
pearson was furious that tottenham were awarded a contentious second - half penalty after nugent and danny rose collided in the area
and the foxes boss let rip at the official after the final whistle , branding mike dean â arrogant â
pearson was incensed by mike dean 's decision to award a penalty and labelled him ' arrogrant ' pearson said : â will i speak to the referee ? what âs the point ? what is the point of talking to him ? he is one of the most arrogant men i have ever met
â the arrogance of the man at times is frightening
i just find it difficult to accept that we have to deal with yet another contentious decision that has not gone our way
the ref gave the controversial penalty after nugent was adjudged to have brought down danny rose â it is two players colliding
nugent will be the first to admit he should have probably dealt with it a little bit earlier
the length of time it took to actually give the decision , and i am led to believe nobody else âs opinion was actually involved
â he took that length of time to decide if two players colliding in the box is a penalty
i really do feel at the moment that we continue to be short - changed
i am not suggesting that it is deliberate but we ca nât be on the receiving end of so many poor decisions
â on the prospect of an fa fine , pearson added : â will the fa look at it ? i do nât know
will they ? â pearson 's side were unlucky to not come away with a point after pushing tottenham all the way
