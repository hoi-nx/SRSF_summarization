andrew smith said the fatal shooting took place in skid row at lunchtime on sunday the shooting in skid row came during a national debate about police use of force after several killings by on - duty police officers
in november rookie cop liang shot dead an unarmed black man , gurley , as they patrolled a housing estate in brooklyn , new york
police claim that liang appeared to accidentally fire a shot when he was about 10 feet from the 28 - year - old without saying a word
prosecutors alleged that liang 's first concern was that he ' was going to be fired ' while mr gurley 's friend fought alone to keep him alive and was forced to find a neighbor to call 911
he has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter
the killings of two unarmed blacks by white police officers in missouri and new york last summer touched off protests over police conduct that intensified after grand juries refused to indict the officers
tensions escalated further after two new york police officers were killed by a man who suggested in online posts that their deaths were in retaliation for the deaths of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , and garner in new york
garner , who was put in a chokehold by an officer , was heard gasping , ' i ca n't breathe ' before he lost consciousness and later died
black teenager brown , 18 , was shot and killed by white officer darren wilson , who claimed he was acting in self - defense
the shooting set off days of racially - charged protests
the violence sunday had echoes of the august shooting by los angeles police of 25 - year - old ezell ford , whose death in a struggle with officers brought demonstrations in the city
ford was unarmed , but police officers said he was shot only after reaching for an officer 's gun

witnesses told the times that the man is known on the street in the area as ' africa , ' and that he had been there for four or five months after spending time in a mental health institute
one witness , jose gil , 38 , told the times he saw the man swinging at police then heard one of them shout , ' he 's got my gun ! ' before the shots were fired
horne , 29 , said the man had been fighting with someone else in his tent before officers arrived
' it 's sad , ' horne said
' there 's no justification to take somebody 's life

tents and cardboard shelters cover the sidewalks of skid row , the downtown neighborhood where an estimated 1,700 homeless people live
many of them struggle with mental illness and addiction
