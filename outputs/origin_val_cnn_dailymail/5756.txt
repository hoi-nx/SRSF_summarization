a deadly al qaeda - linked terror attack on a syrian regime intelligence headquarters yesterday was so massive it measured 2.3 on the richter and registered as an earthquake
at least 20 regime security force members and 14 rebels were killed in the west of aleppo - the largest city in syrian and the frontline in battles between the assad regime , the islamic state , western - backed rebel groups and the al qaeda - affiliated nusra front
the latter group are believed to have carried out yesterday 's attack targeting air force intelligence offices , in which they used a tunnel to detonate bombs , creating an explosion so huge that the european mediterranean seismological centre mistook it for an earthquake
' the goal was to storm the building and to control it , but they failed , ' rami abdel rahman , the director of uk - based observatory monitoring group
six civilians were also killed in separate rebel shelling of regime - controlled areas , he said
the attack began with a huge blast from explosives in a tunnel near the intelligence building , the observatory and a syrian military source said
' gunmen blew up a tunnel that they dug ( into the regime - controlled sector ) and then attacked the area surrounding the air force intelligence headquarters , ' the military source said
journalists in eastern aleppo said the blast was heard across the city
it later emerged that the explosion was so huge that it measured 2.3 on the richter and was registered as an earthquake by the european mediterranean seismological centre

the rebels faced heavy resistance from government troops supported by fighters from lebanese shiite militant group hezbollah , a key backer of assad , it said
the assault was repelled with the help of regime air strikes on rebel positions and the clashes eventually subsided
' dozens of ( rebel ) gunmen were killed in artillery and air strikes
the situation is quiet now in the area
there are minor sporadic clashes , ' the syrian military source said
al qaeda 's affiliate in syrian , nusra front , said on twitter that its forces , along with other rebel factions , had ' stormed the air force intelligence offices and surrounding buildings '
the attack was the worst reported violence in aleppo since the rebels rejected a united nations plan to freeze fighting in the northern city on sunday
united nations envoy staffan de mistura has made the plan for a temporary ceasefire in aleppo the centrepiece of his efforts to bring any kind of halt to the conflict in syrian , where more than 220,000 people have been killed since it erupted in march 2011

he held talks in damascus on saturday to try to finalise a deal , with a delegation member saying he hoped to set in motion as soon as possible a plan to halt fighting in aleppo for six weeks
but rebel representatives refused to consider the proposal unless it forms the basis for a ' comprehensive solution ' to the conflict through the departure of assad
de mistura has angered the opposition by describing assad as ' part of the solution ' to the syrian conflict
some western powers have also cast doubt on the plan , with the france ambassador to the united nations , francois delattre , saying tuesday that ' france remains sceptical about the regime 's willingness ' to follow through on it

' the people are against him , the regional countries are against him and the west is against him , and ( still ) he succeeded , ' assad said , speaking in english
' you 're either lying to us or you 're talking about superman because if you do n't have superman , ( if ) he 's a regular president , it means he could withstand four years only because he has the public support
' wednesday 's attack featured a favoured tactic of syrian 's rebels -- especially in aleppo -- of digging tunnels near government buildings and setting off explosives
fighting in aleppo erupted in mid- 2012 , and control of the city -- once syrian 's commercial hub -- has since been divided between rebels on the eastern side and the regime in the west
the air force intelligence headquarters in aleppo is a key strategic site for regime forces and the surrounding area has come under repeated attack from rebel forces .
