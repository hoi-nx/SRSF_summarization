from rations to ready meals , british âs kitchen cupboards have held the secrets of how we eat over the decades
and in just two and a half months last summer one family of five munched their way from the post-war era to modern times to reveal how dramatically things have changed
the robshaws found the 1950s wholegrain national loaf particularly hard to stomach , and ten - year - old fred was overjoyed when sweets came off the ration
the robshaw family took on a culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in each decade from the 1950s to the 1990s

in the 1950s the children had to wait patiently for their father to finish his dinner , knowing his leftovers would be their supper

the decade also saw the rise of the pot noodle
in the 1980s goats cheese , mange tout and kiwi fruit became the foods to impress your dinner party guests
gourmet dishes and nouvelle cuisine took over from the simple but hearty dishes of earlier decades
by the 1990s , sushi and curry were as popular as traditional english dishes and ready meals became the norm
the programme also shows how fridges , freezers , microwaves and even televisions revolutionised the way the country ate , and how the rise of supermarkets changed shopping forever
the robshaws found that food in the 1970s was brightly - coloured - but perhaps less enticing - than before families began to get a taste for spicier food in the sixties and vesta introduced an early ready meal in the shape of a beef curry
in the same era , cooks could buy ingredients such as garlic and oil from the chemist spaghetti bolognese arrived in the british from italy in the sixties ... and it has n't left british dining tables since mr robshaw , a freelance journalist and children âs writer , said 1950s - style rationing left them feeling hungry all the time and was particularly hard on fred , who â literally danced with joy the day sweets came off the ration â
he went on : â none of us found the national loaf easy to digest
as flour was scarce , it was padded out with potato starch
â when the family entered the 1960s , mr robshaw said â food became fun â thanks to the likes of fish fingers and â it all felt extraordinarily liberating after the austerity of the 1950s â
he added : â it [ the show ] brought home to us all how british food has been revolutionised in an incredibly short time
â throughout the series , in which the family saw not only their menus given an overhaul but also their wardrobes , kitchen and daily routine , they were helped by famous faces including mary berry and hairy biker dave myers
