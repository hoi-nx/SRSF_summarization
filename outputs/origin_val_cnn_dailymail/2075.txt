a conservative party mp has urged his supporters not to ' mention the conservative party or david cameron ' when sending out letters in support of him
gavin barwell , who is fighting the key london marginal of croydon , has asked constituents to sign letters to friends and neighbours supporting his re-election
but mr gavin barwell was left red - faced after it emerged he sent out ' sample ' letters designed to make it look like they were written by ordinary constituents
gavin barwell , who is fighting the key london marginal of croydon , has asked constituents to sign letters to friends and neighbours supporting his re-election the letters , seen by the standard , all appeared to be written in exactly the same style
they were full of similar phrases â with each beginning with ' dear neighbour ' and went on to describe an incident where mr gavin barwell helped them
they often ended with the phrase : ' i really ca n't recommend gavin barwell strongly enough
' in a letter to constituents asking them to endorse him , mr gavin barwell writes : ' i 'm not asking you to write a political letter â in fact , it 'll be much more effective if it does n't mention the conservative party or david cameron
' asked if he or his team wrote the sample letters , he said : ' people write their own letters , i 've not written anything
these are genuine constituents that we have helped who wanted to write a letter
i think in one case we helped with the drafting
they are not fake letters
' ' i 'm therefore writing to ask if you would be prepared to write to people in your neighbourhood saying why you think i am a good local mp
' one labour mp compared his letter with the bungling fawlty towers manager basil fawlty telling staff ' do n't mention the war ' in front of german guests
mr gavin barwell has urged his supporters not to ' mention the conservative party or david cameron ' when sending out letters in support of him labour mp stephen pound mocked : ' it 's a case of ' do n't mention the tories ! ' mr gavin barwell insisted he just did not want the endorsements to be too political and that he had put mr david cameron on his own leaflets
he said : ' the purpose is not to send political letters
the purpose of the letters is a personal endorsement of my work as mp
' my own election leaflets will be full of mentions of both david cameron and the conservative party
' these letters are different
they are from ordinary people telling their story
i do n't think people doing that will be comfortable making party political points
' but sarah jones , the labour candidate for croydon central , told the standard : ' it 's a sign of real desperation that gavin barwell is actively telling people not to call him a conservative party
he 's trying to pull the wool over people 's eyes
' if people were wondering if the conservative party brand had become toxic in croydon , he 's the proof you need
' however hard he tries , he ca n't run away from his voting record â voting for deep cuts , privatisation of the nhs , the bedroom tax and trebling tuition fees
