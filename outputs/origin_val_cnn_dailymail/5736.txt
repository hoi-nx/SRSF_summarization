when i signed for the newly - formed mls side i really wanted to score their first goal

i received the ball from massimo ambrosini 10 yards inside their half on the left as we broke from our own penalty area
i just kept running with the ball past one player , then another , then one more on the edge of the fenerbahce box before finishing low under volkan demirel
kaka is congratulated by his team - mate andriy shevchenko after scoring a brilliant goal against fenerbahce 3 ) brazil 4 - 1 argentina , confederations cup final at the waldstadion , june 2005 cicinho switched the ball from the right side of the pitch to robinho on the left
he controlled it with his chest and passed to me on the edge of the box
i took one touch to tame the ball then curled a shot into the top right corner
to do it in a confederations cup final was special
kaka bends the ball into the top corner to help brazil to a convincing win against rivals argentina in 2005 2 ) brazil 3 - 0 argentina , friendly at the emirates stadium , september 2006 it was late in the game and the ball came out from an argentina corner
i managed to steal the ball from lionel messi and started running at full speed with the ball
he chased me all the way , but i kept ahead of him , ran past gabriel milito then finished low past roberto abbondanzieri
pablo zabaleta could nât stop it going over the line , however hard he tried
kaka finishes with aplomb past argentina keeper roberto abbondanzieri at the emirates stadium in 2006 1 ) manchester united 3 - 2 ac milan , champions league semi-final at old trafford , april 2007 as i said in my interview , my second goal in the champions league semi-final first leg against manchester united was a highlight of my career

to do it at old trafford , with all the history of the stadium , was amazing
