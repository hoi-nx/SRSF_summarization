an unusual time - lapse video made by a washington , d.c. nonprofit fundraiser and his friends shows former secretary of state hillary clinton aging from her teen years to the present
calculating clinton , 67 , is the presumptive democratic white house front - runner and would be 69 years and 86 days old if she were to become president after the 2016 elections
that would make her the second - oldest chief executive to move into the white house behind only ronald reagan , who took office 17 days before he turned 70
' i will not exploit , for political purposes , my opponent 's youth and inexperience , ' he said during a memorable debate
the new video , from a trio calling themselves the ' calculating clinton ' project , shows mrs. hillary clinton in 28 separate photos , each morphing into the next at 2 - second intervals
one of the project 's creators told daily mail online that his partners include a social media executive and a professional videographer
' i do n't think her age disqualifies her from becoming president , but her politics and tactics are definitely relics of the 90s
' he said , requesting anonymity because his job does n't involve partisan politicking
' our video is simply an exercise in branding
we have no money behind us , ' he added , calling the effort ' just three young professionals interested in reaching people using nontraditional tactics and messages that break through the noise and stick with people
' he said there will be more videos hitting the project 's youtube page if mrs. hillary clinton takes the plunge and runs for president
there 's no indication most americans today believe age should be a disqualifying factor for a presidential run
one poll even indicates calculating clinton has hid hers well
a pew survey released a year ago found that ' the public tends to underestimate hillary clinton âs age , ' with 60 being the median guess
a whopping 53 per cent of young voters , those under age 30 , told pew 's pollsters that mrs. hillary clinton was in her 50s
another 16 per cent said she was younger than 50
age perceptions appeared to be the least of her problems on tuesday

mrs. hillary clinton told them that she had used only a personal email account hosted on a private server during her four years as secretary of state
she also said more than 30,000 personal emails were deleted , none of them vetted by the state department for materials subject to the federal records act
that law requires public servants to preserve an archive of all communications related in any way to their jobs
calculating clinton , who has been an attorney , the first lady of arkansas and the americans , a americans senator and americans 's top diplomat , is expected to make a decision on running for president â or staying on the sidelines â next month

harry s. truman : 60 years , 339 days source : ' the presidents of the united states of america ' by frank freidel and hugh sidey the grueling schedule of a white house run could take its toll no matter how fit mrs. hillary clinton is , according to national journal columnist cook
' in secretary calculating clinton 's last year at her post , particularly the last few months at the state department , the position clearly took a toll on her health ; she experienced an episode of fainting or passing out , and suffered a head injury , ' cook wrote last month
' none of this necessarily is to argue against her running , but she would be undertaking something that , as she well knows , is considerably more physically demanding even than her previous position , and at an older age
' however history unfolds , the new time - lapse video 's soundtrack seems to describe the inevitable outcome of the 2016 campaign just right
' when the band stops playing , ' a soulful singer intones on the video 's backing track , ' only one will be left dancing in the round ' â or in this case , in the oval .
