tampa police have arrested a pair of teenagers in last week 's shooting of a young pit bull mix that was left for dead
the 17 - year - olds face aggravated animal cruelty and armed trespassing charges after tying the hound , now named cabela , to railroad tracks and shooting her multiple times
surveillance video from the area showed a group of individuals walking the dog along the tracks in the city 's sulphur springs neighborhood before later running away , said detective messmer
neighbors heard gunshots and police were called
cabela was purchased to be used in dog fighting , but she was n't any good at it so they wanted to get rid of her , according to messmer
" this appears to be an isolated incident , " he said
" it does n't appear that there was a large amount of dog fighting that goes on in the neighborhood
" on march 5 , police found cabela tightly tied to the tracks and shot three times -- twice in the neck and once in the shoulder
" nothing gets you ready ... to see a dog -- a helpless animal -- tied so tight to a railroad track around the neck that it 's literally pinned down , " said sgt. rich mills , who freed her
" she was literally pinned down
she could not get away even if she tried
" once freed , mills rushed cabela to tampa bay veterinary emergency center
initially , it was thought the young dog would have to her right front leg amputated because the damage was so severe , but a metal rod was inserted and she 's recovering
in fact , cabela 's already walking on her repaired leg
rehabilitation will take four to six weeks , according to dr. davidson
