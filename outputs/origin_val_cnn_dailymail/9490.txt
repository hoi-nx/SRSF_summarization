a prosecutor who sent an innocent man to death row for 30 years has apologized to him and admitted he was more interested in winning the case than achieving justice
attorney a.m. ' stroud , from shreveport , louisiana , admitted that he was to blame for putting father - of - four ford behind bars in 1984 for the fatal shooting of a jeweler
' in 1984 , i was 33 years old , ' he wrote in a letter to the shreveport times
' i was arrogant , judgmental , narcissistic and very full of myself
i was not as interested in justice as i was in winning
' ford , now 65 , was released from the prison in angola in march 2014 but last month , he learned he has stage four lung cancer and just four to eight months left to live
in his letter , stroud , 63 , slammed the decision
' ford should be completely compensated to every extent possible because of the flaws of a system that effectively destroyed his life , ' stroud said
' the audacity of the state 's effort to deny mr. ford any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of louisiana justice is appalling
' ford was accused of shooting rozeman , a shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom mr ford had done occasional yard work , in 1983 and was convicted the following year
he was sent to prison , where he lived with little light or heat , while stroud , who had been with the caddo district attorney 's office for two years , went out to celebrate by having drinks with his team
' that 's sick , ' he said in his letter
' i had been entrusted with the duty to seek the death of a fellow human being , a very solemn task that certainly did not warrant any " celebration "
' from behind bars , ford continued to protest his innocence
ford , now 65 , was convicted of an 1983 murder but was released a year ago after evidence showed he was not at the scene
he has since been diagnosed with cancer and has four to eight months to live then in 2013 , state district judge ramona emanuel voided the conviction and sentence based on the new information that corroborated his claim he was not present or involved in rozeman 's death
' my fault was that i was too passive , ' stroud said in his letter
' had i been more inquisitive , perhaps the evidence would have come to light years ago ... wrongly accused : ford , a father - of - four ( pictured in a booking photo ) , was sent to death row in 1984 ' i did not hide evidence , i simply did not seriously consider that sufficient information may have been out there that could have led to a different conclusion
and that omission is on me
' stroud said he still does not know the extent of the new information that led to ford 's release
but he added that the odds were stacked against ford , whose attorneys were inexperienced in criminal law
he also faced an all - white jury
in light of the new evidence , stroud said he realized how wrong he had been
' i speak only for me and no one else , ' he said
' i apologize to ford for all the misery i have caused him and his family
i apologize to the family of mr. rozeman for giving them the false hope of some closure
' in a separate interview with the shreveport times , stroud again called for ford to be compensated and for the ' barbaric ' death penalty to be abolished
ford walked free from angola in angola on march 11 , 2014 , wearing a jean jacket , sweater and beanie hat and carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes
as he walked out of the prison gates , he said he was sad he had not been around to raise his now - adult sons , but added : ' it feels good ; my mind is going in all kind of directions
' freed : ford is pictured in march 2014 as he was freed from the state prison following 30 years behind bars
he was given just $ 20 but was taken in by a non-profit group who found a free place for him to stay prison officials gave the then - 64 - year - old a debit card worth just $ 20
that , along with the money that he had in his bank account , left mr ford with a paltry $ 20.04 to his name
his lawyers set up an amazon wishlist for strangers to donate funds and items - from furniture to clothing - so ford could start to re-build his life
with the help of a non-profit group , resurrection after exoneration , he had a place to live free of charge and has since moved to his own apartment
he relies on social security disability and food stamps , and has also visited california to see his four sons
he has also filed separate federal lawsuits claiming he was wrongfully imprisoned and was denied medical care following his cancer diagnosis
he names numerous prison guards and prison doctors for ignoring his condition and says his poor living conditions , including contact with sewage and asbestos , contributed to his illness
after he left prison , he learned he had stage 3 lung cancer , which has now progressed to stage 4
making the days count : ford , pictured last month , relies on social security disability and food stamps
he is suing the state for denying him medical care for his lung cancer , which is now terminal ' i 'm trying to make every day count , ' he told the shreveport times from his home in new orleans after learning he had just months to live
he said if he does get awarded any money , he plans to leave it to his grandchildren
he said he has between 17 and 21 - but could not be sure how many
of his situation , he said : ' i do n't have no anger
i have anger that i have cancer
i have resentment angola allowed this to happen
i guess everything is for a reason
i really do n't know
' louisiana department of public safety and corrections spokeswoman pam laborde told the times-picayune that she could not comment due to pending litigation and privacy issues
no one has been charged with rozeman 's death
three men had also initially been arrested in the crime but were ultimately released because of insufficient evidence
two of the men have since been indicted in other murders .
