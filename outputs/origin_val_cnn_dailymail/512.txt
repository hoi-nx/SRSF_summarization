the predictions come as forbes released its billionaires list this week with gates - who is widely expected to become the world 's first trillionaire - at the top with a worth of $ 79.2 billion
if the u.s. national wealth continues to grow at its current rate , gates , who saw his fortune grow by $ 4.2 billion in the past year alone , could well reach the eye - watering figure in his old age
among those who believe a trillionaire is only years away , entrepreneur peter diamandis says he believes the wealth could be earned through space discoveries , the washington times reported
could he be the first ? microsoft 's gates topped forbes ' billionaire list earlier this week and he could well be the first person to become a trillionaire

international investment bank credit suisse has previously said in an annual global wealth report that there will be 11 trillionaires within two generations
' two generations ahead , future extrapolation of current wealth growth rates yields almost a billion millionaires , equivalent to 20 per cent of the total adult population , ' the bank said in 2013
