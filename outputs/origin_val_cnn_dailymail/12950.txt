everyone 's favorite male models made a surprise appearance at tuesday 's valentino show at paris fashion week
and , no surprise , they were really , really ridiculously good - looking
ben stiller and owen wilson reprised their roles as the vacuous models from the popular 2001 film " zoolander " at tuesday 's women 's couture show
there was no mistaking ben stiller for anyone other than the fierce zoolander 2 as he sashayed down the runway in a valentino trench , casting blue steel in every direction
he was followed by nemesis hansel mcdonald , played by owen wilson , showing off another valentino coat over a pair of " lovely " pajamas , wall street journalist fashion columnist christina binkley said
the duo is gearing up for " zoolander 2 , " which is slated for release in february 2016
" apparently derek and hansel mcdonald have come to terms on # zoolander2 , " ben stiller joked in a selfie posted on his instagram account
publicity stunt , perhaps , but we 're not complaining about an opportunity to bring back the phrase , " he 's so hot right now
