for dundee united and celtic , the trilogy becomes a quadrilogy
already facing each other three times in three competitions at three different venues across the third month of the year , one final blast of beleaguered referee thomson âs whistle at tannadice ensured yet another instalment of this saga
in the movie business , each successive film in a franchise tends to be markedly poorer than its predecessor
and as the dust settled on this breathtaking and at times bewildering contest of almost incessant controversy , the suspicion lingered that nothing that lies ahead in march could possibly match this blockbuster for drama , action and utter high farce
for on an astonishing william hill scottish cup afternoon on tayside , nine - man dundee united fought to a valiant 1 - 1 draw against their 10 - man visitors
this was a game scarred by two early red cards , ultimately three in total , but , in truth , there could have been five
one , dished out to the luckless paul paton , was a monumentally unjust case of mistaken identity
leigh griffiths wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1 - 1 draw with dundee united celtic defender virgil van dijk ( right ) was sent off after only nine minutes of the william hill scottish cup quarter - final in a case of mistaken identity , the referee also sent off dundee united 's paul paton adding to the scandal , nadir ciftci , the dundee united striker who opened the scoring from the spot after team - mate connolly appeared to dive to win a penalty , should not have been on the park at all after kicking out at scott brown
the celtic captain was , himself , lucky to escape red for a quite awful challenge on the turkish forward in the first place
and even after all that drama there was still room to plot in a villain - to - hero story , as leigh griffiths missed a penalty then scored an equaliser to break the heart of outstanding dundee united keeper cierzniak
leigh griffiths â beautiful header secured a replay at parkhead on march 18 â the second of three games in a week between the teams â although the celtic striker may now relinquish penalty duties
â i had the chance to get us back in it with the penalty but he saved it , â said leigh griffiths
â i âd been practising in training all day yesterday [ saturday ] and never missed a single one
i apologised to the fans because i never scored
it was my fault and if kris commons is back in the team next week he will be back on them because he âs no1 penalty taker
but if not i will put my hand up to take one because i am always confident
â their goalie âs had one of those games , he saved everything we threw at him
i hope he âs not in that form in the final next week or we could be in trouble
but it was nice that i picked myself up to score
' the referee points to the spot after connolly was brought down in the celtic box celtic keeper gordon fails to stop nadir ciftci from giving dundee united the lead dundee united 's nadir ciftci celebrates scoring the opening goal with a penalty the tone for a bizarre afternoon was set on nine minutes when scott brown went in hard on ciftci
he retaliated with a kick towards the celtic skipper âs head
in the same melee , butcher slid into virgil van dijk , who appeared to stamp down on the dundee united man as the pair tangled on the ground
and yet , after a three - minute discussion between referee thomson and his assistant graham chambers , red cards were issued to virgil van dijk and , astonishingly , the apparently blameless paul paton instead of butcher
as he trudged off , paul paton âs face was the picture of incredulity
this season he has already been banned for two games for allegedly spitting at aberdeen âs johnny hayes â despite his â victim â protesting that paul paton was innocent
paul paton recently insisted he was the victim of unfair treatment from the sfa because he elected to play for northern ireland over scotland
that , of course , remains a nonsense but he was right to feel aggrieved
as half - time approached , dundee united nearly took the lead when butcher âs mis - hit shot was diverted past gordon by ryan dow but the ball bounced back off the inside of the post and was hacked away to safety
then , after a lighting break , celtic raced up to the other end and great play from stefan johansen saw him cleverly slip the ball in for stokes
the forward was clean through on goal , and took two touches before picking his spot
unfortunately for him , however , the spot he chose was the bottom left post and the ball was cleared by dundee united âs relieved defence
whether or not the ball took a bobble on the pitch , only stokes will know , but it looked a real sitter
worse was to come for the irishman when young connolly drove at the celtic defence and appeared to throw himself to the ground with stokes nearby
dundee united have a second player sent off after paul dixon ( 3rd left ) receives his marching orders leigh griffiths missed his chance to equalise for celtic from the penalty spot it looked a dive but nadir ciftci did nât care about that as he ruthlessly cracked his spot kick low and hard beyond the diving gordon
as the teams left the park at half - time emilio izaguirre was furious at the award of the spot kick
but it was the honduran âs misplaced clearance into the path of connolly that had put his team under pressure in the first place
it was a crazy conclusion to the first half but the second period immediately brought fresh madness
within three minutes , dundee united were down to nine men when leigh griffiths â shot struck paul dixon on the arm as the dundee united defender attempted to block
leigh griffiths caught the ball well but dundee united goalkeeper cierzniak , so often criticised , pulled off a wonderful save to prevent celtic levelling
with dundee united moving to a 5 - 3 - 0 formation , it was like the alamo at times but there were great saves to come from cierzniak - from both stokes and substitute john guidetti
leigh griffiths makes up for his penalty miss by drawing celtic level with a header celtic captain scott brown celebrates with leigh griffiths as the game finishes in a 1 - 1 draw despite the one - way traffic , however , gordon had to look lively to stop butcher scoring on a rare dundee united counter
just as it looked like celtic âs treble dreams could come unstuck on an unacceptably poor tannadice pitch , leigh griffiths gained his redemption
running on to stefan johansen âs beautifully - flighted ball , he nodded expertly beyond cierzniak
from then on in , dundee united nine men battled valiantly to remain in the hunt for a semi-final spot
â it will be a tough game at hampden against inverness or raith , â nodded leigh griffiths after the draw was made
â either side will make it hard for us - but that âs only if we get through by finishing the job at parkhead
but we know dundee united will make it tough for us
â at the end of a quite thrilling encounter , dundee united had sent out a clear message ahead of the sequel , next sunday âs league cup final at hampden
