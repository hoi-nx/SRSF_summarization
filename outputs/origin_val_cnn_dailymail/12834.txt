cabela 's not a cat , but the young pit bull mix apparently had a few lives to spare
tampa police found her shot and bleeding , tied to a set of railroad tracks in the city 's sulphur springs neighborhood on wednesday
folks called after they heard someone fire a gun
cabela was hit by three shots -- two to the neck and one to the shoulder
officers freed the pup from the tracks and rushed her to tampa bay veterinary emergency center , where dr. davidson and staff stabilized and named her
the dog will have to have her front right leg removed because of the damage from the gunshots , but should be rehabilitated within a week , the vet said
" dogs rebound quick , " said davidson , adding cabela is in great spirits
" really , after everything that this dog has gone through ... she 's the sweetest , " she said
" i mean she 's not angry with people
she 's been really really good
" the cost of cabela 's treatment will run several thousands dollars , but will be picked up by the clinic
once she 's healthy , cabela will be spayed , vaccinated and set up for adoption , where she will be paired with a " good family , " davidson said .
