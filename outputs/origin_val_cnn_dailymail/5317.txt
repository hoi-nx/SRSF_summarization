clinton has been accused of deleting all her emails while under subpoena
the allegation , leveled by a republican chairman for a house committee on benghazi , is the latest in a series of claims that are hammering the former first lady 's reputation as 2016 approaches
in a letter released on friday night , rep gowdy , r-s.c. , said the former secretary of state has failed to produce a single new document in recent weeks and has refused to relinquish her server to a third party for an independent review
clinton 's attorney , kendall , rubbished the claims
the benghazi committee demanded further documents and access to the server after it was revealed that clinton used a private email account and server during her tenure at state
house speaker john boehner has not ruled out a vote in the full house to force clinton to turn over the server if she declines to make it available by gowdy 's april 3 deadline
in a six - page letter released late on friday , kendall defended clinton , saying she had turned over all work - related emails to the state department
that included everything sent or received during her tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013
' the state department is therefore in possession of all secretary clinton 's work - related emails from the ( personal email ) account , ' kendall wrote
kendall also said it would be pointless for clinton to turn over her server , even if legally authorized , since ' no emails ... reside on the server or on any backup systems associated with the server
' rep. cummings of maryland , the top democrat on the benghazi panel , said kendall 's letter confirmed ' what we all knew : that clinton already produced her official records to the state department , that she did not keep her personal emails and that the select committee has already obtained her emails relating to the attacks in benghazi
' dispute : the claims come as the former secretary of state defends her use of a private email system no take two ? analysts warn the saga could have a devastating affect on clinton 's approval ratings before the 2016 presidential race , which could hamper her chances of a second white house stint with husband bill cummings said it is time for gowdy and other republican to stop what he called a ' political charade ' and instead make clinton 's emails public
gowdy also should schedule clinton 's public testimony before the benghazi panel as soon as possible , cummings said
kendall said in his letter that clinton 's personal attorneys reviewed every email sent and received from her private email address â 62,320 emails in total â and identified all work - related emails
those totaled 30,490 emails or approximately 55,000 pages
the material was provided to the state department on december 5 , 2014 , and it is the agency 's discretion to release those emails after a review
kendall said clinton has asked for the release of all of those emails
he said the state department is reviewing the material to decide whether any sensitive information needs to be protected
' clinton is not in a position to produce any of those emails to the committee in response to the subpoena without approval from the state department , which could come only following a review process , ' kendall wrote
gowdy said he was disappointed at clinton 's lack of cooperation
' not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record , she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server , ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest , ' he said
in a statement released later friday , clinton spokesman nick merrill said she ' would like her emails made public as soon as possible and ... she 's ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the american public
