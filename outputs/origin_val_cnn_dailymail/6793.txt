israel coach guttman has claimed bale cares more about wales than real madrid ahead of his side 's crunch euro 2016 qualifier against the dragons
guttman 's astonishing claim comes on the back of real madrid 's dramatic slump in form and Â£ 85.3million world record signing bale being booed by his own fans at the bernabeu
the european champions suffered their fifth defeat of 2015 when they lost 4 - 3 at home to german side schalke on tuesday night , and although that was enough for real madrid to progress to the quarter - finals of the champions league 5 - 4 on aggregate , it did not spare the players from the wrath of angry madridistas
bale endured a frustrating evening on tuesday night but real madrid still qualified for the quarter - finals fans waved white handerkerchiefs - the traditional symbol of disgust at a bad performance - with bale once again made the scapegoat for real madrid 's problems
bale was branded selfish and castigated in the real madrid media after choosing to shoot rather than pass to ronaldo and karim benzema against espanyol in january and the welshman has since suffered a dip in form with no goals or assists in his last eight games
and now guttman has added fuel to the fire by insisting bale is saving his best for wales ' visit to israel on march 28 , when the top two sides in group b meet in haifa
bale celebrates scoring a late winner for wales against andorra back in september last year israel coach guttman ( right ) believes bale ( left ) cares more for playing for his country than real madrid ' i feel that bale is saving himself for the national team , ' guttman told sports.walla.co.il
' the level of the miles he does and the level of his commitment to the national team is nothing like how he plays for real madrid
' when they had a player injured [ george williams , who revealed he is out for six months after requiring knee ligament surgery ] bale was the first to [ tweet ] ' get well soon '
' they are like us , they are one group , but bale is the one that gives them balance
' the welshman , playing against schalke on tuesday , has struggled for form in recent weeks for real madrid cristiano roanldo scored twice as the champions league holders advanced 5 - 4 on aggregate on tuesday israel and wales are the early surprise front - runners in group b , with guttman 's leaders having won their opening three games against cyprus , andorra and bosnia-herzegovina
second - placed wales are a point behind israel and unbeaten after four games , and confidence is high in chris coleman 's squad after the goalless draw against group favourites belgium in brussels in november
guttman admits that stopping bale is key to israel staying top of the section , but he takes heart from keeping the welshman 's real madrid team - mate ronaldo off the scoresheet in a 3 - 3 draw in tel aviv two years ago
real madrid fans were pictured waving handkerchiefs after the final whistle against schalke on tuesday in that 2014 world cup qualifier , only an injury - time equaliser from portugal full - back fabio coentrao prevented israel from recording a famous victory
' i remember how sheran yeini [ maccabi tel aviv midfielder ] was able to stop ronaldo
' whenever ronaldo was on the side of the pitch , somebody else guarded him
' we have to be close and do n't let bale empty space
if we wo n't do it , it will kill us
