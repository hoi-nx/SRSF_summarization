cameron reacted angrily to a conservatives minister 's warning against banning hate preachers cameron reacted with fury after a conservatives minister warned against banning radical preachers from universities during a fiery cabinet meeting , it has been revealed
the prime minister ' jumped on ' the universities minister clark after he spoke out against home office plans to force universities to ban non-violent ' extremists ' , sources said
mr cameron was backed up by the home secretary theresa may and communities secretary eric pickles
the extraordinary row comes after it emerged mrs may is at loggerheads with the lib dem business secretary vince cable over the issue
the home office wants all campuses to become no - go zones for all ' extremist ' speakers to prevent students becoming radicalised
but mr vince cable insists that the move could force debates ' underground ' , where extreme views will go unchallenged
last month 's cabinet row suggests the issue is dividing the conservatives as well as the coalition
the issue has come to the fore after the unmasking of mohammed emwazi â a university of westminster graduate thought to be the isis executioner known as jihadi john
westminster was named in a 2009 report as having invited three hate preachers to give a talk in 2006 , and just days before mohammed emwazi 's identity was revealed , thousands signed a petition to block an event where an anti-gay figure was due to speak
former students at the university have claimed it is a ' hotbed of radicalism ' where students ' celebrated 9/11 '
westminster pupil raheem kassam , who campaigns against extremism at british universities , said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like mohammed emwazi
new laws passed by the government put a legal requirement on universities to prevent terrorism
mrs may insists this should include barring people with extreme views from speaking on campus
but mr vince cable , who is responsible for university policy , warns a blanket ban on radical preachers could backfire
' if the default option is to ban outright , there is a chance the debate will happen anyway outside the campus in an uncontrolled ' underground ' environment , with no challenge to extreme views at all
' but mrs may said : ' if colleges and universities did n't realise before what we are up against , they should know now
we 're not talking about regulating legitimate debate â we 're saying they need to do more to stop radicalisation on campus
' since news of emwazi 's connection with isis in syria broke , the university of westminster 's is has distanced itself from having any involvement
mohammed emwazi - the islamic state militant known as ' jihadi john ' - studied at the university of westminster conservatives party chairman grant mr shapps accused the liberal democrat of blocking attempts to crack down on radicalisation
he said : ' yes there is a difference of opinion
vince cable does n't want to do what conservatives want to do which is that on campus we do n't want radical preachers saying things which incite violence which ultimately can lead to the radicalisation of young people
' we have seen these three girls go off to syria , we have seen jihadi john , we do n't want think that sort of preaching should happen in our universities
' i 'm afraid to say that conservatives just have a simple view that people in vince cable 's constituency of twickenham or around the country deserve that protection and that means we have to put proper , decent , tough rules in place which do n't ban free speech but do stop people from preaching death
' the university of westminster has hit back at claims it is a fertile breeding ground for is fundamentalism as arguments rage over who is to blame over jihadi john
kuwait - born londoner emwazi had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the british authorities but was nonetheless able to travel to syria in 2013 and join a group responsible for the murder of several western hostages
responding to claims from a fellow former student that the university allowed extremism , a spokesman for the institution said : ' we condemn the promotion of radicalisation , terrorism and violence or threats against any member of our community
' we have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community , who come to study from over 150 nations
' there was also a renewed suggestion - from a former independent reviewer of government anti-terror laws - that mohammed emwazi might have been prevented from joining up with is had restrictions on suspects not been relaxed
' had control orders been in place , in my view there is a realistic prospect that mohammed emwazi , and at least two of his associates , would have been the subject of control orders with a compulsory relocation , ' lord carlile said
' if that had been the case , he would not have done what he 's done in recent times , ' the liberal democrat peer added .
