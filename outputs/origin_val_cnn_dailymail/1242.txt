their plight was summed up on the whistle
after a game millwall just had to win in order to retain any hope of survival , the supporters warmly applauded as they trudged off
the fans realise what dreadful circumstances interim manager neil harris has pitched up in
it was better but ultimately not enough
the lions looked every bit a side to have scored just three goals in their previous eight games ; plenty of huff , but very little puff
had brighton âs bennett not crashed the bar from 25 yards and later blazed wildly over , it might âve been worse
millwall now look consigned to relegation and upbeat neil harris will treat the remaining eight fixtures as an audition for when the club make a permanent decision on holloway âs successor in the summer

â the support they gave was absolutely terrific
we âre just trying to give them the belief , to get the fans back onside
â neil harris believes this is already a side the fans can identify with again after disaffection under holloway
â i was nât always the best player on the pitch here but i played with my heart on my sleeve , â he added
â we maybe lacked a little bit of creativity in the final third and we âre searching for a goal to kickstart us
â the league table does nât lie - games are running out
you have to start somewhere
we need to add to that
â we âre in a difficult position but we âve got games to win
â this is nât fair on the young boss
it could well be a case of right job , wrong time for the man who âs adopted the club for which he appeared in the 2004 fa cup final and who stood right behind him when beating testicular cancer

these were small steps in a mission to rejuvenate themselves , and something chris hughton has noted
â they started well , â the brighton boss said
they âve got a very good club man in the job at the moment
â respect means neil harris wo nât be implicated in the probable relegation , and for now he âs just intent on putting smiles back on some faces
