her departure came just months after she was moved from a key counter-terror role at the met police
the controversial 54 - year - old was in charge of specialist operations , including counter-terrorism , between july 2011 and summer 2014
however , scotland yard chief sir bernard moved her to specialist crime and operations for the last few months of her career â stripping her of counter-terror responsibilities
ms cressida dick was appointed assistant commissioner at the force in 2009 - 26 years after joining the met police in 1983
she was in charge of the operation which led to mr de menezes being shot seven times in the head in 2005 after being mistaken for a suicide bomber
she gave evidence at an old bailey trial and the inquest in 2013 , coming close to tears as she described the ' horrible '' and ' terrible ' tragedy
she denied that she gave an order that mr de menezes must be stopped from getting on to a train at stockwell station ' at all costs ' and also denied instructing the firearms teams to use lethal force to stop him

ms cressida dick gave the order to ' stop ' mr de menezes at stockwell station after it was feared that he was one of four men who had tried to bomb the tube the day before
the 27 - year - old electrician was shot dead on july 22 , 2005 , after anti-terror police mistook him for bomber hussain osman
ms cressida dick , who was later promoted to the deputy assistant commissioner , told his inquest that the innocent brazilian was the victim of a series of ' unfortunate ' coincidences

the innocent brazilian was shot by anti-terror police in july , 2005 when asked what went wrong , ms cressida dick said it was a series of ' unfortunate ' coincidences
she said : ' if you ask me whether anybody did anything wrong or unreasonable in the operation , i do n't think they did
' officers followed mr de menezes when he left his flat in tulse hill , south london - thinking he could be suspect hussain osman , who lived in the same block - but were not able to positively identify him
he was shot seven times in the head as he boarded a train at stockwell station after ms cressida dick gave the order to ' stop ' him as he entered the tube
during his inquest , she denied giving an order that mr de menezes must be stopped from getting on a train ' at all costs ' or instructing the firearms teams to use lethal force to stop him
' i would need to be absolutely satisfied that this person posed a dreadful imminent threat before i would order a critical shot , ' she said
' i was asking for what you might call a conventional challenge from the firearms officers
' the inquest by jury later found the met police guilty of health and safety failings over its bungled operation but no officer faced criminal charges .
