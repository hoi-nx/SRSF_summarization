logan , left , pictured with her former rugby international husband kenny , right , shamed a twitter troll who told her to go back to the kitchen her father was an international footballer and she is married to a former rugby star
so when a troll tweeted that she should be a housewife rather than a tv sports presenter , logan was on safe ground hitting back
she promptly named and shamed the man who described her a â f * * * ing geezer bird â â and was swamped with praise by her followers
yesterday mrs logan , 41 , retweeted the sexist message , which appeared to have been sent to her by a web designer named glen hughes
it appears he hurled his abuse after mrs logan tweeted her thoughts about football
writing using the twitter handle @ glenweblondon he said : â who asked your opinion f * * * * * * geezer bird get back to kitchen â this is freelance web designer and latent feminist glen â
within minutes , scores of mrs logan âs 372,000 followers had applauded her for drawing attention to the troll , who has since deleted his profile
among them was alice arnold , partner of fellow bbc presenter clare balding , who wrote : â name and shame logan ! ! good on you
â mrs logan , whose father terry yorath was a welsh international footballer and was part of the presenting team covering the world cup in brazil , replied : â occasionally you just need to deliver a little upper cut for your own sanity do nât you think ? â and hundreds of other twitter users offered their support to mrs logan , with one writing : â logan you are great , do nât worry about these silly people who do nât think before they speak
others pledged to avoid working with the designer , including one who tweeted : â any of my suppliers who use @ glenweblondon will lose business
â another posted : â good luck with your female colleagues tomorrow
learn a bit of class from logan
â last night vivienne pattison of campaign group mediawatch-uk said : â i âm really pleased that she âs in a position to be able to fight back about it
we hear lots of stories about people not in that position and some of them end really tragically
we are still navigating our way through the challenges that social media present but actually being abusive like that on twitter is no different to publishing it anywhere else
he clearly should have thought twice before pressing the button that says publish , because that is exactly what he âs done
â it is not the first time mrs logan , who is the wife of former scotland rugby star kenny logan , has used social media to name and shame a troll
last month she shared a sexist remark from @ garywall001 , which read : @ gabbylogan you âre s * * * on match of the day [ match of the day ] get some ironing done , â and wrote : â the thing is i am a woman so i can do both
â in the past she has also voiced annoyance to be repeatedly asked â who is looking after the children â
mrs logan , who is mother two nine - year - old twins reuben and lois , told essentials magazine : â people still think it âs a woman âs responsibility to organise everything
when i was away , some of the mums at school asked kenny how he was coping
no one asked me that when he was working in australia last year
i âm often asked who âs looking after the children when i âm away , yet my male colleagues are nât
â mrs logan âs twitter came after international women âs day was celebrated on sunday
earlier this month she hosted a discussion at breakfast networking event for the campaign , in aid of the domestic violence charity refuge
logan , left , pictured with her father , former welsh international terry yorath , said she needed to respond to the insulting tweet ' to deliver a little upper cut for your own sanity do nât you think ? â
