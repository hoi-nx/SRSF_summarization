' the iron man star - who has children apple , ten , and moses , eight , with estranged husband chris martin - continued to say she is keen to be seen as a normal woman through her lifestyle website goop , and not a ' guru ' who professes to know all of the answers to people 's problems

we know that a woman 's time is her most precious resource and we want to multitask , get a lot done , and what we want to do is provide the best solutions
the iron man star says she is keen to be seen as a normal woman through her lifestyle website goop her lifestyle website , goop , features everything from fashion to health and beauty advice ' i see myself as an actor and a mother and as an entrepreneur
i do n't see myself as a guru at all
i 'm not a guru because i 'm the one asking the questions
i 'm not purporting to know anything
' during a recent appearance on bloomberg 's market makers ahead of international women 's day , the star said of the perception of her site : ' i think there is sometimes a miscommunication
' ' we are n't a super-luxury site , but we 're aspirational
we have things on there that cost $ 4
we have things on there that cost $ 500
sometimes i think that some of the criticism goop gets is because people have nât actually gone to the site and looked around and seen what we actually are
' in 2011 , the star admitted that the near - deafening criticism she faced over goop prompted her to consider quitting the brand altogether
' there were a couple of times when i thought , " i 'm just gon na stop doing it
people are so mean to me
i do n't want to do it , " ' she told harper 's bazaar uk
' but then i was like , " who cares what some lame person out there says ? " i was in italy once , and this old man came up to me and said , " i had the best time in nashville because of goop
" and that is so worth it to me
