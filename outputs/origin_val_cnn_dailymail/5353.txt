gone are the days of pamela anderson running in slow motion through the surf
a british company has invented the world 's first lifeguard drone - which could soon replace the human lifesavers on a beach near you
the drones , carrying cameras and rubber rings , can be sent out by lifeguards from the shore , and can allegedly rescue drowning holiday makers quicker than humans , who 'd have to battle through the waves
rigi , 28 , co-founder of rts ideas , launched the business in iran but has moved to london after gaining start - up support and will present a prototype next month
complete with lights and thermal cameras for night rescues , the drones could appear on holiday beaches in time for summer , even aiding with rescues of ships and yachts in trouble
' at the moment many people talk about bad drones and drones that are spying and killing people but i think everything has a good side and a bad side , ' said rigi
pamela anderson in 1990s tv show baywatch : many fans fondly remember her trademark red swimsuit ' people should see the good side to drones where they can save lives ' he said
' the drones can reach people stranded at sea far quicker than lifeguards and can deploy three buoyancy aids in one flight
' rigi and his business partner partner amir taheri , 27 , hope that one day the drones will be stationed on floating platforms where they can be charged from solar energy
the drones can reach people far quicker than lifeguards and can deploy three buoyancy aids in one flight ' this is the future of lifeguards i believe , ' rigi said
' in a competition , we found a lifeguard could perform a rescue in 90 seconds , but the drone took 20 seconds
that 70 seconds could be the difference between life and death
' finding people is hard with rescue teams
moving in boats , you do n't get good vision.but the drones ' range and height can spot a drowning person , which is really helpful for ships
eventually the drones may be stationed on floating platforms where they can be charged from solar energy ' a rescue team could take 10 to 12 minutes where a drone could take one minute
basically this increases the efficiency and decreases danger to lifeguards
rts ideas , based in tech city , in shoreditch , east london , are also hoping to develop a drone that can perform mountain rescues
in one of the british 's main holiday hotspots , cornwall and devon , more than 8,500 people were caught up in beach and sea rescue dramas last year
research showed that a lifeguard could perform a rescue in 90 seconds while the drone took just 20 seconds the inventors are hoping to decrease the number of people that drown by up to 60 per cent perranporth alone had 1,000 incidents , according to the rnli
' we have n't any contacts for cornwall yet but hopefully we can deploy this at beaches in the british and right around the world , ' said rigi
' we 're looking forward to hopefully decreasing the number of people that drown by up to 60 per cent with new technologies , where our drone is one of those technologies
' we 're not totally using autonomous drones in the first stage
the company hopes to deploy their invention at beaches in the british as well as around the world ' we 're using human intelligence on one side and the abilities of this technology to save lives quicker and more efficiently
' charlie johnstone , a surfer who works in porthtowan , said : ' i 'm not sure how they 're going to be programmed and how the drones would react to different people
but jemima barry , who works on seaton beach , thinks the idea could take off
she said : ' as long as it would n't take over the lifeguards and ruin their jobs then it 's a good thing
' so long as the lifeguards were still there - because you still need humans who know what to do
