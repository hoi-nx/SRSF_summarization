budget prices : aldi is introducing wagyu burgers at Â£ 2.99 each in a bid to chase from new zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers an a list celebrity might spend Â£ 29 on a wagyu burger at london âs dorchester hotel â after all it is renowned around the world as a byword for luxury given its flavour and succulence
alternatively , you could try the local aldi , where the budget chain is introducing wagyu burgers at Â£ 2.99 each
the budget chain is to offer a limited stock of wagyu burgers made with beef imported from new zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers
normally , luxury restaurants , stores and gourmet butchers sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye - watering Â£ 100 per kilo â so putting it out of reach for most families
however , aldi is bringing the beef , which originated with pampered cattle in japan , to the masses
last year the company sold wagyu sirloin and rib - eye steaks at Â£ 6.99 each , which resulted in something of a stampede among the bmw - driving classes
it believes the burgers will be similarly successful
wagyu beef stands out from other meat because of its distinctive marbling with fat , which melts into the meat during cooking to produce a fabulous taste and moist texture
the cattle were initially introduced to japan as a beast of burden to help cultivate rice during the 2nd century
beer was fed to the animals during the hot summers to stimulate appetite , while massaging was used to prevent muscles cramping on small farms in japan where the animals did not have sufficient room to move around
kobe beef is the purest , highest quality of the meat , which is produced from the black tajima - ushi breed of wagyu cattle and raised according to strict tradition
however , the demand and appetite for the beef is now so great that herds are now being reared across the globe , including the uk and new zealand
beef from wagyu cows is sold for as much as Â£ 100 per kilo in luxury restaurants and gourmet butchers aldi said the decision to stock the burgers was inspired by the menu at the oscar ball
stars such as bradley cooper , eddie redmayne and julianne moore were amongst the 1,500 members of hollywood royalty to dine at infamous governors ball , where mini american wagyu burgers served with aged cheddar were on the menu
the chain âs managing director of corporate buying , tony baines , said : â at aldi our shoppers love to try out lots of specialist products , and wagyu is no exception
following the frenzy around the wagyu steaks aldi sold last summer , we wanted to offer something new that would excite our customers
following his oscar success , eddie redmayne dined at the governors ball where mini american wagyu burgers served with aged cheddar were on the menu â aldi âs specially selected wagyu burgers are made from premium quality wagyu beef , and are available at an everyday low price , which our customers have come to know and love
â at the dorchester bar , the Â£ 29 wagyu burger is served with tomato relish and truffle mayonnaise
aldi suggests teaming its version with its specially selected brioche burger buns , which are 99p for four , and a pack of roquefort cheese , which is Â£ 2.29
that would give a price for the aldi version of less than Â£ 4 â assuming you only need a few slices of the cheese .
