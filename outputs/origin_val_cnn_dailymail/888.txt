mike holpin , a recovering alcoholic from ebbw vale in monmouthshire , has an unusual way of keeping track of his children
with 22 that carry his last name , 18 who do n't and ' probably a few more ' , mr mike holpin is one of the uk 's most prolific fathers with offspring aged between 37 and three
to keep track of all his children , who were born to 20 different mothers , he has had their names tattooed across his back
nevertheless , he says he is a changed character who wants nothing more than to reunite his vast brood - and would like to add a few more if he can
' i 'm as fertile as sin , ' he explains
' i do n't believe in contraception and i love sex
' according to mr mike holpin , his first sexual experience came aged nine but his baby - making career did n't really get underway until he got a job at a fairground in his late teens
' boys working on rides like that , they 're only there for one reason and that 's to pull women , ' he reminisces
' good looking boys are better but funny boys are spectacular
' you have to do some manoeuvring but me , i thought , i just want sex
i 'd pat them on the rump and if they say f * * * off then they 're not really up for it
if they say yes , then great
' keeping track : mr mike holpin , from ebbw vale in monmouthshire , shows off his family tree tattoo reformed : mr mike holpin , a recovering alcoholic , says he is a reformed character and wants to reunite his family taken : because of his alcoholism , many of his children were taken by social services and grew up in care although mr mike holpin has had many girlfriends , he admits to having had only six serious relationships , all of which fell victim to his ongoing battle with alcohol
his children too have suffered because of his alcoholism , with nearly all being taken into care as a result
it is , says mr mike holpin , his biggest regret
' due to my drinking and my womanising , most of my kids have gone through the care system , ' he explains
' it makes me feel like s * * * because they 've suffered
they [ social services ] took them from me because i 'm an alcoholic
i 'm still an alcoholic - i just do n't practise it
' now the reformed character is hoping to reunite his huge brood and fulfil the promise he made to each child as they were removed
' when they went into care , i made a promise that no matter how long it took , i will get my kids home , ' he says
perfect : mr mike holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect adding : he hopes to add to his family , aged between 37 and three , in the future ' i miss all the fun we used to have so i guess getting them back , my life will be set
my life will be perfect
' mr mike holpin also says he would like to add to his family with the help of his fiancÃ©e diane but ca n't resist reminiscing about the pulling techniques he used in the past
' there 's nothing nicer than a single fellow with a baby , ' he smirks
' sex ? it 's sex is all it is
you could look like the back of a bus but sex is sex
you do doggy style if she 's ugly
' i 'm only 56 , ' he continues
' i 'll never stop [ having children ]
in the bible , god says go forth and multiply
i 'm doing what god wants
' now , he says , he is a reformed character
' i 've got so much love in me for my kids , it 's spilling over , ' he says
' i need them more than they need me to be honest
i ca n't be without them
' he also says he hopes his children will be able to forgive him , both for their upbringing in care and for his lengthy reproductive career
' i ca n't make up for what i 've done , ' he admits
' all i can do is be there for them now
