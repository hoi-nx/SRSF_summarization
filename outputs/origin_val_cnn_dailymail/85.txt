it 's not every day that you find yourself sitting in the front row while a scantily clad dancer writhes in front of you but that is exactly what happened to the dutch ' maxima last night
the 43 - year - old royal did , however , manage to keep a straight face during the modern dance performance which took place at copenhagen 's royal library
sat beside danish 's frederik , who also managed to look suitably interested , the royal was enjoying the second evening of a three - day state visit to danish
they had flown over especially for the performance which was part of a return banquet hosted by maxima and willem-alexander for the danish royal family
designed to highlight dutch culture , maxima arrived for the event looking wonderful in a patriotic russet gown studded with rhinestones
eschewing her usual up - do , the mother - of - three wore her long blonde hair loose and curled for the event , which was designed to give danish and its royals a sneak peek at dutch culture
sitting on her other side during the performance was willem-alexander , who , like 46 - year - old frederik , was dapper in a dinner jacket
nonplussed : not everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves with some of the audience looking baffled glitzy : all of the royals had dressed up for the occasion , including the sequin - loving marie ( right ) scantily clad : most of the dancers chose to keep clothes to a minimum for the event round of applause : the royals , among them margrethe , politely clapped when the performance ended well done : the dancers enjoy the adulation at the end of their performance not to be outdone , 43 - year - old crown princess mary opted for a striking strapless black dress with a flattering empire - line cut
in contrast to her dutch counterpart , the australian - born royal had pulled her hair into a sleek low chignon and wore eye - catching diamond - shaped gold earrings
equally glamorous was danish 's margrethe who donned a rose - pink gown with a white lace bodice and fur shrug
also at the event was margrethe 's younger son , prince joachim , 45 , and his impeccably dressed french wife marie , 39 , who swept maxima an impressively low curtsey as she arrived
glamorous : maxima cut a patriotic figure in her dramatic russet gown convivial : willem-alexander cracked a joke as he posed with the danish royals outside the venue in charge : danish 's margrethe and the dutch ' willem-alexander on the red carpet pucker up : maxima puckers up as she greets danish 's prince consort henrik outside the event the cultural celebration topped off a busy day for maxima and willem-alexander who had earlier experienced the best of danish weather during a sunny but blustery ferry crossing to samsã¸ island
a small speck of land just off danish 's jutland peninsula , the island is entirely carbon - neutral with heat and hot water produced by incinerating hay
afterwards , the royal party was shown around a special type of danish boarding school called an efterskole
most danish teenagers spend at least a year at the boarding schools , which are usually paid for by parents , albeit helped by a contribution from the state , where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music
the efterskole on samsã¸ focuses on aquatic sports , diving , aviation and golf , all of which are frequently indulged in by the sports - mad crown prince
sweeping a curtsey : french - born princess marie offers maxima a dramatically low curtsey chic : dutch willem-alexander , danish queen margrethe , maxima and prince henrik stylish : maxima is glamorous in russet as she arrives at the royal library in copenhagen dressed in their best : danish prime minister helle thorning-schmidt ( left ) and princess benedickte willem-alexander and maxima 's trip to samsã¸ was one of the main events of their three - day visit , which began with their arrival at kastrup airport 's royal terminal on tuesday
the pair were treated to a banquet at christiansborg palace that night , with maxima wowing in a spectacular royal blue lace dress
danish 's margrethe also rose to the occasion in pale blue , while mary chose simple white
last night 's cultural event was the last stop on an action - packed itinerary that ends today when the dutch royal couple fly home to amsterdam
70s redux : maxima had nailed this season 's 70s trend with her tailored camel coat close : the two couples , who are of a similar age , are known to be close friends hats off to mary and maxima ! the dutch and danish royals were glamorous in matching trilbies hay hay : mary and maxima visit the island 's heating plant , which uses hay to produce hot water
