when avery was born , doctors told his parents : ' it 's a girl '
but from a very young age , the youngster from los angeles knew it simply was n't the case
the transgender 15 - year - old knew he was a boy from the age of two , setting his physical ' parts ' aside
writing for cnn , he has described how he knew he was male long before he discovered the terms ' gay ' and ' sexuality ' , and the difficulty he encountered with other people 's perceptions growing up
he also urges parents to let children set out their path - no matter their gender

he claims he knew he was a boy when he was two his parents let him cut his hair short for his preschool graduation , even though he was wearing a dress describing life as a toddler , he said : ' i was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind - not yet distorted by biology , other people 's confusion , or fear
' no matter how many times i was told differently , i was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too , for the most part
' he said he first heard the term ' gay ' in second grade , even after he had his first ' girlfriend ' , and remembered how one year ' a penis ' was at the top of his christmas list
however he feared people may perceive him as ' different ' when he learned homosexuality was considered by some to be abnormal
' i knew i liked girls and i was technically a girl , biologically , but i was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings
i was not gay - but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over
' at the age of seven he started to prefer wearing boys clothes and by eight , he was playing baseball avery was elected class president in the fifth grade by his peers
he strongly stated that he was a boy and the ' people that mattered knew it too , for the most part ' he is pictured at age 10 with short , curly hair
by now he was living the life of a boy , but the word transgender had n't formed part of his vocabulary avery described how he was able to become the boy he wanted , because he grew up in a house that taught him to ' love anyone i wanted to
' ' that said , ' he added
' i knew being gay was n't a bad thing , but i also knew it did n't describe me
i was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that , either
' when he entered middle school , he grew out his hair and started to wear dresses as to avoid the ' emotional torture '
but in 2012 , when he was 12 , he told his parents he was transgender
he is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment after attending a number of group sessions , and has urged people to consider categorizing people into boys and girls more carefully
' i can not stress to the world enough , gender and sexuality are two completely different things , and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight , ' avery said
he added : ' whether i 'm a boy or a girl , white or black , rich or poor , gay or straight , it 's completely irrelevant
what truly matters is the fact that i 'm avery and i 've always known exactly who i was
' avery wore a suit and lavender waistcoat for his fifth grade graduation , but from then on he grew out his hair and some times wore a dress to avoid the ' emotional torture ' of middle school in 2012 he told his parents he was transgender and is now undergoing hormone therapy treatment
