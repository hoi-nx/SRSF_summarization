if you were the member of a minority group and tried to create a system to control and oppress the majority , you could not have done a better job than the white leaders of ferguson , missouri
let 's start with the demographics
ferguson is small -- roughly 20,000 residents -- and is 67 % black and 29 % white
over the past decade , ferguson 's population has changed from majority white to majority black
its elected officials did not
five of six city council members are white , as is the city 's mayor
how does this happen in a city two - thirds black ? two answers : timing of elections and type of elections
ferguson , like most municipalities , holds elections in april of odd - numbered years
however research shows that such " off - cycle " elections reduces voter turnout
ferguson also holds nonpartisan elections , which means that there are no party labels on the ballot
this not only reduces the likelihood that people will vote , it also has been shown to reduce what voters know about the candidates
although missouri does not track the race of its voters , according to an article in the washington post , catalist , a private voter data firm , performed a study and found that the voting rules operating in ferguson effectively suppress the black vote
in the national election in november 2012 , the study found , voter turnout between blacks ( 54 % ) and whites ( 55 % ) was virtually identical
but because of the vast racial differences in the city 's population , it resulted in an electorate that was 71 % black and 28 % white
fast - forward five months later in april , when whites were three times ( 17 % ) more likely to vote than blacks ( 6 % )
that resulted in an electorate that was majority white : 52 % versus 47 %
that is how a majority - black population winds up with almost all - white elected representatives
ferguson 's law enforcement officers are also not representative , with roughly 94 % of its police force being white
similarly ferguson 's local judges are nonrepresentative
i 'm sensing a pattern here
local judges are appointed by the ferguson city council upon nomination by the mayor for a two - year term
the ferguson municipal court is also all - white
but the black citizens of ferguson apparently keep the police and local judges very busy
in 2013 , ferguson had the highest number of warrants issued in the state , when you control for size : 3.6 pending arrest warrants per household and 2.2 arrest warrants on average per person
and 95 % of people arrested for jaywalking in ferguson are black
while 67 % of the population is black , 86 % of vehicle stops involve a black driver
while 29 % of the population is white , 12.9 % of vehicle stops involve a white driver
blacks were almost twice as likely to be searched as whites , even though searches of blacks were less likely than whites to result in contraband being found ( 21 % vs. 34 % )
nobody said racism made sense
but for ferguson , it has made money
in prior years ferguson tried to raise sales tax but learned the hard way that it did not result in increased revenue because people voted with their feet and took their wealth with them
ferguson turned to a different revenue source : collecting traffic fines and penalties from the largely black population
those revenues constitute ferguson 's second - highest revenue source
once a resident gets a ticket and does not appear in court with an explanation , an arrest warrant is likely issued
once arrested , the resident may sit in jail for a very long time , while the fees and fines continue to accrue
a class - action lawsuit filed this month against the city of ferguson has challenged this funding system , calling it a " modern debtors ' prison scheme
" the remarkable part of this story is how patient the black residents of ferguson have been
it took the death of a teenager to get them mad enough to protest and the nation got mad with them
between the class - action lawsuit and the department of justice 's involvement , blacks in ferguson should know the world is watching
the arc of history is long and bends towards justice -- and help is finally on the way .
