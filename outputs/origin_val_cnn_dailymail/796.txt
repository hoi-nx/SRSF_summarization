meanwhile one of mayweather 's former opponents , saul alvarez , believes the us will dictate whether the fight is an exciting one for those watching around the world
he told fox deportes : ' mayweather is very smart
he can makes things frustrating or he can make a spectacular fight
he does not expose anything
' in the past , he 's thrown very few shots and makes things difficult
if he exposes himself just a little bit more , we can get an enjoyable fight
' pacquiao comes forward and he 's always throwing a lot of punches , and he 's fast
he can complicate things with his movement as he did with ( timothy ) bradley and ( juan manuel ) marquez
hopefully the fight is attractive
