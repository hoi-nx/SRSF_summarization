former new england patriots player hernandez appeared upset with a man he is accused of murdering two days before the killing , an associate of the victim said on tuesday
this came as a nike expert revealed hernandez was wearing the same kind of shoes the night of the killing as the footprints found near the victim 's body
nicholas testified in bristol county superior court in fall river , massachusetts , that hernandez stared at the man he is accused of killing , semiprofessional football player odin lloyd , and another man at a boston nightclub on the night of june 14 , 2013
nicholas said hernandez stared at odin lloyd and another man for two or three minutes and later walked quickly out of the nightclub with his head down as odin lloyd ran behind him , trying to catch up
he said hernandez appeared to brush odin lloyd away with an arm gesture , telling him to talk to someone else
' he seemed like he was angry about something , ' nicholas said , adding he saw hernandez ' storming out of the club ' and ' walking aggressively '
' he looked like he was upset , ' nicholas added
defense lawyer fee went after nicholas 's testimony , bringing up inconsistencies in what he told police in an august 2013 interview and what he said on the witness stand tuesday
fee played video clips from the interview in which his testimony varied , such as about where hernandez was and what hernandez was doing
when fee asked him if he could remember telling police what he said in the video , nicholas repeatedly said he could not

hernandez sits with his attorney charles rankin during his murder trial at the bristol county superior court in fall river , massachusetts prosecutors contend hernandez killed odin lloyd , who was dating his fiancÃ©e 's sister , after becoming upset at him for associating with people he disliked at the rumor nightclub that night hernandez , 25 , had a $ 41million contract with the new england patriots when he was cut from the team hours after being arrested for odin lloyd 's killing in june 2013
he is on trial on murder and firearms charges and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted
the former tight end and two friends , ernest wallace and carlos ortiz , picked up odin lloyd at his boston home in the early hours of june 17 , 2013 , and drove him to an industrial park less than a mile from hernandez 's house in north attleborough , massachusetts , where his body was found later that day , according to prosecutors
odin lloyd , 27 , had been shot five times with a .45 caliber handgun , and investigators found several shell casings at the scene and one that had been removed from a rental car returned by hernandez
also on tuesday , the jury heard that hernandez wore a model of nike shoe in surveillance video recorded at his home that prosecutors say he was wearing at the time of the murder
witness hedges , of nike , testifies during the murder trial of former new england patriots player hernandez hodges said that hernandez was wearing the same nike air jordan 11 lows in surveillance footage from before and after the murder
prosecutors said a footprint at the scene matches the shoe hedges , a consultant for nike , identified the footwear worn by hernandez in still images as nike air jordan xi retro low shoes , saying : ' it 's a very unique shoe
' hedges , who worked for the footwear company for more than 30 years , was shown surveillance video of hernandez at a gas station less than 90 minutes before the killing and at his home less than 10 minutes after
in both , he said , hernandez was wearing nike air jordan 11 lows
prosecutors have said a footprint at the scene was made by that kind of shoe
but hernandez lawyer james sultan pointed out that more than 3million shoes with that sole have been made
hedges said fewer were made in a size 13 , the size hernandez wears , which would have a slightly different sole than the others
prosecutors also showed videos of headlights heading toward the empty lot at an industrial park not far from hernandez 's home where odin lloyd 's body was found and then leaving less than four minutes later
but the four videos , from a gas station and two businesses , were from so far away and of such poor quality that the kind of car or the number of occupants could not be seen .
