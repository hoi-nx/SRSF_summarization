auctioneer graham barton said the final selling price of the 502 sq ft block and grounds overlooking st austell bay had been â a breathtaking outcome â
he said : â it was a spectacular lot , i have n't seen something with so much potential in as long as i can remember
â this is arguably the most gloriously located residential development opportunity for sale in cornwall today
â it has stunning panoramic and jaw dropping sea views
the property looks southwards across st austell bay with the historic harbour at its western edge
â there is huge potential for a fantastic family home or holiday home with extension or complete replacement among the options subject to planning consent
