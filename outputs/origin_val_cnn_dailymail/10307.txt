qpr defender isla is convinced his chile international colleague sanchez will become the best player in the world after a sensational start to his arsenal career this season
sanchez and isla were this week included in a 20 - man chile squad to play a friendly against brazil at the emirates on march 29 , and also against iran
sanchez , who has scored 18 goals this season , has helped fire arsenal to third in the premier league table , where they sit just a point behind manchester city
and isla , who is on a season - long loan deal at loftus road from juventus after impressing for chile at last summer 's world cup in brazil , believes sanchez has all the ingredients â and the temperament â to eclipse even barcelona striker lionel messi and real madrid 's cristiano ronaldo as the best in the business
arsenal 's sanchez can become the best players in the world , according to isla ' i have known him for ten years and i think sanchez has shown what he is made of , ' said isla
' he has always said that he wanted to be the best in the world and now he has arrived in a team where this can truly become a reality
' he can build confidence and where they play for him and he transmits the confidence that his teammates give him but honestly , i am not at all surprised by the quality of sanchez as a player
' i am proud to play alongside him for chile , as i am proud to play alongside arturo vidal of juventus and claudio bravo of barcelona among others
i think together we are able to succeed and it would be fantastic for our country
sanchez was one of chile 's star men at the world cup and will be a key man at the copa america ' sanchez is a leader as are the other two
of course , the team is a group but there are always role models in any team and i think these three in particular are fundamental to ours
' there are always high quality players and these three are the pillars of our team and the rest of us must accompany them to achieve great things
' firstly sanchez provides what i believe we lacked before which are his goals
' it 's fantastic that he is scoring so much which fills him with confidence and joy and i hope he continues to keep scoring always more
' if we were to talk about his characteristics , we could be here all day but for me , i love playing with a player who 's so bold , who is a fighter , runs for 90 minutes and always loves training
' i have heard from many of his arsenal teammates also that he never tires in training or on the pitch and this is fundamental for the team
' qpr 's isla is proud to play for chile alongside the likes of sanchez and arturo vidal of juventus also included in the squad is barcelona goalkeeper claudio bravo , former cardiff midfielder gary medel , fiorentina 's david pizarro , qpr 's eduardo vargas and juventus midfielder arturo vidal
and isla has issued a warning to brazil boss dunga to expect a serious test against fellow chile at the emirates
the friendly in london will take on extra significance as brazil secured a dramatic penalty shootout win against chile to reach the last eight at the world cup last summer and set up an all - south american quarter - final against colombia
' it 's a game that give brings up some pain , for everything that happened in the world cup which was a beautiful game , i think as much for brazil as it was for chile , ' added isla
' the game played on for 120 minutes before going to penalties and sadly brazil won but they really had to work for it
' to play this game as a revenge match in a beautiful country , and beautiful city such as london , all chileans will take interest and i hope it goes well
' brazil v chile is on march 29 at 3pm at the emirates in london
