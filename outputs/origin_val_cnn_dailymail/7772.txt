three weeks before echo huntley died , aged just 36 , she and her twin brother , hollywood star noah , went for a walk in the sussex village where they grew up
â it was a beautiful day , â remembers the actor , who shot to fame in the 1990s playing long - haired hunk luke mcallister in itv âs emmerdale , and recently appeared in the box office hit dracula untold
â we had a cream tea and then wandered up to the 11th century church
â as early summer sunlight dappled through the trees on to the ancient graves , noah idly asked echo where she âd like to be buried
he recalls : â she said in her slightly dismissive way , â oh , i do nât know
maybe there , â and pointed to a damp and shady corner of the churchyard
â noah asked echo if she would nât want somewhere more picturesque to rest but , having made her choice , she seemed adamant
echo was a lifelong sufferer from the neurological condition epilepsy , but , before she died , appeared to have turned a corner in her treatment
then she suffered a catastrophic seizure during a day out at the beach
three days later , on june 6 , 2010 , she passed away from multiple organ failure
and so echo was laid to rest in the spot she had chosen , quite befitting the unconventional life she had chosen , living with her carpenter husband iain in a gypsy wagon , and breeding pheasants for a living
epilepsy , which affects about one per cent of the population , is due to damage to the tissues of the brain which causes disruption in communication between nerve cells
this can occur through head injury , stroke , meningitis and genetic conditions , or birth trauma â which is rare , but perhaps was a factor in echo âs case
noah and his sister came from a large family of eight children including , remarkably , three sets of twins
when she was born , echo spent four weeks in hospital
â she turned blue just after birth , â explains noah
soap star : noah , who is now 40 , played heart - throb luke mcallister in emmerdale from 1993 to 1995 people with epilepsy have a tendency to recurrent seizures and the type and severity depends on the part of the brain damaged
alongside drugs known as anti-convulsants , management of the condition involves a healthy lifestyle that includes regular sleeping patterns
in some cases , surgery can help
noah says : â as a family we are unconvinced by mainstream medicine for the most part , and relied predominantly on nurturing her ourselves
she rejected most anti-convulsants because of the side effects
â dr john jacob , consultant neurologist at milton keynes and oxford university , and bmi saxon clinic in milton keynes , says : â anti convulsants have long been the mainstay of treatment for epilepsy no matter what form it takes
this is in part because of the very small risk of death when the seizure is prolonged or sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
but it can be hard for younger patients to commit to a drug which they need to take for long periods or even the rest of their lives
â while they were growing up , the huntleys lived a bohemian existence in sussex , with all the children home - schooled
echo had her first seizure aged nine
noah says : â doctors felt being at home was the best thing for her , with a twin growing at the same chronological rate and able to support her
there were differences between us academically which became more pronounced as we grew up , â noah continues
â i was looking to go to oxford university
echo led a normal life apart from the odd seizure , and she stayed locally
â noah joined the cast of emmerdale aged 19 and then , as his film career took off in his 20s , divided his time between los angeles and london
echo became his solace from the â madness â of showbiz
red carpet : noah ( right ) with dracula untold co-stars luke evans and sarah gadon at the premiere last year in her 20s , unable to drive because of her seizures ( the dvla requires patients to be seizure free for a year to hold a licence ) , echo began taking medication and for a decade , this worked
then her symptoms returned with a vengeance
seizures typically last just a few moments but in severe cases , they can occur in quick succession , or continuously â and any episode that lasts for more than five minutes requires urgent treatment as there is a risk of brain damage
echo âs fits were lasting 30 minutes or more
â such seizures are often triggered by something , â says professor ley sander , director of the epilepsy society , professor of neurology and clinical epilepsy and honorary consultant neurologist at university college london
perhaps an infection or forgetting medication
but sometimes they just happen without explanation
â in echo âs case , no one will ever know why , on a hot may day at shoreham beach near brighton with her husband , she suffered a two - hour seizure
an ambulance took her to intensive care , where her family were called to her bedside
throughout our conversation noah is introspective , speaking about the idea that when one twin dies and the other survives there is a â connection between heaven and earth â , and that seeing a bird trapped in the eaves of a church â felt like a symbol â
but , perhaps like his sister did when choosing her memorial , he also sees humour even in the bleakest moments
and he speaks of the dreadful time with gentle humour : â the day after she died , my agent called , oblivious to what was going on , and said , â we âve got this great audition
it âs for a film called waking the dead â¦ â â
