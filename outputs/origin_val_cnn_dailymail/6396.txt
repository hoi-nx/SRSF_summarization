by the time mccoy traipsed in , ninth in the first race of his last cheltenham festival , the acclaim for his great friend and rival was ringing in his ears
the sound of rolling thunder from the crowd , packed 50 - deep on the lawns along the final two furlongs of the closing straight , concluded with walsh âs name being chanted
suddenly the people âs hero seemed quite incidental
it was not to get a great deal better for the man who transcends national hunt racing , and whose farewell to its biggest meeting dominated the build - up to this event
mccoy rides jezki to a disappointing fourth in the champion hurdle on day one of cheltenham festival in truth , mccoy has known plenty of days like this at cheltenham festival before , and while he will have felt disappointment , his supporters in a record opening - day crowd of 63,000 had much to compensate them
the thought of this cheltenham festival helps sustain some people through the long winter months and , when it finally arrived , it could hardly have been more glorious
cleeve hill almost shimmered in the background as springtime attempted its own burst to the front
amid the drama mccoy fought hard to try to fulfil the expectations placed upon him , perhaps more from a wider sporting public who have come to revere his sustained excellence
the cognoscenti know that there is little low hanging fruit for him at cheltenham festival this year , but there are still three days left to make this a fitting valedictory appearance
the fantasy ending remains victory on friday , either in the gold cup or the meeting âs final race , which has been temporarily renamed in his honour
he might be a far more sanguine character than when he first started racking up the champion jockey titles , but frustration was etched into his features as he went in and out of the weighing room
mccoy had considered jezki ( above ) as his best chance of a winner at cheltenham festival this year you do not become the nation âs most durable sportsman without defeats continuing to sting
on tuesday these came in the form of finishing ninth , last , fifth , fourth and pulling up in his five races
it is a strange day when american rich ricci , uber - wealthy banker and the pantomime villain of racehorse ownership , gets more cheers in the parade ring than someone deemed a national treasure , but this was one of them
mccoy has admitted that he is anxious about the prospect of retirement , but afternoons such as on tuesday might serve to ease the fear
no defeat hurt more than coming fourth on jezki in the champion hurdle , and the horse âs trainer jessica harrington revealed he had been quick to take responsibility
mccoy looks dejected after the final race , the chaps restaurants barbados novices â handicap steeplechase â ap was blaming himself , saying he took on faugheen at the top of the hill , and in chasing the winner it probably cost him second or third and he finished fourth , â she said
â if he had ridden him to be second to faugheen then he may well have been second
â the latter scenario was never likely to happen , especially as mccoy had identified jezki , the defending champion from last year , as probably his best chance in 2015
he was not to add to his comparatively modest cheltenham festival tally of 30 winners , a total exceeded not just by walsh but barry geraghty , too
he has tasted glory here â the gold cup win on synchronised and the masterclass on wichita lineman in the 2009 william hill â but it is 17 years since he was the leading jockey at this bacchanalian jamboree
mccoy , riding bold henry , pulled up with two fences left in the final race of the day mccoy , riding in his last cheltenham festival , did not have the day he would have hoped upon arrival some revellers had gone home as he set off in the last race , the exotically - named chaps restaurants barbados novices â handicap steeplechase , on bold henry
they were never in it and pulled up with two fences left
afterwards mccoy had what looked like a lengthy inquest with the owner jp mcmanus before fairly sprinting back to the weighing room for the last time
he was not in the mood to discuss the afternoon âs events , saying only â it was all right
â perhaps he could merely have pointed to the name of the horse who had started favourite and just come second in the final chase
for ap it had been a thomas crapper kind of day .
