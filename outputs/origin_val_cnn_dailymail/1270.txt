as the clock ticked down on celtic âs league cup final win , goalkeeper gordon looked in a world of his own as he glanced around hampden park , savouring every last moment
when the final whistle confirmed his first winners â medal since the scottish cup victory over gretna on penalties with hearts in 2006 , the goalkeeper immediately searched out the twin lights who had inspired his incredible comeback story
over the course of his two long years out injured , four year old daughter freya and then the arrival of little emma , now 22 - months old , provided both fortitude and hope in what was a seemingly endless dark tunnel for gordon
scott brown lifts the scottish league cup alongside keeper gordon ( right ) on sunday once britain âs most expensive keeper , his girls now found their daddy a house - husband , unemployed after being released by sunderland in the summer of 2012 due to knee tendon and anterior cruciate ligament injuries
neither daughter knew him as gordon , scotland hero and scottish cup - winning goalkeeper ; the man who had once been voted as having made the best save in the 20 - year history of the english premier league
and the longer his spell out of the game continued , the more the 32 - year - old âs retirement looked a weary inevitability
keeper gordon gets the drinks flowing in the dressing room and sprays champagne as his team - mates on sunday , however , as celtic looked to the future with the first trophy of the ronny deila era , gordon celebrated with his family present at hampden park , including wife jennifer
it was , he conceded , a day he feared may never happen
â i took a moment or two towards the end to think about things , â admitted gordon , his lips visibly quivering with emotion after the 2 - 0 win against dundee united
â when the game was already won , and dundee united were nât going to get back into it , it was nice to stand up the other end of the pitch and just have a look around at the fans celebrating and singing all the songs
celtic goalkeeper gordon poses with the scottish league cup trophy in the winning changing room â to win it feels brilliant , absolutely fantastic
it âs the manager âs first competition and he âs won it â so it âs great for him but it âs also great for me personally
â i just wanted to take it all in , to realise that this was really happening for me
that i had won a cup again
it had been a long time coming since the last one at hearts
it âs a dream come true
â i took my two little girls , freya and emma , out on to the pitch with me afterwards
it was so nice to be able to do that for them
they have stood by me and they have supported me for the two whole years when i was nât working , while i was concentrating fully on getting back into football
celtic goalkeeper gordon maintains his clean sheet during the scottish league cup final â it must have been a hard thing for them to have to deal with
they were so young that they never really knew what daddy did for a living
they were a big part of my inspiration to get back to top level football
i wanted to show them what their daddy used to do ! â and i managed to do that
it means the world to me to share that moment with my girls out there on the pitch
and they absolutely loved it , dancing around and picking up all the confetti
it was such a special moment for me and for my family ; a moment i will never forget
â as he danced across the park with his girls and his jubilant team - mates , gone were memories of surgery and the seemingly interminable healing process
â to come from where i was , all the hard work makes it special , â he smiled
â at times it might have been easier to give up but the support i âve had to keep going , to carry on and to get to here is just brilliant
it feels like i am back now
gordon pumps his fists in celebration as celtic defeated dundee united in the scottish league cup final â when i was injured , i just wanted to play a game of football again
but once i managed that i realised i was capable of getting back to a high level
and that â s when i started to think about what is possible
â but to do this in my first season back is just amazing
when i first signed for celtic last summer , fraser forster was still here as no 1 goalkeeper
â so to get in and have 40 games under my belt â plus a medal in the bank â is just so hard to contemplate
this is more than i could ever have hoped for when i was making the journey back from where i have been
â but i ca nât afford to look too far back because we âve got a busy run - in to come this season
â we âve got a difficult game on wednesday night against dundee united in the scottish cup quarter - final replay and this result today might give dundee united an added incentive to come out and have an even bigger go at us
â i thought dundee united played pretty well today even with 10 men
they stuck to their tasks and they are a tough team to break down
so if we are not at our best , 100 per cent ready , they will have every chance to do well against us
