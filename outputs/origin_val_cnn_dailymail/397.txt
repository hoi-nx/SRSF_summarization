an amazing image revealing some mysterious phenomena in a gigantic galaxy - cluster collision has been revealed
in the region , where clusters of hundreds of galaxies are colliding , a rich variety of objects are visible only to radio telescopes
scientists created a â true colour â image of the region to reveal what it would look like if humans could see radio waves , rather than just visible light
researchers have released an amazing image of abell 2566
in the annotated image ( move the slider to see the markings ) , the point sources ( examples in red ) are galaxies like ours
blue objects are radio galaxies with streams of plasma , and in green is the ' large relic ' , which could be a shockwave as the clusters collide
researchers at the nrao ( nrao ) made the image using the vla ( vla ) in new mexico
in the image , red colouration shows longer radio waves , moving down to blue , which is composed of shorter radio waves
the region is known as abell 2256 , and is about 800 million light - years from earth and about four million light - years across
the image covers an area in the sky almost as large as the full moon
in the image , the multiple â dots â that can be seen are â normal , everyday galaxies â as big as the milky way , dr eilek of the nrao told mailonline
a radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous at radio wavelengths
it is usually composed of two jets being expelled from a large elliptical galaxy
radio galaxies can be detected at large distances , which makes then useful tools in studying the structure of the universe
â star formation in such galaxies is a strong source of radio waves , which come from supernova remnants and cosmic rays that are energised in the star formation regions
â there is also a handful of objects known as radio galaxies , which each have a massive central black hole that emits jets of plasma
â in clusters like this the unusual shapes of the radio galaxies are due to the interaction of those jets with the cluster atmosphere , â dr eilek continued
â we do n't yet understand just why each of those sources have the shapes they have - we âre still working on that
â but these are definitely radio galaxies in the cluster ; we think the merger happening in the cluster has something to do with the large number and unusual shapes of these radio galaxies
â resarchers at the nrao ( nrao ) made the image using the vla ( vla ) in new mexico , shown here
the vla is at an altitude of 6970ft ( 2125 metres ) and consists of 27 independent antennae two of these , towards the right - hand side of the image , have long trails with them
this may be due to them speeding very fast through the cluster , with their plasma left behind in a tail
perhaps the most notable part of the image is , as dr eilek calls it , the â big fuzzy thing â to the upper right
this is known as the large relic , and it is a million light - years across but its formation is a mystery
â one possibility is that this is a huge shockwave , caused when the two clusters ram together supersonically , â said dr eilek
however , she notes that it could also be a â reconnection layer â , where magnetic fields are pushed together until they annihilate
this same process is thought to drive solar flares in our sun , and also earth âs aurorae .
