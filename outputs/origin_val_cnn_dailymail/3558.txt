video : scroll down to watch pearson 's outburst pearson fixes a reporter with a stare during a tetchy exchange after the draw with hull after concluding the press conference , pearson muttered ' waxing away , my a * * * ' under his breath he was then further angered by the suggestion his team âs season was â waxing or waning â with ten games left and seven points separating leicester from safety
â waxing or waning , f * * * * * * hell
my a * * * , â pearson is heard saying as he finishes his press conference at the king power stadium
as he gets up he appears to utter the word : â p * * * *
â pearson was irked at his players being accused of intimidating the officials given his stance on such matters
pearson does not countenance such dark arts
in a december interview he said : ' people who are more cynical - minded might say i âm naive
' there is a concern at the premier league about the number of times that is happening
i hope my players do nât start doing it
' there âs a difference between being streetwise and using intimidation of officials as a vehicle to win
i âd never cheat to win
' he is fiercely protective of his squad and , in any case , replays showed only a couple put their arms up in appeal with the same number of hull players arguing the opposite
the leicester manager then seemed to call the journalist a ' p * * * * ' for the line of questioning pearson looks frustrated during another game where his leicester side failed to win it is a third controversial incident for pearson this season
in december he was banned from the dugout for one game and fined Â£ 10,000 for telling a supporter to â f * * * off and die â after receiving sustained abuse
in february he was involved in a touchline exchange with james mcarthur as the pair fell together
pearson jokingly throtted the crystal palace midfielder then held onto his shirt as he attempted to rejoin play
the next day brought pearson âs phantom sacking , when leicester owner vichai srivaddhanaprabha is believed to have wanted to bring the axe before his son aiyawatt counselled against
alex bruce âs comments ultimately triggered the exchange on saturday evening
the hull manager said : â there is a raging debate about chelsea in midweek
i âve seen everybody surround alex bruce for a red card for his challenge
â for me it is a perfectly decent challenge i would expect a centre - half to make
the reason we enjoy the premier league is its honesty and integrity and if we âre going to go down the route of every other league jumping around , whinging , trying to get people yellow cards and red cards
for me it âs not right
â pearson was asked if he thought it was a fair criticism
â no , â he said , before entering into a tetchy exchange with the journalist which ended with him finishing the press conference in angry fashion , and swearing under his breath
steve bruce cited chelsea in terms of the leicester players behaved to try and get alex bruce sent off â¦ did they ? oh very nice
do you think that âs a fair criticism ? no. what âs your take on that situation ? i âve just said no. but what âs your take on a situation where all the players surround a referee ? how many times have you seen us play this year ? three times
well there you are then
you âre not in a position to judge my players on that
i âm not judging anyone
i âm just asking you â¦ you âve asked me and i âve told you
i do nât think it âs a fair assessment
do you consider that leicester âs season is waxing or waning ? i do nât have to use that sort of analogy
we are in the same position
we âve got ten games left , six games at home , and our home form has to be drastically improved for us to give ourselves the best chance
you got any more questions you want to ask ? obviously not
waxing or waning , f * * * * * * hell
my a * * *
p * * * *
pearson seems to be feeling the pressure as his side remain rooted to the bottom of the table the leicester boss was unhappy at a question about his players ' behaviour leading to tom huddlestone 's red
