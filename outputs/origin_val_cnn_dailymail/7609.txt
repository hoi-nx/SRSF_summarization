god blessed us to bear children
the media cursed us with untrue body image
we are all beautiful because if gods grace

some of hollis ' followers went a step further , sharing on her page their own bikini snapshots , with stretch marks and all
for his eyes only : the 32 - year - old party planner wrote in her facebook manifesto that the only man whose opinion she cares about is her husband , david , and he thinks she looks sexy positive feedback : hollis ' photo has drawn thousands of comments from other moms , some of whom even shared ' imperfect ' bikini photos of their own third time 's the charm : after she gave birth to her third son ( pictured ) , hollis was finally able to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight through healthy eating and exercise nancy engelhard uploaded a photo of herself in a black two - piece number on the beach , along with a caption that boldly stated : ' this is me ! after 2 kids , 1 miscarriage , 7 bladder surgeries , ovarian cancer and a hysterectomy ! love my bikini ! a few male commenters also weighed in , among them disabled veteran mike vanderveen who revealed that he still wears shorts , even though he had lost his legs in a land mine explosion
' at least i do n't have to worry about snakebites , cold feet , stubbing my toes , twisting my ankles , and buying shoes is a breeze , ' he joked , before concluding in all caps : ' if you do nât like what you see , look the other way ! ! ! ' hollis responded to the veteran âs message by saying that at age 22 , she had a bout with a condition called bell 's palsy , which left her face paralyzed for two months
not everyone , however , got on board with her positive body image message , with some users lambasting her for drawing attention to such a relatively minor problem as stretch marks
the mother of three , however , insisted that her critics missed the point of her message
party girl : hollis , pictured all dressed up alongside her spouse , launched her party - planning business in la back in 2004 playing dress - up : the hollis clan on halloween , channeling an old west town , with rachel hollis dressed as a flowering cactus and her youngest son dressed as a tumbleweed hollis , the daughter of an oklahoma pentecostal minister and a church pianist , said she has been fighting the battle of the bulge her entire life , even before she had her three sons , ages 2 , 6 and 8
while she was pregnant with her first child , the 5 - foot - 2 hollis packed on 45lbs , and she had not lost that weight by the time she became pregnant with her second son
after giving birth to her youngest , hollis was finally able to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight through healthy eating and exercise
hollis revealed to today show that the now - famous beach photo was taken a week after she had completed her first marathon and was proud of her new and improved physique
' it âs never ever going to be like a victoria âs secret model , but i think i look good and my husband wants to make out with me , so i âm doing something right , ' hollis concluded .
