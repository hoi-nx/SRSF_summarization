dyer has been told his future lies at swansea even though manager garry monk has left him out of his last three match - day squads
dyer started the season on fire with three goals in as many premier league games and was reported to be in international contention when england manager roy hodgson paid a visit to the liberty stadium in september
but dyer 's form has tailed off since that blistering start and he is now behind fellow widemen wayne and jefferson montero in the liberty stadium pecking order
dyer ( left ) should stay at swansea despite his recent absence from the side , says garry monk the 27 - year - old winger has even failed to make the bench for swansea 's last three games against manchester united , burnley and tottenham but monk explained that was down to him changing his customary 4 - 3 - 3 formation to one featuring a midfield diamond
' these are very difficult decisions for me , ' garry monk explained
' dyer had a fantastic start to the season , he had a little dip and then he came back a bit
' he has probably been a bit more inconsistent but he has still contributed fantastically to the team
there are no problems whatsoever with dyer
' he is one who does deserve to be in match - day squads but unfortunately with the way things are sometimes that is n't always possible
' the formation we 've been playing dictates the bench , you have to look what you need and there are normally three or four players who miss out
' garry monk has said it has been difficult to leave dyer out and feels he deserves to be in be in the match - day squads dyer has made over 200 league appearances for swansea since signing from garry monk 's former club southampton in a Â£ 400,000 deal in 2009
the wiltshire - born winger helped the club win promotion to the premier league in 2011 and has been a consistent performer in the top flight - and garry monk insists he still has a big part to play at swansea
' i have known him since he was 14 and watched his career , i know him better than probably anyone else in the squad , ' garry monk said
' dyer has contributed a lot this season , he is a fantastic player to work with and someone who is at a very good level
monk has known dyer since he was 14 and says he knows him better than any other member of his squad ' he is a big part of what i am doing here but there are moments within seasons where you miss out
' we have four good wide players in jeff , wayne and dyer and mo barrow coming through , they are all different types who can contribute different things and selection depends on who we are playing and how the players have trained
' these decisions are never easy - it 's probably the hardest part of the job - but i am always honest with the players and i think they respect that
