the fbi is asking detectives across the country to dust off their cold case murder files and see whether millionaire heir robert durst could be connected to any other unsolved crimes
robert durst , the focus of hbo 's true crime documentary series " the jinx , " was charged with first - degree murder last week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante , berman
now the fbi is putting out a call to local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where robert durst lived over the past five decades , a u.s. law enforcement official said
unsolved cases in vermont , new york , the san francisco bay area and southern california are among those getting a new look , the official said
robert durst 's attorney , deguerin , said it 's a sign that authorities are desperate
" they seem to be going to such great lengths to pin something else on him , " deguerin said
" they must not have much of a case to begin with
" robert durst , who authorities believe has a net worth of $ 100 million , has lived in numerous places and owned property in at least four states , according to court documents and public records
in " the jinx , " robert durst describes the time he spent living in vermont with his first wife , kathleen , running a health food store in the 1970s
in 1982 , kathleen mccormack durst went missing
robert durst says he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in katonah , new york , and she headed to their manhattan apartment
her family members say they believe she 's dead and that robert durst is the one to blame
the case has never been solved
he 's also lived in galveston , texas , where he admitted to shooting a neighbor and dismembering the body in 2001
he was acquitted in a 2003 murder trial after arguing he 'd acted in self - defense
last week , police searched condos robert durst owns in houston as part of the investigation into berman 's death
she was shot dead in december 2000 in her beverly hills , southern california , home
investigators know robert durst was in southern california the week berman died
it 's a detail robert durst shrugs off in the hbo documentary , in which he denied he had anything to do with berman 's death and said , " southern california 's a big state
" authorities investigating a decades - old cold case in vermont said monday that there 's a connection between robert durst and the case of lynne schulze , a college student who disappeared from middlebury college in 1971
" we are aware of the connection between the disappearance of lynne schulze and robert durst , " middlebury police capt. hanley said
" we have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead
" hanley elaborated tuesday on the nature of the connection , saying robert durst owned a health food store where schulze shopped the day she disappeared
but there is no evidence the two had met , hanley said
deguerin 's attorney brushed off the accusation monday
" you know , he may have been in chicago when jimmy hoffa disappeared , " he said
" he 's an easy target
" the name of the health food store , " all good things , " was also the title of a 2010 film starring ryan gosling and kirsten dunst that was a thinly veiled fictional take on the robert durst case
after seeing the film , robert durst reached out to director andrew jarecki and said he wanted to be interviewed
the interviews with robert durst became the basis for " the jinx
" robert durst says in the documentary that he had traveled during the week of berman 's death to trinidad , southern california , a small coastal city in northern southern california
" it was very rural , very pretty , " he says
and it was a place , robert durst says , where he lived " off and on
" in eureka , about 20 miles south , robert durst has been part of another investigation
authorities there say they have n't ruled out the possibility he could be connected to the disappearance of karen , who went missing in november 1997 when she was 16 years old
the police chief said investigators were interested in learning what robert durst has to say about that case now that he 's behind bars
" we are certainly interested in any information that may or may not come out of interviews with mr. robert durst , " police chief andy mills said
" if information comes to us that allows us to further our investigation , then we will certainly take the opportunity to do that
" according to local news reports at the time of mitchell 's disappearance , she was last seen leaning into a light blue car that she might have gotten into
a witness gave police a description of the man behind the wheel , which resulted in a sketch of a gray - haired man with glasses -- a drawing that journalist birkbeck says looks remarkably like robert durst
" he wears these wide - rim glasses
he was wearing those glasses back in the day and it 's also in the composite , " said birkbeck , whose book , " a deadly secret , " chronicles robert durst 's life and run - ins with the law
" robert durst apparently knew karen
karen had volunteered at a homeless shelter in eureka , which robert durst had frequented , which he had a habit of doing in different cities , " birkbeck said
he 'd also gone to a shoe store that mitchell 's aunt ran at a mall in eureka , birkbeck said
the former lead investigator on the case , parris , retired several years ago and could not be reached for comment
in 2003 , he told the journal news that there were similarities between robert durst and the composite sketch
" he 's a lead we 're following , " parris told the newspaper , " and with all the information we 've learned about him , i 'm not fully comfortable that i can eliminate him from our investigation at this point
" investigators looking at other cases across the country have their work cut out for them , birkbeck said
" in 2002 , when my book was first published , we reported that police found six addresses in the san francisco bay area alone
some of them were properties , some of them were post offices , some of them were warehouse facilities
there were other address in northern california , southern california , as well as other parts of the country , " he told cnn 's " erin burnett : outfront
" but the investigation is nothing new , he said
" they 've been looking at this for several years now , " he said
" i guess with recent events , they 've really expanded their scope
" cnn 's jean casarez contributed to this report .
