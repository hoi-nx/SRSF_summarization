the high court heard how the woman was admitted to hospital in 2008 after complaining of abdominal pains at her gp
she was treated with painkillers for three days before surgeons decided to remove the inflamed organ
but by the time they got round to operating , ms sarah marquis 's appendix had burst and an abdominal infection had set in
as a result she lost her ability to have children naturally
describing the hospital 's role in her ordeal , ms sarah marquis 's counsel cara guthrie said : ' had it not been for the negligence of the defendants , ms sarah marquis â appendix would not have perforated
' she would have made a rapid and uncomplicated recovery , avoiding an extended hospital stay , and she would not have been rendered infertile
' as a result of the botched operation ms sarah marquis had to take time off from her Â£ 85,000 a year job and missed out on promotions abroad , she added
while the trust 's barrister admitted it was to blame for the complications , he denied her claim that she was entitled to Â£ 1.5million

' the trust acknowledges the fault on its part that caused your injuries and it is sorry for that , ' said bradley martin
' ( but ) the possibilities are that you would have got pregnant naturally in the six months you and your partner decided to really try for a baby after the negligence
speaking of her long term partner who she began living with shortly after the surgery he added : ' you moved in together in order to have a baby
' he rejected her earlier claim that had it not been for the operation she would have been selected to work in the company 's american offices as he said she would have been pregnant
