the jury , which began deliberating last friday , unanimously found devonte campbell , casey jones and alex bernard guilty of two counts of murder
omar hassan , 21 , was found guilty by a majority of 11 - 1
they will be sentenced at a later date
opening the murder trial last year , prosecutor lisa wilding qc said the two victims were set upon in their black ford fiesta in montague road having been trapped by four cars which stopped in front and behind so they had no means of escape
she said : ' the occupants of the four cars that boxed in that lone vehicle got out and ran to the trapped car
inside it were two young men - josiah manful and aaron carriere
' less than a minute later those two men were fatally wounded having been stabbed in a swift , frenzied , utterly brutal attack that left mr josiah manful with 13 wounds and mr aaron carriere with 11
' mr josiah manful managed to get out of the driver 's seat to call for help but both men were fatally wounded and were pronounced dead at the scene
omar hassan ( pictured left ) 21 , and alex bernard , 21 , ( right ) were both found guilty of murder jurors were told that the defendants had been ' working as a team ' to ' lure ' the two young men in to a trap and kill them
although there were drugs and cash in the car , only one item was stolen - mr aaron carriere 's mobile phone which contained his drug dealing ' client list '
the prosecutor said : ' the ferocity of the attack , which was inflicted upon men who were helpless and trapped in their car seats , by a pack of men who surrounded the car , the use of at least two knives , the stab wounds to the neck and torso that killed them , were all intended to cause at least very serious harm and we say was intended to kill them
' each of the defendants played their part in the murders , some wielding knives , some lending support through physical intimidating presence , and others acting as getaway drivers , the court heard
afterwards , some of the defendants tried to evade capture by dumping cars and fleeing the country in the days after the attack , the court heard
casey jones , 19 , ( pictured left ) and devonte campbell ( right ) aged 20 were also found guilty of murder mr aaron carriere and mr josiah manful 's wounds were so horrific they looked like gunshot victims , with one eyewitness likening the attackers to ' a pack of wild animals ' , the old bailey heard
' less than a minute later those two men were fatally wounded , having been stabbed in a swift , frenzied utterly brutal attack than left josiah manful with 13 wounds and carriere with eleven , ' said prosecutor hallam
during the attack aaron carriere managed to answer his phone and gasp ' help me ' to an associate who heard the sound of repeated blows
josiah manful managed to stagger out of the car but collapsed on the bonnet while his friend died in the car
mr hallam added : ' the extent of the injuries of the victims was such that it initially looked as though they had both been shot
' mr aaron carriere was a ' successful drugs dealer ' selling crack cocaine , heroin and cannabis on the streets of leytonstone and , unbeknown to him , was the subject of an undercover police probe
the old bailey ( pictured ) heard mr aaron carriere and mr josiah manful 's wounds were so horrific they looked like gunshot victims , with one eyewitness likening the attackers to ' a pack of wild animals ' on the night he died , he had been dealing drugs and may have been planning to sell more because he had four packages of crack and eight of heroin rolled together and hidden in his underwear as well as Â£ 700 cash in his bag
mr josiah manful was apparently worried for his safety because at the time of his death he had a lock knife hidden in his boxer shorts , the jury was told
devonte campbell , casey jones , alex bernard , and omar hassan , all from east london , denied two counts of murder
wail alawi , 23 , abraar amin , 18 , and the 17 - year - old , who can not be named for legal reasons , also from east london , were cleared
it can now be reported that devonte campbell , a known gang member , was serving a suspended jail sentence at the time of the killings
in january last year , he was handed 16 weeks ' jail , suspended for 12 months , and disqualified from driving for 18 months for perverting the course of justice , dangerous driving and driving without due care and attention .
