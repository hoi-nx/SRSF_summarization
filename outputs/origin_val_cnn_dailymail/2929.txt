' andrews , who was signed to play maria for a fee of $ 225,000 ( Â£ 150,000 ) , without any share of the profits , had to have her hair and clothes refreshed after each of the nine takes it took to get the scene completed
in his book â the sound of music story â santopietro details how having been knocked down on half of the ten takes , even the placid actress â finally got so angry i yelled , â that âs enough ! â â but she could nât be heard over the sound of the helicopter , and the pilot interpreted his star âs hand signals as a thumbs - up gesture of , â you âre doing great â let âs go for one more
â andrews , who was 28 during the filming , told diane sawyer said that the brook , which was actually plastic filled with water , was also brought in by the movie studio and the birch trees were also brought in
in his book santopietro writes how helicopter rentals were very expensive , and the budget was so slim on the film that with only the first half of the number requiring the use of the helicopter , as soon as the shot was captured , the pilot would instantly fly to obersalzberg for the filming of the movie âs finale : the von trapp family âs escape over the alps into switzerland
there was no money for even one more day âs helicopter rental
the story â based on fact â of maria von trapp , an austria nun turned governess who married into a musical family and defied the nazis , inspired devotion and ardent fervour
on every continent where it played it set one box office record after another
it ranks as the fifth highest - grossing film of all time ( when gross is adjusted for inflation ) and is , arguably , the most beloved film ever
