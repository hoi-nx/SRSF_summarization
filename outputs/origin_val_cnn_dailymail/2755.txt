meets gay icon : the 18 - year - old met german filmmaker and gay activist rosa von praunheim ( left ) at court in berlin today at first he struggled to find refuge and says the lack of accommodation or shelter for vulnerable young men is another important point he wanted to highlight with his case
he eventually found a home with an organisation called papatya , which is aimed at housing vulnerable girls and young women
he was later invited back home by his mother , with his father supposedly at work , and returned only to be kidnapped
the family had hoped to smuggle him back to lebanese with a forced marriage in mind , but were stopped by authorities on the romanian - bulgarian border and brought back to berlin
despite nasser 's father and uncles not turning up in court for their sentence , the defiant teenager saw the day as a victory
he was pictured wearing a badge saying ' stop homophobia ' and a rainbow wristband in widely - circulated photos - making sure that he brought his cause to the widest audience he could reach
making a stand : the teenager hopes his case will raise the profile of the struggles faced by gay muslim men
