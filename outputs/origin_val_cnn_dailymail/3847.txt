the doomed mh370 was taken on an emotional â last farewell â fly - past of the pilot âs home island of penang before being deliberately landed on the water and sinking intact thousands of miles away , according to a britain pilot who claims to have identified its final resting place
the unusual overflying of penang is â perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator â he says
the theory of hardy , a senior boeing 777 captain with a major commercial airline , has gained support from one of britain âs top flight safety specialists , learmount of the respected flight international magazine and flightglobal website
he has concluded that the search in the vast indian ocean being conducted by the australian transport safety bureau ( australian transport safety bureau ) is about 100 nautical miles away from the where the aircraft actually is
he also believes the riddle of the aircraft âs odd dog - leg flight path immediately after take - off from kuala lumpar is down to the aircraft performing a final â fly - past â of malaysia âs penang island to allow someone to have â a last emotional look
â captain hardy notes from his research that the captain of the lost boeing 777 777 - 200 , shah , came from penang , while first officer mh370 was from selangor
details are reported in the sunday times
captain hardy says that after taking off from kuala lumpur at 16.41 gmt on march 7 last year , flight mh370 lost contact with air traffic control at a point over the china sea where four flight information regions intersect
the last verbal contact had been at 19.19 and the captain âs was the last voice heard
captain hardy said the flight did something â quite remarkable â by flying in and out of the airspace of malaysia and thailand eight times noting : â i âve never seen anything like that but it is a good way to cause confusion between the controllers
â the captain of the lost boeing 777 777 - 200 , shah , left , came from penang , while first officer mh370 was from selangor , right missing : searchers scouring huge swathes of the world 's oceans for the jet have so far found no sign of it after flying along the border the passenger jet performed a sharp u-turn towards penang , one of three turns made in quick succession
' it took me months to work out what this was
' the clue was ayers rock , â he said referring to the giant natural feature and landmark in the heart of australian
' i have done the same manoeuvre there , to look down and get a great view
somebody was taking a last emotional look at penang
â he explained : â i thought of this at 5am , went downstairs and researched where the air crew were from
â noting that pilot shah was from penang while co-pilot hamid was from selangor , he said : â someone did a nice long turn and looked down on penang
it âs perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator
â military radar gave the last fix of the flight at 18.22 gmt heading south towards the navigation waypoint anoko
it then flew straight for thousands of miles before , it is believed , ending up at the bottom of the sea off the coast of australian
australian investigators believe the plane crashed
but captain hardy believes it was deliberately landed on the water and then sank intact close to a trench in the sea â explaining why no wreckage has ever been found
australian investigators said they had been in touch with captain hardy and described his theory as â credible
â flight magazine âs mr learmount said : â since capt hardy revealed in flightglobal / flight international his calculations about where mh370 is likely to have come to rest , the australian transport safety bureau â leading the mh370 search team â has spoken at length to him
â despite worldwide interest in his work , nobody â yet â has suggested his calculations are anything but logical and mathematically sound
