ewan was kicked and punched in the playground of living faith lutheran primary school at murrumba downs in brisbane 's north two weeks ago
he was left with some ' cracking bruises ' and clear psychological effects , but his father anthony says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist
ewan was kicked and punched in the playground of living faith lutheran primary school at murrumba downs in brisbane 's north two weeks ago mr ewan was told by the school the group of boys - aged five and six - organised for the on - duty teacher to be distracted so they could carry out the attack on february 26
' ewan told me he was tricked into playing with the boys
they lured him behind the building and when he tried to run away they chased him and caught him , ' mr ewan told daily mail australia
' they dragged him back and started kicking and punching
' the bruises are still there on his knees
he had a couple on his arms and chest
luckily he did n't have any broken bones or blood gushing out
' his parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as ' restorative practice '
' they made ewan go back to face all five boys so they could see what the bullying had done to him - how traumatic is that ? ' he said
' he went to sleep that night with a stick to protect himself
i sat on the floor of his bedroom
' ewan was left with some ' cracking bruises ' and clear psychological effects , but his father anthony ( right ) says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist ewan , pictured here with his sister , was kicked and punched behind a school building by five young boys four of the boys remained in the same class with ewan the next day , while the little boy who admitted to being ' the boss of the group ' was moved to another classroom
' it 's gang violence
i ca n't believe six - year - olds can be pre-meditating attacks like this
one admitted to being the boss and getting four others involved , ' mr ewan said
the parents of all five children were called in and given behavioural orders to work on at home , while age - appropriate consequences were enforced at school
principal mueller said the school had taken swift action and were ' saddened ' by the bullying
' i fully understand the concerns of parents of any child impacted by such an incident , and by the same token , i 'm also conscious of our responsibility to teach these very young students at the infancy of their school career what is right and wrong , ' she told the courier mail
ewan 's parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as ' restorative practice ' ms mueller said the boys involved were still being monitored in the playground and consequences were being implemented at home with the support of parents
' no matter what these parents do at home to help them , these kids have got away with a slap on the wrist
if we keep letting them get away with violence , how is it going to stop , ' mr ewan said
' for my own child 's safety i have to rely on other parents to take a proactive approach
' mr ewan said he was hesitant to take ewan back to school the day after he was bullied but did n't want him to fear it altogether
' i just sat him down and told him what they did was wrong
i still sit there asking if he 's okay
he 's been really quiet and shut down
' i do n't know how much it 's going to affect him
i still ca n't believe it happened
