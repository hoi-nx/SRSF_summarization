a couple that made headlines around the world when their baby son allegedly spontaneously burst into flames four times are back in the news after their second newborn baby son also caught fire
in the first incident in 2013 the couple 's first baby , rahul , ended up in the intensive care ward at a hospital in south - eastern india 's viluppuram district , in the tamil nadu state , after neighbours had heard him screaming , and rushed into the house from outside to discover the child on fire in his cot
his mother , who was working in the fields , took him to hospital and since then he has caught fire another three times , she claimed
india mother rajeshwari karnan claimed that her 10 - day - old baby son ( pictured ) spontaneously combusted medics at the government kilpauk hospital said that the boy had about 10 per cent burn damage to his feet one of the first serious accounts of it appeared in the august journal philosophical transactions of the royal society in 1745 , which recorded how a 62 - year - old italian countess had gone to bed one night feeling â dull and heavy â
the next morning , all that was found in her bedroom was a pile of ash and her legs
many other cases followed , and by 1806 , one scientist thought he had the answer
in an essay on the combustion of humans , pierre lair suggested that the problem was the demon drink , and he subtitled his article , products of the abuse of spirituous liquors
the explanation that alcohol was to blame quickly caught on , especially among moralists who were against the hard stuff
in 1832 , a popular victorian magazine claimed all those who suddenly burst into flames were â habitually drunken â
the notion was so widespread that when charles dickens included an episode of spontaneous human combustion in his 1852 novel bleak house , the victim â the villainous mr krook â was said to be â continual in liquor â
british research biologist ford argued in two articles , one of which appeared in the new scientist , that spontaneous human combustion may be caused by a chemical called acetone that is produced naturally in the body , the chemical often used as a solvent in nail - varnish removers
in healthy humans , acetone is normally disposed of through urine , but when people suffer from certain illnesses , acetone levels can build up in the body , and can even be smelled on the breath
on the website mumsnet , one poster wrote that her young daughter had ' acetone breath ' , and that ' apparently children have higher than normal acetone levels '
professor ford has noted that many of the people who have combusted spontaneously were unwell at the time , and as a result , may have developed a condition called ketosis , in which acetone in the body increases
ketosis can have a range of causes , including alcoholism , diabetes , a high - fat diet , and even , in babies , teething
furthermore , acetone infuses itself well into human fat
and it is also extremely flammable
unable to find a human volunteer to test his theory that a build - up of acetone causes spontaneous human combustion , professor ford made a model from pieces of pork - the animal flesh that most closely approximates ours
the ' pork puppet ' was marinated in acetone , dressed in clothes , and placed in a chair
professor ford then held up a gas lighter , and the result was dramatic
the ' body ' burst into a fireball , and in under an hour , it had been completely consumed by flames
in fact , the acetone was so volatile , that even just a static spark from synthetic fabrics could have caused the conflagration
all that was left - as is so often the case with spontaneous human combustion - were the legs , which professor ford suggests remain unburned because there is not enough fat in that part of the body to store the flammable acetone
for a year - and - a - half , however , there have been no more incidents , until now , after the same problem returned to affect his newborn brother
the child , not named , was rushed into the government kilpauk hospital by his mother , rajeshwari karnan , who claimed that her son 's feet had spontaneously combusted while she was in the bath and that she had managed to beat out the flames before rushing him to hospital
medics said that the boy had about 10 per cent burn damage to his feet in an incident that happened when he was 10 - days - old
rajeswari said she had heard him screaming and found his feet on fire in a repeat incident that mirrored the ' spontaneous combustion ' of his older brother
after over a month in neonatal intensive care unit , the burns have healed and the baby is now fit for discharge , according to hospital dean narayana babu
however , social workers are now looking at the issue of whether it is safe to release the child back to his parents
he said : ' all tests reveal he is completely normal , and the parents too , went through psychiatric counselling and were found to be normal
' however medics are still reluctant to hand the child over for fears that one of the parents , they suspect the mother , is suffering from the munchausen by proxy syndrome in which a parent seeks to harm their child in order to get attention
child psychiatrist shiva prakash srinivasan told local media : ' this need for attention is fulfilled by bringing the child into a hospital with a medical condition , and getting attention , and in this case with worldwide headlines there was certainly a lot of attention
' spokesperson for tulir - the centre for the prevention and healing of child sexual abuse-vidya reddy said : ' from all that i have read , it definitely seems like the mother has this syndrome
it is vital that she be assessed appropriately and helped as soon as possible
also , the child protection systems in the state must intervene in this case immediately
' rajeshwari karnan , 25 , said the suggestion that she had caused the fire that damaged her two sons was ludicrous
she said that she and her husband karnan perumal , 28 , had been the only ones around each time the incident happened but it was ridiculous to suggest either of them were to blame
at the time speculation had circulated around the world that baby rahul was a victim of spontaneous human combustion
the couple also have an older daughter , narmatha , who has not yet been a victim of the condition
medics who suspect the mother is to blame for the incidents pointed out that the phenomenon has never been proven to exist , given the large amount of water the average human body contains
crematoriums use at least 30 cubic metres of gas , along with 600 cubic metres of pre-heated air , to incinerate a corpse

in the case of baby rahul , doctors found average levels of acetone
but many believed the parents and a large amount of money was raised to help them after they were forced out of their village with locals fearing that the baby might start a major fire
they were even bought a new house with the money and sceptics say the family are clearly looking for another handout by producing a second burning baby .
