a former scout saved by hero pilot harrison ford after getting lost while on a camping trip has told the injured star : ' get better soon , my family is thinking of you
' cody clawson says ford is a ' genuine hero ' after saving his life in a dramatic helicopter rescue back in 2001
cody clawson was just 13 when he lost the trail during a boy scout camp in a remote forest just south of wyoming 's yellowstone national park
he was missing for almost 19 hours and helicopter pilot ford â who lived part - time in jackson , wyoming at the time - joined a massive search - and - rescue mission to find him
he shone his belt to flag ford down ' genuine hero ' : cody clawson , now 26 and married with a son , hails the star wars actor as a real life star cody clawson , now 26 , recalls : ' we had just got to the camp and started unloading and i started to follow somebody who i thought was my dad
' i lost track of him and before i knew it i was completely lost
' i was just 13 , i was pretty scared
i stayed where i was for about half - an - hour but no one came , so i started wandering , then i got really lost
' i was missing overnight , it had rained and snowed that day so it was freezing cold
' i was soggy , tired and hungry
i found a cave to take shelter and curled in to a ball
' i was so tired i slept on and off
' cody clawson said he prayed to be rescued and was was only comforted by his religious beliefs
' in the night i guess i had an epiphany or whatever you want to call it and the next morning i knew where i needed to go , ' he said
' i walked for a good few miles before i started hearing the search planes
i found a clearing next to a steep rocky outcrop and started making my way up
he was able to find a cave to sleep in and navigate himself but eventually , cody clawson was stuck and afraid ' i was about to start climbing it and that 's when i saw the chopper
' cody clawson had seen ford 's helicopter circling above him but then suddenly the aircraft vanished from view
' i had a scout belt on which had a shiny brass buckle and i used it to reflect the sunlight to get their attention , ' he said
' i was definitely glad of my boy scout training at that point , but then the chopper passed over and had gone
' i thought they had n't seen me , i felt terrible and got a little depressed
' luckily for cody clawson , harrison ford had spotted the teen and had set down his helicopter on the crest of a nearby hill
cody clawson recalled : ' this guy came down and was shouting my name
' i was so relieved , he said , " we 're here to get you , but you 'll never guess who 's flying the helicopter ? " ' in my mind i was like , " i really do n't care " , i just wanted to get out of there
' but he said it was harrison ford and i did n't believe him
' cody clawson said he did n't realize the rescuer was telling the truth until he got in to the back of the chopper
' the pilot turned round and said , " good morning "
' the way he said it reminded me so much of his role of hans solo in star wars
then i was like , " oh my god , han solo has just rescued me , how cool is that "
' i thought i was delirious at first but then realized i was n't dreaming
' harrison ford flew the boy to a make - shift search and rescue headquarters that had been set up in the area
' they said the camp was a mile - and - a - half from where i was so i was walking in the right direction , ' he said
' when we landed harrison ford came over to me and said : " boy , you sure must have earned a merit badge for this one
" ' but i told him i 'd already earned this badge last summer , and he laughed
avid flyer : harrison ford , 72 , has been a trained pilot for more than two decades and has a bevvy of aircraft here he is pictured on an airfield surveying the fare
cody clawson said he looked like hans solo in the driving seat crash : on thursday afternoon , ford crash - landed his vintage spitfire on a los angeles golf course handled : experts hailed the landing as ' perfectly executed ' as it was his only option when the engine failed ' he had always been somebody i looked up to and appreciated
' and what he did gave me a different perspective on stars
they sometimes get portrayed as snobby people , but there really is good , generous people out there
' and to me harrison ford is one of those good people who we 're lucky to have as an influence on our lives
' at the time cody clawson recalls ford being interviewed about the rescue and the indiana jones actor said : ' i 'm gon na fly anyway so i met as well fly search and rescue and help people
' then teton county sheriff bob zimmer said ford 's volunteer efforts saved the department $ 1,000 an hour , the amount it would have cost to hire a private pilot
cody clawson admitted he was a little embarrassed by the incident but added that he was very popular with the kids on camp when they found out who rescued him
he said : ' the kids asked if i got an autograph but i told them , ' no , but i got a hug and a handshake , and that 's better '
these days cody clawson , who lives with wife kelsi and their 16 - month - old son kael in ogden , utah , works for a medical company making filters for dialysis machines
life imitating art : ford is perhaps best - known for his role as inter-galactic pilot hans solo in star wars in the role , played alongside mark hamill and carrie fisher , he flew the fictional millennium falcon aircraft he said that when he heard the news that harrison ford had crashed his vintage plane in venice , california and had been injured , he was ' shocked ' and ' genuinely concerned '
' this guy saved my life , the first thing i thought is ' is he alright ' , ' cody clawson said
' i appreciated what he did for me all those years ago and i just hope he gets better and can help other people in future
' he 's a genuine hero , not just in the films , he 's a great man
' it 's not the only time ford has been involved in a dramatic rescue
in july , 2000 the actor rescued sarah george , 20 , after she got in to difficulties on table mountain in wyoming
george and her friend freeman , 22 , were on a five - hour climb of the 11,106 - ft mountain on july 31 when heat , altitude and dehydration left george sick and unable to take more than a couple steps
after another hiker called for help on a cell phone , the star wars star took to the air
ford landed his helicopter in a meadow and picked up george ; freeman was told there was n't enough room and had to hike down
' he was wearing a t - shirt and a cowboy hat , ' george told abc news
' he did n't look like i 'd ever seen him before
' the ailing george vomited into the hat with about a minute to go before landing at jackson 's st. john 's hospital
' i ca n't believe i barfed in harrison ford 's helicopter , ' she said .
