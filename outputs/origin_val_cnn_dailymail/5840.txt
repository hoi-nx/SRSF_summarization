attique sami , 44 , was the third member of a drug smuggling crime gang to be jailed over the plot when he received a sentence of 19 years yesterday attique sami of ilford was found guilty of conspiring to import and supply heroin following a trial at luton
his conviction follows the sentencing of two other men , noman qureshi , 32 , from bradford , and israr khan , 35 , from luton , in october last year
they were sentenced to 21 and 18 years respectively
the smugglers did not realise they were already under surveillance by a crack team from the nca soon after the container ship arrived at the port in suffolk in december 2013 on the evening of friday 6 december 2013 , noman qureshi drove from his home in bradford , picked up israr khan in luton , and drove to a hotel in ilford
attique sami arrived in his porsche 911 to meet with them to discuss where to unload the heroin from the car
the jaguar , which had been shipped to the uk from pakistan , was driven on the back of a low - loader to an address in dagenham during the early hours of 7 december noman qureshi and israr khan met it , but shortly after left the scene
they were arrested later that morning in luton
the jaguar was seized and examined by specialist border force search officers
they recovered 316 separate packages of heroin totalling 230 kilos
if cut and sold the drugs would have had a likely potential street value of Â£ 37.2 million
attique sami was arrested in february 2014
nca investigators linked him to a phone that had regularly been used to contact noman qureshi prior to the heroin importation
the class a drug was packed into the boot ( pictured ) , dashboard , central console and spare wheel compartment
even the car 's engine had been removed to make room for the lucrative haul black packages of heroin appear to be concealed inside the back seats , removed by police paperwork with the vehicle made out it had been shipped to the uk to be repaired

police said they were part of an international crime group national crime agency branch commander david norris said : ' attique sami played a crucial part in this conspiracy - his role would have been to recover the drugs concealed within the car
' this group had international contacts and planned to import hundreds of kilos of high - purity heroin to the uk in what was a quite remarkable smuggling attempt
' the car in which the drugs were hidden had virtually every spare bit of space filled with heroin
' but they were unaware their moves were being monitored by nca investigators , who prevented them from putting these harmful drugs on the streets
