for alligator handler jason mcdonald , being mere inches from the jaws of alligators is all in a day 's work
but for those of us not quite so fearless , we can see what 's it 's like to wrestle one - without the danger - thanks to the gopro he wore to capture this footage
mr jason mcdonald wore the camera as he caught bertha , a 10ft female gator who weighs 500lb , at the colorado gator farm in mosca , colorado
the 34 - year - old even opens the reptile 's mouth with his hands while an awestruck crowd watch
mr jason mcdonald , who treats and cares for the rescued animals , said he became involved with colorado gators 10 years ago , when he signed up for a wrestling class
and his work at the farm is in stark contrast to his day job as a crematory manager
he said : ' i wanted to get a pet gator and i had heard that the farm offered classes
the clip shows mr jason mcdonald as he uses a rope to handle the gators and then wrestle them with his bare hands the 34 - year - old is seen demonstrating his gator handling skills in front of a crowd at the colorado gator farm mr jason mcdonald , pictured with bertha , prefers the larger , but slower reptiles to the smaller ones who are faster ' i really enjoyed the rush i felt catching them and the experience of helping treat them for wounds and seeing them recover
' colorado gators started out as a fish farm , but in 1987 , its owners decided to buy 100 baby gators , as a means of disposing of guts and carcasses
' while we do n't breed gators , we have saved over 200 and currently have a population of around 400 , ' he added
surprisingly , he has never sustained a serious injury from handling gators - and insists he prefers catching the larger ones compared to the smaller ones , which are more mobile
he said : ' the bigger gators the less flexible and much slower as they have more mass to move
' bertha is one of the original gators we got from florida and she is extremely large - with the average size for a female being around eight foot
' we have geothermal wells that keep the water hot - that 's the reason we can have gators in one of the coldest places in the us - and it 's also why we have such big and healthy gators
