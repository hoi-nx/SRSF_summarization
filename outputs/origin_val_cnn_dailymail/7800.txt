henderson required a slice of luck after an uninspiring first half against swansea , jordi amat âs sliding tackle sending the ball ricocheting on to his shin and ultimately looping beyond the reach of lukasz fabianski
but there has been nothing fortuitous about the manner of his improvement over the past two years
he has blossomed from a player talked about in the same breath as andy carroll and charlie adam - as examples of how liverpool wasted the money from the sale of fernando torres - to england âs best midfielder
liverpool have not lost any of the 15 games where their vice-captain has worn the armband this season , winning 12 and drawing three , proving himself in the dressing room and on the pitch a worthy successor to the departing steven gerrard
henderson celebrates scoring against swansea , the latest high point in his huge improvement henderson was almost sold to fulham by rodgers but is now england 's best midfield option the former sunderland man was spoken about as a waste of money but is steven gerrard 's successor now an incredible unbeaten run in the league stretching back to december has put liverpool just two points behind united in fourth and henderson has been the key to their revival
even when he is not playing well , as was the case against swansea , the 24 - year - old is a hub of industry , harrying the opposition and straining every sinew and devoting every ounce of energy to the cause
he also keeps popping up at the crucial moments - this was his third goal in as many games and a vital one which keeps the momentum going for his side
sportsmail âs jamie carragher speaks of him as one of the best midfielders in the premier league
not bad for a bloke from wearside who runs funny
henderson was not even playing particularly well against swansea but he made the difference for liverpool liverpool have not lost any of the 15 games played by henderson as captain in steven gerrard 's absence legendary united manager sir ferguson turned down the opportunity to sign henderson that was the assessment of none other than sir ferguson , who wrote in his autobiography that steve bruce , then henderson âs manager at sunderland , recommended united sign the youngster
ferguson declined citing henderson âs gait â might cause him injuries later in his career '
of course now he is just the sort of player united would want marshalling their midfield when the sides meet on sunday in what could transpire to be pivotal in the race for the final champions league spot
henderson laughed off ferguson âs mean observation , even taking it as a compliment that the pair were discussing him
over his career so far , he has demonstrated an enviable resilience and a thick skin
when he first arrived at anfield for Â£ 16million and failed to immediately deliver on the promise shown for boyhood club sunderland he was widely , and understandably , maligned
even rodgers wanted to sell him to fulham at one point
when he first arrived at anfield , henderson failed to immediately deliver on the promise shown at sunderland ferguson turned down henderson while he was at sunderland but united could do with him now rodgers considered selling henderson to fulham but has been won round by the player 's ambition but henderson won the northern irishman round with his desire and ambition and the two have struck up a good relationship
henderson credits rodgers ' insistence that he work on his tactical nouse with his improvement
gary neville , who works closely with henderson in the england set - up , has observed a big change in him in the last 12 months and praised his fanatical approach to working on set - pieces
â he has a massive conscience in terms of caring about his game and practising on the training ground , â gary neville said on sky âs monday night football
â i remember last year seeing a big change in him in terms of training and practising free - kicks and set pieces
henderson poses with charlie adam , kenny dalglish , alexander doni and stewart downing ( left to right ) upon signing but in his early days at the club he was viewed as an example of liverpool wasting money henderson is a leader in the dressing room at liverpool , and with england , according to gary neville the midfielder accepts the congratulations of his team - mates after a hard - fought win in wales on monday â you saw him taking set - pieces with steven gerrard in the middle
who would have thought that would happen two years ago ? he is not frightened to pull people out and talk , that is why he has the captain âs armband
he is one of the leaders in the dressing room at liverpool and he is the same with england
â there may have been moments of luck along the way for henderson but his story is one of perseverance and boundless improvement
liverpool and england will hope there is even more to come
henderson initially struggled to meet expectations at liverpool but is now valuable for club and country jordi amat slides in to clear for swansea but the clearance rebounded off henderson and into the net
