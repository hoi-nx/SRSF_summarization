he has ruled out fighting fellow brit khan in order to focus on facing the winner of the fight of the century

' i 'm the world champion and i will fight some other massive name
i 'm not interested in what he does next now
' it makes sense to do a unification fight
no contact has been made yet with either of them ( floyd mayweather or manny pacquiao ) and i 'm just focusing on my mandatory challenge at the moment , but i want to be involved in the big fights
' brook had previously talked up the chances of fighting khan at wembley stadium but with all eyes on the floyd mayweather - manny pacquiao contest , which brook will be attending , his attention has been diverted elsewhere
' i want floyd mayweather , ' he said
' i want the best pound - for - pound fighter that everyone has titled him as
i want to fight the very best - i 'm in my prime , i 'm unbeaten , i 'm world champion
