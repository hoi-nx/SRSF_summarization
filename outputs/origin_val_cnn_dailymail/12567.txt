pit bulls may not be the first dogs everyone thinks of when it comes to cute , cuddly canines
but one photographer aims to change that with a new series of portraits
some very cute images of pit bulls wearing flower crowns started popping up on facebook this weekend after the sean casey animal rescue in new york posted them
they are the brainchild of new york - based photographer sophie gamand , who is partnering with shelters in new york to create pit bull portraits that make you say " awwww
" with " flower power : pit bulls of the revolution , " sophie gamand says , she hopes to " challenge the way we look at pit bulls " by giving them a softer image
gamand and sean casey animal rescue staff members credit the images with increasing pit bull adoptions since the postings
who knows , could this canine couture be part of the latest trend in weddings ?
