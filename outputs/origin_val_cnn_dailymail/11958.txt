according to the research , today âs twenty and thirty - somethings will own an average of 1.7 homes over their lifetime , compared to 3.2 homes for the over- 50s experts blamed rising prices â which have also meant higher stamp duty charges , legal fees and estate agent costs â as well as a housing shortage and stricter mortgage lending criteria which was introduced last april
many families have instead chosen to stay put and extend their current homes
and moving house has become so unattainable that many uk said they are already in their â forever â home , including one in five people in their thirties
a separate report yesterday found the affordability of homes in uk cities has deteriorated in the last year and is now at levels last seen in 2009 â with the typical price now more than six times average annual earnings
selwyn fernandes , of lv , said : â while owning your own home was achievable for the previous generation , it is an impossible dream for many today
â rising house prices and strict lending criteria are now not only preventing people from buying their own home , but they are also stopping many homeowners from moving , forcing them to modify their homes instead
â paula higgins of the homeowners â alliance , said : â this survey suggests many are stuck in homes which may be unsuitable because they can not afford to move
experts blamed rising prices â which have also meant higher stamp duty charges , legal fees and estate agent costs â as well as a housing shortage and stricter mortgage lending criteria which was introduced last april â in different stages of your lives , you have different needs
you may need to move closer to your place of work , or to good schools , or nearer to family
â you may want more green space or a more adaptable home
but lots of people are finding they are stuck in their first homes , which they struggled to afford in the first place
â transaction costs , changes to mortgage lending criteria and - critically - a woeful lack of new homes being built puts homeownership , and moving up the ladder , out of the reach of many
â the survey by lv asked homeowners whether they were in their â forever â home
they then analysed their age and how many homes they had owned previously
a separate report yesterday found the affordability of homes in uk cities has deteriorated in the last year and is now at levels last seen in 2009 â when uk was in the midst of an economic crisis
