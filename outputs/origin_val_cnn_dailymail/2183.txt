it was a feat many deemed impossible , with previous attempts ending in fatalities and failure
but in 1958 , fuch , successfully led a commonwealth trans-antarctic expedition team to complete the first ever overland crossing of antarctica via the south pole
part of the triumphant team was everest veteran george lowe , who documented the magnificent feat , and his photographs provide a fascinating insight into one of the 20th century 's greatest explorations
the crossing of antarctica , by george lowe and huw lewis-jones , celebrates the achievements of the 1957/1958 commonwealth trans-antarctic expedition team hillary joined the team for the final stages of the crossing
here , ed and bunny melt a chunk of ice in their tent to make some tea ' magga dan left us at the end of january 1957
after a frantic day of writing last letters for home , we headed down to the ice edge to wave her off
we felt no regrets as we had not been marooned ; instead our real adventure was just beginning
our thoughts turned to the huge challenges that would lay ahead to secure our way out - 2,000 miles across a continent ' despite not being as enamoured with the scenery as he was with everest , george lowe snapped amazing images of the epic voyage , but sadly died while the book he co-authored with huw lewis-jones , the crossing of antarctica , was in production
the expedition team arrived in antarctica in november 1955 , where they spent nearly two years building base camps on the continent
peter fuchs and 11 other men left a base camp on the new zealand sector of the antarctica in late november 1957 , and began the overland crossing
a further party set off from the other side of the continent , under the leadership of explorer sir hillary
' the long antarctica night was ending and darkness was giving way to the twilight weeks
having dug out the aircraft it was time to get everything set for the long journey ' the team faced harsh conditions such as snow piling up on their accommodation 's roof
the snow actually helped to keep the heat in originally the plan had been to rendezvous at the south pole around christmas , but bad weather stalled the british team about 357 miles from the pole
peter fuchs ' team arrived at the pole on january 19 , 1958 , where the two forces united to push on to scott base camp , where hillary 's party had started
the triumphant teams arrived there on march 2 , 1958 , 99 days after peter fuchs ' expedition had begun
discoveries along the way included the british team finding a 7,000 - foot mountain range , and the new zealand discovering a 9,000 - foot range
fierce winter winds scoured the ice into a large gully behind the hut at ernest shackleton
meteorologist hannes le grange documented wind speeds nearing 60 knots dog teams remained a vital part of the expedition
this shot was taken by members of the new zealand party on the skelton glacier
they were the first men to set foot there , and establishing a route up on to the plateau was crucial to the future success of the main crossing
a cavalcade of machines would roar down here in 1958 fuch received a telegram from queen after completion of the 99 - day trip
' you have made a notable contribution to scientific knowledge and have succeeded in a great enterprise , ' it read
bunny and his team were knighted for their trip , which went beyond crossing 2,500 miles of harsh terrain in the world 's most hostile climate
the comrades confirmed the existence of a single continent beneath antarctica 's polar ice cap and vast mountain ranges above sea level
discoveries along the way included the british team finding a 7,000 - foot mountain range , and the new zealand discovering a 9,000 - foot range the telegraph from the queen after their exploration said : ' you have made a notable contribution to scientific knowledge and have succeeded in a great enterprise ' sir ernest shackleton famously attempted the mission during his ill - fated endurance voyage
the book , released one hundred years after he set out , celebrates the men who succeeded where he had failed and rewrote the history books the book , published by thames and hudson , includes over 150 photographs , in black and white and colour
the pictures bring to life the day - to - day moments of the historical expedition , with the stark landscapes providing a sensational backdrop to the events
the crossing of antarctica begins with an introduction by sir ranulph fiennes , and the core chapters detail george lowe 's own account of what he experienced of the trip
peter fuchs and 11 other men left a base camp on the new zealand sector of the antarctica in late november 1957 and began the overland crossing , and would eventually arrive at the pole on january 19 , 1958 some of the pictures were taken at â 50 â° c ( â 58 Â° f ) and many are seen for the first time
sadly , george lowe died before the book was completed , but it stands as a testament to the remarkable explorer bunny and his team were knighted for their trip , which included crossing 2,500 miles of harsh terrain in the world 's most hostile climate one of our sno-cats , haywire , was returned by ship to london and then went on a tour of towns all over england , arranged by major sponsor , british petroleum
here bunny is speaking to a crowd of people in trafalgar square on may 14 , 1958 many polar experts and explorers also add their reflections in the book on antarctica , and the meaning and art of true exploration
they include sir ranulph fiennes , peter fuchs , jonathan shackleton , bã¸rge ousland , sebastian copeland , ken blaiklock , felicity aston and paul dalrymple
