the young lions converted all four of their spot - kicks , while mexico 's marquez struck the crossbar and diaz fired an awful kick out of the stadium
the game had ended 1 - 1 in normal time after chuba akpom won and then drilled home a spot kick to cancel out jose ramirez âs opener early in the second - half

the 19 - year - old , enjoying a prolific season for club and country at youth level , dusted himself off to fire home and draw boothroyd âs side level in the match
they had fallen behind three minutes after half - time when ramirez found himself totally unmarked to sidefoot a low cross past england goalkeeper walton
this encounter , under floodlights at the hive , home of conference promotion hopefuls barnet , was the first in a double - header this week , with the united states lying in wait in plymouth on sunday
mexico , who won the championship in jamaica in january , booking their spot at the under 20 world cup in new zealand later this year , were always going to provide stiff opposition
tasked with preparing another crop of players for under 21 standard , boothroyd mixed rising stars from the premier league academies with names who have featured regularly at championship level this season

daniel rios collected the ball on the edge of the area , traded passes with gama , before firing in a shot that goalkeeper walton blocked with his body
england âs first sniff of goal fell to arsenal âs chuba akpom , having his best campaign yet on the fringes of arsene wenger âs first team , but his daisy - cutter from range lacked power
one of those cross-field pings almost caught england out on 19 minutes when the impressive marquez found ramirez wide on the left
instead of looking for options centrally , he shot from a tight angle and walton gathered
nottingham forest midfielder osborn pinged a shot a couple of feet wide of the post but mexico enjoyed the best chance of the half just after the half - hour
an inswinging corner from marquez was met by gama , who had burst to the near post , but his header crashed back off the crossbar with walton beaten

two minutes after that , leicester city man barmby lost out to marquez in a battle for the loose ball and the mexican was nât too far away of steering a low shot inside the far post
it did nât take long for mexico to find the breakthrough in the second - half
from their first attack , the ball was worked quickly across from the right wing and there was ramirez , completely unmarked , to sidefoot past walton from close range
it was a frustrating goal to concede and mexico offered little respite
the half - time substitute irving lozano curled a shot just over and the visitors looked the more likely to score
boothroyd introduced one chelsea man for another when john swift came on for lewis baker , while matty grimes of swansea city replaced osborn
slowly , england started to carve out chances and a mazy run down the left from barmby saw him fire across the face of goal
their reward would soon arrive through chuba akpom and he could have won it but struck the outside of the post late on

we only showed in flashes what we 're all about individually and as a group
' i thought they were by far the better team first half , we played a little more brave in the second - half and towards the end there was only one team that was going to win the game
' but it certainly was a hard - fought one and we were up against the ropes at times
' we tried out a new system tonight because of the lack of availability of our wide players and we might need to go to toulon and play that
so it 's a good experience
