a professional cleaner who mops up after extreme hoarders has told of the disgusting conditions he comes across almost on a daily basis
marsden , who runs biohazard trauma and crime scene cleaning , has shared photographs from inside the houses he cleans up with daily mail australia
the pictures document some of the worst houses in the nation , littered with piles of rubbish , mountains of food scraps and stacks of newspapers covered in faecal matter the company is forced to clean
mr marsden assesses how dirty a house is on a scale of one to 10
homes that fall into the rating one category are those lived in by basic hoarders who collect a lot of things , whereas a rating of 10 means there is so much filth in the house that you can not see the floor , which is often also covered in animal faeces and infestations everywhere
for a three - bedroom , one - bathroom home , cleaning up can cost up to $ 20,000 if it scores a rating of 10
' it usually would take three technicians two weeks to clean a home that âs rated a 10 , ' mr marsden told daily mail australia
' a 10 has animal faeces , bug infestations ... [ people are ] just throwing rubbish everywhere , and food scraps get put in a pile
in extreme circumstances , employees wear tyvek suits to protect themselves from hazardous dangerous of their jobs ' i would rather live at the tip than live in some of these houses
at least the tip has fresh air
' one of the signs mr marsden sees that indicate a hoarder is gumboots left on the back step
he said people who had extreme tendencies would use the footwear to wade through their out - of - control homes
mr marsden said he would service houses with the rating of 10 every fortnight and three to four houses between a one and six every week
he said cleaning up after hoarders was worse than mopping up unattended deaths , where people die of unnatural causes
this was the scene of an unattended death where a body was found lying in the middle of rubbish mr marsden said most unattended deaths involved hoarders because most were ashamed to let people into their homes category 1 : organised hoarding but clean living category 2 : organised hoarding where regular cleaning should be undertaken more often category 3 : the hoarding has gotten to a point where it is now taking over living space and rubbish is now a problem inside with ants nests , roaches category 4 : in desperate need of sorting and cleaning out junk as valuable items are now mixed in with junk and rubbish category 5 : floor space half of what it should be with 50 per cent of the hoarding area now rubbish piles with some food scraps and mice infestation category 6 : on the way to becoming completely out - of - control with dog / cat urine and faeces now mixed in with the rubbish category 7 : all rubbish and food scraps , with valuable items un-noticible - only a pathway runs through the mess category 8 : same as 7 but now the pathway is also rubbish with no visible floor , several rooms used as rubbish bins category 9 : sleeping on dirty mattress or couch among the rubbish as rooms and kitchen are not accessible , food scraps thrown everywhere , roaches , bed bugs , all kinds of bugs
rats / mice and mould with dry - retching smell
place looks like a rubbish tip inside with two feet of rubbish in living rooms and higher in other rooms , non-working toilet and no running water category 10 : floor and building structure is compromised from rotting floor , walls , and too hazardous to be cleaned without a building inspection but sadly most unattended deaths involved hoarders who were ' embarrassed or ashamed ' to let people visit their homes
' the bodies tend to be on the pile of rubbish
the rubbish is completely covered in goop and bodily fluid and faeces and everything that comes out a body
cleaners are often met with two feet deep of rubbish along with caked on faecal matter on the floor inside the home of rated 8 , which means rubbish and food scraps , with valuable items un-noticible and litter - covered footpath mr marsden 's clients range from those who have mental health issues to drug addicts and alcoholics this is when a house reaches a level three on mr marsden 's ratings system , with grime and dirt caked onto the kitchen bench another home with the stove covered in grease and the nearby sink is covered in stubborn filth ' floorboards often are rotten underneath because of the filth that grows underneath
' cats and dogs that live there p * * s and crap everywhere
they usually live on the couch because there 's nowhere else for them to go
' mr marsden 's clients range from those who have mental health issues to drug addicts and alcoholics
most people would think the filth would be the most difficult to deal with but he insists it 's the hoarders who did not want to throw anything out
mr marsden said he would service houses with the rating of 10 every fortnight and three to four houses between a one and six every week one of the signs mr marsden sees that indicate a hoarder is gumboots left on the back step he said people who had extreme tendencies would use the footwear to wade through their out - of - control homes this shower has an major mould and limescale problem that has remained uncleaned for a long period of time ' we wo n't clean the property if the owner is present during the clean , ' mr marsden said
' we tell them to buy a box of stickers and go around and sticker everything with a red or green dot if they want to keep
anything that 's not stickered gets thrown out
' despite the nature of the job , mr marsden said there was no shortage of candidates looking to break into the industry
' we get calls every week from people wanting jobs
everyone wants to be a crime scene cleaner because they see it on tv shows and think it 's a cool job , ' he said .
