the union flag is to be plastered across big money projects paid for by the britain taxpayer to show the public where their taxes are spent
ministers will announce tomorrow the plan to brand roads , flood defences and broadband hubs with the message ' funded by the uk government
it will be used on projects across the britain , but will prove provocative in scotland where the move to highlight britain spending will be seen as a challenge to supporters of independence
the new logo will be unveiled by ministers tomorrow , and will be used on any project funded by the britain taxpayer treasury minister danny alexander , who is a scotland mp , will unveil the logo which will spring up in every area ' from cornwall to caithness ' treasury minister danny alexander , who is a scotland mp , will unveil the logo which will spring up in every area ' from cornwall to caithness '
under the plan , any firm who wins a britain government contract will have to agree to display the logo on the finished work
treasury insiders insist that the logo is not designed to challenge scotland nationalists , but promote the need for investment across the britain
' it is just a reminder to people that this is where their money is going
the use of the logo will seek to emphasise that major investment in big money projects is only possible thanks to the strong economic growth , and scotland as a result of remaining in the britain
however , some areas of infrastructure are devolved , so will not apply in scotland
the logo will also draw comparisons with a similar image used on foreign aid sent around the world funded by britain
it copies a long - standing brussels agreement which sees the eu flag displayed on infrastructure which it has funded
the treasury says that there is Â£ 466billion of new projects in the pipeline , which the government is helping to fund using public money
mr danny alexander said : ' i 've prioritised infrastructure in this government because only long - term investments will support britain businesses and get the public finances and economy on a firm footing
' it 's only right that we recognise the contribution of the britain taxpayer in supporting this economic growth , which is why i 'm delighted to launch these union flag plaques , which will proudly adorn infrastructure investments from roads in cornwall to broadband in caithness
' the move will draw comparisons with a similar logo used on foreign aid sent around the world funded by britain the plan has been drawn up with cabinet office minister francis maude , who said : ' as part of our long term economic plan , this government is investing in our nation 's physical and digital infrastructure
' whether it 's high speed 2 investment in the northern powerhouse or superfast broadband connecting cornwall and wales , all future infrastructure projects funded for by britain taxpayers will carry this simple britain flag branding
' in 2012 a similar logo was introduced for foreign aid funding , which included the union flag and the words : britain aid from the britain people '
under official rules , its use is not optional but ' is a condition of accepting funding from dfid '
despite the insistence that the logo is not designed to counter scotland independence calls , ministers are understood to be concerned about the rise in support for the snp since voters in scotland rejected independence in the historic referendum held in september
the use of the logo is seen as a small step in shoring up support for the britain north of the border , with the snp set to make big gains in may 's general election
in the event of a hung parliament , labour could be forced to depend on nationalist mps for support , raising the prospect of a second referendum on independence
snp deputy leader stewart hosie described the plaques as a ' silly gimmick ' which did not disguise the coalition 's cuts to overall infrastructure spending and scotland 's capital budget
he said : ' putting a sticker on projects is a silly gimmick by danny alexander and his tories bosses , which ca n't cover over the fact that his government at westminster has slashed infrastructure spending - destroying jobs and delaying economic recovery - including cutting scotland 's capital budget by a quarter
' despite this , the scottish government is delivering over Â£ 11 billion of investment over the three years to 2015 - 16
instead of the huge cuts imposed by danny alexander and the tories , people across the britain would prefer more infrastructure investment , and fewer gimmicks
