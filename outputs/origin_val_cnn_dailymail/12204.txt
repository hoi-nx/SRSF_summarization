tikrit , iraqi while iraqi government and allied forces were on the defensive friday in ramadi , they remained on the offensive in tirkit -- trying to win over not only the strategic city , but the hearts and minds of its nearby residents
iraqi forces steadily bombarded the last part of tikrit still controlled by isis , with fighting described by one wounded man as intense
still , even as it fends off this assault , the militant group continues with its barbaric tactics
" yesterday , bodies floated down the ( tigris ) river from the hospital , " said saber kraidi , an eight - year iraqi military veteran
" they were people from tikrit executed by isis
" the iraqi military is joined by some sunni fighters and a predominantly shiite militia , working together to retake the city best known to most westerners as the hometown of former dictator saddam hussein
they are working on not just winning the battle , but securing the peace
members of the badr organization , a powerful shiite armed group , handed out food and supplies friday to residents of the sunni village of albu safah , whose 30 families have been holed up the last 10 months amid the fighting
the village 's leader , jamid , said the shiite fighters ' efforts were working
" they 're good , " jamid said
" if someone is sick , they 'll take them to the doctor , even at 2 or 3 in the morning
" if it were n't for them , isis would have slaughtered us
" in june , tikrit fell to isis , which has conquered large areas of iraqi and syria and claimed them as part of its islamic caliphate
there have several attempts to take it back since then , all of them failures
the latest push began this month , involving around 30,000 fighters
by thursday , the government controlled about 75 % of the besieged city , with about 150 holdout isis fighters controlling the rest , said main al-kadhimi , commander of the hashd al-shaabi militia
there was no independent confirmation of such a significant advance by the iraqi forces
but they have been making progress in recent days
that includes gaining control of tikrit military hospital , a few blocks south of the presidential palace , on wednesday
the goal is that , if iraqi and allied forces can take tikrit , then they 'll have more realistic hope of similarly winning back mosul -- a city that 's nearly 10 times bigger
yet , even if isis is losing ground in tikrit , that does n't mean it 's not a dangerous , destructive force elsewhere
case in point is happening about 100 miles south of tikrit in ramadi , which the extremist group began assaulting on wednesday
faleh al-issawi , deputy head of the anbar provincial council , has said officials believe the ramadi assault " is an isis response to the tikrit operation
" more than 40 iraqi soldiers died when isis blew up the iraqi army headquarters near ramadi in iraqi 's western anbar province , an anbar provincial leader told cnn on friday
isis fighters there dug a tunnel underneath the army headquarters and detonated hundreds of homemade bombs , al-karhout , the head of the anbar provincial council , said thursday
the headquarters are located in the albu diab area , just 4 kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) north of ramadi
al-karhout denied reports that the u.s. - led coalition had bombed the headquarters
so , too , did the u.s. government , with its baghdad embassy stating friday that no coalition aircraft were even in the area a statement released early friday by the u.s. - led coalition against isis said the iraqi security forces had successfully repelled the isis attack on ramadi , despite coming under attack from several directions
" the successful defense of ramadi by isf is another example of their increasing ability to defeat daesh in multiple locations and prevent the terrorist group from gaining ground , " said lt. gen. james l. terry , the coalition force 's commander , using another name for isis
" the isf continues to hold terrain in some locations while making gains in others
" in an audio message posted thursday , isis spokesman abu mohammed al adnani called reports of victories by coalition members against the extremist group " delusional and fake
" he spoke of the coalition 's use of fighter jets , heavy artillery and tanks , saying it is a " nightmare and will go eventually
" cnn 's ben wedeman reported near tikrit in iraqi
