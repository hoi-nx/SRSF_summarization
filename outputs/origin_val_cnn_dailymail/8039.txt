on july 6 2013 three china teenagers were killed and nearly 200 others hurt when the boeing 777 from south korea slammed into a seawall at the end of a runway during final approach to to san francisco international airport
the impact ripped off the back of the plane , tossed out three flight attendants and their seats , and scattered pieces of the jet across the runway as it spun and skidded to a stop

both died in the asiana airlines jet crash in 2013 grief : an unidentified relative of one of the crash victims cries at the asiana airlines ' counter as she and other family members check in for a flight to san francisco at pudong international airport in shanghai u.s. safety investigators blamed the pilots , saying they bungled the landing approach by inadvertently deactivating the plane 's key control for airspeed , among other errors
but the ntsb also said the complexity of the boeing 777 's auto - throttle and auto flight director â two of the plane 's key systems for controlling flight â contributed to the accident
the ntsb also faulted materials provided to airlines by chicago - based boeing 777 , saying they fail to make clear the conditions in which the auto - throttle does n't automatically maintain speed
investigators said captain lee , a seasoned airbus a320 pilot transitioning to the bigger boeing 777 , cut the autopilot on final approach into san francisco , where the instrument landing system was out of service
doing so put the auto - throttle on hold , meaning it would no longer automatically control airspeed , explained investigator - in - chief bill english
when the jet dipped below the correct glide path , captain lee reacted by pulling the nose up - but the auto - throttle , still on hold , failed to deliver an expected burst of engine power that would have enabled the airliner to make the runway
mr pitre said the passengers who settled had injuries that were less serious and have stabilized
at least 14 of the people with whom settlements were reached are minors , requiring the court to approve the agreements , according to tuesday 's filing .
