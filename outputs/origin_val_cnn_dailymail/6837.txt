pakistan - born bowler ahmed has been tipped to give england a stern examination this summer after being called into western australia 's ashes squad on tuesday
the 33 - year - old , who sought asylum in western australia in 2010 before securing residency two years later , is one of 17 players selected for both the five - ashes test series and a preceding tour of the west indies
ahmed took 48 wickets during victoria 's triumphant sheffield shield campaign , catching the eye of national selector marsh , who feels the spinner can make life difficult for england 's batsmen when the ashes series starts in july
ahmed celebrates after taking eight wickets for victoria in the sheffield shield final last week ahmed bats for victoria during the sheffield shield final with western australia in hobart ' him being a leg - spinner as opposed to a finger spinner gave him a slight advantage , ' marsh said at a press conference organised to announce the squad
' believe it or not , western australia is always looking for leg - spinners
we 've had a proud history of leg - spinning in this country and we want that to continue
' ( ahmed ) does n't bowl too much rubbish and he creates a lot of pressure
' he has men around the bat in most instances and he keeps asking the batsmen questions , which is what good spinners do
' he maintains good economy and asks questions of both left and right - handers , bearing in mind that england may have up to seven left - handers
' ahmed pictured during a one - day international with england at old trafford in september 2013 ahmed has caught the eye of australian selector marsh ( left ) , seen here with adam gilchrist there was no place for all - rounder glenn maxwell despite his world cup heroics but adam voges , the scorer of 1358 runs in sheffield shield cricket last season , will be on the plane departing for the west indies on may 19
one - day specialist glenn maxwell , named in the international cricket council 's team of the tournament following sunday 's triumph over new zealand in melbourne , made only 41 runs and failed to take a wicket against pakistan in his last test appearance for the baggy green back in october
marsh said of adam voges : ' i looked at him on four or more occasions and i thought ' i do n't know how anyone will get this bloke out ' , he was that dominant
' it was n't just the 1300 - odd runs , it was the way he made them
' it was as good a sheffield shield batting as i have ever seen
pure weight of runs , the way in which he got those runs , you could see test player written all over him
' adam voges , seen here playing for western australia , has been selected after an excellent season glenn maxwell has not been picked in the squad despite helping western australia to world cup success while fast bowler ryan harris is included , he will remain in western australia throughout the tour of the west indies , which begins in dominica on june 5 , as he anticipates the birth of his first child
after the second test in jamaica - scheduled to conclude on june 17 - he will travel to the united kingdom to reunite with his team - mates ahead of the first ashes test at sophia gardens in cardiff on july 8
james pattinson misses the trip to the caribbean due to an injured left hamstring but will be observed over the coming weeks and may become an option later in the australian winter
new south wales wicket - keeper peter nevill is included in a test squad for the first time after scoring 764 runs throughout the sheffield shield campaign
ryan harris has been selected but will miss the tour of the west indies prior to the ashes ' peter nevill has been on our radar for some time and deserves his opportunity through weight of runs and performances behind the stumps , ' said marsh
' he has also demonstrated impressive leadership qualities which have caught our eye
' also travelling are skipper michael clarke and his vice-captain steve smith , brad haddin , josh hazlewood , mitchell johnson and nathan lyon
shaun marsh , mitchell marsh , chris rogers , peter siddle , mitchell starc , david warner and shane watson complete the selection
marsh told cricketaustralia.com : ' the test team has performed very well in recent times , but the big challenge is to do that away from home
' we believe this squad has sufficient depth for these important test matches against the west indies and england and will give us the best chance of success
