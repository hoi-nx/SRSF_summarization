leeds will attempt to plunder the points from another smash - and - grab act when they take on dragons in perpignan on saturday
while the rest of the english super league clubs spend two or even three nights on their annual trips to the south of french , the leeds charter their own plane to get them in and out of the city on the day of the game
it is a move that has paid off so far , with mcdermott 's men winning on each of their last three trips to the stade gilbert brutus , and the coach believes it could be even more important this time with the hectic easter programme coming up
leeds boss mcdermott set for clash with dragons in perpignan on saturday ' there 's a lot of meticulous planning involved but it 's something we prefer to do and it 's a more efficient way of doing it , ' mcdermott said
' sometimes we do n't treat our players as robustly as they should be treated , certainly in terms of travel
' it 's worked well for us
i do n't think travelling on the day of the game is as detrimental as you would imagine , although i would n't do it every single weekend
' what it does do is help you recover for the following game
the players get to spend the night before they travel in their own bed and on the night of the game they 're back in their own bed again , albeit later than normal
' the dragons have also chartered their own plane for trips to england but they spent last week in manchester to take in back - to - back away games against the two hull fc clubs
brad singleton of leeds scores his teams third try of the game against wigan last week that exercise can only be described as a failure after frayssinous ' men lost both games , conceding 83 points in the process , but mcdermott expects them to be back to their formidable best back on french soil , where they are unbeaten so far this year
' i am sure they will be good , ' mcdermott said
' they 'll be determined to turn things around
every team has a tussle with them when they go out there
' saturday 's meeting between the clubs will be the first since the dragons ended leeds ' play - off hopes with a dramatic 24 - 20 triumph at headingley last september
leeds are still without skipper kevin sinfield , as well as prop kylie leuluai and winger tom briscoe , so liam sutcliffe , ash handley and andy yates keep their places following the win over wigan
frayssinous recalls half - back scott dureau and threequarters ben pomeroy - who has completed a one - match ban - and mathias pala to take the places of todd carney , vincent duport and michael oldfield , who were all injured in the defeat at hull fc .
