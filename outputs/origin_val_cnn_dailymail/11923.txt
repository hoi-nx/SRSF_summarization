the us study showed supplements of of purified omega 7 oil , the key fatty acid found in anchovies , could reduce harmful blood fats and boost ' good ' cholestrol anchovies could hold the key to cutting risk factors for heart disease and stroke
an extract of omega oil found in them reduced levels of harmful blood fats and boosted â good â cholesterol
the findings come from the first human trial of supplements of purified omega 7 oil , the key fatty acid found in anchovies
after just a month volunteers were found to have a 44 per cent cut in c - reactive protein ( crp ) , a marker of inflammation in the blood , along with triglycerides and bad ldl cholesterol
experts say the health benefits of palmitoleic acid , the prime omega 7 acid , are only just emerging
dr roizen , who led the us study , said â i think the major benefit come from decreasing inflammation as well as a beneficial effect on other contributing risk factors to cardiovascular disease , with no side effects that we know of
â dr roizen , professor of medicine and head of the wellness institute at the cleveland clinic , said â the trial showed inflammatory markers were reduced and the effect on good fats was a bonus
â there seems to be a lot of benefit and not much risk â this could help us tackle some of the factors made worse by obesity that can lead to heart disease , â he added
in the study , 60 adult volunteers were randomly assigned to take 220mg of palmitoleic acid once a day or an inactive supplement for 30 days
those taking part had mildly raised levels of blood fats and inflammation
after the study tests showed a 44 per cent reduction in crp , 15 per cent cut in triglycerides and eight per cent fall in ldl cholesterol â all factors linked to heart disease
levels of hdl â a good form of cholesterol â rose five per cent compared with those taking dummy capsules
the trial , published by the journal of clinical lipidology , was funded by tersus pharmaceuticals which provided the experimental capsules called provinal
provinal is available in the uk as pura 7 , a new brand of omega 7 concentrated wild anchovy oil
unlike the better known polyunsaturated fatty acids known as omega - 3s , omega - 7s are monounsaturated fats and they have different mechanisms of action
but to get the same effect from anchovies alone would mean eating a can of the fish a day palmitoleic acid was found by scientists at harvard university in 2008 to be the first fatty acid to act as a hormone in the body
it plays an important role in regulating metabolism and appears to protect against harmful processes associated with obesity - related diseases such as diabetes
dr roizen , who chairs the scientific advisory board for tersus pharmaceuticals , said people would have to eat around a can of anchovies a day to get the same amount of omega 7 oil from a daily dose of supplements
â that âs a reasonable amount of anchovies every day if you like them , but some people find it simpler and more convenient to take supplements â he added
