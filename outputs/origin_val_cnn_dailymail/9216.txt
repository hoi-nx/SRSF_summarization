her choice of thigh - high patent boots , mini skirt and above - the - knee red - and - gold bobble coat was certainly eyecatching
if theresa may âs intention was to upstage angelica rivera , mexico âs rather beautiful first lady , then she succeeded â though unfortunately not for the right reasons
rather , the home secretary looked a disturbing mix of one part dominatrix and one part fifties housewife , with those gloves that put me in mind of a pair of marigolds
home sexetary ! sporting s&m thigh boots , miniskirt and red and gold bobble coat this week , may goes into fashion meltdown on her way to meet the queen and the president of mexico at 58 , what may appears to be suffering from is a classic 50s fashion crisis
having been there , i know the form this crisis takes
one day you survey yourself in the mirror and decide you âre looking like a middle - aged frump and that if you do nât watch out you âll soon be morphing , before your time , into a little old lady
your wardrobe is in a rut
you buy the same boring basics for weekends and the same smart suits or skirts and tops for work , year in year out
so , in an effort to update yourself , you rush out and start buying things that will make you feel fresher , flirtier , more youthful
unless you have teenage children to put you in your fashion place ( and may does nât have children ) , you may find yourself with a whole new wardrobe that just does nât chime with your looks , age or , in may âs case , profession
husbands , being husbands , tend not to notice these things
girlfriends do nât want to upset or undermine you , so they generally keep schtum
in may âs case , the trajectory was slightly different because it appears that for one brief year in her early 50s she did hit her fashion stride with a wardrobe of flatteringly cut separates in a stylish palette of navy , white , black and taupe
it âs not known whether she feared they made her invisible , however , but what âs certain is that since 2010 her style has been characterised by eccentric and flamboyant outfits
her look has certainly changed over the years
in the early days after her election to parliament in 1997 , and the years from 2002 when she served in the cabinet , her style evolved from ill - fitting suits in drab colours to garish : think of the voluminous orange mac she wore to the tory conference in 2009
but once the tories came into power and she was promoted to home secretary , she seemed to embark on a brief transformation after losing weight and finding her fashion feet
shortly after , though , the crisis set in and has been growing worse , culminating in this week âs sartorial disaster
while her fetish for s&m style boots â she also wore them in 2013 for the south korean president âs state visit â is fifty shades of embarrassing , i can empathise
when my marriage broke up in my mid- 50s , i bought a pair of similar boots in suede rather than patent or pvc , but after catching my reflection one day in a shop window , i thought : â who am i trying to kid ? â admittedly , my 50s fashion panic was partly about attracting men in the wake of my divorce , which is not an issue for the happily married may
but it reflects a loss of fashion confidence at this stage of our lives when the shops are full of temptations that look great on hangers and 25 - year - olds , but not necessarily on us
the big difference between may and rest of us , of course , is that her fashion faux pas have to be played out in the full glare of the camera
if you play it safe , as the duchess of cambridge does , you get criticised for being bland
go too trendy and you will be mocked for trying too hard
perhaps , when it comes to fashion , may should take a leaf out of sam cam âs book
the prime minister âs wife always looks elegant and low - key , while promoting british fashion to an international audience
theresa may is an attractive woman and has shapely and slender legs that are amazing for a woman of any age , but if when you think of the home secretary the first thing that springs to mind is her footwear and snazzy coats rather than her policies , she âs getting something wrong
february 2000 mp may is a relative new girl , opting for sombre grey suit and pearls
but even then , the leopard - print bag and slit in her skirt hint at a wilder side october 2004 not just any old mac for the tory party conference â but a pepto-bismol pink mac , with extra wide - legged trousers and clashing red shoes december 2005 black suede boots and a techni - colour nightmare coat at a party to celebrate david cameron becoming tory leader october 2009 an unflattering bright orange raincoat , possibly made out of a hot air balloon , for the tory conference july 2010 despite the creases , this is a flattering suit with stylish accessories
an outfit that says may means business september 2010 on trend in an elegant floral cocoon coat
just a shame about the mismatched bag and shoes october 2010 leaving a cabinet meeting at downing street in a winning combo of ice - blue silk jacket and flattering palazzo pants , teamed with a stylish bag may 2012 time to remind her that less is more ? at no 10 , the multi-coloured jacket overwhelms the skirt , which looks as if it is caught in her knickers november 2013 first outing of the stuart weizman kinky boots and another knock - â em - dead coat for a state visit
it âs hard to imagine what she has to smile about in this garish outfit october 2014 ditch the girly bow and inexplicable gauntlets and may would look wonderful for a visit by the president of singapore
over-icing the cake is never a good idea but it seems she ca nât help herself
