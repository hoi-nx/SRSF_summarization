islamabad , pakistan police have arrested more than 500 parents in and around the northwestern pakistan city of peshawar for not allowing their children to get the polio vaccine , an official said tuesday
peshawar deputy commissioner mehsud told cnn that the 513 arrests took place monday and tuesday as part of a government campaign to administer polio vaccines in parts of pakistan 's khyber pakhtunkhwa province
those arrested will be released on bail if they sign an affidavit stating that they will let their children get vaccinated , according to the deputy commissioner
pakistan 's vaccination rate is inordinately low for a number of reasons , including attacks on medical workers , the displacement of people due to ongoing military operations and a lack of trust by some families
whatever the reason , the fact that a large number of children are not immunized is having an impact
such vaccines are credited with wiping out polio in most parts of the world
but pakistan is an exception , according to the global polio eradication initiative , a public - private partnership that includes the world health organization and unicef ( unicef )
the south asian nation leads all others in new polio cases in recent years , and has nine of this year 's 10 reported cases
in 2014 , pakistan had 327 cases
the next closest country was nigeria , with 36 cases
authorities in khyber pakhtunkhwa province hope to ensure that 2.7 million children there get vaccine drops
they 've learned about more than 13,000 cases in which parents have not done so since a provincial campaign began two weeks ago , mehsud said
dr. ahmad , a unicef team leader based in pakistan , called authorities ' unprecedented move a last - ditch effort to clear polio from " cluster " zones where large numbers of families have refused to get their children vaccinated
" first the workers ( try to ) convince them , then their supervisors , then senior members of the community , " ahmad said
" ( this government action ) is the final step in eradicating this issue
" polio is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children , sometimes leading to paralysis and death
the virus is easily preventable through immunization , but there 's no cure once it is contracted
it went from being a health issue to a security issue after u.s. intelligence officials used a vaccination program to help in their hunt for osama bin laden in 2011
under cover of the program , the cia sought to collect dna samples from relatives of the al qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in abbottabad , pakistan
cia policy : wo n't use vaccination programs as part of operations those administering the vaccines have become targets , with the national emergency operations center reporting that more than 70 medical workers have been killed in attacks since december 2012
and in june 2012 , pakistan taliban commander bahadur announced that polio vaccines would be banned in another pakistan province -- north waziristan -- because of drone strikes there
bahadur called the strikes " worse than polio
