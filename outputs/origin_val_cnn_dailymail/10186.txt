swirling through the air in mesmerising saucer - like shapes , these exceptionally rare lenticular clouds are the most common explanation for ufo sightings
the remarkable - looking disc shapes were spotted by amateur photographer glenn spencer , 42 , in the sky above chester in cheshire
the formations , also known as wave clouds , were scattered over miles , producing a stunning spectacle
rarely seen in the uk , lenticular clouds are formed when a tall geographic feature , such as the the top of a mountain , obstructs a strong wind
the interruption in airflow creates a wind wave pattern in the atmosphere on one side of the mountain and at the top of these waves , moisture in the air condenses and forms a cloud
as air moves down into the trough of these waves the water evaporates again , leaving behind clouds in a characteristic lenticular shape
mr glenn spencer noticed them while driving to the shops and was so amazed that he stopped the car to retrieve his camera from the boot
he said : ' i tried to follow them to higher ground to get a good view
they were just so mesmerising and i thought they looked amazing
it is easy to see why people mistake them for ufo
i 've never seen anything like it
