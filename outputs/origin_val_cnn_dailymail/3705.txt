minister jo swinson said the recordings would provide evidence under new consumer rights bill people should make smartphone recordings of dealings with tradesmen , builders , decorators and even hairdressers to ensure they stick to their word , a minister said yesterday
jo swinson said the recordings would provide evidence under a new consumer rights bill that will ensure verbal agreements are enforceable
the bill will go through its final stages in the commons on monday and come into force in october , giving the public stronger powers to challenge firms that treat them badly
the consumer affairs minister said the system will make the rules on complaints and refunds much clearer for the public and businesses
the bill also includes new rights for people who buy and download content from the web , whether it is a hollywood film , a computer game or a song
the minister said the recordings of conversations with traders should be made openly and would form part of any legally - binding agreement , along with documents , emails and text messages
she said they could be used in many circumstances , including a hairdresser promising to cut hair in a particular style
her comments follow the controversy triggered by shadow chancellor ed balls , who suggested families should demand receipts from small traders to help ensure tax is paid
miss jo swinson , a liberal democrat , stressed that verbal agreements will have the force of a written contract from the autumn , particularly if they are backed up with a recording
â if you make a verbal agreement with a trader , then that forms part of the contract , â she said
â if you say i want you to paint my bathroom a particular shade of mint green , but they then use a different one , then they have not delivered what was agreed
â it is important for people to have agreements and to have a note of those
email will be one way that a lot of people do that , sometimes it might be a text message
people could also use their phone to record the conversation , if both parties found that was an easier way of doing it
â the minister stressed she was not suggesting any kind of secret recording
when asked if they could include consultations with hairdressers , the minister said : â absolutely , yes
â the minister said people should use their smartphones to record dealings with tradesmen , builders , decorators and hairdressers
miss jo swinson said the recordings with traders should be made openly miss jo swinson said in some circumstances customers would use the recordings to encourage the trader to put a job right , in others they would support a demand for a refund
she gave the example of a children âs balloon entertainer who missed a birthday party by turning up two hours later than agreed as someone who would be expected to give the customer their money back
the minister said the best option is to get a written contract , but she said traders should understand that verbal agreements are also legally binding
however , hilary hall , chief executive of the national hairdressers â federation , said her members might find the idea of being recorded â unnerving â
â i can see why consumers might want to do it , but i imagine anyone would feel uneasy about being recorded on a smartphone , â she said
â it can be hard for someone to describe what they want , and very hard for a hairdresser to exactly describe what they are going to do
even a recording wo nât resolve this , because two people can come away from the conversation with different ideas
â the sales of goods act already gives shoppers some rights to repairs and refunds
the government says the new regime simplifies existing laws .
