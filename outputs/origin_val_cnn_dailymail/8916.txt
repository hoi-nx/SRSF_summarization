but any subsequent treatment such as braces , crowns being fitted on uneven teeth or whitening can be up to Â£ 10,000 depending on what a patient decided to have done
other procedures include sonic clean and polishing â for about Â£ 130 a session â which uses air and tiny particles to blast teeth and remove stains caused by coffee , chocolate and wine
some private dentists have renamed their surgeries â spas â , greeting patients with scented candles in the waiting room and offering facials , foot massages and aromatherapy
separate figures from the british association of cosmetic dentistry estimate the number of people seeking such treatments is growing by 40 per cent a year
experts say adults are becoming more self - conscious and worry that their personal life and career may be hindered if they do nât have nice teeth
britons are shelling out thousands of pounds for private dental treatment also , medical advances have replaced traditional train - track braces with clear , barely noticeable devices costing Â£ 6,000
many are having these fitted in the run - up to major events where they will be extensively photographed such as family weddings or milestone birthdays
peter alderson , of ldf , said : â britons people have taken to cosmetic dentistry in a big way , and that âs reflected in rising incomes for top dentists
â increasing numbers of dental patients are starting to explore cosmetic treatments like laser whitening , and are willing to pay significant amounts of money for cutting - edge services , especially if they are delivered in a more exclusive , private clinic - style environment
â the biggest dental groups are able to invest very heavily in their practices â equipment , furnishings and it systems , and that has raised the stakes in the profession markedly
the younger generation of dental clients â those that are more comfortable with paying for cosmetic dentistry â expects enhanced services such as online booking and text message reminders as well as cutting - edge treatments
â if dentists want to make the most of the demand for cosmetic dentistry , they need the type of apparatus and environment that brings in clients , but that type of equipment routinely costs tens of thousands of pounds
â one popular procedure is â cosmetic bonding â , in which grey fillings or chipped teeth are painted over to make them almost invisible , costing up to Â£ 1,000
laser whitening is increasingly being offered for about Â£ 100
nissit patel , of progressive dentistry in putney , south - west london , said : â over the past five years , i have seen a huge increase in adult orthodontics , primarily for cosmetic reasons
in my practice , the business has at least doubled in the past three years
â he added that many of his patients came to him shortly before weddings or birthdays .
