education : david cameron and his wife samantha have accepted a place at a church academy a short walk from downing street for their daughter nancy david cameron is to become the first conservative prime minister to send a child to a state secondary school after accepting a place at a church academy a short walk from downing street
the prime minister has been privately worshipping at a west london church once a week , often on a weekday morning , for several years
now he and wife samantha have decided to send daughter nancy , 11 , to the grey coat hospital , a cofe school in westminster , from september
it is a significant break from tradition for a tory leader â and for the camerons personally , given that the prime minister was educated privately at eton and his wife at marlborough college
grey coat hospital is thought to have been the family âs second choice for nancy , after another church school in west london
like hundreds of thousands of parents , the camerons heard this week from their local authority which of several applications had been successful
a family friend has revealed that they have now accepted a place at grey coat hospital â a choice which will be seen as an indication of mr david cameron âs confidence that he will still be in power later this year , given its proximity to number ten
the school is rated outstanding by education watchdog ofsted and is one of the most sought - after state schools in the area , with seven applications for every place
tory chief whip michael gove sent his daughter beatrice there last year , when he was education secretary
featuring recently in tatler âs guide to the best state schools , its sixth - formers produced 71 per cent a * to b a-level grades last year
many went on to oxbridge and other elite universities
school down for video the school is ethnically mixed , with only around a third of its pupils being white
it also prides itself on being a social melting pot , with children from council estates mingling with those of middle - class professionals
headteacher sian maddrell insists on strict discipline , with pupils placed in detention if they forget books , are disruptive or even glance at the clock during lessons
they are barred from using detention time to do homework , instead being expected to read an â improving book â
the school âs official uniform outfitter is john lewis , including its upmarket west london department store peter jones
it admits girls aged 11 to 18 and boys only in the sixth form , with 151 places allocated for this year âs intake
a total of 116 are reserved for girls from practising church families , preferably with attendance for at least 40 weeks of the year for the previous five years
a further 15 go to pupils with an aptitude for languages , with remaining places filled on an open basis , with preference given to those living nearby and attending â feeder â schools
second choice : the school is rated outstanding by ofsted and is one of the most sought - after state schools in the area , with seven applications for every place the school was founded on st andrew âs day in 1698 to educate poor boys and girls so they could be â loyal citizens , useful workers and solid christians â
after a colourful history which included a murder in 1773 and a rebellion against the â dreadful conditions â in 1801 , it became a girls â day school in 1874
it is not clear on what basis nancy has been admitted , but mr david cameron is understood to have been paying regular private visits to worship at a west london church for several years
he and his family sometimes attend on a sunday , but more often he blocks out part of his diary on a weekday morning to worship alone , friends say
the camerons also applied to lady margaret school , a church academy in fulham , west london , which is rated â outstanding â , but are not thought to have been offered a place there
the prime minister sent his children to a church state primary school in kensington , which also reserves most of its places for families who are regular churchgoers
political leaders have in the past attracted controversy for sending their children to high - performing faith schools , such as the strict catholic london oratory in west london chosen by nick clegg and tony blair for their children .
