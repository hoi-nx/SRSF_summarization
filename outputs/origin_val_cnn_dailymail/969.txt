they are known as some of nature 's most reclusive predators , and it seems this owl was keen to live up to that reputation when it was spotted by a photographer in a park in the czech republic
peeking out from behind a tree , the huge bird of prey appeared to play hide and seek with senior engineer and photographer jiri michal as he tried to capture it on film
the amusing game of peek-a-boo took place in vysoka , a small village in the country 's hilly east , while the seven - year - old male owl was out hunting
surprise : a great grey owl pokes it head out from behind a tree as jiri michal , 34 , a senior engineer and photographer , captures the bird of prey on film playing games : mr jiri michal , who spent three hours trying to photograph owls before spotting this one , said he was n't sure what the bird was doing , but it appeared to be playing a game with him mr jiri michal , 34 , of pilsen , czech republic , said : ' i was n't sure what this mischievous owl was doing , however it kept poking its head out from behind this tree as if it was playing a game with me
' owls are definitely my favourite birds
they have amazing eyes and are always pleasure to photograph
' mr jiri michal said he had been photographing the birds for three hours when he spotted this one roughly 20ft away
he added : ' this owl was not in the mood to play for too long , and straight after i took these pictures he flew off
' i 'm forever thinking up new ideas for what to photograph and i love nature as a whole
from the smallest insects to the larger birds and mammals , they must all be protected

despite owl 's reputation as night hunters , great grey owls often seek out prey during the day , perching high in branches and using their excellent hearing and eyesight to track down prey
now you see me : the great grey owl is the largest species of owl , measuring up to two and a half feet in length
despite the animal 's reputation for being nocturnal , this species often hunts during the day youngster : mr jiri michal believes the owl was a male , and was around seven years old , making it relatively young
captive birds have been known to live up to 27 years old their large face , and two disc - shaped plumes of feathers around their eyes , act as satellite dishes , filtering sound into two highly sensitive ears under the feathers
their hearing is so acute that , during the winter months , the owls often hunt by swooping low over snow drifts , listening for the sound of voles or gophers moving around underneath
their large , soft feathers and slow , deep wingbeats mean they are nearly silent as they move , so as not to scare their prey away
once they have locked on to a target underneath the snow , they will use their sharp talons to plunge through the ice and drag their meal out
while the birds are not migratory , they will roam for miles around their usual hunting grounds if prey becomes scarce .
