' what 's more , a neighbor said the children could be heard screaming ' mommy , mommy help me ' as the blaze took over the home
firefighters received a call at 12:23am about the blaze at a single - family home in midwood , a section of brooklyn known for its low crime and large orthodox jewish population
more than 100 firefighters responded and brought the blaze under control at around 1:30am
daniel nigro said the blaze started in the kitchen , when a hot plate that was left on caught fire
he added that the plate was likely kept on as it is a way to keep food warm during the sabbath without using the oven
during the sabbath , most orthodox jewish families will not light fires
he then added ; ' there was no evidence of smoke detectors on either the first or the second floor that may have alerted this family to the fire
' a smoke detector was found in the home 's basement
the mother and eldest sister jumped out windows at the front of the house as soon as they saw the flames , which raced up the stairs to the second floor where the entire family was asleep , while the other children were trapped in their rooms in the rear
the mother tried to get the children but the blaze was too fierce , and after suffering serious injuries realized her only choice was to jump out the window to find help
' my kids are in there , get them out ! get them out , ' she screamed according to neighbors who spoke with the new york post
