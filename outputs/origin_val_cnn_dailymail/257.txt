breathing : necropsy results show that the male cat , otherwise healthy , stopped breathing shortly after being darted he said that though the tranquilizer is safe when entering a muscle tissue , it can be fatal when delivered to the heart or lungs

wardens intended to release it safely back into the wild , and brennan said that it is always better if wardens do n't have to ' chemically immobilize ' an animal
usually , wardens attempt to simply chase mountain lions away from a populated area if there is a safe route available , but in this case , there was no good exit for the cat , as he had wandered into the middle of town , brennan said
