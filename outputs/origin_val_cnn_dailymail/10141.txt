cosby stood up to hecklers at a performance in baltimore on friday night
at one point during the show a man stood up and yelled ; ' 38 women spoke up and called you a rapist
38 women ! ' as fans of cosby screamed ' shut up ! ' at the man , he quieted the audience and spoke directly to the protester
' i am going to handle this the way i want it handled , ' he said
38 women ! ' ( protesters from outside his denver show earlier this year above ) ' just remain calm , ' cosby told the audience according to the washington post
' we are here to enjoy my gift
we are not here to argue
we will find them and ask them to leave
' a few minutes later , the man was located and escorted out of the 2,500 - seat modell performing arts center , which was notably empty
this as venues have stopped selling water during cosby 's performances , afraid someone may throw it at him during his set
one attendee said he only got tickets after a friend 's wife refused to go following the recent allegations , and he was more there to see the hoopla surrounding the event than the actual show
this happened on the same day two more women ( above with gloria allred ) came forward to say they were drugged and raped by cosby outside the venue , over 30 protesters greeted guests as they went into the auditorium , along with two individuals who were there in support of cosby
' i have been sexually assaulted , ' one of the supporters , zeanyanna johnson , told the baltimore sun. ' i know what it feels like
but the man has n't been charged with a crime , and the man has n't gone to court
the bible says , " judge not , lest you be judged
" ' earlier that day , two more women , margie shapiro and sunni welles , came forward to claim they were drugged and raped by cosby as teenagers
cosby has continued to maintain his innocence .
