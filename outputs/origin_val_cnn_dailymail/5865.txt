' it has hit all of us , who i know , ( who ) also know gibson , like a tonne of bricks
' ' we only knew her online , but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer , who was surviving aggressive cancer
' gibson and i talked quite a bit about my feelings about ( cancer ) , how she could empathise with me , the feelings i felt about my mother dying and how i 'd wished i was more responsible when it happened , that i 'd wished i had tried to explore more ideas , like gibson did

' i do n't care about exposing gibson
i have n't spoken to her for months , years
' i just want her to confirm or deny ( her diagnoses ) so people who put their faith in her , invested in her - they need to know
' they need to know , if they 've rejected conventional medicine on what she 's saying
' it 's their lives , it 's not a game

that 's all i want ' after three years of sometimes personal exchanges online , ms gibson and ms smith stopped talking after the development of the whole pantry app. ' if i saw gibson now , i would just ask her to tell the truth
that 's all i want
' i do n't want to see her beg people for mercy
i do n't want her to beg for forgiveness - i just want the truth
' come clean , be transparent , let the world know where you 're at
if you were misdiagnosed , own up to it
' gibson did create an exceptional application , that is loved by many , but i think she should sell it for what it is , complimentary medicines and a diet - not life saving treatment
' all people want is the truth from her
