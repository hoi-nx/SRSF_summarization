a petty feud between the two most powerful women in miliband âs inner circle has rocked the labour
the dispute between the party âs election chief powell and chief whip rosie winterton flared up over an invitation to the brit awards pop music awards on the night of a crucial commons vote
insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair â both rivals for miliband âs ear â to a head
flare - up : election chief powell , 40 , left , and chief whip rosie winterton , 56 , became embroiled in a dispute over ms powell 's brit awards plans it was caused by the desire of 40 - year - old ms powell â who is tipped as a future labour leader â to attend the brits â pre-party â where guests mingle with pop stars
but ms rosie winterton , 56 , ordered ms powell to stay at westminster for a vote called by miliband to ban mps having second jobs
one source said : â rosie winterton told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with madonna and co. â the argument reportedly intensified when powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the â second jobs â debate was partly the responsibility of labour âs shadow cabinet office team , which includes her
in the end , ms powell backed down and took part in the vote
but she still managed to get to the main brits awards event at london âs o2 arena
