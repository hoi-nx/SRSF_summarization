the company had an office account and a client account and there were clear rules stating that solicitors should only use the company 's account
but between october 2010 and december 2012 , a total of 14 cheques ranging from between Â£ 600 and Â£ 10,060 were paid out from the client account by painter

in december 2012 , a cheque for Â£ 10,060 , intended for st michael 's hospice in hereford , was put into her own bank account
it was paid in at a time when the office was officially closed for christmas and painter subsequently went on a skiing holiday for most of january with her family
judge richard rundell said : ' we live in an age when people question authority and others in positions of authority but thankfully most people consider that solicitors are honest
' most people consult solicitors , being quite sure that whatever else might happen their solicitor will behave honestly and properly
' you failed in that respect and failed quite badly
' over the space of over two years you took from this relatively small practice Â£ 50,000
' that was the most severe and gross breach of trust on the part of anyone who was then entitled to call themselves , and should have been proud to call themselves , a solicitor
' it 's difficult to imagine a more serious breach of trust
' prosecutor michael conry said the offences came to light when the office manager , sue smith , became concerned about the cheques and contacted the firm 's partner , emily gourley
she used Â£ 10,000 destined for st michael 's hospice in hereford ( pictured ) to take her family on a three - week skiing holiday to france the solicitors regulation was then notified and when police became involved , painter initially said she was trying to help the business
but at a second interview she accepted she had altered paperwork to conceal her actions
the court heard that she had said she would repay her money and accepted she had used the money for her own purposes
lister , defending , said painter became a solicitor in 2009 and had now separated from her husband
he said she was the sole carer of her 70 - year - old mother , and was also receiving benefits
mr lister added : ' she has suffered as a result of this and she has lost her good name , been struck off as a solicitor and will find it hard to hold her head up in the hereford area in future
' caldicott gallimore solicitors said it welcomed the two - year sentence handed to its former employee
a spokesperson for the firm said : ' solicitors hold a unique position of trust in society
' painter abused that position of trust and it is right that her crimes should be made public and that she should be punished accordingly
' not only did mrs painter abuse the trust that clients had placed in her , she abused the trust and good will of her business partner and her colleagues
' we would like to reassure all out clients that all client funds have been restored and that no client has lost out as a result of mrs painter 's offending
' we have worked tirelessly in conjunction with the police and the solicitors regulation authority in investigating these offences and ensuring that our clients have not suffered any detriment as a result of mrs painter 's crimes
' since april 2013 we have further strengthened our financial controls and have improved our governance in every area of our practice
' the statement added that painter 's fraud was uncovered following the firm 's own routine internal financial checks and was immediately reported to its regulator .
