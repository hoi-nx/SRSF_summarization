it has been described by guests as a night spent living like the flintstones
but the owners of this devon b&b were actually emulating the iron age - not the stone age - when they built an elaborate thatched hut , complete with open log fire , for adventurous guests
ambitious farmer , charles cole , 49 , has hand - built a primitive wooden roundhouse in devonshire , which comes complete with a six - ton thatched roof to protect guests from rain
food is available on arrival , if requested , and candles are on offer for lights pop the kettle on ! take advantage of the fire , or get a meal cooked for you upon your arrival by the hosts
the hut is designed to allow ventilation when the smoky fire is lit forget electricity , the only luxuries you will experience are candles , an open stone hearth fire , a single cold tap and a composting toilet
mr charles cole had dreamt of creating the b&b since he was a teenager , after watching a bbc documentary of a small community recreating an iron age settlement
he made the decision to make his dreams a reality and created upcott barton using materials found purely on his farm
the project was a family venture , with mr charles cole , his wife iona , 42 , and their children hedley , 23 , lizzie , 21 , may , 18 , and charity , 14 , spending six months and a total of 2,500 hours manpower to create the dwelling
they helped to construct the walls from from a sand and lime mixture , and even now it is completed , iona and lizzie help out with running its everyday bookings
he said : ' you have in the back of your head a little dream that is there all through your life
' we are farmers and we were looking at ways to try and diversify what we do and lots of farms have converted barns but we wanted to try something completely different
' we thought it can not be that hard but my grief , you would n't believe the work
' if we had known in the first place we probably would n't have started it but the roundhouse turned out far better than we thought
' the hut is 30 metres in diametre , with a six ton roof made out of 14in thick water reed thatch
the walls were made by mr charles cole and his son hedley , 25 , who trained with the royal marines and featured on channel 4 's royal marines commando school bare essentials ! switch off from the busy world , and enjoy a simple night stay in devonshire - but do n't expect a luxurious experience ! all the furniture in the roundhouse was made from mr charles cole 's 214 - acre farm
all members of the family helped out on the project , which had been mr charles cole 's dream since he had been a teenager although it is a iron age roundhouse , many guests have said they felt it is similar to fred and wilma 's home in the 1960s cartoon , the flintstones the hut took mr charles cole , his wife iona , 42 , and their children hedley , 23 , lizzie , 21 , may , 18 , and charity , 14 , six months to build , which is a total of 2,500 man hours historic roots ! allegedly the land which the roundhouse sits on today was home to the dumnonii people who inhabited the area from at least the iron age up to the early saxon period mr charles cole admitted feeling anxious that the wooden structure would fill up with smoke from the fire
the father of four said : ' the terrifying thing about it was we were not sure that the whole idea would work at all because the fire may have smoked the place out , we had to build the whole thing before we could try it out - thank heaven our fears were unfounded
' the house sleeps two to ten guests and flintstones wannabes will be relieved knowing the farm can provide meals if they do not wish to try their chances on the stove
although guests will be experiencing primitive living , it will set them back Â£ 170 a night to experience life as a bedrock resident
bookings can be made through the canopy & stars website or from the owners at upcottbarton@btconnect.com
inspiration for the home came from a fly on the wall documentary called living in the past on the bbc in 1978 , where a small community recreated an iron age settlement a fear the family had in recreating their homes was ventilation and there were concerns the smoke from the fire would fill the roundhouse , thankfully the smoke passes through the thatch , allowing meals to be cooked on the hearth the painstaking reconstruction of an iron age roundhouse was achieved by charles cole in the heart of the devonshire countryside the whole family helped out , including daughter lizzie , ( left )

mr charles cole wanted to turn back the clock for guests the six ton roof was created with 28ft long timbers from surrounding woodland and a thatcher put in the 14inch thick water reed thatch daughter lizzie did sketches of what the hut could look like , ( left ) , which look remarkably similar to the end product , which is now accepting bookings for hotel guests , ( right )
