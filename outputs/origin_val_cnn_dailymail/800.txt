southampton fear they will miss out on a permanent move for on loan defender alderweireld with parent club atletico madrid intent on sparking a bidding war for the player
the belgium international has impressed for the southampton this season prior to sustaining a hamstring injury at manchester united in january
his performances have been central to southampton 's attempt to finish in the premier league 's top four , and manager koeman wants to make the loan move permanent ahead of the next campaign
however , alderweireld 's form has not gone unnoticed elsewhere
tottenham boss mauricio pochettino is understood to be an admirer of the 26 - year - old , while manchester city remain in the hunt for defensive reinforcements with manuel pellegrini yet to find the perfect partner for captain vincent kompany

southampton have a Â£ 6.8million option on alderweireld as part of their loan deal but it 's thought atletico madrid may well use a clause in the deal that stipulates they can essentially pay Â£ 1.5m to cancel that and then sell the player to the highest bidder

southampton work to a tight budget and know they 'd be facing an uphill struggle in striking a deal with atletico madrid this summer if bigger clubs enter the race
alderweireld signed for atletico madrid from ajax for a fee of Â£ 6.2 million in 2013 , and the spanish club are keen to recoup as much of that fee as possible
alderweireld has 43 caps for belgium since making his international debut back in 2009 the 26 - year - old slides in with a challenge on newcastle united 's striker emanuel riviere ( left )
