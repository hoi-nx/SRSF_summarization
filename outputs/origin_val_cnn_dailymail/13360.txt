kiev , ukrainian the bodies of all 33 workers killed in coal mine explosion wednesday in eastern ukrainian have been recovered , officials with the donetsk regional authority said
preliminary information indicates the explosion at zasyadko mine was caused by methane gas , according to dan , the official news agency for the self - proclaimed dpr ( dpr )
" this did not happen because of shelling , " an emergency services official told the news agency
the explosion occurred just before 6 a.m. local time , when 230 people were at the mine , the official website for separatist - controlled donetsk city said
of those , 157 were evacuated in the initial hours after the blast , including 14 injured and one dead , according to the website
fifteen rescue teams are working at the scene , it said
zasyadko mine is one of the most dangerous in terms of methane in ukrainian , according to the ukrainian news agency ukrinform , which reported that 240 people had died at the mine since 1999 -- 101 miners were killed in a single accident in 2007
ukrainian prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk , speaking at a cabinet meeting , accused the pro-russian separatists who control the area of denying ukrainian rescue teams access to the site , ukrinform reported
he urged russia to tell the separatists to allow in the rescue workers
" you took millions of ukrainian in donetsk and luhansk hostage and are now brutalizing miners ' families by not letting in help , " ukrinform quoted him as saying
ukrainian president petro poroshenko also called for rescuers to be allowed in
" i demand ukrainian rescue workers and investigators to be granted access at the site of the tragedy , " he tweeted
however , dpr representative denis pushilin said ukrainian had not offered help with the rescue , and the dpr will ask russia or separatist authorities in luhansk for help if needed , according to the separatists ' news agency
separatist leader aleksandr zakharchenko issued an order to close the mine a month ago , but managers ignored the order because the mine legally belongs to ukrainian , ukrinform cited the separatist news agency as saying
a shaky ceasefire is currently in place in donetsk and the neighboring luhansk region , the center of a months - long conflict between pro-russian separatists and ukrainian government forces
