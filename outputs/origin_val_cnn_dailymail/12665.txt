two australia held by indonesia authorities for nearly a decade appear to be just days away from execution by firing squad
myuran and andrew , members of the so - called " bali nine " sentenced on drug smuggling charges , were transferred wednesday from prison to a maximum security facility where they will be isolated before being put to death
australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair
they have been jailed since april 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from bali to australia
opinion : why executions wo n't win indonesia 's drug war australia prime minister tony abbott on wednesday said " australia are feeling sick in their guts at the prospect of execution for these two
" " we abhor drug crime , but we abhor the death penalty
we think that these two australia deserve to be punished , but they certainly do n't deserve to be executed , " he said
the prime minister said people should not let anger affect australia ' relationship with indonesia
the two men will be given 72 hours notice of their impending appointment with a 12 - member firing squad once they arrive on the island of nusakambangan
but precisely when is unclear
they are among a number of people from different countries who are also scheduled for execution
the bali nine were arrested after indonesia police received a tip from australian federal police
andrew , 31 , was called the ringleader of the plot , and myuran was described as andrew 's collaborator in the scheme
seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences
police caught four people at the denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies
another four -- including myuran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of kuta
andrew was detained after a boarding a plane to sydney -- he was n't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot
the indonesia administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two australia against president widodo
the attorneys wanted a review of the president 's decision to deny them clemency
lubis , who represents the pair , said a challenge had been submitted to the administrative court and lawyers were still waiting for a court summons
" there should be no execution as long as there is a legal process going on , " lubis said
myuran and andrew have become model prisoners during their time behind bars , according to fellow inmates and the jail 's chief warden
myuran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates
andrew has found spirituality , which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems
their rehabilitation is genuine , australia foreign minister bishop has said
" andrew and myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve , " bishop told the australia parliament in february
indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers , and widodo has made it clear he does n't intend to introduce a policy of leniency
in december , six prisoners were killed by firing squad , including five foreigners from brazilian , the netherlands , malawi , nigeria and vietnam
brazilian president dilma rousseff issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had " severely affected " relations with indonesia
