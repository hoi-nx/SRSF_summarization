they describe themselves as the â only gays in the village â
and civil partners neil berry and wesley shepherd have become embroiled in a bizarre spat that seems almost worthy of tv âs little britain
the couple have accused their neighbour , a parish council veteran , of triggering a vendetta against them over a parking space next to their Â£ 850,000 thatched cottage in the picturesque village of upper clatford
in a further twist , their neighbour gale admits creating a log bench for himself directly behind their house where he often sits facing their bedroom
but he told the mail he has nothing against gay people , saying he is on chatting terms with a lesbian blacksmith and once went to parties at mr neil berry âs house featuring â butlers in the buff wearing nothing except little aprons and bow ties â
the colourful row has shattered the genteel tranquillity of the hampshire village , with its medieval church and riverside green
gale ( pictured ) denies being homophobic - but admits he built a bench directly behind their house neighbours at war : mr gale 's house ( pictured left ) and mr wesley shepherd and mr neil berry 's house ( right ) mr neil berry , 53 , moved in to his 18th - century cottage more than a decade ago , and later received planning permission to double its size
but over the years tensions developed between him and mr gale
the 66 - year - old retired mechanical engineer , whose family has been in the village for generations , is said to have started a one - man campaign to convince mr neil berry and his partner their parking area was really part of the village green
the couple claim he prompted his â drinking buddies â on the parish council to launch a â homophobic vendetta â against them
they say the council has spent nearly Â£ 7,000 â 20 per cent of its annual budget â on a legal bid to take away part of their parking space
the row came to a head last week when police were called after a councillor turned up at their house with a contractor to erect a fence that would have reduced the size of the parking area
mr neil berry said : â when i told them they had no right to put the fence there the contractor shouted homophobic abuse at me and pushed me against a car , which wesley shepherd managed to film
' my glasses were broken and i was hurt and shocked
mr neil berry ( left ) moved in to the cottage more than a decade ago and later doubled it in size the couple claim mr gale made his â drinking buddies â on the parish council launch a â homophobic vendetta â against them - and the council has spent 20 per cent of its budget on a bid to take away part of their parking â the parish councillor just stood there
the police turned up and went away with the contractor to question him about my report of a homophobic assault
â he added : â mr gale has complained about everything we âve done â and drinking buddies on the council always back him up
â he âs also used a chainsaw to make himself a bench on the riverbank behind our garden , facing our bedroom , which seems a bit pervy and an invasion of our privacy
â he said mr gale âs behaviour had left him and his partner feeling intimidated
â we âve made a beautiful house in keeping with its 200 years of history , â he added
â i do nât understand why there âs all this hatred
' we think it can only be because we âre the only gays in the village
â mr neil berry said the problem began when the parish council suddenly registered a new plan of its village green land , and began clearing an overgrown patch next to his garden â while claiming that he had unlawfully extended his boundary
â it was around that time that mr gale decided to go back on the parish council , â he said
â they âve since spent almost Â£ 7,000 in legal fees and other costs on trying to take a few feet of land off us
' it âs a fifth of the council âs annual budget
they âve taken down a fence we had up , although the land has been part of the cottage for decades with no complaints
â but mr gale insisted that the council was right to take action over an attempt to â steal â land from the green
and he said he had also phoned the police after mr neil berry called his wife a â witch â
the controversial log bench - mr neil berry said it ' seems a bit pervy and is an invasion of our privacy â he told the mail the trouble started when mr neil berry began extending his cottage , encroaching on public land
threatening to sue over claims he is homophobic , mr gale said that he and his wife margaret had welcomed mr neil berry to the village , adding : â he and his partner were guests at our daughter âs wedding
â and as he used to be married to a woman he has three children and we treated them like grandchildren , giving them presents and letting them play in our garden
' we went to a number of parties at his house where 90 per cent of the guests were gay couples and butlers in the buff
' it is incorrect to say i âm homophobic
there are other people in the village who are basically gay or homosexual or whatever you want to call it
' i âm very friendly with a lesbian blacksmith
but he is basically stealing land from the parish , and that is not right
â mr gale said he had resigned as a councillor after mr neil berry alleged that he was behind the boundary dispute with the parish , which he denies
he claimed his neighbour was â just crying homophobia because he âs not getting his own way â , adding : â he provoked the incident with the contractor , who i feel sorry for
and i had to call the police when he called my wife a witch
â the contractor denies a homophobic assault on mr neil berry
amy taylor , the clerk of upper clatford parish council , said : â the council does have a boundary dispute , but it is in the hands of lawyers and we can not openly discuss it
' there is not , however , a homophobic vendetta against the couple involved , and the councillors are very upset at the suggestion â
a police spokesman said investigations were continuing
the â only gay in the village â was a catchphrase used in bbc comedy little britain by daffyd , a â committed homosexualist â who pranced around a small welsh town dressed in black rubber
mr neil berry ( pictured right with his partner wesley shepherd ) said mr gale âs behaviour has left them feeling intimidated
