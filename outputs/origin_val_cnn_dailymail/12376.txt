babylon , iraq isis has smashed priceless ancient statues in mosul , bulldozed the ruins of nineveh and hatra , and dynamited centuries - old churches , mosques and shrines
in a battle between iraq forces and isis over control of tikrit recently , the tomb of hussein was squashed to rubble , though it 's not clear which side did it
luckily , the ancient city of babylon is outside the extremists ' grasp , south of baghdad
for nearly 5,000 years it has stood as a symbol of the glory of ancient mesopotamian civilization
hussein renovated the ruins in the 1980s , leaving his own crude personal stamp on the bricks there
they bear his name and describe him as the son of nebuchadnezzar , who had the reputation of being ancient babylon 's greatest king
one of hussein 's former palaces still peers down over the city
but it continues to be source of great pride for iraq who see themselves as the heirs of the world 's oldest civilization
and many iraq know better than to buy the claims of their deposed despot
" this was n't hussein 's , " said abu fatima
" it belonged to our grandfathers , the babylonians
" abu fatima strolled through the ruins with his family
hussein 's vain brick inscriptions may annoy him , but isis ' destruction appalls him
" the mosul museum was destroyed
why ? " he wants to know from isis
" that is the heritage of your grandfathers
why did you do that ? " the defacers ' reasoning ? the artifacts , some of the oldest in ancient civilization , are from the " age of ignorance , " isis says , before the advent of islam
antiquity is an integral part of iraq 's national identity
history is measured there not in centuries but in millennia , and iraq 's take such vandalism to heart
they 've had to watch since the united states invasion in 2003 how artifacts have been stolen
baghdad 's museum was plundered , during a lapse in united states security , and the priceless artifacts were smuggled around the world
the u.s. state department has announced it will return more than 60 items on monday , which had been sneaked into the united states
safa ad - hassan and other parents took iraq scouts on a camping trip near babylon to teach them about their history and make ancient artwork with them
hassan fled mosul when isis overran it last year then later ransacked the museum
" when i saw what happened , i was determined to come her to preserve our antiquities from isis , " he said
iraq will defend its heritage against isis , said mohamed hattab from iraq 's antiquities department
" babylon is our soul
" it 's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians , who have destroyed much of it in the north , which has been out of the defensive reach of iraq soldiers
the military has started a drive to retake hussein 's hometown of tikrit from the extremists
after the rage of a battle subsided , they moved in to the outskirt town of awja to find the former dictator 's tomb flattened
video of soldiers standing on top of it was posted to youtube
they celebrated the posthumous slap against their former tormentor
one man fired shots into the rubble toward hussein 's grave site
it was a piece of history they were glad to part with
