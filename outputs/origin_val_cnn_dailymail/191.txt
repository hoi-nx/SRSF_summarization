' he 's a lefty but he has a very flat backhand and a short take - back on his forehand so it 's hard to read
' he moves well and he has good hands around the net - in both sets though he played one or two loose games which helped me and i stayed solid throughout

' i started to feel more comfortable after that and went for my shots more
