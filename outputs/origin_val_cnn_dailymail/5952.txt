the department did not comment on the revelations
however a report in 2015 addressing ' management challenges ' highlighted ' repeated problems in it security and noted increasing threats and vulnerabilities to the department âs systems and data
' the document said more steps needed to be taken to make sure federal employees did not breach the database
one of the factors considered was a two - step authorization process - but it is yet to be implemented
in september 2013 the office of the inspector general - who oversee the department 's management - warned officials there were weaknesses led to ' unauthorized accesses to private information
