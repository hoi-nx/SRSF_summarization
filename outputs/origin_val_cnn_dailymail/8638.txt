the conservatives were boosted by a string of economic indicators , which show uk is enjoying its strongest growth since 2006 , which chancellor george osborne hailed as â a hat - trick of good news families are better off than when the coalition came to power , the economy is growing faster than expected and consumers are more confident than they have been for more than 12 years , official figures revealed yesterday
on day two of the election campaign , the conservatives were boosted by a string of economic indicators â crowned by ons figures showing uk is enjoying its strongest growth since 2006
the uk is out - performing all other leading economies , including the u.s. , japan , canada , germany and france
in seven signs that the economy is on the up following the worst slump since the 1930s : labour has repeatedly claimed that families are Â£ 1,600 a year worse off than they were when the coalition came to power , but shadow chief secretary to the treasury chris leslie last night conceded that living standards appeared to be â crawling back to the levels that we were at five years ago â
as david cameron claimed the tories would help business to create two million more jobs over the next five years if they remained in power , on top of 1.9 million since 2010 , independent economists said the government could boast a â remarkable â record on employment
car giant honda announced a Â£ 200million investment in its wiltshire plant - one of the many signs the economy is on the up chancellor george osborne hailed â a hat - trick of good news about the uk economy â , insisting : â with 37 days to go until the election , it âs another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk
voters now face a stark choice : do we stick with a plan which is working , delivering growth and jobs , or do we put all that at risk with ed miliband whose policies of more spending , more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos ? â labour had planned to use ronald reagan âs famous question â â are you better off than you were four years ago â â as a central plank of its election campaign , but the pressure on family finances has eased in recent months as the cost of food and fuel tumbles and wages rise
inflation has fallen to zero â its lowest level for more than half a century â and uk looks set for a period of deflation or falling prices
overall , it means the average uk voter now has more cash to spend than they did at the 2010 election
household spending per head also rose by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year
shadow chief secretary to the treasury chris leslie conceded that living standards appeared to be â crawling back to the levels of five years ago â yesterday âs ons figures showed the economy has grown by more than 8 per cent since the last election , having crashed by 6 per cent in the so - called â great recession â under labour
the uk economy is now 3.7 per cent bigger than at any time in history
business investment rose by 7.5 per cent last year to a record Â£ 179.7billion in an indication that companies are confident enough to spend for the future
and exports rose by 4.6 per cent in the final three months of 2014 despite the ongoing crisis in the eurozone
liberal democrats chief secretary to the treasury danny alexander said : â rescuing our economy was the main reason that the liberal democrats formed the coalition
this upward revision in gdp is further evidence that our recovery plan is working
â shadow chancellor ed balls said the recovery had been the slowest in 100 years
â a small upward revision today in the gdp figures does nât change that overall record
this has been a disappointing recovery and it did nât have to be this way , â he said
experts said uk was on course for another strong year in 2015
andrew sentance , of pricewaterhousecoopers , said : â we should expect gdp forecasts for this year to be revised upwards on the back of this data
it is still entirely possible that the uk will head the g7 growth league in 2015 , as we did last year
â however , in a setback for the government , the services sector , which powers much of the economy , has slipped back
output from services firms â which make up about 78 per cent of gdp and range from hotels to hairdressers â fell 0.2 per cent in january
martin beck , senior economic advisor to the ey item club , said the services figures were â disappointing â but described them as a â blip â
labour claims ... versus the reality : james slack 's analysis yesterday , on day two of the campaign , myths peddled by ed miliband and his shadow ministers over the past five years were exploded
here , we examine the key facts to emerge on what could be a pivotal day in the battle for no 10 ... ed miliband and his shadow ministers have peddled myths over the past five years and on day two of the election campaign they exploded claim : â this has been a disappointing recovery and it did nât have to be this way
â reality : in 2014 , gdp grew by 2.8 per cent â revised up from 2.6 per cent yesterday and the fastest annual rate of growth since 2006
uk had the strongest annual growth rate in the g7 in 2014
canada , the next highest , grew at a rate of 2.5 per cent
claim : â living standards have fallen
families are Â£ 1,600 worse off
â reality : real household disposable income per head was up by 1.9 per cent in the final three months of 2014 compared to 12 months earlier
living standards are now officially higher than when the coalition took office
disposable income â a calculation of incomings versus outgoings â now stands at Â£ 4,187 compared to Â£ 4,178 in the second quarter of 2010
the independent office for budget responsibility predicts families will be Â£ 900 better off by the end of 2015
labour âs Â£ 1,600 figure excludes tax changes and dates from april 2014 : since then inflation has fallen sharply while pay rises have improved
claim : â it is a complete fantasy the private sector could mop up the jobs lost during cuts to the private sector
â reality : the institute for fiscal studies yesterday said â the economy has done incredibly well in terms of job creation â
employment is up by 1.9million since the election with an average of 1,000 jobs being created every day
for every one job lost in the public sector , four have been created in the private sector
unemployment is down 654,000 since 2010 to 1.86million
claim : â consumers lack confidence
they are not feeling the recovery in a tangible way
â the number of people working full - time has risen by 1.42million - 75 % of the rise in employment since the election has been in full - time jobs reality : the internationally - respected gfk measure â a large - scale survey of the public âs personal finances , savings and optimism about the future â rose to +4 in march , its highest level since june 2002
over the past year it has risen by nine points
this compares to a record low of -39 during the labour years , recorded at the height of the financial crisis in july 2008
real household spending after inflation rose by 0.3 per cent in the year to december 2014
it has risen by 3 per cent since the coalition came to power
claim : â investment in business is woefully weak
â reality : ons figures show business investment is the fastest growing part of gdp â up by 7.8 per cent in 2014
claim : â hard - working people are being held back by the scourge of zero hours contracts
â reality : the number of people working full - time has risen by 1.42million
three - quarters of the rise in employment since the election has been in full - time jobs
three - fifths of the growth in employment since 2010 has been in higher skilled occupations
â no matter where you may be , you are sure to get everyone and neighbouring surroundings in the picture â
verdict : yesterday was a big moment for the tories , providing them with a chance to deliver a positive message after days of negative campaigning over labour âs tax and spending plans
it also dealt a significant blow to ed miliband âs â cost of living crisis â line of attack
the challenge for the tories is to find a way of hammering home their economic successes â something they have failed to consistently do so far â without sounding triumphalist
not every family feels better - off yet
while it is of huge political significance that living standards are now higher than in may 2010 , the average household has only a tenner more to spend .
