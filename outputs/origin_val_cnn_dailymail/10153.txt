robin paul , a manager at the roudebush veterans affairs medical center , sent the email making light of mental health issues and patient 's suffering to her staff on december 18
it featured a series of photos of a christmas elf posing as one of the hospital 's patients , pleading for xanax and hanging itself with an electrical cord
paul oversees a staff of more than 30 health care professionals in the seamless transition integrated care clinic , which is responsible for assisting new veterans with their va benefits , services and programs , to include mental health
the email was forward to the indianapolis star , who reported it on monday and the next day paul was placed on paid administrative leave pending further investigation
paul 's boss mattice described the email as ' completely and totally unacceptable
' ' it in no way reflects the attitudes of our staff toward our patients
we take great pride in the quality of care and the empathetic outreach we provide to the veterans we have the honor of serving , ' he said
the email is more bad news for the va which is already reeling from a scandal last year , when it was revealed that hospitals and clinics across the country had manipulated data to downplay long patient wait times
there has been outcry from a number of veterans groups , including the veterans of foreign wars
' all we want for the va to do is to be able to fix what 's broken , to hold employees appropriately accountable and help restore the faith of veterans in their va health care system , and this one employee , this one supervisor , violated all three of those , ' said joe davis , director of public affairs
' there is nothing amusing about 22 veterans committing suicide every day , ' said john stroud
' and it is absolutely inexcusable that a va supervisor would make light of any issue that veterans face
' yet despite the email being sent more than two months ago , bosses only suspended paul once it was leaked to the media
' this inappropriate email needs to be taken very seriously , ' said u.s. sen. dan coats , r-ind. ' an immediate independent investigation should occur to determine proper disciplinary action
' va officials have n't say how long the investigation will take and if all the results will be made public
' i ask veterans to accept my apology for this failure , ' mattice said
' and to allow us to continue to demonstrate to you our commitment to your health and well - being
' in another photo the elf begged for the anxiety drug xanax
