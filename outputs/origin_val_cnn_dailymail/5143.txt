i think roy hodgson should start him
yes , he 's in the squad but start him in the team
' he 's ( roy hodgson 's ) watched him enough times this season , he knows what he is all about an he is on fire
' the form he is in , i think get him in there and he will score goals
he will be a great foil for rooney and i am a big fan of his
' i like his attitude and the way he scores all sorts of goals
i could n't believe we are n't going to show his goals ( during the analysis ) but the editor said " he only scored a tap - in , a deflection and a penalty "
