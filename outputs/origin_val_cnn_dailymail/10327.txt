a florida teacher claims she was fired because she reported that her preteen student had told her she was being abused by her step - father
castella was teaching part time for brownsville middle school 's iprep program when a student told the teacher that her stepfather lays on top of her
castella said she sought out another teacher 's advice because she was unsure of the school 's protocol and then reported what the child had told her to a school counselor the next morning
they like everything to be brushed under the rug , ' she told nbc 6
but school administrator told her that she was being investigated because she did n't report the abuse soon enough
castella allowed the student to go home to her allegedly abusive step - father before the teacher alerted authorities
the girl was first questioned by the department of childhood services without castella in the room , castella said she was then let inside in the room , where she claims she heard the student confess that she had been molested by her step - father multiple times
police were contacted and the student 's father was arrested and charged with child molestation and lewd and lascivious conduct
when castella returned to school , she said she was called into the principal 's office and told she was under investigation by the school because she did n't report the incident in a ' timely manner '
a spokesman for miami-dade county schools told nbc 6 that if someone in the district learns about a ' potential abuse case ' they are ' required to report it immediately '
but , according to castella , the principal claimed she had to be let go because the school could no longer afford to fund her particular position - not because of the investigation
the student 's father was arrested and charged with child molestation
castella said the school then told she was under investigation by the school because she did n't report the incident in a ' timely manner ' but , according to castella , the principal claimed she had to be let go because the school could no longer afford to fund her particular position - not because of the investigation castella believes she got fired for reporting what her student had told her
castella said she is ' disgusted with the system ' , which she says should be fighting to keep on board a teacher who ' did the right thing '
' i became a teacher for my students , ' she said
' i did n't become a teacher to save the reputation of a school
' the controversy comes just weeks after two teachers in the miami-dade county schools ' district were fired for incidents involving students
last week a music teacher at miami palmetto senior high was arrested and charged of having sex with a 17 - year - old student that he admitted to having a nine - month relationship with
and at the beginning of the month a kindergarten teacher at the district 's school was charged with child abuse after he allegedly dug his nails into a student 's hand and leg because she was struggling with math problems .
