emily maitlis âs outfit on newsnight on wednesday â complete with spotty tie , waistcoat and rolled up shirt sleeves - sparked discussion among viewers it is meant to be bbc television âs flagship current affairs programme

emily maitlis âs outfit on wednesday night â complete with spotty tie , waistcoat and rolled up shirt sleeves â raised more than a few eyebrows on social networking site twitter
the bbc2 programme was watched by 830,000 people but it was the 44 - year - old âs unusual outfit choice that sparked discussion and drew attention away from what was meant to be the programme âs top story
the leading segment was intended as a serious discussion about the announcement by the bbc that jeremy clarkson âs contract would not be renewed following a â fracas â with producer oisin tymon
miss emily maitlis interviewed yentob , the bbc âs creative director and presenter of arts show imagine , about the decision
mr yentob âs remarks on the programme were also criticised as elitist
one viewer tweeted : â why is emily maitlis dressed as if she has escaped from the sets of st trinian , refusing to play the extra
â another added : â of course we all adore emily maitlis almost as much as she adores herself but is nât the ravaged st trinian âs schoolgirl look a tad de trop ? â a third wrote : â emily maitlis is wearing a strange outfit this eve , part off duty city boy , part pirate
