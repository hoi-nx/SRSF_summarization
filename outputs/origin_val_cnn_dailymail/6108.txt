referee neil swarbrick has apologised for wrongly sending off west brom 's mcauley during his side 's 3 - 0 loss at manchester city
mcauley was a victim of mistaken identity when he was shown a red card after dawson fouled wilfried bony in the second minute of the premier league clash at the etihad
neil swarbrick has now admitted to his error in a statement from professional game match officials ltd , the organisation responsible for refereeing appointments
referee neil swarbrick shows a red card to mcauley ( right ) during the second minute of west brom 's match at manchester city
but it was dawson who committed the original foul on wilfried bony west brom defender dawson makes a challenge on manchester city striker wilfried bony the ivorian striker tumbles to the ground under dawson 's challenge bt sport showed the incident from referee neil swarbrick 's perspective , with no 25 dawson the closest to him wilfried bony continues but mcauley then comes in with a challenge of his own inside the area wilfried bony goes to ground again under mcauley 's challenge and the west brom player is sent off wilfried bony heads to the etihad turf after being challenged by mcauley the west brom players protest as mcauley is shown the red card by referee neil swarbrick 1 mcauley loses the ball inside his own half , with striker wilfried bony now bearing down on goal 2 dawson comes across and makes the tackle , sending wilfried bony crashing to the ground 3 referee neil swarbrick steps in , blowing his whistle to stop play 4 but wilfried bony has picked himself up quickly and continues to run with the ball into the penalty area , clearly not having heard the whistle 5 mcauley then comes back to put in another tackle on the manchester city striker 6 play finally stops and neil swarbrick beckons a player across to him
dawson does not move , however , putting his hands on his leg 7 instead , mcauley walks across to the referee and is then shown the red card 8 mcauley can be seen saying ' it was n't me ' as players surround the referee
but their protests are to no avail the statement read : ' in the second minute of manchester city v west brom , referee neil swarbrick made a decision to send off mcauley for a ' denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity ' offence
' the referee has confirmed the offence was caused by a different player , which should be addressed now as a case of mistaken identity
the referee has apologised for his error
' neil swarbrick left the west brom players stunned and manager tony pulis livid after showing mcauley a straight red card when dawson had committed the original offence
mcauley 's sending off left west brom with 88 minutes to hold out against manchester city with just 10 men mcauley was seen mouthing the words ' it 's not me ' to referee neil swarbrick but it was n't enough to change the decision
at half - time , neil swarbrick admitted to bt sport that the first number he saw after the incident was mcauley 's no 23 , leading to the case of mistaken identity
speaking on bt sport at half - time , pundit steve mcmanaman said : ' it 's just a simple case of mistaken identity
the decision is right , wilfried bony is through and he 's denied a goalscoring opportunity
it 's a red card
the two players mistaken by referee mcauley ( left ) and dawson ( right ) mcauley walks past his manager tony pulis as he leaves the field ' it 's a simple thing for the referee , neil swarbrick , he 's just sent the wrong man off
he 's sent mcauley off , he should have sent dawson off
one 's no 25 , the other 's no 23
' owen hargreaves added : ' dawson 's head is down initially because he think he 's getting sent off
he just calls the players over , he does n't call anybody specific
' in the end , mcauley comes over rather than dawson
in that situation , dawson should be holding his hands up
it 's a case of mistaken identity
it 's a shame really because it 's killed the game
' because wes brown 's sending off in sunderland match at old trafford three weeks ago was a case of mistaken identity , both he and john o'shea got away with bans
when asked whether the challenge warranted a red card , david james said : ' absolutely , he 's the last defender
wilfried bony is through one - on - one with the referee , it 's definitely a red card
' the red card was shown just 89 seconds into the match at the etihad , leaving west brom with a mountain to climb against the defending champions
roger east sent off sunderland 's wes brown instead of john o'shea after a foul on radamel falcao
west brom players darren fletcher , james morrison and craig gardner were seen protesting to neil swarbrick as the players left the field for half - time , but to no avail
with 88 minutes to hold out with 10 men , the west brom lasted 25 until wilfried bony spun inside the box and fired home his first for the club
fernando doubled their advantage five minutes before the break , smashing home after west brom failed to clear a corner
and david silva made absolutely sure 13 minutes from the end , turning home stevan jovetic 's shot with a faint touch
wes brown is given his marching orders during the match at old trafford despite the fact it was john o'shea the former liverpool player and sportsmail columnist jamie carragher wrote on kicca : ' another case of mistaken identity in a sending off in today 's game at the etihad
referees need help ! ' we need technology in the biggest sport in the world ! ! how long do we have to wait ? ' goal line technology has helped the game but came too late
i would start with mistaken identity for red / yellow cards a monitor for the fourth official or the match assessor upstairs to help one of their colleagues
' the referee must know from the players reaction he 's made a mistake but ca n't be seen to change his decision that must surely affect the rest of his performance ? last season marriner wrongly showed gibbs a red card when alex oxlade-chamberlain handled gibbs is sent off by referee marriner during the premier league match between chelsea and arsenal ' we can then see how far we can take technology but we have to start somewhere
west brom wo n't have anyone suspended now either ! ' it is the second such incident in manchester in the space of three weeks
on february 28 , referee roger east mistakenly sent off sunderland 's wes brown rather than john o'shea after a foul on manchester united striker radamel falcao
and last season , marriner wrongly showed gibbs a red card when alex oxlade-chamberlain handled on the line in arsenal 's 6 - 0 defeat at chelsea
