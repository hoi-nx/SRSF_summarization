an amateur historian has unearthed the identities of the men who captured top nazi himmler ( right ) - discovering that one of them was his own grandfather , lt sgt mannion ( left ) himmler , who was one of the men responsible for the holocaust and was head of the s.s. , was wearing an eye patch disguise and carrying a bag of money when he was captured
he was taken to a checkpoint , quizzed and moved to a camp where he was identified - before killing himself
the names of his arresting officers has always been known but the four british men who first found him - from 196 battery of the 73rd anti-tank regiment - had been shrouded in mystery
mr mannion , from manchester , says he discovered who the men were when researching his grandfather 's military career
he spent Â£ 30 accessing military service records of his grandfather - who he knew had served with 196 battery
but he was stunned to find the records show lt sgt mannion was one of the men who found himmler
historian chris mannion discovered documents ( pictured ) revealing his grandfather captured himmler when researching his military career an arrest report he was sent shows himmler was picked up by one non-commissioned officer and three gunners
mr mannion says the documents show they were gunner john fletcher , gunner michael faye , gunner n carlston and his own grandfather
the official records show one of the men fired a shot before faye grabbed himmler - and the group led him to the checkpoint
mr mannion now plans to publish the records and his findings in an upcoming book about himmler 's capture - and the men who found him
he said : ' as a young boy i looked up to him for being a soldier , and would play with his medals and bits and pieces he brought back from the war
' i never knew what he had done in the war , i was always curious , but no one could tell me for certain
' in the end i set out to find out myself
there was a rumour in the family about a high - ranking nazi official but i did n't think in a million years i would find out anything like this
' i decided to get his service records , paid Â£ 30 , and was sent 2,600 pages
they had the records of the capture of himmler - and there was my grandfather 's name
' when himmler received the news of hitler 's death , he travelled to flensburg where he remained for the first week of may
on may 15 , 1945 he dismissed his staff and left with his two companions for a hide - out in the harz mountains
the three men set out on foot , moving across country , seeking cover in the woods , and sleeping in sheds or haystacks
the four british men who first found him - from 196 battery of the 73rd anti-tank regiment ( pictured , with lt sgt mannion third from right , front row ) - has been shrouded in mystery himmler 's group were stopped on several occasions but managed to bluff their way through , until they tried to cross through meinstedt on may 21
when they were about to travel through meinstedt they were surprised by a british patrol of the four men from 196 battery
they tried to evade capture but , after warning shots were fired , they stopped to be searched , taken to a military checkpoint and detained
over the following two days , himmler was moved to several camps and then the headquarters of the second british army in lã¼neburg , south of hamburg , where he admitted who he was
a doctor tried to examine him but himmler bit into a cyanide pill he had concealed , collapsing and dying shortly afterwards
mr mannion 's documents showed that his grandfather fought in normandy , belgium , holland and germany
he landed in normandy the day after d - day , and was also involved in peacekeeping after the war , routinely patrolling germany arresting fleeing germany and preventing further unrest
according to the files , it was on one such patrol that lt sgt mannion and three other members of his patrol stumbled across the group of germany , who were acting suspiciously
himmler ( left ) - one of the men responsible for the holocaust and head of the s.s. - was hitler 's right - hand man the report reads : ' on 21 may 45 , at about 1930 hrs , one of the patrols which the regt sent out daily to neighbouring villages , saw three men emerging from a wood , at meinstedt
' the patrol hailed the men , and when they failed to stop , fired a warning shot
' the three men then approached
as they held no allied release permits , the serjeant in charge of the patrol sent them back by truck
' the amateur historian said : ' the report says that himmler was in disguise with an eye patch , having grown a beard
' what gave it away was his papers were just too correct , they were brand new , and he also had a bag stuffed full of money , it 's all in the report
' he had two men with him , who were obviously s.s. , and they knew himmler was n't who he said he was , so they handed him over
' mr mannion , who never met his grandfather , added : ' i was proud of him anyway , for going to fight for his country as millions did , but this is just the icing on the cake
' it took me a few weeks just to take it in , all the pictures of himmler now i ca n't see it in the same way , because my granddad caught him
' when you see the records you realise they did momentous things , it 's really something to be proud of
it 's made me feel closer to my grandfather
i 'm in awe of him
' lt sgt mannion died in in 1948 following complications of injuries sustained in the war
the son of a school teacher , himmler was born in munich on october 7 , 1900 , and went on to become the architect of the holocaust and one of the nazi party 's most dreadful chiefs
his first involvement with the nazis was in 1923 , and he was their propaganda leader between 1926 and 1930
he was made head of the s.s.-the schutzstaffel - a major organisation and hitler 's personal bodyguard , which became one of the most powerful organisations under his leadership during the nazi
himmler developed it from a 290 - man battalion to a huge group with its own military
he became president of the secret state police ( secret state police ) once the nazis had come to power in 1933 , and set up the very first nazi concentration camp , dachau , the same year
himmler was obsessed with the idea of the germany as the aryan race and racial purification and encouraged aryans to only breed with each other in special programmes he set up
during the second world war , after hitler had successfully invaded poles , he was able to force more than a million poles and 300,000 jews out of the west of the country
in 1941 , himmler was present at the shooting of 100 jews by firing squad in minsk
he deciding that having to witness such killings might affect the mental health of his s.s. men , and declared that alternative methods of genocide be found
in 1942 he was charged with control of ' the final solution to the jews problem ' - the holocaust
he was given control of the concentration camps , including auschwitz , and by spring that year it was greatly expanded to include gas chambers
in total , close to six million jews were killed by the nazis during the holocaust
when it became clear that the nazis were going to lose the war , himmler attempted to bargain with the allies , and hitler consequently stripped him of all his duties
after the surrender he used a fake identity to try and escape , but was captured
he committed suicide while being held by the allied forces on may 23 , 1945 , by swallowing a cyanide capsule .
