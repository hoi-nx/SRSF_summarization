authorities at sydney airport stopped two australian teenagers who were suspected of trying to leave the country to join isis
the brothers , aged 16 and 17 , raised suspicion when they attempted to pass through customs , immigration minister peter dutton said on sunday
" what we have here are two teenagers who have been intercepted on their way to a potentially very dangerous situation , " dutton said
the teenagers had return tickets to unnamed " conflict zones " in the middle east , and a luggage search heightened suspicions that they were headed abroad to fight
the boys were later released into the custody of their parents , who were said to have no idea of their intentions
" these two young men ... are kids , not killers , " dutton said , who added the matter had been referred to the australian federal police
prime minister tony abbott said the brothers were australian citizens who had been lured by a " death cult
" " these were two misguided young australian , australian born and bred , who went to school here , grew up here , imbibed our values , and yet it seems they had succumbed to the lure of the death cult and they were on the verge of doing something terrible and dangerous
" the prime minister spoke directly to other susceptible australian who were considering leaving to fight abroad
" my message to anyone who is listening to the death cult is block your ears
do n't even begin to think you can leave australian , " he added
australian estimates there are at least 90 citizens fighting and supporting terrorist groups in iraq and syria
last month , the government announced plans to suspend or revoke citizenship for dual nationals involved in terrorism , and also strip certain privileges from australian citizens who break anti-terror laws .
