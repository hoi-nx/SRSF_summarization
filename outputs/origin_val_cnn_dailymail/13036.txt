how do gop try to breathe new life into an old scandal ? we 've seen it time and time again
here 's how it works : step one : republicans , with nothing in their arsenal to use against hillary clinton , selectively leak to reporters a " scandalous " tidbit -- often one that has been previously reported
step two : the new media bites
step three : the media hyperventilates and suffocates the airwaves with repetition of the same story
step four : upon further examination , the story falls apart
this is exactly how the latest media hype , this time over hillary clinton 's use of emails at the state department , has played out
and it presents yet another chapter in the benghazi hoax
the new york times story about hillary clinton 's use of a private email account at the state department is a perfect example of " gotcha " journalism , where reporters will take any bait the gop give them without proper vetting
the new york times has a history of this
( whitewater , anyone ? ) the new york times story suggests secretary hillary clinton broke federal rules in relation to her email
but the new york times ' main source for this allegation says hillary clinton violated no laws
yes , hillary clinton used a private email account to communicate while she was secretary of state
but so did secretaries of state before her
according to the state department spokesman marie harf , john kerry is the first secretary of state ever to rely primarily on official state department email
hillary clinton asks state department to release emails : what you need to know in october 2014 , 18 months after hillary clinton left , the state department was engaged in the process of updating its records preservation policies
the state department asked every secretary of state dating back to madeleine albright to provide records , including emails , from their time in office
hillary clinton responded to the state department 's request for emails , providing the department with over 55,000 pages of emails
she did so months ago
hillary clinton has been fully transparent and has asked the state department for these emails to be made public
gop investigators seeking to hype the current benghazi investigation leaked the issue to keep a dying investigation alive
and once again , reporters bit
in the days since the new york times posted its story , there have been dozens and dozens of stories written on the topic
why ? because the clintons are held to a double standard when it comes to media scrutiny
their perfectly usual , above board behavior is spun as secretive and unaccountable -- while gop are left relatively unscathed
mitt romney used his private email account to discuss political business , and when he left the governor 's office , his administration destroyed records rather than turn them over to state archives
scott walker 's county executive 's office used a secret email system , which investigators determined was being used to engage in campaign work on county time and to avoid public records disclosure laws
mike huckabee 's office had files , including emails , cleaned and physically destroyed , including " travel records , calendars , call logs , and emails
" why has n't their behavior been scrutinized over and over again ? because their last name is n't hillary clinton
in the end , all we are left with is the benign fact that hillary clinton used a personal email account at the state department
this is n't even a revelation -- it has been known for years
looks like the gop wasted their breath , once again , for nothing .
