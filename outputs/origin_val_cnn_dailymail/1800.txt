administrators at a catholic university in florida agreed to help an honors student start a campus club that would send money and supplies to the isis terror army
hidden camera footage released monday morning shows officials and faculty at barry university advising a senior â identified only as ' laura ' â about the best way to secure funding for a club she called ' sympathetic students in support of the isis
' ' i want to start fundraising efforts on campus , and what i want to do is raise funds to send overseas , ' she told bley , the school 's coordinator for leadership development and student organizations
bley offered to help her create the organization and agreed with her request to ' pass out isis state flags and educate people ' at an annual student ' festival of nations ' fair
the video is from james o'keefe , a conservative ' guerilla film - making group ' that last week captured a cornell university dean agreeing that isis and hamas would be welcome at the ivy league school
it also once received tuition money from retired nba great shaquille o'neal , who graduated in 2012 with a doctorate in education
his final ' capstone project ' â a load - lightened version of a doctoral dissertation â focused on ' humor and seriousness in leadership styles , ' according to the miami new times
the school 's mission statement says ' all members of our community ' must ' accept social responsibility to foster peace and nonviolence
' yet bley was enthusiastic about laura 's terror - funding venture
' we 're not here to limit people and their clubs , he said
' if there a demand or a need , or an interest that students have to do this , we 're here to support that
' ' if you 've got ... people who are interested , and this is something you want take and run with , ' he added
' we 're here to help you get that done
' ' we 're here to support that ' : bley explained that his office would n't make judgments about the kinds of activities and clubs college students wanted to sign up for the only objection ? asking students to support a group with ' isis ' in its name , a multicultural program coordinator thought , might hold the organization back â so why not rename it ? laura put the murderous isis army 's credentials front - and - center
' they are terrorists , ' she told bley , ' but , like , we 're trying to help them
we 're trying to , like , educate them and give them funding so that they do n't have to be impoverished and get involved in acts of violence
' ' you should create jobs and help promote education in the islamic state , ' she added later , ' because that 's what helps reduce terrorism
' that was a subtle jab at state department deputy spokeswoman marie harf , who said last month on msnbc that ' we can not kill our way out of this war ' with isis
' the obama administration , marie harf said , should instead ' go after the root causes that lead people to join these groups ' â including ' lack of opportunity for jobs
' at one point laura expanded her fictional club 's mandate to include providing paper and pencils to the ' widows and orphans ' of dead isis jihadis
barry university is a catholic institution founded in 1940 ; its enrollment includes more than 9,000 students , about half of whom are undergrads like laura campus collaborators : barry university administrators bley ( left ) and frederique frage ( center ) , and professor pawena sirimangkala , helpfully counseled an undercover investigator about how to start a pro-isis student club fly the flag : laura was told her fictional pro-isis group would be allowed to pass out isis flags and ' educate ' people during a campus ' festival of nations ' event famous alumnus : shaquille o'neal earned an education doctorate in 2012 another part of her pitch to college officials was a mission that included providing flashlights to isis fighters and their families
' a lot of the facilities have been destroyed ' in iraq and syria , she said , ' so there is not a lot of electricity and power
' ' a lot of the fighters , they ca n't see at night , you know ? ' she continued
' so , like , people are attacking them and they ca n't see at night
and because they are so poor , like , they do n't have night vision and stuff
' bley explored the idea , speculating about the ' thousands of dollars ' it might cost to send ' bulk shipments ' of flashlights to the middle east , ' like the ones at costco and stuff
' the only objection laura encountered was related to the group 's proposed name
' the only thing , as far as the name [ goes ] , ' she heard from frage , the university 's associate director of international and multicultural programs , is that ' technically our country is at war with isis '
frage was quick to add : ' i am not saying that â at all â isis represents islam
' but students might have ' some reservation ' supporting a group engaged in a ' humanitarian effort ' aimed at the terror group , she said
' it 's just unfortunate
' another multicultural program administrator , daisy santiago , chimed in that laura should rename her group ' students in support of the middle east ' â ' as opposed to having the ' isis ' [ name ]
' james o'keefe has already stung a cornell university dean who said on camera that the ivy league school would welcome an isis ' freedom fighter ' who wanted to run a training camp jobs for jihadis ? state department deputy spokeswoman marie harf insisted in february on msnbc that an employment program in the iraq and syria could stem the tide of isis a professor who runs the university 's honors program later agreed to serve as the pro-isis club 's faculty advisor
laura explained that despite a less focused name that did n't include any mention of terror groups , her organization 's mission would remain ' raising money and sending it to the islamic state
' professor pawena sirimangkala responded : ' i 'll sign
i 'm glad to do it
' laura , an email from a barry university administrator confirms , is set to receive an award on monday from the school , as the ' outstanding senior in the communication department
' in december the corporation for national and community service , a federal government agency , named barry university to the president 's higher education community service honor roll
the distinction acknowledges universities that place a premium on community service efforts
daily mail online has contacted the university staff named in the video and has not received a comment from them
in a statement provided to daily mail online by the university , smith , vice president for student affairs , said , ' there has been no formation of an isis - related humanitarian aid group at barry university ' and that ' no paperwork ' has ' ever ' been filed to create such an organization
' if a student or students are interested in forming a recognized student organization , they are advised on the established processes to follow for approval , ' smith stated
' however , submitting a request does not guarantee approval since the purpose of all student groups must be in accordance with barry university âs mission statement and core commitments
' barry university would not approve any group supporting a terrorist organization
