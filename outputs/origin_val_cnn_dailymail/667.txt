button found a glimmer of hope in mclaren 's dismal start to the formula one season when he at least finished sunday 's australian grand prix
the briton was last of the 11 cars that completed the race , and was twice lapped by race winner lewis hamilton 's mercedes , but the 2009 world champion saw some positives
' today has been a good day , ' he said
' we 're still a long way off , but this is a good starting point -- and i enjoyed the race
i even had a good little battle with checo ( sergio perez )
mclaren driver button finished last at the season - opening australian grand prix button waves to the crowd ahead of the race
mclaren have endured a difficult start to the season ' today also really helps in terms of development
if we 'd done three laps , we 'd have learned nothing , so we 've learned a massive amount by completing a race distance
' button missed out on a championship point but he said that was almost irrelevant after a weekend when everything went wrong for the sport 's second most successful team , who have not won a race since 2012
' it was also a good opportunity for me to get used to the car and to play around with it , making adjustments in the cockpit , ' said the briton , whose longest stint before melbourne had been 12 laps
' there 's a lot of work still needed - on power , driveability , downforce and set - up - but we can make big strides
and , by improving one area , it tends to snowball
' mclaren had low expectations after button and kevin magnussen were the slowest qualifiers
things only got worse on sunday when the dane failed to make the grid after his honda power unit blew up on the way to the grid
kevin magnussen is presented to the crowd before the race , but the dane failed to make the start after his honda engine blew on the way to the grid ' even though i could n't make the start , the team can learn something from my car 's problem , ' said kevin magnussen , who was recalled after fernando alonso was ruled out on medical advice following a crash in testing
' we can take positives from button finishing the race , too - we came here to learn , and that 's what we did
finishing is a small victory for the team - i do n't think we expected to be able to do that
" now we can get a car to the finish line , we can start to accelerate our learning
' racing director eric boullier also found a silver lining from a dark weekend
' it 's not easy to find positives , but in fact there are some , ' he said
' we can take positives from button finishing the race , too -- we came here to learn , and that 's what we did
