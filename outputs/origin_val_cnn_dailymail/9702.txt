escaped jail : jaciskova , pictured in ugg - style boots outside court today , stole Â£ 7,000 worth of shoes while working at russell and bromley a shop assistant stole more than Â£ 7,000 of shoes by walking home in a new pair every day
russell and bromley worker jaciskova slipped on a pair of designer shoes at the end of each shift at the oxford street without anyone noticing
once home , jaciskova would put the shoes up for sale on ebay , southwark crown court heard
the mother - of - two , who was yesterday spared a jail sentence , walked off with Â£ 7,363 - worth of shoes before staff noticed a large amount of the shop âs stock was advertised on ebay
jaciskova , 37 , who lives in high wycombe , was then hauled into a meeting and initially denied stealing 26 pairs of shoes , before later admitting to her crime
sitting in the dock wearing a pair of tatty , black ugg - style boots , she wept as details of her theft were read to the court
jaciskova had earlier pleaded guilty to one count of theft at a magistrate âs court in february
yesterday , prosecutor zinner said : â this is a breach of trust case
the defendant was an employee of russell and bromley in oxford street and she was employed by the store as a sales assistant
â it transpired in june last year that significant amounts of russell and bromley stock had found their way for sale on an ebay account
' in particular seven pairs of shoes and this is the initial tranche of shoes the defendant stole
â jaciskova , originally from presov , slovakia , stole shoes from the brand âs diva , laura and skater ranges â with some pairs worth up to Â£ 400 each
mr zinner said : â she admitted what she had done was take the shoes out of the boxes from the stock room over a period of weeks , worn them home and then placed them on ebay to sell
there was an element of pre-planning and deviousness because the defendant left empty boxes in the right place in the stock room
â jaciskova initially avoided prosecution by agreeing to hand in her resignation the day she was accused of the theft
â however the staff were concerned that in fact that was just the tip of the iceberg because a significant number of shoes had gone missing from the stock room and a further 19 pairs of shoes were discovered having been stolen , â mr zinner added
serial thief : after stealing the designer footwear from russell & bromley , above , the mother would then sell them on ebay â because the defendant had not volunteered the extent of her criminality and the second tranche significantly increased the loss to the company it was reported to the police and on november 24 last year the defendant attended high wycombe police station
â robert conway , representing jaciskova , said his client was â truly ashamed and regretful â
he added that she suffered a â medical condition â that she was now getting treatment for
judge michael grieve acknowledged she stole because she had been in financial difficulty , so instead of jail sentenced her to a 12 - month community order with a three month curfew attached
he said to jaciskova : â i am told and i can see from your behaviour at the moment that the realisation of your behaviour and being found out â that combination has caused you shame and regret
â jaciskova , of high wycombe , pleaded guilty to a single count of theft but avoided a jail at her hearing at southwark crown court , above
