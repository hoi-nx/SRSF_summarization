a bride who shot her niece dead during an argument on her wedding night has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter
christina george-harvan , 30 and katelyn francis , 21 , were celebrating at jimmy k 's bar in new brighton , pennsylvania , after the ceremony on april 24 , 2014 when they started arguing over who should drive home
the row spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband jeremy harvan 's car when the gun went off
on friday a jury convicted her of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment - both class one misdemeanors
her bond was revoked and she was led back to the jail cells in tears - but her family say they are pleased with the outcome
we figured there would be something
and this is the least of those charges prosecutors were seeking third degree murder , but the jury agreed with the defense 's argument it was an accident
george-harvan , a former nurse , took to the stand on thursday during her trial
she told the court about the hours leading up the shooting - saying there was no tension with her niece
according to cbs pittsburgh , she said : ' i was happy â¦ she was so cute
we were only nine years apart
the first thing she did was say , ' aunt tina , i 'm so happy for you , ' and gave me a big hug
' george-harvan 's mother ( pictured ) admitted she did n't think there would be a not guilty verdict and was pleased her daughter was given the lesser charges as the night went on they drank more , the court heard , and soon mr jeremy harvan was determined to drive home
however francis demanded she be the designated driver and tried to take the keys off of him
george-harvan said : ' when i turned around , the glove box is open and i see this gun
i think i got ta move this gun
i go get it out of the glove box to move it and boom the gun goes off
the defense attorney then asked : ' did you squeeze the trigger ? ' and she replied : ' no. ' recounting the moment she realized she had shot her niece , she said : ' everything freezes , jeremy harvan says , ' you just shot your [ expletive ] cousin '
' he steps over her dying body and he runs
i put pressure on [ katelyn francis 's ] wound and i screamed and dialed 911
she added , ' i felt devastated
it was like a nightmare
your wedding day is supposed to be the best day of your life and my niece is dead
