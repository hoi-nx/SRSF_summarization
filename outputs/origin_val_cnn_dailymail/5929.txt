islamic state terrorists could launch a chlorine gas attack on british - a weapon used to kill thousands of british troops in the world war i trenches , an expert said today
colonel de bretton-gordon believes that every british isis fighter will have been given chemical weapons training in the hope they will come back to launch an attack
the retired head of chemical and biological weapons for the iraqi army believes the tube or sporting events could be the target
scotland yard said that last year five british a week were heading to syria and an estimated 500 of them may have returned to british
fears : colonel de bretton-gordon , left and right in 2007 , recently retired head of chemical and biological weapons for the iraqi army , is worried that isis might launch a chlorine attack in british colonel de bretton-gordon , who is now managing director of avon protection , believes that isis terrorists returning to the british are ' highly likely ' to use the gas , because it is easier to get hold of than weapons like guns and explosives
he has spoken out to warn the public what to do if there is an attack on british soil and believes that it would be ' very survivable and a lot less dangerous than bombs and bullets '
he told mailonline : ' i am convinced that is fighters are all being given training in chemical weapons and the british ones , who are likely to be more educated , will all be targeted in the hope they may return home
' they will have a reasonable idea on how to use chlorine and other toxic chemicals as a terror weapon
' this could happen on a train or tube or even at a big football match
acquiring weapons and ammunition is very difficult in the british but you can get up to 90 tonnes of chlorine without any licence
' the authorities must keep a close eye on those fighters returning to the british , especially if they have a background in chemistry , and in particular anybody buying toxic chemicals '
chlorine was used 100 years ago during the 2nd battle of ypres in april 1915 , where the gas was vapourised into a cloud
it is classified as a ' choking agent ' , burning the lungs when inhaled in large quantities
but it is nowhere near as dangerous as nerve gases like sarin
mr de bretton-gordon says that chlorine is being used on an ' industrial scale ' in syria and iraqi but that taking simple steps would help people survive an attack
chlorine is readily available in british , used in swimming pools and decontamination in industry
' my working with british charity syria relief has focused in syria on giving civilians the basic know - how to avoid chlorine
the same advice applies to british , ' he said ' chlorine is not very toxic and the green and yellow clouds are easy to see and avoid
it is very non-persistent only lasting for a few minutes
it was used in the world war i but dropped because it did not work very well
' it is key that isis do nât get the advantage of an unexpected chemical attack in the british
if you can hold your breath for 30 seconds and run in the opposite direction you will be okay
if outside you should aim to climb or reach higher ground
' also urinating on a cloth and holding it to your mouth will help because urine kills chlorine
' i train people in syria to be aware of which way the wind is blowing because chlorine can travel quickly on the wind , but it also means you can avoid it
' if the attack was on the tube , chlorine is heavier than air , so it would quickly drop to the tracks
it is the panic that would create the carnage , so it is important people are prepared for it
' chlorine attacks are very survivable and a lot less dangerous than bombs and bullets , if you use simple procedures
â fear of toxic chemicals and chemical weapons is the killer not the toxicity of the agents
â it is 20 years since the sarin attack on the tokyo underground , but it took three years and $ 10m dollars to create 1kg of sarin and i think it is highly unlikely that isis or anyone else has the capability to do that in british '
evidence : a gas canister lies at the site of a bomb attack on a road between mosul , iraqi , and the syria border in northern iraqi , believed to have been used by isis target : experts fear that the tube or other packed areas may be subject to attacks by isis militants in the british crude roadside bombs filled with toxic chlorine gas are now being used by islamic state terrorists , it has been claimed
iraqi officials say government forces have defused dozens of the devices in the course of their war with the fanatics and have produced video footage which backs up their claim
mr de bretton-gordon said : ' islamic state are all over these chemical weapons
the big prize is mosul , its capital in iraqi
lose it and they lose the country and have to retreat to syria
' i believe they will do anything to hold mosul , and this will include chemical weapons use '
one bomb disposal expert said that the use of the chemical is a sign of desperation as the iraqi army makes advances against is in saddam hussein 's home town of tikrit
haider taher told the bbc : ' they 're resorting to this new method , putting chlorine in these home - made roadside bombs , which is toxic to those that inhale it
' he described how his team detonated a bomb in tikrit that , unbeknown to them , contained chlorine
they immediately began feeling the effects of the chemical , experiencing ' painful choking ' and blocked throats
jennifer cole , senior research fellow at defence think - tank royal united services institute , told mailonline that although chlorine can be lethal , it does appear that it 's being used to spread fear by is
she said : ' chlorine is easily available from a number of industrial sources and is very hazardous â causing breathing difficulties in particular and in extreme cases prolonged exposure can kill
' used in roadside bombs such as this , in the open air , it disperses reasonably quickly and so appears to be intended to cause panic rather than serious harm
' terror : chlorine was first used in the world war i and because it is heavier than air the clouds of killer gas would drop into trenches and wipe out troops chlorine was used by the british in the world war i , but it proved to be unreliable
in one attack in 1915 the gas blew back into british trenches after canisters of the chemical were fired from heavy guns at the germany
in tikrit , iraqi soldiers and militiamen have reportedly retaken areas and key sites in the north , south and west , including a police headquarters and a hospital
some 23,000 personnel are believed to be involved in the operation , the biggest offensive against is mounted by the government since the jihadist group captured large parts of the country last june
the u.n. security council recently approved a united states - drafted resolution that condemns the use of toxic chemicals such as chlorine in syria , while threatening militarily enforced action in the case of further violations
chlorine , a chemical used in industry and water purification process , was first introduced as a chemical weapon at ypres in world war i with disastrous effects because gas masks were not easily available at the time
in 1915 , at ypres , belgium , germany opened thousands of canisters of chlorine upwind of allied troops , condemning many to an agonising death
jack dorgan , of the northumberland fusiliers , was hurt in a 1915 gas attack and said : ' our eyes were streaming with water and with pain
luckily again for me i was one of those who could still see
but we had no protection , no gas masks or anything of that kind '
british private harry cox said : they gassed us
and how i got out of it , i went up a tree
all the others they all went down in the shallow in the trenches of course there they all laid out all sprawled out and suffering agonies
actually the battalion was wiped out â there was only five really fit men left '
by 1918 chemical weapons had proliferated on both sides â including phosgene , cyanide and mustard gas
horrified by the effects , 15 countries signed the geneva protocol
more severely affected individuals may suffer acute lung injury ( ali ) and / or acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) and one in 100 will die
in october , iraqi officials said islamic state ( is ) militants used chlorine gas during fighting with security forces and shiite militiamen in september north of baghdad
in the attacks , about 40 troops and shiite militiamen were slightly affected by the chlorine and showed symptoms consistent with chlorine poisoning , such as difficulty in breathing and coughing ,
the troops were treated in hospital and quickly recovered .
