lancashire police chiefs declared they found â absolutely no evidence â that attempts to bring the paedophile liberal mp to justice were blocked
the internal inquiry contradicts claims by retired detectives that key evidence was â locked away â and they were silenced
labour mp danczuk , whose book about smith âs sordid double life sparked the investigation , last night accused the force of a whitewash
he said there is a â mountain of evidence â that smith was a paedophile and serious failings had allowed him to â get away with his crimes for years â
â it is very disappointing that lancashire lancashire police are unable to accept this and are now trying to rubbish the claims of their own former officers , â mr danczuk added
â this shows that we have nât learned lessons from the past and a culture of cover - up and denial still persists
â the outcome of the inquiry will raise questions over whether it is appropriate for police to investigate themselves in such cases
