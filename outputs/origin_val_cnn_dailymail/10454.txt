a sydney hospital employee who alleged a colleague sexually harassed her with repeated references to his ' anaconda ' has had her claim dismissed
but the claim has shone a light on a culture of vexatious complaints and counter-complaints among health staff
nacu , a sterilising technician at st vincent 's private hospital , told the nsw civil and administrative tribunal that another technician approached her at work in february 2013 and told her : ' my anaconda , it 's really big and alive '
a sterilising at st vincent 's private hospital claimed another technician approached her and repeatedly sexually harassed her ms nacu told the tribunal she initially believed her colleague , alano , was talking about a pet snake
she alleged that mr alano then pointed to his penis and said : ' this one '
on another occasion he discussed his penis with her and offered to show it to her
she also said mr alano frequently slapped her on the back despite her requests that he stop
in a decision handed down on tuesday , the tribunal rejected ms nacu 's version of events , noting that if the harassment had occurred it would likely have come to the attention of her supervisors
' the charge of repeated sexual harassment in the workplace is a very serious allegation which must be decided in that light , ' the tribunal stated
' in the face of the respondent 's denials and the absence of any evidence ... we are not satisfied that the applicant has proved her allegations on the balance of probabilities
' the man allegedly pointed to his penis and said : ' my anaconda , it 's really big and alive ' one witness - cox , who was a nursing manager of sterilising services at the time of the alleged harassment - testified to a ' culture of vexatious complaints ' within the department
' ( mr cox ) pointed out that they were not all made by the applicant , ' the tribunal 's judgment read
other staff members made complaints which were dismissed
he could not recall whether he became concerned at the level of complaints
under questioning , ms nacu agreed that other staff members had successfully made complaints about her , including about her swearing at colleagues , and that her counter-complaints had been dismissed on several occasions .
