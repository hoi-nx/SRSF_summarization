hillary clinton has been hammered time and time again for the scandal which erupted after it emerged that she used her personal email account for government business
but she made light of the scandal at a gathering of reports on monday night , looking forward to ' new beginnings ' ... including a new address
clinton , who is expected to declare her bid for president in the coming weeks , even promised ' no more secrecy ' after weeks of being pressed to turn over state department emails she had hitherto kept to herself
joker : hillary clinton showed her lighter side , joking with reporters about her recent email scandal , and promising ' no more secrecy '
she is pictured about at a speech earlier on monday the former secretary of state and first lady , who was speaking at the awards ceremony for a political journalism prize , admitted it was odd for her to willingly put herself in the way of the press - but tried to spin the occasion as a fresh start
she said : ' i am well aware that some of you may be a little surprised to see me here tonight
you know my relationship with the press has been at times , shall we say , complicated
' ' ... but i am all about new beginnings
a new grandchild , another new hairstyle , a new email account â why not a new relationship with the press ? ' so here goes
no more zone of privacy - after all , what good does that do me
' prank : clinton joked that everyone at the prize - giving in washington , d.c. , had a non-disclosure agreement under their seat however , she could n't help but indulge her secretive side , even in jest , by pretending the guests would all be stopped from talking about the event with a legal gagging order
she said : ' but first of all , before i go any further , if you look under your chairs , you âll find a simple non-disclosure agreement
my attorneys drew it up
' she was speaking at a ceremony held for the toner prize for excellence in political reporting , which is awarded by syracuse university
the event in washington , d.c. honors robin toner , a political reporter who died in 2008 , but interviewed clinton several times in the preceding decades
dan balz , a washington post reporter , won the $ 5,000 prize this year
the event could be one of clinton 's last public appearances before announcing her much - anticipated candidacy for president in 2016
at one point in the her remarks at the event she seemed to make a joke about her longstanding position that she is still considering whether to run or not
it came on the day that ted cruz became the first to throw his hat into the ring and announce himself as the first official candidate in the presidential election
other republicans , including jeb bush , scott walker and rand paul are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks .
