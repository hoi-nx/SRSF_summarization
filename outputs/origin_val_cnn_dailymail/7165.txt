defence secretary michael fallon said the britain would send around 75 military trainers to train syrian rebels britain is to provide military training to syrian rebel groups fighting isil , the government has announced on the final day of parliament
defence secretary michael fallon said the britain would send around 75 military trainers and headquarters staff to provide instruction in the use of weapons , infantry tactics and medical skills
the training , which forms part of a us - led programme to support the moderate syrian opposition , will take place in turkey
mr michael fallon said isil could only be defeated by local forces on the ground in syrian and iraqis
he said : ' britain remains at the forefront of coalition military efforts to support the iraqis government in their fight against isil
' this effective and closely co-ordinated activity in conjunction with iraqis and kurdish ground forces has largely stalled the terrorists ' advances
' but isil must be defeated in both iraqis and syrian
in syrian , coalition air strikes have supported the liberation of kobane and have disrupted isil 's logistics and supply lines
' however , defeating isil ultimately lies with local forces and we are helping to create effective ground forces in syrian , as well as in iraqis , so they can take the fight to isil
' the training programme , expected to start in the coming weeks , is intended to equip and train thousands of screened members of the opposition in syrian over the next three years
britain military instructors have already been providing training to kurdish peshmerga militias fighting isil in northern iraqis
these will provide wide area surveillance over iraq of is activity and track improvised explosive device ( c-ied ) laying activity
the raf planes will join the tornados and reaper remotely piloted aircraft which have conducted 194 strikes over iraqis , starting on 23 march
britain troops will be sent to turkey to train moderate syrian forces battling isil , such as those above holding a flag with ' isil ' the britain continues to be the second largest contributor to the coalition airstrike campaign and is playing a leading role in the coalition 's counter improvised explosive device ( c-ied ) training programme , the mod said
this is in addition to the infantry and heavy machine gun skills training packages the mod has already delivered to over 1,100 members of the iraqis forces
mr michael fallon added : ' britain remains at the forefront of coalition military efforts to support the iraqis government in their fight against isil
' the number of asylum - seekers in the western countries rose by nearly 50 per cent last year - driven by the devastating conflicts in syrian and iraqis , the un has revealed
in 2014 , some 866,000 people applied for asylum across europe , north american and other wealthy countries - up 45 percent in just a year earlier
the surge is linked to the spiralling conflicts in the middle east , which have created ' the worst humanitarian crisis of our era , ' the un 's melissa fleming told reporters
as a sign of the crisis , the number of asylum applications last year was the second highest on record , coming very close to the all - time - high of the about 900,000 requests made in 1992 , at the beginning of the conflict in bosnia and herzegovina , unhcr said
syrian 's conflict , now in its fifth year , has killed more than 215,000 people and forced 11.4 million people to flee their homes , including nearly four million who have left the country
last year , 150,000 syrian applied for asylum in industrialised countries , marking a 166 - percent hike from 2013 and accounting for a fifth of all asylum claims , the unhcr report said
as the violence in syrian has spilled over into neighbouring iraqis with the ruthless islamic state jihadist group , iraqis too have been leaving in droves
last year they accounted for 68,700 asylum applications to wealthy nations - almost double the number a year earlier - while afghans made up the third largest group , with almost 60,000 applications .
