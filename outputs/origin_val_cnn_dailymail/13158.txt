" wait up 2015 fit nation and dr. sanjay gupta -- you want me to climb up stone mountain -- that is over 1,500 feet straight up
are you nuts ? " i screamed
this is actually what i signed up for when i uploaded my video to the fit nation website in december
" but climbing mountains on sunday morning -- you got to be kidding me , " i exclaimed
but it was all part of the process i realized i was going to take on as i learn how to be a triathlete
after our first initial week with a trainer and nutritionist , the six of us were introduced to a whole new way of how to approach fitness and how to incorporate it into our lives
i knew it was going to be a difficult task , especially for someone like me heavily involved in civic affairs and community service
at lifetime fitness , our nutritionist walked us through a number of exercises on how we should look at food , nutrition and our calorie intake
after being on several diets over my lifetime , what he said was simple
to look and review your intake and replace it with other foods such as fruit and vegetables -- these small steps can be major impact on your training
tackling nutrition and calorie intake can also be exactly how i viewed the climb up stone mountain
i put these nutritional issues on the backburner for years
it was pretty much like looking at the mountain that i was about to climb that morning -- where do i start , where do i begin ? -- and telling myself that it was going to be an arduous task
my training schedule has also been an uphill battle
in january and the first weeks of february , i started strong with my gym , running and swim workouts
however , as life pressures got in the way , i saw myself withering off
but luckily i have been inspired by my 2015 fit nation teammates to keep me on track
their updates have been truly inspiring and have helped me think about the struggles i face in my training activities
as i get older , i realize that fitness and nutrition are key to long - term health ; however , the support of friends and family is also important to help tackle your health
my team members of the fit nation have been there for me
i recently weighed myself when i visited the doctor 's office
it has been six weeks since i hit the scale
i actually lost 20 pounds
what ! really ! uphill battles are hard to see when you are in the middle of them
just like that sunday afternoon in january , i could not wait to be on the mountaintop and see the view from stone mountain with the members of 2015 fit nation
and guess what ? after all this huffing and puffing over the last six weeks , i ca n't wait to see the view in september at the malibu triathlon
it 's just another uphill mountain to climb .
