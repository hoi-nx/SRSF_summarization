westminster âs public administration committee said the country âs top mandarin , sir jeremy heywood , had been â wrong in law â during a row over two of theresa may âs special advisers sir jeremy heywood was given a humiliating rebuke by mps yesterday for clearing taxpayer - funded advisers to take part in political campaigning
westminster âs public administration committee said the country âs top mandarin had been â wrong in law â during a row over two of theresa may âs special advisers
it is another blow to the reputation of the cabinet secretary â who is known as sir cover up for trying to block the publication of letters related to the iraq war
nick timothy and stephen parkinson , two of the home secretary âs closest aides , refused an order from tory hq to take part in telephone canvassing during last year âs rochester by - election
the pair said it was a breach of the special adviser 's code , which says that - as public servants - they should not conduct canvassing in by - election campaigns and are required to resign their posts if they wish to do so
number ten and tory hq disagreed â suspending both men from the list of candidates at the forthcoming general election as a punishment
to justify the decision , number ten relied upon advice from sir jeremy heywood , who wields enormous power inside government
he controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in â backroom support â activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category
but that interpretation has now been flatly rejected by the public administration committee
the committee said : â any direction to a special advisers to conduct telephone canvassing was misguided , and that advice that such a direction or such canvassing was permitted under their code and contract of employment was wrong in law
â we recommend that special advisers should never again be confronted with directions or informal pressure that puts them in breach of the code and of their contracts of employment
â the speaker âs counsel , carpenter , told mps he had been â unpersuaded â by sir jeremy heywood âs arguments
mr carpenter said that , far from being a backroom activity , telephone canvassing involved taking part in a political debate with members of the public
mr nick timothy and mr stephen parkinson are now expected to apply to be re-instated to the candidates list after the election
sources said they appeared to have a â slam dunk case â to get their suspension lifted
labour deputy chairman jon ashworth said : â the parliamentary authorities have delivered a damning assessment of the number 10 operation , and we now need to know which ministers were complicit in issuing this â misguided â advice
sir jeremy heywood controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in â backroom support â activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category
pictured : theresa may â given the proximity of the election campaign , we need a formal government response today which outlines how number 10 will ensure no rules will be broken over the role played by special advisers
â at the time , the decision to remove the advisers from the candidates list was widely seen as the latest episode in a long - running feud between downing street and the home office
tensions have repeatedly flared amid fevered speculation over mrs may âs own leadership ambitions
polls have shown she is the activists â favourite to succeed the prime minister
another of the home secretary âs advisers , fiona cunningham , was forced to quit last summer after clashing with michael gove over extremism in schools
last week , sir jeremy heywood came under fire over new rules which ban the country âs 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists without ministerial approval
he approved the order at the request of cabinet office minister francis maude
yesterday , the mail told how the move was opposed by london mayor boris johnson , who said : â sunlight is the best disinfectant
