a zebra crossing in chinese has managed to get the locals cross
people 's daily reported that town planners in chenzhou , a city of around 4.6 million people in southern chinese , built three sets of zebra lines which lead to a triangle - shaped traffic island planted with palms trees and a hedge
ridiculed by chinese online users , chenzhou authorities said they would revamp the design
tree - point turn : anyone trying to cross the intersection in chenzhou is advised to take some shears local residents joked that in order to get to the other side of the road they have to risk their life by walking around the island , or , better yet , fly past like ninjas
the crossing is located on the intersection of longquan road and dongfeng road , a semi-residential part of the city
a local police spokesman confirmed they had received several complaints about the traffic island and its bizarre zebra crossing connections
wheel of fortune : the locals have an auspicious nickname for the intersection , but they have to risking their lives walking around it every day ' normally zebra crossings are supposed to bring convenience to the pedestrians and make sure that pedestrians are safe , ' said the spokesman
' however we passed a report onto the council because this strange combination brings pedestrians into potential danger as they are forced to walk around it when crossing the intersection
' a local resident said : ' we call it the " wheel of fortune " , and it 's a bit of a joke around here because when they built it they obviously were n't thinking properly
' no man 's land : the division built the crossing while the park and gardens division planted the garden
it seems the two government bodies did n't communicate the amusing design is resulted by a no - man 's - land between local governmental functions
a spokesman for the local council said the road division is in charge of building the zebra crossing , but the park and gardens division , who designs traffic islands , ended up making a complete garden surrounded by hedge .
