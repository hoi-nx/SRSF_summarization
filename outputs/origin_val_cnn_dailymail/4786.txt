he 's not known for his friendships with the royal family but actor martin sheen looked remarkably at ease as he posed with princess beatrice at a london event last night
joining mr martin sheen and the beatrice was holly branson , who was enjoying her first solo night out since becoming the mother of twins etta and artie in december
the unlikely trio were at the bulgari hotel in central london for a gala dinner held in support of we day , which is part of a charity movement that aims to give young people more understanding of global events
sam is himself a new father with wife isabella antruther-gough-calthorpe giving birth to the couple 's first child , a daughter eva-deia , late last month
like the richard clan , princess beatrice , who recently embarked on a finance course in the us , is a supporter of we day , as is her cousin harry
ahead of the event , she took to twitter to declare her support , writing : ' proud to be supporting @ weday this friday @ hollybranson is making the opening speech , good luck you âll do great

last year 's event , which also featured actor clive owen , saw prince harry take to the stage at wembley arena , where he called on young people to get involved with charity work
' some people do nât think it âs cool to help others â¦ personally , i think it âs the coolest thing in the world , ' he enthused
while this year 's event may not have a royal speaker , it certainly made up for it with the launch dinner at the bulgari hotel where guests were served seared beef fillet and gianduja [ a type of hazelnut infused italian chocolate ] mousse ahead of speeches at the end of the night
