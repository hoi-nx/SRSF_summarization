military security experts have successfully managed to stop a truck in its tracks by destroying its engine with a laser
the 30 - kilowatt fibre laser called athena burnt through the manifold in seconds , despite being fired by a team from lockheed martin positioned more than a mile away
the security firm said the test signifies the next step to fitting lightweight laser weapons on military aircraft , helicopters , ships and trucks
during the test , the 30 - kilowattfibre laser burnt through the truck âs engine ( pictured ) and disabled it from more a mile away the demonstration was the first field testing of lockheed martin âs integrated 30 - kilowatt , single - mode fibre laser weapon system prototype
â fiber - optic lasers are revolutionising directed energy systems , â said keoki jackson , lockheed martin chief technology officer
â we are investing in every component of the system - from the optics and beam control to the laser itself - to drive size , weight and power efficiencies
athena is based on the firm âs area defense anti-munitions ( adam ) laser weapon system
in tests off the california coast in may , adam was used to successfully disable two boats at a range of approximately one mile ( 1.6km )
the high - energy laser burnt through multiple compartments of the rubber hull of the military - grade small boats in less than 30 seconds
lockheed martin previously demonstrated the system âs capabilities on airborne targets in flight , including small - calibre rocket targets and an unmanned aerial system target
the system can precisely track moving targets at a range of more than 3.1 miles ( 5km )
â this test represents the next step to providing lightweight and rugged laser weapon systems for military aircraft , helicopters , ships and trucks
â by using a technique known as spectral beam combining , the system blends multiple laser modules to create a single , powerful , high - quality beam
this is said to provide greater â efficiency and lethality â than multiple individual 10 - kilowatt lasers used in other systems
athena is based on the firm âs area defense anti-munitions ( adam ) laser weapon system
in tests off the california coast in may , adam was used to successfully disable two boats at a range of approximately one mile ( 1.6km )
lockheed martin said at the time that it developed the ground - based system â to demonstrate a practical , affordable defence against short - range threats

â our adam system tests have shown that high - energy lasers are ready to begin addressing critical defense needs , â added tory bruno , president of strategic and missile defense systems , lockheed martin space systems company
these are nât the first laser systems to track and destroy targets but lockheed martin said its tests are significant because the lasers are smaller , use less power and are more efficient
â the high - energy laser serves as the heart of a laser weapon system , â said dr. johnson
â this 30 - kilowatt milestone shows our commitment to producing the high beam quality and high power needed to address a variety of military â speed - of - light â defensive operations
â the adam laser prototype can precisely track moving targets at a range of more than 3.1 miles ( 5km )
last year 's marine tests are shown
these are nât the first laser systems to track and destroy targets , but lockheed martin said its test are significant because the lasers are smaller , use less power and are more efficient
