' i think the team this year is really good
the team has had its ups and downs - winning streaks and losing streaks are just a part of the nba season , ' he said in a teleconference call with media from asia on tuesday night
' but i think we âve all grown from last year
i 've got better , dame [ damian lillard ] has got better , every player that was on the roster last year has got better
' we have an opportunity to win this year , but we have to play a lot better and maximize our time out there
lamarcus aldridge ( right ) was part of the portland team that lost to the san antonio in the semi-finals last season ' i think we learned a lot from our play - offs series versus san antonio
we saw how well they executed , we saw how they never stopped playing , how dialed - in they were
they were very particular about the things they did and how hard they played
they were just locked in
' i think we saw that they we were n't on that level last year but i think every player understands what it takes to win and we saw how they beat us up close and personal
' so i think we get it
i think this team is probably a little bit better than last year as far as experience goes , from the guys we had being in those moments last year
then arron [ afflalo ] came in and steve blake , they gave us more experience and they make us better , too
' lamarcus aldridge , a four - time nba all - star , is one reason why portland have enjoyed a good season so far and are a dangerous opponent in the west

' it 's just getting older
i âm more comfortable out there , i âm in my prime offensively so i think in the last three years i âve just gotten better , i âve just felt more comfortable every year , ' he added
' and with the three points , i focused on it last summer , i got a lot more shots
in the off season i âve tried to become more comfortable with the three
' i think with our offence , i can take more threes on the floor in games , so i think it âs just a little bit of the hard work in the summertime , and being more comfortable with the offence , and just being in my prime and feeling confident out there
' lamarcus aldridge will be hoping his efficiency on the court can help portland 's five - game losing streak when they travel to the utah jazz on wednesday night
