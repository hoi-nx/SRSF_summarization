she 's known as the imelda marcos of uk politics with a shoe obsession that has seen her attend functions wearing everything from sparkling gold wellies to leopard print kitten heels
yesterday , however , the home secretary , 58 , put her best foot forward in a brave choice for a very formal occasion - a pair of black patent leather , leopard - print over-the - knee boots
joining the queen , the prime minister and other dignitaries at the horse guards parade in central london to welcome mexican 's president enrique pena nieto and his wife angã©lica rivera , mrs may strode forth in the flamboyant footwear , even managing to perform a neat curtsy in said boots to greet queen
mrs may teamed the adventurous boots with a colourful red and gold coat and a warm pair of long red gloves there was no optical illusion to the bright overcoat that the mp for maidenhead was wearing either
the colourful red and gold number , which mrs may has showcased before , more than matched the thigh - high boots for glamour
a 41 - gun salute , fired by the king 's troop royal horse artillery sounded as president enrique pena nieto and his wife arrived with the prince of wales and the duchess of cornwall
on a particularly inclement day , perhaps the boots were as much about warmth as they were about fashion
it 's also not the first time they 've been seen ; mrs may donned the same pair - or something very similar - for another ceremonial greeting back in 2013 when the president of south korea , park geun-hye arrived for an official visit
have n't we seen them somewhere before ? mrs may donned the boots - or something very similar - for another ceremonial greeting back in 2013 when the president of south korea , park geun-hye visited the uk the mp is famously unapologetic about her fancy footwear , having described her sometimes maverick choices as a conversation starter
she once said : â i have no regrets ( about being famous for my shoes )
the good thing is that they are often an icebreaker
' the conservative mp famously sported a pair of leopard - print kitten heels at the conservatives â annual party conference back in 2002 ... and the eye - catching footwear has kept coming ever since
it started with leopard - print : the mps penchant for wearing animal prints is well - known ... mrs may famously wore these kitten heels at the conservatives â annual party conference back in 2002 stepping out : more leopard - print with a splash of scarlet ( left ) last year at the tory party conference
in 2010 , mrs may left a cabinet meeting at downing street sporting a pair of stripy flats ( centre ) and ( right ) she famously wore a sari with matching silk heels to an event celebrating the achievements of asian women in the same year rural practicality meets urban bling ... mrs may sported gold hologram wellies ( left ) at a party conference in blackpool in 2007 and ( right ) , another , earlier , showing for the stripy flats ... this time in 2006 at the bournemouth conference dowdy ? even more leopard - print , although this time in a much flatter form ... mrs may went for comfort at the conservative 's annual spring forum in 2013 teaming a leather skirt with roses on her feet ( left ) , mrs may 's footwear choices have certainly earned her plenty of headlines and ( right ) a confident pose ... and a sensible heel at the conservative in birmingham in 2014 just last month a supporter at the conservative fundraising black and white ball splashed out a cool Â£ 17,500 to go on a shoe - shopping mission with mrs may
and the home secretary even suggested once that her shoe - style had encouraged a young supporter to venture into politics : ' i was in the commons recently and saw a young lady wearing a nice pair of shoes
' i said i liked them and she said my shoes were the reason she became involved in politics
' although the queen appeared unruffled by the home secretary 's sartorial choices , fashion industry commentators were quick to question the biker chic look
fashion writer simon glazin questioned the appropriateness of the shoes for such a formal occasion : ' wearing a pair of boots like this for a night at your friend 's house is fine but i 'd certainly question the choice when you 're heading to a meeting with the mexican president and shaking hands with the queen
they looked uncomfortable to curtsy in
' a passion for red after all ? wearing a rather risque outfit at the dorchester hotel back in 2010 ' it 's the high - shine patent that is particularly unflattering
it can look , dare i say it , a bit cheap
they do n't really go with that coat and gloves either , which are actually very chic
' although it 's unclear where mrs may might have bought the boots from , shoe retailer russell and bromley have a strikingly similar pair of ' glossy black croc print patent leather ' costing a not insubstantial Â£ 465 a pair
the brand describes the boot as easy to wear ' with black skinnies for understated glamour by day or dress up with tailored dresses for a cool twist on evening dressing
