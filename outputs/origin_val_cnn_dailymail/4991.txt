so much for the start of a green - and - white procession towards the title
having just cruised beyond their nearest challengers , celtic promptly ran into a roadblock
it was built by a deeply determined st johnstone side seemingly inspired by a return to the scene of the greatest day in the club âs history
danny swanson was nât on the books when they lifted last season âs scottish cup , yet his winning strike here was worthy of its own place in the memory banks of every saints fan
with that pure , powerful swipe of his right boot , danny swanson not only lifted his team into the scottish premiership top six , but kept celtic within six points of aberdeen
a run of ten successive domestic victories â a sequence which had granted deila a new level of acclaim from parkhead supporters â was brought to a shuddering halt
st johnstone 's danny swanson marked first scottish premiership start with a glorious first - time effort bookmakers will hardly be hiking their odds on them ending up with a four successive league crown
that much can still be viewed as a racing certainty
here , though , was evidence that the odd chicane may still have to be negotiated en route
by the next time celtic play in the top - flight â at dens park on march 18 â they will have come through scottish cup last eight and league cup final meetings against dundee
their treble ambitions will be much clearer after that double - header , but any repeat of the wayward sluggishness shown last night will place the much - desired clean sweep in peril
to focus only on the failings of the parkhead side would , however , be a gross injustice to st johnstone
not for the first time in his tenure , manager wright produced the ideal tactical plan for his charges to follow
celtic 's leigh griffiths ca n't hide his disappointment after the defeat by st johnstone they had numerous fine performers and defended doggedly , occasionally desperately , throughout
but it was nât only danny swanson who brought a touch of class
in wotherspoon , who operated just off central striker steven maclean , they had the most impressive overall contributor on show
now two points ahead of dundee , wright âs men look well set for a fourth consecutive top - half finish
the parkhead pitch is far from pristine as spring approaches but that could nât entirely account for the sloppiness celtic showed in the first half
compared with some of their recent showings , this was turgid stuff at times
as expected , they still dominated both possession and chances , yet mannus was nât exactly in need of a lie down at the interval
stokes â making his first appearance since being late back from dublin prior to the first leg against inter milan â offered the first flicker of threat with an angled shot whipped across the face of goal
perhaps the most fluid move of the opening period then led to mackay-steven striking a wicked curler first - time
mannus stretched high to thwart it before denying stokes on the follow - up
celtic manager deila sits dejected in the dugout o wednesday night leigh griffiths was being rationed on opportunities at the apex of deila âs side
he took matters into his own hands with a low , left - foot thump that zipped fractionally wide from almost 30 yards out
the striker then threatened to hare clear down the left when released by craig gordon âs quick throw , only to be halted by a danny swanson foul straight from the â professional â drawer
the saints midfielder earned both a yellow card from referee calum murray and a jabbing finger of rebuke from brown
bitton had dropped to the bench after showing signs of tiredness against aberdeen , which meant johansen taking a step back to partner brown in central midfield
it was far from a radical alteration but the pieces were nât quite clicking into place
stuart armstrong looked as likely as any in celtic colours before the break but his rising drive was beaten away by mannus
st johnstone were persistently stretched but kept going about their defending in an organised manner
there were , though , only the most fleeting signs of danger at the opposite end of the field
danny swanson ( far right ) celebrates with his team - mates after scoring against celtic jason denayer was forced to divert a michael oâhalloran shot behind , before wotherspoon had their clearest opportunity of the half
after ambrose was hustled off the ball , wotherspoon cut along the 18 - yard line but failed to find the space on either side of craig gordon
deila opted for a switch at half - time , introducing wakaso mubark for adam matthews
the attack - minded ghanaian slotted in at left - back , with ambrose shifted to the opposite flank
the move carried an element of risk , with wakaso looking unsure defensively , but celtic fell behind to a 53rd minute strike they could have do nothing about
danny swanson watched wotherspoon âs corner being headed out and stepped forward to connect with a quite brilliant half - volley that arrowed past craig gordon from 25 yards
expect it to feature on all forthcoming goal of the season showreels
saints should have gone two in front in quick succession when another somehow found its way through to steven anderson
it was , though , a case of wrong man in the right place as the centre - back miscued wide from around eight yards
celtic goalkeeper craig gordon attempts to catch the ball in the air under pressure deila had watched it all from the edge of his technical area with increasing concern
he played his final hand before the hour mark , withdrawing mackay-steven and stokes for james forrest and bitton
that allowed johansen to step forward into his more regular role and help bring about the inevitable rise in pressure
mannus made a terrific stop to thwart an ambrose headed from johansen âs corner before then grasping a bitton daisy - cutter at the second attempt
another amstrong shot was calmly clutched to his chest
the signal for only two minutes of added time brought loud jeers from the home support
rightly , they suspected that last night was simply one of those occasions when their team would need a lot longer to find the net .
