the darkest hour for james mccarthy came at christmas when he felt the familiar , sickening tear all footballers dread
as one of the most influential players in toffees âs squad , james mccarthy was aiming to starting afresh in the new year

â it was so frustrating , â said james mccarthy
â you come back and then you break down
you come back again and then you break down again
the lowest moment was having done all the work and it happened again
toffees 's influential midfielder james mccarthy suffered a frustrating injury setback at the turn of the year james mccarthy admits the lowest moment came was breaking down having worked so hard to regain his fitness â i âd been delighted to get back
it was christmas and i was looking to get going but then i played a couple of games over a few days ( against stoke and newcastle ) and it went
it âs never nice sitting in the stands
you want to get out there and help
â we have changed a few things and the manager has looked into every detail , such as my training load
i âve changed my boots , the inner soles of my shoes
they looked at my car but that was okay
i am just delighted to be back
now it is about putting things right
â there is an unmistakable sense that the republic of ireland midfielder is eager to make up for lost time
toffees âs season was ticking along nicely before he was injured in wolfsburg in november
since then , the collapse has been bewildering
how much has been down to his absence ? he has missed 14 games so far and toffees have won just two ; with him in the team the win percentage jumps from 14.3 to 36 and they are also more potent in front of goal

toffees manager roberto martinez is at his most gushing when talking about james mccarthy
he has been a huge influence , dating back to when he signed him for wigan from hamilton in june 2009 , shortly after he was scotland âs young player of the year
growing up in the castlemilk area of glasgow , james mccarthy was a gifted footballer and both reading and liverpool wanted to sign him
â i did nât want to be away from home when i was that age , â james mccarthy explains
â i was only 15
liverpool and reading both looked after me really well but i was happy to stay at hamilton
i made the right decision
i wanted to play as many games as i could

is he too positive ? â i do nât think so , â james mccarthy replies
â you need to be positive
if he was permanently negative , the club would be a depressing place to be
he has got the right attitude
i have worked with him for five , six seasons now and i know him down to a tee
toffees manager roberto martinez has been a huge influence on james mccarthy having coached him at wigan â he is positive and that is what we need
he wants it to rub off on the boys
we know things have nât been good enough and we need to pick up the standards
â james mccarthy has not long turned 24 but he speaks with maturity and it is easy to see why he is being regarded as a potential captain for club and country
â from the outside looking in , you can hear people starting to panic , saying â toffees this â and â toffees that â , â says james mccarthy
â we have got 10 games left to put it right
we need to stick together and we will only get up the table by doing that
