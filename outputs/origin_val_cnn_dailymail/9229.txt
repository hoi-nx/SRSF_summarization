' besides that i come up with a lot of ideas that i try to turn into photographs
and if i need more dogs my friend joins me with his sheepdogs , jason and ashley
' and once a year for sophie 's birthday we go to mcdonalds and order french fries and burgers for them - a kind of doggy birthday party - which is where that photo came from
' hannake and i actually met because of the dogs , i had one old english sheepdog and she had two
i needed someone to look after mine for a week and hannake agreed
after that we went on a date and became a couple
