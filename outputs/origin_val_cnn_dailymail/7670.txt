there 's an old adage - if you want something done right , do it yourself
well , that was certainly the case for grays player - manager bentley
with his side 2 - 1 down in the second - half to hampton and richmond in the isthmian league premier division , defeat was looking likely
bentley though , was n't prepared to just stand back and take one ; so , in a bold tactical move , the 37 - year - old subbed himself into the game , and minutes later , he scored an equalising goal with a header from a corner
grays player - manager bentley comes on as a sub to score an equalising goal for his side bentley 's header makes the score 2 - 2 between grays and hampton and richmond borough as if that was n't incredible enough , when the grays goalkeeper was forced off the field with injury and with no replacement available from the bench , bentley stepped into his position
amazingly , he managed not to concede , even after his side gave away a clumsy penalty in the 81st minute
bentley guessed correctly and saved the shot to keep grays in it at 2 - 2
the blues would then go on to score a late winner and bentley has since become a viral sensation
after an injury to the grays goalkeeper , bentley went in goal and had to face an 81st minute penalty amazingly , the 37 - year - old managed to save the shot and keep the scores level , before grays nicked a winner
