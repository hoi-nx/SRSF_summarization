flemming , a 32 - year - old music teacher from canton , michigan , is now barely recognizable as the 625lb man he used to be - but his massive weight loss has left with him between 30 and 40lbs of excess skin
' it 's a constant reminder of my past and it gets in my way every single day , ' mr flemming , who is asking for $ 22,000 in donations for skin removal surgery via gofundme , tells daily mail online
' this is something i 'm very uncomfortable showing , ' he admits in the video
' i do n't go out in public like this , and i have n't gone swimming in over a decade because i 'm too ashamed really
' mr flemming says his rib cage sticks out as a result of it expanding to push his former weight away from his organs
he also displays a lymphodema on his inner thigh , which used to be a ' pocket of fat ' but has now detached from the rest of his body and will need to be surgically removed

' my typical fast - food meal was a double cheeseburger with a large pop and large fries , ' flemming wrote on fitness blog beyond the miles
' that usually was n't enough , so i would have chicken nuggets with it as well
i also ate arby 's frequently
large roast beef sandwich , large curly fries and drink , and a side of mozzarella sticks
i ate fast food every day , ' he added
in the spring of 2012 , mr flemming was playing draw something , a pictionary - inspired app , which randomly matched him with eastham , a woman 20 years his senior in london
he began chatting with ms eastham , who has myotonic muscular dystrophy , a condition that causes progressive wasting of the muscles
to manage her condition , ms eastham follows an extremely healthy lifestyle , and never takes her well - being for granted
a friendship grew , and mr flemming began to confide in her about his weight problems , and about his drinking - a secret he had kept even from his parents
he was expecting sympathy , and admits he was thrown by what was actually a brutally - honest response
' she told me that i was wasting my life and that i should be ashamed that i was throwing it away when there are so many people out there who are fighting to stay alive , herself included , ' mr flemming wrote
on october 13 , 2012 , he made the decision to quit drinking cold - turkey , and to drastically change the rest of his life too

' i was n't aware of how bad the withdrawals were going to be , so the first few days were like torture , ' he recalls
' i had cold sweats and could n't sleep
i also found myself fighting extreme boredom at first and it really helped having eastham to talk to
' still , mr flemming managed to quit without the assistance of rehab or a support group , and has been sober ever since
' i think aa is a great support for people , but it never really appealed to me , ' he remarks , adding that he is an atheist
' i 'm not a spiritual person and i do n't really like the idea of surrendering my will to a " higher power "
' i like to think that i am in control of myself and it is all up to me
' leaps and bounds : mr flemming , pictured ( left ) with ms eastham and ( right ) at a race , has something of an ' addiction ' to running , and his next goal is to run a full marathon overhaul : ' i cut out all processed sugar and red meat , ' says mr flemming , pictured before his weight loss

' i cut out all processed sugar and red meat , ' he says
' i limited myself to 1,400 calories per day for a long time
it was difficult at first , but it taught me to choose foods that were low in calories , but filled me up
i ate chicken breasts and rice quite frequently
' in a bid to get fit , he began by simply walking in place for five minutes
' i did it little by little , ' mr flemming states
' i started walking outside and could barely make it around the block and i added to that little by little
eventually i walked my first mile
' with ms eastham cheering him on by phone , mr fleming got to the point where he was walking five miles every morning
' i dropped 100lbs over three months
it came off really fast
i was over 350lbs still when i started running in little increments at a time , ' he says
