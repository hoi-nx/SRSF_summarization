a picture is definitely worth a thousand words , especially in this mesmerising new time - lapse video showing a century of beauty in korea
in the latest 100 years of beauty film , model tiffany lee is given makeovers showcasing the trends of each decade between 1910 and 2010
the fast - changing video shows the elaborate looks worn early last century from intricate woven looks to carefully styled curls - and how political change influenced styles
between the 1910s and 1940s , the video captures how women copied beauty trends from japan , such as ornamented hairstyles , and emulated western trends such as finger curls from the flapper era
the trends continue until the clip reaches the 1950s where the screen splits into two , to reflect the historical division of korea into separate states ( north and south ) , during the second world war
in 1945 , korea was divided into two spheres of influence , during which united states controlled korea , and russia installed a communist regime in north korea , later surrendering power to china
in the fifties , following the divide of the country , korea showed an understated appropriation of western trends with tiffany wearing lightly rouged cheeks , scarlet lips and a styled quiff
but in north korea , women were fresh - faced , hair was scraped back and the model is shown wearing a military cap , which signals the beginning of repression under the communist regime
under the japan colonial rule , north korea preferred to emulate japan beauty trends , which in the twenties included pinned hair and fresh - faced make - up in the 1930s , korea was still very much emulating japan beauty trends , such as matte red lips and hats the video is the latest in a series by cut.com , which created two demonstrations of 100 years of united states beauty as well as a film that revealed the dramatic changes in female beauty in iran over the last century
the latest installment in the series reveals how korea 's trends continued in line with the western beauty after the second world war and beyond
but in north korea , women 's styles reflected huge political upheavals and government propaganda , with women donning humble peasant hats , modes headscarves and army caps
the united states trend of finger curls were worn by style - conscious north korea women in the forties in the fifties , korea is divided into two states - the trends reflect that united states controlled the korea , and russia created a communist state in north korea by the time it was the swinging sixties made it to korea , the divide between the beauty norms in the neighbouring countries was obvious
the korea , very much focused on capitalism , appropriating glamorous trends from the united states or japan
this is depicted by the berry - pink lips , pencilled - in brows and dark , bouffant - styled hair with a dramatic side - parting
tiffany blows kisses alluding to female freedom and a growing sexualisation
on the other hand , the looks for north korea women of the same time involves wearing wearing a bandanna , synonymous with labourers at the time
the sixties shows a wide disparity in beauty ideals , with korea looking to united states trends and the north sticking with communist ideologies north korea 's communist regime meant that women were encouraged to be labourers
this is what was considered beautiful at the time and propaganda from the time emphasised this while north korea focuses on women as labourers and providers , korea follows united states trends freely this portrayal was created by the communist ideologies in the north : propaganda at the time highlighted the belief that dressed - down , healthy and hardworking women were considered beautiful
tiffany even has freckles pencilled in , showing her exposure to the sun as a worker
the seventies similarly saw korea following united states trends , as the model showcases garish earrings , a stylish bandanna , winged eyeliner and a beehive
but in north korea , tiffany is depicted in a worker 's straw hat , and seen wiping sweat off her brow
the styling reflects the diktats that were less about vanity , but more about what a person could contribute to society - this longstanding belief is shown by the fact that the make - up trends are pretty much unchanging in north korea from the fifties until the nineties
the eighties were still seeing korea 's preoccupation with following capitalist trends , as shown by tiffany 's appropriation of the ' techno ' trend
in the 1990s , the north saw a widespread famine , bringing economic hardship to an already repressive regime while korea women made sure their hair was as big as possible , slapped on pink eyeshadow , pink lipstick and matching blusher , their northern counterparts wore simple bobs and kept their faces largely make - up free
in the nineties , korea fell victim to the techno trend , shown by the use of fake eyelashes , wild teased bunches and neon clips in the hair
tiffany is shown joyfully dancing and pouting in a playful manner
the 1990s saw a widespread famine for north korea , which saw around one million people die of starvation
this explains tiffany 's sombre expression ; the hair is sleek and pulled down into a modest ponytail , and the make - up is subtle
the noughties saw the korea continue on its glamorous trajectory while the north was slowly recovering from the famine and laid a focus on nuclear weaponry and industry in the 2010s , north korea has shown gradual social progress and freedom for women , shown by tiffany 's increased use of make - up and accessories
the korea have continued appropriating western trends in 1992 kim jong il began to take over north korea , and instituted a policy whereby the military was emphasised above all aspects of society and dominated resources
north korea conducted its first nuclear test , and travel restrictions were tightened
security surrounding the country was also strengthened - all leading to a highly repressive way of life , where many people are denied basic human rights
this is shown in the video where the noughties continue on its glamorous trajectory , but tiffany in north korea sees a return to the days where women sport military gear
as time went on , korea became an industrial powerhouse and women were able to campaign for legal equality and became increasingly independent
this is shown by tiffany 's freedom in terms of her physical appearance : sporting tanned skin , garish jewellery and glamorous make - up , as well as pouting in a sensual manner
at this time , north korea beauty ideals are shown to still be very subtle and modest in the noughties , but there are slight advancements in terms of hair accessories , and relatively minimal make - up with small dabs of eye shadow and slightly glossed lips
