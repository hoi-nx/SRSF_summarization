fifty years after the bound body of a dairy farmer was pulled from a river , a new theory has emerged in the unsolved case of his death
prosperous but unpopular dairy farmer gibson disappeared in the wee hours of new year 's eve 1957 in newbury , vermont
searchers pulled his bound body from the river nearly three months later
the case remains officially unsolved , but it 's been widely accepted for decades that a small mob of drunken townspeople incensed by rumors that gibson had beaten his elderly hired man kidnapped him , tied him up and threw him in a car trunk , where he suffocated
they threw his body into the river
he had been bound at the ankles , and with his hands behind his knees
a new book claims that he staged an elaborate sucide the crime was deemed a ' lynching ' by editorial writers from boston to washington to the civil rights - era south
( all the players in vermont were white , but white supremacists in the south used the story to cry they were being unfairly singled out for the mob killings of black men
) the story spread across the globe , even earning a feature in life magazine
gibson was a successful dairy farmer who had many enemies in the community of newbury ' you can go anywhere , quite a ways off , and if you say you 're from newbury they 'll bring it up , ' said placey , 72 , who was related to gibson by marriage
two men later went on trial but were both acquitted
so what really happened ? judge martin , who as a new lawyer in 1960 helped represent one of the accused , recently published a book in which he argues gibson killed himself , with some ingenuity and difficulty , in a largely successful attempt to get revenge on his neighbors by pinning the blame on them
in orville 's revenge : the anatomy of a suicide , martin argues that gibson , broken by the criminal charge he was facing in the hired man 's beating and by the enmity he had created among his neighbors , staged evidence at his farm , walked over a bridge to new hampshire , climbed out on a pier , tied himself up and rolled himself into the water
' he was very proud , quick to hold a grudge , and his whole life was crashing down upon him , ' martin said in an interview
martin has taken his conclusions to the vermont attorney general 's office , whose investigators plan to take another look
they could reclassify the case and remove it from the list of vermont 's unsolved homicides
not everybody buys martin 's theory
' i do n't know why a supposedly intelligent man like judge martin would say that , ' said mcclintock , 75 , gibson 's niece , who still believes some of her neighbors know what happened to her uncle
mcclintock and the placeys offer - point - by - point rebuttals of why they believe martin 's book is inaccurate , getting basic facts wrong and ignoring others that do n't fit his thesis
they speak of threats they believe were intended to keep people quiet , including one in which a note was stuck with a knife to a tree outside the home of a potential witness
martin 's theory is n't entirely new , but the book lays it out in detail
the idea that gibson could have tied himself up was brought up during the second trial , but investigators did n't accept it
gibson , 47 when he died , came to newbury with his family as a child
he purchased the farm out of foreclosure several years before his death
over the years , he built it up to be one of the richest properties in the fertile land along the river
but he never fit in
he and his wife were n't part of the partying crowd
he drew resentment for being the early bird at the courthouse to purchase his property , beating more established townspeople who wanted it

his body , which had been bound at the feet and with his hands behind his knees , was pulled from the river three months after his disappearance on new year 's eve 1957 judge martin demonstrates how it would be possible for someone to tie themselves up and roll themselves into the water and then came the last straw â the story about the beating of his hired man
gibson was charged with a crime , though some argue the man 's injuries were exaggerated by the town rumor mill. the day gibson disappeared , he had planned to visit a lawyer
placey 's husband , david , now 71 , responded the day of the disappearance to a call from gibson 's wife when her husband did n't return from the morning milking
in the barn , he saw evidence of a crime , including depressions in a grain bag where he believed two men had sat , drag marks on the floor and a crushed milk pail
' it was pretty plain that something happened there ; there was not a question in your mind , ' placey said recently
police dragged the river but found nothing until the end of march , when troopers discovered gibson 's body miles downstream
he was wearing his farm clothes , his ankles were bound and his hands were tied behind his knees
his body was in remarkable condition
the death certificate cites ' suffocation ( means unknown ) '
it was n't until fall 1958 that a doctor told investigators he had driven by gibson 's barn the morning the farmer disappeared and saw a car he recognized and two men he knew
those two men - robert ' welch and carpenter - went on trial separately
welch was acquitted after the judge ruled there was n't enough evidence to convict him
a jury cleared carpenter , represented with help from martin
martin , who became a judge in 1970 and retired in 1998 , argues investigators never allowed themselves to consider possibilities other than a vigilante killing
he is seeking the support of the vidocq society , a private organization of sleuths that specializes in solving old crimes

almost 60 years after he disappeared and was later found dead , a retired vermont judge is arguing in a new book that gibson 's death was a suicide
for decades many thought gibson 's death was vigilante revenge for his beating of a hired man society member stephenson said he believes martin 's explanation
if vigilantes had killed gibson , his body would have been beaten to a pulp
and by killing himself , gibson was able to take control of a life that was spiraling down , he said
' if you look at orville 's behavior pre-crime , you 'll find that a lot of people had tried to take control of his life , ' stephenson said
by now , most of the original players are dead
gibson 's wife died in 1973
welch died two months after the trial
despite the ugly memories it dredges up , gibson 's niece said she thinks it 's good people are talking about her uncle again
' we would just like to know the answers , ' mcclintock said
' i do n't think there 's any purpose of trying to arrest anyone
it 's way past time for that
