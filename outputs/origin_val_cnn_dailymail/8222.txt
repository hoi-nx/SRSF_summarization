what are the chances you will live for another ten years ? while your gp might give you some idea , scientists now say you can accurately predict your likelihood of death using a calculator and a treadmill
the process involves running in three - minute segments on a treadmill with an increasing speed and at a growing incline
scroll down to read dailymail.com review of the test ... scientists say you can accurately predict your likelihood of death using a calculator and a treadmill
the process involves running in three - minute segments on a treadmill with an increasing speed runners then plug in their vital statistics into a basic formula to find out how likely they are to die over the next decade
dubbed the fit , the test was created by cardiologists at johns hopkins university in maryland after studying 58,000 stress exams
' the notion that being in good physical shape portends lower death risk is by no means new , ' said lead investigator ahmed
' but we wanted to quantify that risk precisely by age , gender and fitness level , and do so with an elegantly simple equation that requires no additional fancy testing beyond the standard stress test
' the test consists of three - minute segments that increase in speed and incline
follow the below stages in order to see which mets score you reach
make sure you record your heart rate during each exercise
stage 1 - 1.7 mph / 10 per cent grade / 5 mets stage 2 - 2.5 mph / 12 per cent grade / 7 mets stage 3 - 3.4 mph / 14 per cent grade / 10 mets stage 4 - 4.2 mph / 16 per cent grade / 13 mets stage 5 - 5.0 mph / 18 per cent grade / 15 mets stage 6 - 5.5 mph / 20 per cent grade / 18 mets stage 7 - 5.5 mph / 22 per cent grade / 20 mets then put in your details in to the following formula : ( 12 x mets ) + ( % of maximum predicted heart rate ) â ( 4 x age ) + 43 if female
maximum predicted heart rate is calculated as 220 â age
heart rate achieved during exercise should be divided by maximum predicted
if you have at least zero , your survival rate is 97 percent in the next decade
in the study , scores ranged from negative 200 to positive 200
if you score 100 or higher , you have have a two percent risk of dying over the next 10 years , while those with scores between 0 and 100 face a three per cent death risk over the next decade
if you have a score between negative 100 and 0 had an 11 per cent risk of dying in the next 10 years , while scores lower than negative 100 have a 38 per cent risk of dying in a decade
as well as age and gender , the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so - called metabolic equivalents , or mets as well as age and gender , the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so - called metabolic equivalents , or mets
this is a gauge of how much energy the body expends during exercise
more vigorous activities require higher energy output â or higher mets
an activity such as slow walking equals two mets , compared with eight for running
for the study , the team analysed information on 58,020 people , ages 18 to 96 , from detroit , michigan , who underwent standard exercise stress tests between 1991 and 2009 for evaluation of chest pain , shortness of breath , fainting or dizziness
the researchers then tracked how many of the participants within each fitness level died from any cause over the next decade
' get busy living or get busy dying '
these were the famous words of advice andy offered to red during his life sentence in shawshank redemption
they were the same words that were going round my head as i stepped up to the ' when am i going to die challenge '
i 'm a 33 - year - old man of average height and build with an emerging paunch
i spent my twenties drinking and smoking but thanks to a second go at hypnosis , i knocked the smokes on the head last year
i consider myself fairly healthy having passed my formative years swimming , cycling and playing football
now , when i can be bothered , i go to bikram yoga and run
i looked at the test and thought : easy , before hauling myself off to the young man 's hebrew association on 14th
i fired up the treadmill and got going
stage 1 - 1.7 mph / 10 per cent grade / 5 mets easy
i walk twice as fast
stage 2 - 2.5 mph / 12 per cent grade / 7 mets still easy but it reminded me why hate treadmills
they make walking and running so boring
should have brought my headphones
stage 3 - 3.4 mph / 14 per cent grade / 10 mets incline jump is considerate and i 'm starting to feel it
what is wrong with me ? the grim reaper is on my tail
stage 4 - 4.2 mph / 16 per cent grade / 13 mets it was all that food and booze at christmas
i should have done dry january
must stop going to ray 's pizza
i 'm not going to finish this i know it
stage 5 5.0 mph / 18 per cent grade / 15 mets no can do
treadmill does n't go up as far as 20 per cent and thank god
no way i can do last two stages
it was the incline that got me
much harder than i thought
if the test is accurate i 've got two per cent chance of dying in the next ten years
not as bad as i thought
unlike andy from shawshank redemption , i have n't got to start digging just yet
sean o'hare for dailymail.com the results reveal that among people of the same age and gender , fitness level as measured by mets , and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk
fitness level was the single most powerful predictor of death and survival , even after researchers accounted for other important variables such as diabetes and family history of premature death
scores ranged from negative 200 to positive 200 , with those above 0 having lower mortality risk and those in the negative range facing highest risk of dying
patients who scored 100 or higher had a 2 per cent risk of dying over the next 10 years , while those with scores between 0 and 100 faced a 3 per cent death risk over the next decade
people with scores between negative 100 and 0 had an 11 percent risk of dying in the next 10 years , while those with scores lower than negative 100 had a 38 per cent risk of dying
' the fit is easy to calculate and costs nothing beyond the cost of the treadmill test itself , ' says senior study author michael blaha
the results reveal that among people of the same age and gender , fitness level as measured by mets , and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk exercise stress tests usually measure how well the heart and lungs respond to physical exertion while a person is walking on a treadmill at progressively higher speed and elevation
the test is stopped once a person reaches the point of exhaustion or develops chest pain , dizziness or heart rhythm abnormalities
those who have normal readings and no alarming symptoms while exercising are said to have ' normal ' results and typically do not require further testing
however , the researchers say , the new data show varying degrees of fitness among those with ' normal ' stress test results that reveal telling clues about cardiac and respiratory fitness and , therefore , overall death risk over time
' stress test results are currently interpreted as ' either / or ' but we know that heart disease is a spectrum disorder , ' dr ahmed says
' we believe that our fit score reflects the complex nature of cardiovascular health and can offer important insights to both clinicians and patients
