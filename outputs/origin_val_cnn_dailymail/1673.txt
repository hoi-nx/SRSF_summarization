the weather and conditions could hardly have been more different , but murray continued on from his davis cup thrashing of donald young earlier this month
having beaten the world no 44 earlier this month indoors in glasgow , he did so again outside in the steaming humidity of the miami open to reach the third round
murray emerged the 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 winner after an hour and 22 minutes and was left awaiting either colombian 's santiago giraldo or dutchman robin haase
murray cruised past american donald young during the second round of the miami open the british no 1 won in straight sets in the soaring heat as he booked his place in the next round murray was largely untroubled by donald young who struggled to force the scot into unforced errors it was a comprehensive enough performance , although there was the odd lapse of concentration against a player whose own level tends to undulate sharply
murray raced to a 4 - 0 lead but was cut back to 5 - 4 as he briefly struggled with his movement
in these heavy and windy conditions he was too solid for the american left hander and ultimately cruised through after having to fend off break points in the fourth game of the second set
murray said after the match that he was pleased with his performance and , in particular , the way he handled the windy conditions
murray and donald young shake hands after the straight sets win to put the scot into the third round murray , who now plays hard hitting colombian baseliner santiago giraldo , said afterwards : ' i 've played well against him the last couple of times
' obviously today was a very different match to davis cup ; completely different conditions , the tactics that you go into the match with completely change because of the weather and the wind
the wind obviously cooled you down a little bit when you were at the end changes
sometimes it can be ridiculously hot , and that makes managing the points and your emotions important
so i just tried to play smart , and it worked
