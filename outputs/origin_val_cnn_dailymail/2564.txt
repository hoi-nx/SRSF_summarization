scientists say they have found a new dinosaur species which could have grown to 65ft tall â three times the height of a t-rex
nicknamed the sibirosaurus , the creature would have been among the largest to roam the earth 100 million years ago
it is thought to be related to the titanosaurus which grew to 131ft long and weighed 90 tons - the equivalent of nine african elephants

the rocks could not be removed so scientists from tomsk state university extracted fragments from the sandstone for examination , the siberian times reported
dr ivantsov , a scientific researcher in the laboratory of mesozoic and cenozoic continental ecosystems , said they originally believed the remains were of a very large herbivore
it took many years of research to discover it was an entirely new dinosaur
it is thought a dinosaur foot found at the same location in 1995 may also belong to the newly identified species
he told the newspaper : ' when we discovered this finding , it was only clear that the remains belonged to a very large herbivorous dinosaur from the sauropods group
it was the first scientifically described dinosaur from this group in russia
' now after work on the extraction of all the remnants and the restoration ( of the bones ) are almost completed , we can confidently say that we have found a new species , and maybe even genus
dr ivantsov ( pictured left ) said they originally believed the remains were of a very large herbivore the rocks could not be removed so scientists from tomsk state university extracted fragments from the sandstone for examination ' if we talk about our discovery , this dinosaur lived in the late cretaceous period , that is about 100 million years ago
' experts believe a dinosaur foot found at the same location in 1995 may also belong to the newly discovered species
dr ivantsov said : ' we constantly find the remains of dinosaurs on this site , near shestakovo village
they fall down from the steep river bank regularly and we collect them
' bones including part of a shoulder blade will be exhibited permanently in paleontological museum of tomsk state university
they were named after the mythical titans of ancient greece - giant deities of incredible strength
titanosaurs have very long necks and whip - like tails , tiny heads and thick stumpy legs
they ate plants and were armoured with small bony plates along its back which helped protect them from predators
titanosaurs were some of the biggest dinosaurs to ever walk the earth and weighed up to 90 tons

he said : ' it is a case of look and usually you will find
although , they are animals that lived on land and because of that the chances of them being preserved is less than if they were creatures in the seas or rivers , so they are certainly rarer
' on that basis the discovery that has been made is interesting because it is from a part of the world that has n't yielded these particular sorts of dinosaurs
' it therefore increases the geographic range - they have been found in africa , europe and china before
' dr norman said titanosaurs are large ling - necked dinosaurs which travelled in herds
he said : ' it is an animal a bit like dippy , the dinosaur in the hall of the natural history museum - it is that sort of shape
it is long - necked and has a long tail with an elephant sized body
' he said dinosaur footprints suggest they travelled in herds with the largest members on the outside creating a kind of ring of steel which protected the women and children in the centre .
