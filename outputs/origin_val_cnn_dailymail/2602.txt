mr joe kilgannon said : ' throughout our stay at the resort we noticed that some of the food was served only lukewarm and the burgers we were served in the restaurant were raw in the middle
' but obviously we only spotted this after biting into them the first time
' nothing can turn back the clock and make amends for our ruined holiday but we hope that with the help of our legal team we will be able to find the answers we are seeking as to how i fell so seriously ill. ' a few days into the holiday mr joe kilgannon began to feel unwell and his condition rapidly deteriorated the couple also claim that there were insects all over their original hotel room , necessitating a room change

the couple 's lawyer said he is investigating ' the cause of joseph 's illness and how he came to contract salmonella ' he was hospitalised in uk and after further tests he was diagnosed with salmonella poisoning
the couple have instructed international personal injury experts to investigate the cause of the illness after joseph began to suffer from abdominal cramps and diarrhoea
their lawyer jennifer downing , of specialist firm irwin mitchell , said : ' this was meant to be one of the most romantic breaks of joseph and cezanne bannon 's lives but unfortunately the illness he suffered left them unable to fully enjoy the facilities at the hotel and they went home with awful memories rather than happy ones
' salmonella is a potentially fatal form of food poisoning that can leave some sufferers with permanent symptoms
' we will now be investigating the cause of joseph 's illness and how he came to contract salmonella
' we hope thomas cook the tour operator will co-operate fully with us during our investigations
' we would ask anyone who has recently stayed at the resort to get in touch with us if they feel they are able to assist with our investigations
' a thomas cook spokesperson confirmed they were investigating ' serious and , at present , unsubstantiated allegations ' about the hotel stay
the couple claim that food at the resort was served lukewarm and the burgers were raw in the middle thomas cook confirmed they are investigating ' serious and , at present , unsubstantiated allegations ' she said : ' thomas cook would , of course , like to congratulate mr joe kilgannon and ms cezanne bannon on their engagement
' mr joe kilgannon did not raise any concerns with our reps or the hotel management at the time
' as it appears that his symptoms arose several days after his return to the uk , this would suggest that the illness was unconnected to his holiday in mexico
' thomas cook takes health and safety issues extremely seriously
