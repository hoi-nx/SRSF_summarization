claims : kovacic , pictured outside the high court in london today , said he could barely walk after a fatal head - on collision in 2010 a 40 - year - old man who was seeking nearly Â£ 1million in damages after a fatal head - on collision will not receive any of the money after he was secretly filmed enjoying a family trip to the seaside
kovacic said he could barely walk and was incapable of returning to his job as a support worker after the crash in milton keynes , buckinghamshire , in march 2010
the aspiring social worker was awarded Â£ 97,000 in damages - a fraction of the amount he sought - but is unlikely to see any of it after being ordered to pay back insurers and cover legal fees
a senior judge ruled he had ' exaggerated ' his disabilities and tried to ' play - act ' his way to a huge payout at london 's high court today
aspiring social worker mr kovacic suffered serious injuries when 68 - year - old wroe drove into the path of his car on the a422 near newport pagnell
mrs wroe died in the crash
he suffered fractures to both legs , his right arm , a rib and his back , as well as soft tissue damage , and remained in hospital for two months
he also had to undergo further surgery on two occasions after developing infections in his wounds
mr kovacic , from bedford , bedfordshire , sued mrs wroe 's estate and her insurers , aviva , for Â£ 900,000 in damages
aviva admitted the crash was caused by mrs wroe 's negligence
in his claim , which was initially supported by clinical experts , mr kovacic said he could barely walk , was unable to work and was suffering depression
but aviva 's suspicions were raised and he was placed under surveillance in 2013
footage shot by private investigators also showed him driving nearly 200 miles on a day out with his family , taking his children to school and climbing in and out of his car with ease
he was also seen walking without a stick and carrying heavy items
however , he did use his stick , and appeared to limp and get in and out of a taxi with difficulty , while attending an appointment with a harley street medical expert for the defence
after viewing the videos , which were recorded on nine days over several weeks , judge bidder said he was sure mr kovacic 's description of his disabilities ' simply could not be believed '
all of the experts who had backed mr kovacic 's case changed their opinions in light of the footage
aviva had offered to settle his claim for Â£ 350,000 , but he insisted on fighting for more in court even after his lawyers withdrew from the case
mr kovacic , who represented himself , told the high court in london that the undercover footage was ' unrepresentative ' and did not show him on his ' bad days '
he insisted that he could not return to his job or achieve his ultimate career aim of training to be a social worker
but judge bidder said the odds against him only having been filmed on his ' bad days ' were ' huge '
he told the court : ' i have concluded that mr kovacic can simply not be believed in relation to his condition and , except where his claim is supported by reliable other evidence , i am unable to accept his account
' ' i 'm afraid that , having seen him give his evidence and having seen the dvds , i am driven to the conclusion that he deliberately exaggerated his condition
' ' could not be believed ' a senior judge ruled mr kovacic had ' exaggerated ' his disabilities and tried to ' play - act ' his way to a huge payout at london 's high court today , pictured
he was awarded Â£ 97,525 in damages the judge also said that he would have been able to keep his job , from which he was let go in 2012 after nearly two years on sick leave , had he not exaggerated his condition
he added : ' i 'm afraid to say that i find as a fact that , had he not been exaggerating his symptoms , but returned to work prior to march 2012 , he would not have been dismissed by his employers
' the judge found that mr kovacic was entitled to Â£ 97,525 damages from the date of his accident to when he substantially recovered , which was about the end of 2011
however , he will not see any of the cash , and aviva 's lawyers said he would probably end up owing the insurance company money
he had received interim compensation before aviva 's suspicions were raised and was also ordered to pay legal costs which are likely to run into six figures .
