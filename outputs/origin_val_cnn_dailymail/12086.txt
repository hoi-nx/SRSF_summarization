oklahoma university alumni are rallying around an african american chef who has been forced out of his job at the school 's disgraced fraternity after footage emerged of members performing a racist chant
howard has worked at sae for more than 15 years , cooking raved - about chili dogs and cheering students with his ' infectious smile ' , former members say
but on monday , his role was terminated after the university closed sae with immediate effect
it was a reaction to a video of fraternity brothers chanting ' there will never be a n * * * * * in sae ' to the tune of if you 're happy and you know it
none more so than howard
' howard , he writes , ' was always there to chat with you ' but now ' he is going to learn who has been working for
and through some cruel twist of fate , he has to lose the job that he has held for over a decade
' within roughly 12 hours , the fund had amassed $ 5,000
and it is not the only one
' infectious smile ' : howard befriended all students he came into contact with , alumni say as they raise money ' there will never be a n * * * * * sae ' : the vile chant was performed by members of the sae fraternity chapter at the oklahoma university on saturday
the society has since been shut down simultaneously another former sae brother set up a gofundme page slamming ' the disgusting chant ' and lauding howard as ' hard - working and loyal '
that page has at least $ 3,000
a twitter user who shared a link to the fundraising page wrote : ' i went to an sae tailgate one time , ( had a great time ) an i met that man howard , he grills a mean burger
' all members of the fraternity have until midnight on monday to leave the premises , oklahoma university president david boren announced at a press conference amid a chorus of furious reaction to the footage
hitting back : the fraternity 's now - defunct building has been spraying with graffiti reading ' tear it down ' frat house : the sae base at the oklahoma university is pictured above
