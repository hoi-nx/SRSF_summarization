teenagers as young as 16 in birmingham have undergone weight loss surgery obese teenagers as young as 16 have had nhs - funded gastric band operations , worrying new figures show
and in a four - year period , the number of people aged under 30 receiving weight loss surgery in birmingham more than doubled
gastric band and gastric bypass operations are only carried out on the nhs when a patient 's life is deemed to be at risk
such surgery is a last resort , and before it is considered a patient is asked to make drastic changes to their lifestyle to try and lose weight naturally
the guidelines are such that a 5ft 5ins child will not be considered eligible for the drastic procedure unless they weigh at least 15 stone
meanwhile someone who is 5ft 8ins would need to weigh almost 17 stone before they can be given the go - ahead for surgery
figures from the health and social care information centre released under the freedom of information show in the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery
these included two 16 year olds , two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds
overall between 2008 - 09 and 2011 - 12 the numbers of the radical operations performed on the under 30s rose from 35 to 71 - a 102 per cent increase
it comes as new figures this weekend revealed hundreds of babies are being born clinically obese every year
since 2011 , 1,403 newborns have been classified as obese - weighing 9lb 15oz or more , a freedom of information request revealed
last year it emerged that west midlanders are the second fattest group in the whole country , with nhs england figures revealing 65.7 per cent of people are overweight or obese
new figures released in january this year highlighted the worrying news that almost four out of 10 children in birmingham are officially classed as overweight or obese by the age of 11
concerns have been raised that people are opting for stomach surgery as an ' easy option ' rather than go to the trouble of changing their lifestyle , eating more healthily and taking exercise
nhs guidelines state that surgery can only be offered when the patient has ' life threatening obesity ' - a body mass index ( bmi ) of 40 or above , or a bmi of 35 with other serious health conditions that could be improved through weight loss , such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure
the policy states : ' it is always recommended that patients try to lose weight through a healthy , calorie - controlled diet and increased exercise before you consider weight loss surgery , as surgery carries a risk of complications and requires a significant change in lifestyle afterwards
' due to these associated risks , most surgeons , whether they are working privately or for the nhs , would only consider a person for surgery if there was a clinical need , and not just for cosmetic reasons
' people can also opt to pay for weight loss surgery privately
a gastric band operation , which reduces the size of the stomach , costs up to Â£ 8,000
meanwhile , a full gastric bypass , which re-routes the digestive system meaning a person can digest much less food , costs around Â£ 15,000
in the last five years six teenagers aged 18 and under had bariatric surgery
which includes gastric bands abd bypasses
these included two 16 year olds , two people aged 17 and two 18 year olds the nhs has warned that the treatment is available more cheaply overseas , but added it carries increased risks
current statistics suggest that there is a one in 1,000 risk of death from weight loss surgery within 30 days
nationally 16 teenagers under the age of 17 underwent stomach surgery in the last five years
responding to figures revealing a rise in obese newborns , fry , of the national obesity forum , said that although some mothers suffer from medical conditions , which increase the size of the baby , most just overeat
he said : ' quite simply , the number of pregnant women who are obese at the start is increasing
' it is thought that 82 per cent of children who are obese will continue to be overweight
' as they have the same kind of nutrition as their parents there is a continuous upwards spiral
' successive governments have not really addressed the obesity problem
it starts at conception and sometimes even before then
' mr fry also suggested that the number of women having caesareans was increasing due to the increasing size of their babies
he said : ' some babies are so fat they can not come out naturally
' women have to understand that they have to keep themselves in shape due to the huge responsibility they have of producing the next generation
' if we get it wrong , it 's a vicious circle and it will just go on and on and on

a 12 - year - old boy has become the youngest person in britain to have a gastric band fitted , as doctors struggle to fight the child obesity epidemic
the schoolboy is one of an increasing number of youngsters who have had the controversial weight - loss operations , despite recommendations that such high - risk surgery should be a last resort when other efforts to slim down have failed
figures seen by the mail on sunday show that 62 young people aged 18 or under had the stomach - shrinking surgery at nhs and private hospitals over a three - year period
they include the 12 - year - old , one boy aged 13 and two boys aged 15
professor monty duggal , head of paediatric dentistry at leeds dental institute , who regularly operates on obese children to remove decayed teeth , said it was â a matter of national shame that we have these health problems when we are a wealthy , developed nation
the treatments i carry out all cost taxpayers money
â [ yet ] as a professional in my field i have to approach parents with great caution
i ca nât accuse parents of anything
but of course the parent is responsible for the child âs welfare and health
â a 12 - year - old boy has become the youngest person in britain to have a gastric band fitted as figures show 62 young people aged 18 or under had the stomach - shrinking surgery at nhs and private hospitals over a three - year period he added that social workers would be quick to step in at any sign of a parent abusing a child , â yet you can have a child with up to 20 decayed teeth in their mouth , a big fat face , seriously ill and having to be admitted to hospital for a serious operation under general anaesthetic without consequence for the parent
â official statistics from the national bariatric surgery register , which is compiled from surgeons â reports , reveal that the 12 - year - old boy is the youngest child to have been fitted with a gastric band within this group , although it is not recorded if the operation was publicly or privately funded
nhs statisticians said the youngest patient they had on record for bariatric surgery paid for by the health service was 13
however , many surgeons argue that the stomach bands could save the nhs money through reducing levels of obesity and associated illnesses such as type 2 diabetes , which are estimated to cost the health service Â£ 5 billion a year
dr lucy stirling , a clinical psychologist at king âs college hospital , said parents whose children are facing gastric band surgery can fail to take responsibility for their child âs weight issues
she said : â parents can be in denial of the part they have played
â but children need to be brought up to eat in such a way that they âre nurturing their body rather than slowly damaging it
â paediatric consultant ashish desai added : â some parents , when they come to us , have the idea that if their child has the surgery it will act like a magic wand
