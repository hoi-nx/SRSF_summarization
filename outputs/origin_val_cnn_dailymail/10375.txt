cameron today compared himself to action hero tom cruise in his mission to overhaul britain 's relationship with europe
the prime minister said a tory victory in the general election would give him a ' very powerful mandate ' to win sweeping reforms and insisted it was possible
it came after donald tusk , the polish president of the european council which represents eu leaders , said rewriting the eu treaties to curb migration would be ' close to mission impossible ' for mr cameron
but the pm told a press conference in brussels : ' tom cruise normally prevails in the end
he 's a little bit smaller than me , but i hope to be just as effective
' cameron , pictured in brussels today , has compared himself to action hero tom cruise in his bid to overhaul britain 's relationship with europe mr cameron urged voters to the election as an ' opportunity to make sure the problems that bedevil britain 's relationship with the eu are dealt with ' , he said
he said : ' the moment of truth is fast approaching , ' he said
' one of two people will represent britain in europe after the election
it 's either me or ed miliband
' if you send me back here as prime minister on 8 may , i have a very clear plan
i want to sit at that negotiating table with a mandate from the united kingdom people to reform the eu and fundamentally change britain 's relationship with it
' for too long this issue has been swept under the carpet and i believe it is time to deal with it
if i am returned as prime minister , that is what i will do
' so i say to the united kingdom people : give me another term and i will give you your say on europe
' mr cameron said there were other eu leaders ' who will breathe a sigh of relief ' if he is not re-elected
the prime minister 's remarks came after mr donald tusk said he was ' ready to help cameron ' â but dismissed his chances of negotiating a new europe treaty within the next two years before holding an eu referendum
the former polish prime minister said it would be hard to find agreement among all 27 eu leaders that would satisfy mr cameron
he said : ' i have no doubt that we have to help in a limited and rational framework
we have to help cameron because he is obviously pro-european
but mr donald tusk added : ' i am sceptical when it comes to changing the treaty
' donald tusk , the polish president of the european council which represents eu leaders , greeted mr cameron today after claiming that his bid to rewrite the eu treaties to curb migration would be ' close to mission impossible ' mr cameron wants a new brussels treaty to nail down a series of changes allowing britain to limit benefits for eu migrants
the pm has insisted that new rules are needed to help the crisis - hit eurozone , giving britain the chance to renegotiate its relationship with brussels
but mr donald tusk said : ' my intuition is that treaty change is close to mission impossible today because it 's not only about rationality , about good argument
' we need unanimity between 28 member states , in the europe parliament , in 28 national parliaments in the process of ratification
to say that it is a pandora 's box is too little
' mr donald tusk said : ' first of all we need more precise concrete [ details ] about united kingdom demands
' when we have more information about details , about legal problems , then we can decide if discussion about treaty change is at all necessary
' for me the problem of possible treaty change is a practical question
it 's not only about the arguments of cameron
i can agree or disagree with some of them
' but at the end of the day i would like to ask him ' what is your concrete proposal ? ' and then i can consult with the other member states
' but he said : ' we need , also for the united kingdom , a good solution for cameron and britain under existing law , ' he said
' we need the united kingdom in europe
for me there 's no more obvious political thesis than this one
and i feel , but it 's not my role to decide about it , but i feel that the united kingdom needs europe
' the former polish prime minister 's remarks are the first since he took over as european council president in december
he also admitted , in an interview with the guardian , that he will find it hard to crack down on immigration â because of the number of polish living and working abroad
he said : ' it 's not easy for me because of some expectations close to the immigration problems , which means also the huge polish minority in britain
