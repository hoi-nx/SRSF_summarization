the barack obama administration has put the brakes on its plans to ban a popular type of rifle ammunition after an onslaught of criticism from both the public and lawmakers
' you spoke , we listened , ' the agency said tuesday afternoon on twitter
the atf says the agency received more than 80,000 public comments on the proposal to outlaw some types of 5.56 mm rounds â also known as .223 caliber ammunition
the agency said tuesday that comments ran overwhelmingly against the proposal , which it first floated in february
the ammunition targeted by the atf is commonly known as ' green - tip ' because of its distinctive appearance
green - tip : the popular rifle ammunition is no longer being targeted for extinction by the atf hunters and target shooters use the bullets , primarily in ar-15 - style rifles like this one , but the ammo could travel fast enough from a handgun to pierce a police officer 's body armor uncle : the atf decided tuesday that it could n't withstand an onslaught from legislators and the public ' although atf endeavored to create a proposal that reflected a good faith interpretation of the law and balanced the interests of law enforcement , industry , and sportsmen , the vast majority of the comments received to date are critical of the framework , and include issues that deserve further study , ' the agency said in a press release
' accordingly , atf will not at this time seek to issue a final framework
' that carefully parsed language leaves open the possibility that the government could revive the idea in the future
the atf plans to keep collecting comments until march 16
hundreds of lawmakers , including 52 america senators , also objected
the atf had proposed banning the ammunition , most commonly used in the popular ar-15 - style rifles , because they could potentially penetrate a police officer 's protective vest if fired from a handgun instead
the law enforcement officers protection act banned armor - piercing handgun ammunition in 1986
green - tip ammo has long been exempt because it 's primarily used in hunting and target - shooting rifles
the atf 's proposal would have removed that exemption , effectively banning its sale in the america
virginia goodlatte rep. goodlatte took a rhetorical victory lap on tuesday from his perch as chairman of the house judiciary committee
' after much pressure from a large , bipartisan majority in the house , i am pleased that the obama administration has abandoned its attack on the second amendment , ' goodlatte said in a statement
' it is entirely inappropriate for president barack obama to stretch his regulatory authority to implement partisan policies that congress has refused to enact , ' he added
' such an abuse of power would impact many law - abiding gun owners and restrict the america people 's ability to legally and responsibly exercise their second amendment rights
' last week goodlatte and 238 other house members , including seven democrats , sent a verbal stop sign to the atf
' under no circumstances should atf adopt a standard that will ban ammunition that is overwhelmingly used by law - abiding america for legitimate purposes , ' the lawmakers wrote to atf director jones
on monday a group of 53 gop senators complained in a similar letter to jones that efforts to respect the second amendment to the u.s. constitution â which protects the ' right to bear arms ' â ' require not only access to firearms , but to bullets
' ' if law - abiding gun owners can not obtain rifle ammunition , or face substantial difficulty in finding ammunition available and at reasonable prices because government entities are banning such ammunition , then the second amendment is at risk , ' they claimed
only one gop senator , mark kirk of illinois , chose not to sign the letter
he faces a brutal re-election fight next year in a blue state where gun control advocates have a strong presence
the national rifle association also claimed victory on tuesday
' vast majority of the comments ... are critical ' : atf 's message to america admitted that hardly anyone supported them the atf ( atf ) is a justice department agency in charge of regulating access to a wide variety of materials rifle owners complained that without the green - tip ammo , their guns could become useless overnight ' today 's announcement proves what we have said all along â this was 100 % political , ' national rifle association executive vice president wayne lapierre said in a statement
' president barack obama failed to pass gun control through congress , so he tried impose his political agenda through executive fiat
but every gun owner in america needs to understand barack obama 's hatred of the second amendment has not changed
' the nation 's largest gun - rights group is preparing for its annual convention next month in nashville , tennessee , where potential presidential candidates including former texas gov. rick perry , texas sen. ted cruz , former florida gov. jeb bush and wisconsin gov. scott walker will rally thousands of the second amendment lobby 's backers
the controversy has also brought a legislative brickbat out of the house , with florida tom rooney rep. tom rooney introducing the protecting second amendment rights act
that bill proposed to generally limit the atf 's power to regulate ammunition
speaking of tuesday 's resolution , texas kevin brady rep. kevin brady said : ' this was way out of step with reality and i âm glad it âs over
