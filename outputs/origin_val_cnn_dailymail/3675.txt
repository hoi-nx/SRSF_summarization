george osborne declared british had reached a â massive moment â after new figures revealed there have never been more people in work
the chancellor said 73.3 per cent of working - age people were employed â the highest rate since records began in 1971
the government said the british had enjoyed the fastest growth in employment of any major economy in the world over the past year
the unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent , compared to a european union average of 9.8 per cent
mr george osborne said 1,000 more people had found employment every day since the coalition came to power in 2010 , with a record 30.94million people now working
the proportion of people claiming jobseeker 's allowance has also fallen to its lowest level for 40 years , according to the ons
addressing mps yesterday , mr george osborne boasted : â the evidence is plain to see
â work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith , who hailed the ' remarkable ' employment figures the chancellor said it had been a â truly national recovery â , with more cities in the north and the midlands feeling the benefits of the british âs economic growth
he added : â where is employment growing fastest ? the north west
where is a job being created every ten minutes ? the midlands
and which county has created more jobs than the whole of france ? the great county of yorkshire
â we are getting the whole of british back to work
â forecasts published by the independent office for budget responsibility yesterday showed the number of people in employment would rise by another million by 2019
it also predicted the british âs unemployment rate will fall from the current 5.3 per cent to 5.2 per cent next year , returning to 5.3 per cent until 2019
meanwhile , the ons revealed that annual growth in private sector employment was five times the size of the fall in the public sector
this challenges claims by labour that the private sector would not be able to compensate for the number of people made redundant by the state as a result of spending cuts
public sector employment fell by 140,000 last year to 5.4million , the lowest level since records began in 1999 and a fall of almost a million since its peak in late 2009
but employment in the private sector hit a record high of 25.5million , after rising by 757,000 in just one year
work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith said : â this is a remarkable set of figures , which underlines this government âs success in backing businesses to create jobs , and supporting british people to seize those opportunities
â as a country we should be proud that there are now record numbers of people in work , record numbers of job vacancies available , and the lowest unemployment rate since 2008
â for every single day that this government has been in power we have seen an average of 1,000 more people in work
â prime minister david cameron said : â the highest employment rate in our history is not a dry fact
â it means more people with the security of a pay packet and a brighter future
â clegg may have praised the lib dem â contribution to the budget â but last night his party was preparing its own rival offering , writes tamara cohen
in a highly unusual move , treasury chief alexander will today address the house of commons to outline lib dem economic plans
he will even have his own yellow budget box , which will later be handed over to a party donor who paid Â£ 1,500 for it at an auction during the spring conference last weekend
lib dem leader and deputy prime minister clegg , takes in yesterday 's budget in the house of commons treasury chief alexander will today address the house of commons to outline lib dem economic plans after skipping last year âs autumn statement , mr clegg made sure he was on the front bench to hear the good news in the budget yesterday , but was spotted fiddling with his phone and pulling a series of faces
he has insisted it was a â coalition budget â
but the chief secretary to the treasury will say today that while his party supports the plans for this year , after 2016 it would diverge from them dramatically
in a speech some labour and tory mps are likely to see as a misuse of government time , mr alexander will propose more borrowing for infrastructure
he is expected to accuse the tories of making â cuts for cuts â sake â â and labour of planning a spending spree if they win office
the lib dem want to increase the personal tax allowance to Â£ 12,500 , add more council tax bands for expensive homes , and raise capital gains tax for the wealthiest
a senior lib dem said : â our spending plans post 2015 - 16 differ from the tories in a number of key areas
we agree on the need to balance the current budget by 2017 - 18 , but they are talking about running a surplus by carrying on cutting after that
