army sergeant bergdahl was brutally beaten , kept chained inside a cage , blindfolded and threatened with execution during his five years in captivity , he has claimed while speaking out for the first time
the former prisoner of war , who was captured by the taliban in 2009 and released as part of a controversial prisoner swap last year , detailed his imprisonment for the first time in a statement released by his lawyer on wednesday
it came after the army charged the 28 - year - old with desertion and misbehavior in the face of the enemy
he could get life in prison if convicted of the latter , more serious charge
bergdahl vanished from combat outpost mest-lalak in paktika province in afghanistan on june 30 , 2009 while on morning guard duty
he left behind his weapon , ammunition and body armor
his minders briefly left him alone in a village where he was being interrogated and beaten for evading questions
' after a while they put the blindfold back on and threw the blanket over my head
some moments after that i believed i had a chance to run for it and did , ' bergdahl wrote in his statement
he was tackled near the outskirts of the village by a large group of men who pummeled him with their fists and clubbed him with the butt of an ak-47 rifle , snapping off the stock
he tried to escape again near the end of his first week as a prisoner , eluding his captors for about 15 minutes , his statement said , but he was found and beaten with a thick rubber hose

' the blindfold was only taken off a few times a day to allow me to eat and use the latrine
' bergdahl said it was not until his muscles began to atrophy and he began to have trouble walking that his captors unchained one of his hands from above his head and tied it to his side , allowing him to sit up in bed
he developed sores from the chafing of the chains and they became infected , with the infection spreading to his face and other parts of his body , he said
after the first three months or so he was never fully chained to a bed again , but he was forced to remain in chains attached to unmovable objects
after a year of captivity , he was placed in a cage , where his hands were kept in chains
his feet were also chained to the cage every night for a year , he said
charges : on wednesday , army col. daniel king spoke from fort bragg ( pictured ) about the charges against bergdahl , who has been charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy sgt. bergdahl deserted his platoon in june 2009 during morning guard duty , his comrades have said eventually his captors stopped chaining his feet because of ' acute pain ' which developed into a ' freezing numbness that continues to the present , as both feet have neuropathy '
bergdahl faces charges under articles 85 and 99 of the uniform code of military justice : ' desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty ' : article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he ' quits his unit , organization , or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service '
it can carry a death sentence but the military wo n't seek that option in the bergdahl case maximum sentence : five years in a military prison plus reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay ' misbehavior before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command , unit or place ' : article 99 charges a service member with running away from a fighting enemy , throwing down his weapons , abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit , or otherwise purposely failing ' to do his utmost to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy any enemy troops , combatants , vessels , aircraft , or any other thing , which it is his duty so to encounter , engage , capture , or destroy ' maximum sentence : life in a military prison plus reduction in rank , dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay the cage was over plumbing where he could relieve himself
he said he was fed elbow noodles or rice and very little else
he received two bottles of water a day
the bottoms of his feet and other parts of his body were regularly beaten with a copper cable
' i was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years , with little to no understanding of time , through periods of constant darkness , periods of constant light , and periods of completely random flickering of light , and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening behind the door i was held behind , ' bergdahl said in the statement
his captors would also often play mind games with him , he said
they would tell him he was about to be executed or that he was going to be released - or that he was going to be there for 30 years
toward the end of his first year in captivity , bergdahl said he managed to escape again
he got away from the building where he was being held and remained at large for about nine days in increasingly desperate circumstances
' without food and only putrid water to drink , my body failed on top of a short mountain close to evening , ' he wrote
he was eventually found by a taliban search group that brutally beat him , he said
' one tried to rip my beard and hair out , but from what i could sense they where [ sic ] more worried about getting me out of that area as quickly as possible , ' he said
the taliban five : the terror leaders traded for bergdahl were ( top , from left ) : abdul haq wasiq , khirullah said wali khairkhwa , mohammad nabi omari ; and ( bottom from left ) : mohammad a fazl , mullah norullah noori ' this is the time that my body reached the worst point of condition and for approximately the next year and a half i would not recover from it
' the statement was released via his attorney , eugene fidell , after the charges were announced
last year , the obama administration released five taliban leaders in exchange for bergdahl 's return - but the celebration of his release was shortlived after his former comrades came forward and said he had deserted his post and forced them to carry out dangerous mission to try to find him
bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted of the misbehavior charge
he could also be reduced in rank to private , forfeit all salary and be given a dishonorable discharge .
