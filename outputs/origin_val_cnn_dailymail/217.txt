morrison shows off with a strange pose on his official instagram account morrison was released from his last contract at west ham following a string of disciplinary problems he started his career at manchester united and was once compared by sir ferguson to legendary red devils midfielder paul scholes
however , for all morrison 's precocious talent , he found himself consistently involved in off - field dramas
in february 2011 , he pleaded guilty to witness intimidation and was fined Â£ 600 three months later for throwing his girlfriend 's phone through an open window during an argument
by the summer of 2012 , ferguson had seemingly had enough of morrison 's antics and he was allowed to join west ham
but at upton park , the problems persisted and morrison was fined Â£ 7000 by the fa for writing an allegedly homophobic tweet shortly after signing
following only a handful of first - team appearances and some loan spells at birmingham , qpr and cardiff , morrison had his west ham contract terminated
