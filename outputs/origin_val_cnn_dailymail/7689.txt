it is n't often psg are compared to shrewsbury , but that is exactly what chelsea boss jose mourinho did when accusing the french side of ' aggressive tactics '
jose mourinho made the comments ahead of wednesday night 's crucial champions league last - 16 clash at stamford bridge after a feisty 1 - 1 draw in the first leg
he said : ' i was surprised because a team with fantastic players was the team with a record number of fouls
jose mourinho says psg are the most aggressive team chelsea have played this season former blues defender david luiz goes in hard on fabregas during the first leg at the parc des princes psg play chelsea at stamford bridge in a champions league last - 16 second leg on wednesday night fouls committed in the champions league this season chelsea 87 psg 83 nemanja matic 17 blaise matuidi * 15 * highest ranked psg player ' this season we 've played against sides form the championship in the cups , against teams from league one , and shrewsbury from league two , but the most aggressive team was psg
' hazard was often the victim at the parc des princes , though laurent blanc has also claimed diego costa is capable of ' dirty tricks ' and has told the referee to watch out
it promises to be a tough night for bjorn kuipers
not only with psg , but with chelsea - who have committed more fouls than psg in the competition this season - and nemanja matic , whose foul - count is higher than any of laurent blanc 's players
but as the two teams look to reach the quarter - finals , who are the psg players jose mourinho feels so strongly about ? are they more aggressive than those in a league two side ? visit squawka for more champions league stats and facts blaise matuidi ( left ) and marquinhos ( right ) double up to take down hazard during the first leg in paris david luiz and thiago silva graceful , skillful , blessed with flair ; those are the characteristics usually associated with brazilian footballers ... but not these two defenders
their rugged approach against chelsea in the first leg angered the visiting players
that was especially case with former blues defender david luiz
the unconventional centre back was obviously eager to make a point to jose mourinho , who sold him for a staggering fee of Â£ 50million in the summer
david luiz operated in midfield in paris and clattered into hazard and fabregas , as well as going head - to - head with diego costa
he is set to operate further back on wednesday night , so will look to join forces with thiago silva and get on diego costa 's nerves again
david luiz and thiago silva ( right , sporting a black eye ) will be looking to dominate diego costa at stamford bridge david luiz tugs back fabregas ( left ) and squares up to diego costa ( right ) during the first leg marco verratti in a midfield three that usually sees tough - tacklers thiago motta and blaise matuidi surround him , marco verratti - who has been compared to andrea pirlo - is often looked at as the ' nice guy '
but the italian youngster showed he had a bit of the paul scholes about him as he launched into tackles against chelsea last month
one in particular , on hazard once again , should have resulted in a red card for the 22 - year - old
his passing range and balance on the ball is something to be admired , but oscar , willian and hazard should be wary of more late lunges from marco verratti and co. marco verratti is not known for his tackling ability but could have seen red for this challenge on hazard the italian midfielder went in with his studs up and caught hazard over the top of the ball zlatan ibrahimovic ' even a player like zlatan ibrahimovic ( zlatan ibrahimovic ) , a typical attacking player â came back when they lost the ball and attacked hazard from behind when we were countering , ' jose mourinho claimed in his press conference on tuesday
the controversial striker may not be regarded as much of a team player and rarely defends from the front with his running , but it is evident he will do what it takes to win
the swede has been sent off 10 times in his club career , with offences including slapping a player in the face
he has only just returned to action after serving a two - game ban after going in studs - up , over the top of the ball against saint-etienne
zlatan ibrahimovic comes from behind to take down hazard ... will he be in that mood again at stamford bridge ?
