nazir afzal has resigned from the crown prosecution service despite being cleared of improper conduct one of the uk 's most senior prosecutors dramatically resigned yesterday despite being cleared of improper conduct
nazir afzal , who led the crown prosecution service ( crown prosecution service ) in north west england , was accused of sending a text message to a defendant
an internal inquiry exonerated the highly experienced lawyer , who was honoured by the queen in 2005 , of any wrongdoing
but he nevertheless handed in his resignation as more senior colleagues insisted his departure is due to an ' on - going drive for efficiency '
the resignation is a direct blow to director of public prosecutions alison saunders who has faced criticism for pursing campaign agendas instead of serving the general public
mr nazir afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences
this included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an asian rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions
he said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and ' fear of appearing racist ' by ' white professionals ' may have stalled justice
more recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former bbc presenter stuart hall
he also led the prosecutions of coronation street actors bill roache , who was cleared of rape , and michael le vell , who was also acquitted of child sex abuse
mr nazir afzal took up his post in 2011 and led a huge team of about 700 lawyers , legal staff , and administrators
he was responsible for all criminal prosecutions across greater manchester , lancashire , and cumbria
earlier this week his staff received an email earlier this week saying it had always been his intention to step down in 2015
mr nazir afzal led the prosecutions of coronation street actors bill roache ( left ) , who was cleared of rape , and michael le vell ( right ) , who was also acquitted of child sex abuse in the four - line email , mr nazir afzal said there was ' no secret reason ' why he was leaving after 25 years with the crown prosecution service
after studying law in birmingham , mr nazir afzal qualified as a solicitor and worked in private practice until he joined the crown prosecution service in 1991
he began his crown prosecution service career in central london and has prosecuted and advised on many high profile cases
mr nazir afzal was awarded an obe in the queen 's new years honours list in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community
a crown prosecution service spokesman said : ' we are continuing to reduce the number of staff employed across the organisation and nazir afzal is leaving the service as part of this ongoing drive for efficiency
' this is entirely unrelated to any issue of conduct and we are satisfied that there has been no impropriety on the part of mr nazir afzal
