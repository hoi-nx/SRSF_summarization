' that treasure map was later sent from colombia to mr grisales cuervo and after he consignment had been delivered they met up with mr valdes jaramillo at a cafe in brixton where the details of where the drugs were to be found were handed over
' as the men left the cafe on 10 july they were arrested by police officers , each were found in possession of a large quantity of mobile phones , including encrypted telephones

' the bananas were wrapped in a particular cling film and had been smeared with some kind of oil or grease or chemical to prevent detection by sniffer dogs , ' said mr millett

she said : ' the seizure was the culmination of a careful , committed police operation
' in march 2014 they observed gonzales handing Â£ 300,000 to a taxi driver who was later acquitted for his involvement , which was clearly proceeds from the operation
' hernandez-gonzalez was the subject to police observation , and a probe was put in grisales-cuervo 's car revealing the extent of his role in the conspiracy with the bananas
' there clearly had been dummy runs at least , if not actual runs , and very significant imports would have continued had the police not stopped it
' she said valdes jaramillo played a ' very significant ' liaison role with the colombia cartel and played a ' leading role ' in the uk operation
hernandez - gonzales organised the distribution networks in the uk while grisales-cuervo travelled out to colombia in june to visit the cocaine factory and meet the bosses of the cartel face to face
