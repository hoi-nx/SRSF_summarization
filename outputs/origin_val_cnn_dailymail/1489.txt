' we 've got fans on the pitch
the game 's still going on '
that 's not me making a mess of kenneth wolstenholme 's infamous words from wembley in 1966 when the boys in red won the cup
that was jonathan pearce 's spontaneous reaction on commentary when some aston villa fans piled onto the playing area towards the end of their team 's semi-final at home to west brom
of course they were scenes that no one wanted to see
except that they very nearly were
because they were a hare 's breath from what we saw when geoff hurst went through to make it 4 - 2
only time surely makes that a less controversial incident ? aston villa fans invaded the pitch after their fa cup win over west brom on saturday night and are seen taunting the away supporters as a line of police keeps them apart thousands stream onto the pitch after the match , which was moved to saturday evening by the bbc geoff hurst races through to score england 's fourth goal in the 1966 cup final with west germany the fa cup is a tournament that we were told had lost its lustre
and attendances may well have endorsed that
but this season , with the fa cup succumbing to the scheduling charms of their new telly twins the bbc and bt , the tournament seems to have taken on a new lease of life
the kind of effervescent and exciting competition in which frequent nostalgic reruns of great cup days somewhat ironically often includes the sight of fans celebrating on the pitch
not that that makes that group of aston villa fans ' behaviour justifiable
although you might debate that a midland derby that does n't kick - off until saturday tea time could just be asking for such a response ? but the timing was because , i can only assume , the slots were preordained for the bbc to include saturday and monday evenings
while bt had saturday lunchtime and sunday afternoon
and with the bbc having first dibs on that deal
or in other words , bbc had what they 'd consider would be the ideal ties , with which to ensure the biggest possible audience , at the best possible times in their schedule
bbc presenter gary lineker and pundits jermaine jenas and alan shearer watch the pitch invasion monday night 's line - up for the man united vs arsenal featured roy keane , alan shearer and ian wright alongside gary lineker in the old trafford studio bt sport 's team of ( from left ) jake humphrey , paul jewell , owen hargreaves and steve mcmanaman with the fa cup pitchside at bradford vs reading on saturday this was a situation bt sport decided to create a silk purse from
why had n't we 'd been following this season 's giant killers bradford , a nation had cried , having been caught up in the excitement of what had gone on so far with their exploits ? well , on saturday lunchtime , bt went free to air to answer that call and show us this season 's favourite davids in action live against the goliaths of ... reading
ok , not a hell of a mismatch , but bradford were still a great story
unfortunately this potential silk purse of a game became something of a pig 's ear on bradford 's pitch
indeed , such a vision in mud it was , it required the club to provide bt with a strange little turf rug on the touchline to put beneath their shiney plinth
nevertheless , there it was , an old school fa cup that we could all watch , for nothing , and keep the momentum going on what was proving to be a vintage cup season
by way of a precursor for the new league telly deal , this sense of occasion rolled on into monday night
again , this was a slot that may have driven the purists mad
danny welbeck celebrates his winner for arsenal against former club man united on monday night scott sinclair is mobbed by aston villa supporters after scoring against west brom not to mention some fans from north london who would have had to make their way back from lancashire by any means necessary on a school night
but again , if you look at the bigger picture , it was the kind of game that could once again get people excited about the cup
and a formidable old pro line up of roy keane , alan shearer , ian wright and martin keown alongside gary lineker all helped ensure that there was indeed the sense that what we were witnessing was an event
next up , more disruption for four teams whose replayed games will be shoe horned in to fit nicely for us folks at home
regardless of how it affects their league schedules

yes , it has lacked a certain sense of tradition
yes , it has occasionally proven awkward for certain clubs , and their fans
and yes it provided that unsavoury moment at villa park
but i celebrate the fact that the fa cup has been put back in the forefront of our football thinking
and if it is because the bbc and bt have decided between themselves to make it their own , then i 'll live with the negatives and embrace the positive .
