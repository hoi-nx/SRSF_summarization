liverpool manager brendan rodgers was the only person who thought gerrard should not start against manchester united , says scholes
gerrard was on the substitutes ' bench until half - time at anfield on sunday , and was sent off after just 38 seconds of coming on for stamping on ander herrera
scholes feels it could have been a different game had gerrard started , and that being a substitute only added to his frustration leading up to his red card
here is the stamp from gerrard on ander herrera after both players had competed for the ball gerrard clearly puts all his downwards force into ander herrera 's right leg after the pair collided gerrard is shown a red card by referee martin atkinson on a frustrating afternoon for the club captain scholes feels gerrard should have started and that being a substitute only added to his frustration ' should he have started the game ? of course he should , ' scholes wrote in his column for the independent
' there was only one person who can have thought that gerrard was not right to start against manchester united at anfield in a must - win game for liverpool , and that was brendan rodgers
' manchester united were brilliant in the first half , but if they had been up against gerrard then it might have been different
' he had the frustration of not playing in the game , and then he had to watch a first half in which none of his team - mates even made a tackle
it is not nice to stand on the sideline and see your own team getting destroyed at home to a big rival
' i can see what he was trying to do when he came on : put a few tackles in and get the crowd going
but even when you can feel the emotions rising in you , the most important thing is control
i got sent off a few times in my life but i never lost my head
i mistimed tackles and i made mistakes
