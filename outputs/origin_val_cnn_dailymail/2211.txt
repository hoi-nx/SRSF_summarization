whem he hosted university challenge , his catchphrase was â your starter for ten â
but the stakes have suddenly become higher for bamber gascoigne â after he unexpectedly inherited an historic mansion from an elderly aunt
he was stunned to be left 50 - bedroom west horsley place in surrey by the duchess of roxburghe , one - time society beauty and a goddaughter of george v âs wife queen mary
bamber gascoigne , seen in a library at west horsely house , has embarked on a mission to save the crumbling estate , which could be worth Â£ 10million once the restoration has been completed the duchess â lady mary evelyn hungerford crewe-milnes â was also mr bamber gascoigne âs godmother and had no children of her own
she died last year aged 99
the grand country house dates from the 11th century , although most of it was built between the 15th and 18th centuries
it had many visits from royalty , including one by henry viii , during which he enjoyed a 35 - course lunch
later , it was occupied by carew raleigh , son of sir walter
legend has it that he carried sir walter âs embalmed head in a bag at the house after sir walter was beheaded
mr bamber gascoigne , 80 , who presented university challenge for 25 years until 1987 , had no idea he was to inherit the grade i listed pile , until a solicitor contacted him

â she had expressed that , given the work required to restore the house , she expected i would sell it
