once again , the lure of isis may have ensnared another group of foreigners -- this time , medical students suspected of traveling to syria to work in isis - controlled hospitals
the group of 11 people includes seven britons , an american , a canadian and two sudanese , turkey lawmaker mehmet ali ediboglu told cnn on sunday
mehmet ali ediboglu , an opposition lawmaker , told the observer that he had spoken with the students ' families , who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for isis , and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring syria
" they have been cheated , brainwashed
that is what i , and their relatives , think , " mehmet ali ediboglu said , according to the newspaper
but he also stressed that the group did not travel with the intention of joining the battle
" let 's not forget about the fact that they are doctors , " he told the observer
" they went there to help , not to fight
" in a joint statement , the students ' and doctors ' families said their children are humanitarians who went " to turkey willingly to offer voluntary medical help to those refugees who are in need of medical care on turkey 's borders
" they have since " disappeared , " the statement said
" we have heard from the britons , turkey and sudanese authorities that we have so far met , but we hope that the respectable governments of these countries would enforce , speed up and coordinate more effective measures to ensure the safety of our children wherever they are and bring them back to us as soon as possible , " the statement said
eight of the group are medical students who 've just graduated , and the three others are in their final year of medical school , he said
they 'd been studying in khartoum , sudanese
at least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the turkey - syria border , pleading for their return , according to the observer
in an interview published monday in turkey 's hã¼rriyet daily news , the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave turkey without their children
dr. maumoon abdulqadir said he was sending a message to his daughter , lena , who is one of the students
" i know you want to help people and be of use
but you can do this in another way , " he told the newspaper
" there are many who need your help
but this is not the way
" britons officials said they are aware of the report
" we are providing consular assistance to their families and we have informed the turkey police to try and ascertain their whereabouts , " the british foreign & commonwealth office said in a statement
officials have warned that a growing number of foreign fighters are traveling to join isis ' ranks
estimates about how many medical personnel the group has recruited are harder to come by
last year , a 19 - year - old colorado woman was arrested at denver international airport as she was about to start a journey to an isis camp , where she hoped to be a nurse
