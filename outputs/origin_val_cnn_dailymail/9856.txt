revelation : tens of thousands of serious criminals are being let off with just a slap on the wrist because of lazy police officers , a report claims today the home affairs select committee points to an â alarming â rise of the caution culture â which grew and peaked under the labour government â and says this has damaged public confidence in the justice system
the committee âs report concludes that too often , police used cautions as a â time - saving tool â rather than the correct way of tackling an offence
in total , police issued 318,500 of the so - called out - of - court disposals , mostly for minor offences , in 2013 - 14 , down from 660,965 in 2008
despite ministers insisting cautions are â inappropriate â for serious offences , 70 sexual and violent offenders a week received one in the past four years
keith vaz , labour chairman of the committee , said : â the inappropriate use of out - of - court disposals to deal with serious offences is unacceptable
â it is alarming that they are not being used in the correct way in up to 30 per cent of cases
â we can not allow the misuse of out - of - court disposals in serious cases to continue
the public deserve to feel reassured that their local police forces are not tackling serious crimes with a slap on the wrist
â keith vaz , labour chairman of the committee , said the ' inappropriate use of out - of - court disposals to deal with serious offences unacceptable
the committee also says the use of cautions has resulted in a â postcode lottery â
in gwent , 49 per cent of offences were brought to justice , compared with 26 per cent in west yorkshire
at the peak , one in ten of all solved cases was dealt with by out - of - court disposals
by last year , it had fallen to fewer than one in 20
the report found that cautions could save the police time and money by cutting bureaucracy , allowing front - line officers to spend more time pounding the beat
arresting an offender takes almost three hours of police time , and charging someone takes five hours
but too many cautions were being handed out â inappropriately â , says the committee
the report welcomes reforms being introduced by justice secretary chris grayling that will end the caution culture which led to criminals being let off with a warning
six types of out - of - court disposals will be replaced with just two which are designed to compel offenders to make some form of reparation
minor criminals will be told they must apologise to victims or repair damage they have caused to prevent a court appearance
more serious offenders will be give a â suspended prosecution â , which means they must meet a set of conditions such as paying a fine and going on a rehabilitation course to avoid further punishment
last year the mail revealed that 90 rapists have received only a caution since the coalition came to power
in total , police issued almost 15,000 for offences that would typically result in jail , including 2,279 for sexual assault , 783 for robbery and 11,347 for burglary .
