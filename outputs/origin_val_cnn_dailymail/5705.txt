defence secretary fallon has vowed to protect british soldiers if the tory win the general election british soldiers will be protected from â ambulance - chasing â lawyers if the tory win the general election , the fallon pledged last night
human rights laws will be â ripped up â to ensure those who fight for their country can no longer be hounded in the courts , fallon said
he promised to end â abuse â of the human rights act by law firms and so - called victims , who he said were lodging claims on an â industrial scale â
such claims were costing the taxpayer millions of pounds and undermining the vital work of the military , mr fallon warned
the tories will confirm their commitment to diminish the british âs membership of the european convention of human rights in their manifesto
as part of this , the human rights act will be scrapped and soldiers will be subject to a new british bill of rights which will reflect the pressures they face in combat
mr fallon said : â this abuse has got to stop and the next tory government will limit the reach of human rights cases to the british so our forces overseas are not subject to persistent human rights claims
â figures yesterday showed legal claims over incidents involving british soldiers in iraq and afghanistan have already cost the taxpayer nearly Â£ 90million over the last ten years â a figure expected to soar even further

justice secretary chris grayling , pictured , said yesterday : â we ca nât go on with a situation where our boys are hamstrung by human rights laws ' after an inquiry costing Â£ 31million , the allegations were found to be â wholly and entirely without merit or justification â
despite this , the law firms are continuing to pursue cases against the mod for deaths in iraq using the human rights act
if the rules are not changed , top brass fear being bombarded by 2,230 more legal claims
there are concerns that troops will in future have to call a lawyer before taking action â even in the heat of a battle
justice secretary chris grayling said yesterday : â we ca nât go on with a situation where our boys are hamstrung by human rights laws â¦ i made it clear last year that i want to rip up labour âs human rights act and that it is only the conservatives who will make real changes to the human rights framework to restore some common sense
â rules governing conflict would fall under the geneva convention , which allows lethal force as a first resort against enemy combatants
last night former military chiefs welcomed the move
colonel tim collins , served in the iraq war , said : â it is about time this happened
to [ some ] lawyers â¦ the iraq are only a vehicle for profit
it is a shameless racket and must be stopped for everyone âs dignity
â soldier kevin williams , who was repeatedly hounded by lawyers over the death of an iraq man , said : â to hear the tories are going to support soldiers is a relief

seven paratroopers , found not guilty after nine - week trial costing up to Â£ 8million but hounded again the court martial of seven paratroopers accused of murdering an iraq teenager collapsed in 2005 after the judge branded some iraq witnesses as seekers of â blood money â
they were hauled before new investigators as part of the iraq fatality investigations and faced fresh scrutiny over their roles last year
the investigations were brought in order to â fulfil the investigation duties of the state â , in accordance with article 2 of the human rights act
sergeant barry singleton , cleared of wrongdoing after a two - year investigation but now faces more questions the 33 - year - old scot , who shot an iraq civilian at a checkpoint in basra 11 years ago , had his case dropped in 2005
now the iraq historic allegations team â set up to comply with the human rights act â have told him they are investigating the shooting as part of their investigations into alleged war crimes in iraq and he was told he could face charges
the family making the case are represented by phil shiner âs public interest lawyers .
