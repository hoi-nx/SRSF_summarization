many teenage girls spend a decent chunk of their beauty grooming time trying to hide all signs of baby hair on the forehead
but it seems it is now about to become a blessing , as baby hair is one of the beauty trends for this summer
as championed by the likes of fka twigs , katy perry and rihanna , the short fluff around the top of the forehead is becoming a key accessory
fka twigs regularly makes a feature of her baby hair katy perry wore slicked down baby hair at the givenchy show last month , while rihanna is also a fan the style is worn gelled down on the forehead , styled into curls and wavy tendrils
the cutting - edge pop stars are n't the only ones using the style though - several top name designers have also been using their look in their catwalk shows
in february , riccardo tisci sent his models down the runway at the givenchy show with wet look baby hair
the caitlin price show at london fashion week also used the look , but in a more other - worldy manner
model 's at the givenchy show in february sported baby hair and facial jewellery the look also appeared it he dkny ss15 show and last month 's caitlin price show in london the style is n't new - it has been adopted from black and latina cultures in the us , who have used the look for many years
while the look appears to have the beginnings of a new trend among fashion designers , many have been unimpressed by its use in the shows
twitter users commented in their hundreds on the look after it featured at givenchy , with many voicing their distaste
one user called sandi cheeks wrote : ' givenchy had white models with slicked down " baby hairs " i do n't know if that counts as embracing afro - hair
' another called bobola_o said : ' not a fan of givenchy 's gelled baby hair look for their models
when has high fashion ever given a damn about appropriation ?
