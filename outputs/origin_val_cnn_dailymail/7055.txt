the netflix catalogue appears to have been leaked online a day before the streaming service is due to launch in aussies
images that claim to show the tv shows and movies that will be on offer were posted to reddit , listing titles including popular u.s. series house of cards and orange is the new black and aussies shows including rake and redfern now
a netflix spokesman would not confirm if the images were authentic , or comment on whether the company released them , telling daily mail australia : ' we 're not commenting on that supposed leak '
the service launches on tuesday charging $ 8.99 per month for a single screen ( standard definition ) , $ 11.99 for two screens ( high definition ) and $ 14.99 for ultra definition on four screens
this makes netflix 's lowest offering the cheapest tv streaming option on the market

but the online streaming services will still have to convince aussies - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content
this could prove difficult , with a new canstar blue survey finding that the majority of aussies are still not willing to pay for tv content
around one in five are willing to pay up to $ 20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see
but this could change in future , with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young aussies are already utilising online streaming services like stan , presto , quickflix and netflix .
