the swarms of insects that plague light bulbs at night could be about to become a thing of the past
scientists have invented a bulb that emits less blue and green wavelengths , which they claim is 20 per cent less appealing to moths and other bugs
the technology could also save lives in the tropical regions of the world , where insects carry a multitude of potentially fatal diseases
a bright idea : scientists claim they have invented a bulb that emits less blue and green wavelengths , which does nât appeal to insects as much as conventional led light bulbs ( shown ) light emitted by conventional bulbs - particularly the blue wavelengths of led bulbs â is attractive to a range of insects , drawing them out from the night and straight to people âs homes
the problem with this is that insects such as mosquitoes , sand flies and â kissing bugs â that fly towards the light , increase the risk of catching vector - borne diseases
six million people worldwide , mostly in latin america , are infected with chagas disease , which is transmitted by â kissing bugs â that are attracted to lights
sand flies infect people with a protozoan parasite responsible for 20,000 deaths annually , while mosquitoes , which are also drawn to the light , carry malaria which kills more than 600,000 people a year
light emitted by conventional bulbs - particularly the blue wavelengths of led bulbs â is attractive to a range of insects , drawing them out from the night and straight to people âs homes
here , a vast number of bugs flock towards a floodlight in australia graphene is set to make its commercial debut in the form of a light bulb in a â matter of months â
the bulb contains a filament - shaped led coated in the super-strong carbon and is set to go on sale late 2015
uk researchers behind the bulb claim it will last longer and be cheaper to make than conventional leds , as well as slash energy use by 10 per cent
it looks like a traditional light bulb , but the graphene coating enables it to conduct electricity and heat more effectively , to facilitate the improved performance , meaning users wo n't have to change their bulbs as regularly
it was designed at the university of manchester , where graphene was discovered , and will be made by graphene lighting plc , a uk - registered company that âs a spin - out from the university
the university said in a statement : â it is expected that the graphene light bulbs will be on the shelves in a matter of months , at a competitive cost
â this implies that the graphene bulbs may cost less than led bulbs , which can be priced at around Â£ 15
while you may imagine that the brightness of a light bulb may dictate how many insects are drawn towards it , scientists from the university of southern california say it âs the colour of the light that matters most
longcore , associate professor of spatial sciences at the university , said future led bulb designs could be customised to be less attractive to specific insect species
all insects are attracted to â white â light , which is a combination of all colours , but different insects are sensitive to particular combinations of these wavelengths
for example , blue , violet , and ultraviolet wavelengths are especially attractive to moths and some other insect groups , so these wavelengths were turned down in experimental light bulb
however , the light it emitted , still appeared white to humans
professor longcore led a team , with help from philips research in the netherlands , with the aim of reducing the number of insects an led bulb can attract while still maintaining white light for indoor use
dr andrã© barroso , a senior scientist at phillips , said : â for the purpose of this study , we created unique and one - off led lamp designs that can be customised to emit different colour wavelengths to reduce the attraction of insects
â this is where lighting meets health and well - being
â the bulbs were tested against off - the - shelf commercial led bulbs , compact fluorescent bulbs and a control with no bulb
professor longcore âs research team fixed each bulb over traps in several locations in california â two in the santa monica mountains to represent rural locations and one in the city of los angeles
sand flies infect people with a protozoan parasite responsible for 20,000 deaths annually , while mosquitos , ( pictured ) which are also drawn to the light , carry malaria which kills more than 600,000 people a year in just over a month , they collected 5,579 insects in the traps , it was reported in the journal philosophical transactions b. the order diptera , which mosquitoes belong to , represented almost seven in every 10 insects caught
they found that despite the customised bulbs being brighter than the led bulbs , they attracted 20 per cent fewer insects
he said : â the research provides proof in concept that led lamps can be customised to avoid specific areas of the spectrum that could have adverse environmental consequences , while still providing light for indoor use
â â for places in the world where glass windows and screens are uncommon , reducing insect attraction to indoor lights is a big deal
â â future research is needed into the light attraction of individual vector species and with the current configurations in the tropics , but the current results indicate a viable path forward
