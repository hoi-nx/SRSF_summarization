england verdict in one sense disappointment because that was the fourth straight year england have finished runners - up
professional sport is about winning ; sport âs oldest adage is â nobody remembers who came second â
on the other hand , england are growing and improving and i am very positive and excited about this team
they have discovered a creative , attacking game that can put any team in the world under pressure if they have the courage to use it
if they work massively on their defence , ensure the full might and power of england âs front five can be brought into every game and become far more clinical in their decision - making at key moments they can achieve great things
and twickenham was rocking again on saturday , the first time in ages we really did have 80,000 people on their feet screaming
england are going to be incredibly tough to beat at twickenham this autumn and that âs a good place to be in a world cup
england 's players form a huddle after narrowly missing out on the six nations title to ireland on saturday head coach stuart lancaster walks down the tunnel after watching his country 's 55 - 35 victory against france what did stuart lancaster get right and wrong ? 15
chris robshaw bench : marler , t youngs , wilson , parling , wood , care , farrell , tuilagi right : he has nailed down the first - choice half - back combination â george ford and ben youngs â and that is huge
ford has been impressive from the start and ben youngs has finished the tournament like a train
the coach has also given jonathan joseph his head at 13 and england have a real cutting edge at outside centre , supported by two fast - developing wings
jack nowell has impressed in all sorts of ways and anthony watson has pace and class , although he needs to find ways of getting more involved
the first - choice england backs , with the exception of 12 , pick themselves now and have a tournament together under their belt
billy vunipola is now an 80 - minute player â he did nât miss a minute of the five games
that âs a big step forward and down to hard work and dedication
george ford ( pictured ) , alongside ben youngs , have formed a first - choice half - back combination wrong : stuart lancaster missed a golden opportunity to check on danny cipriani âs form by starting him against scotland , when i would also have tried slade at 12
george ford could get injured , so danny cipriani needs to be fully integrated and slade could be the answer in a problem position
england have also missed out by not getting steffon armitage involved because there are occasions when the back row has looked unbalanced and one - paced
it is too late now and that idea , alas , has to be binned totally
i am still puzzled by some of the substitutions
no danny cipriani against ireland , then he was brought on at full back on saturday when it cried out for him to play at inside centre
also , why bring on richard wigglesworth , who is just not an impact player , for ben youngs with 10 minutes left against france ? ben youngs was enjoying the game of his life and when the adrenaline is pumping you can achieve remarkable things
it was his day and he was nât finished
stuart lancaster missed an opportunity to start danny cipriani ( centre ) against scotland during the six nations how can england improve their defence ? england conceded 11 tries in the tournament and though i would discount the france game as an extraordinary one - off , they still coughed up sloppy scores in other games
at this level it is about two things on top of great technique
firstly , you have to throw a mental switch from attacking to defending
you must instantly go into a different mindset
that defensive mindset was just not there on saturday and cost england the championship
secondly , you need to communicate all the time from 1 - 15 â keep talking , pointing and tackling
if twickenham is going to become a fortress again it starts and finishes with defence â 11 tries is six too many for a team which has the firepower to trouble any side
ben youngs goes over the line to give england an early lead in their must - win six nations clash against france leicester tigers star ben youngs jumps for joy after scoring the first try of the match on saturday evening player of the tournament my england player of the tournament is george ford , who has quickly proved himself a real gem
he is the man who has started bringing out the full potential of a talented and dangerous england back division
my player of the tournament , though , is ireland flanker sean oâbrien , who is a force of nature when fully fit
he set the tone for ireland in their important win over england and his display against the scots on saturday was the most impactful individual performance of the tournament
ford ( centre ) is my england player of the tournament - he has proved himself as a real talent are irish worthy champions ? yes , totally
they have the best coach in joe schmidt and the outstanding captain and leader in paul oâconnell
ireland have seamlessly brought in young players , notably jared payne and robbie henshaw , who have replaced brian oâdriscoll and gordon dâarcy
joe schmidt varies his game plans and selections cleverly and rarely misses a trick
they outplayed and out - thought england in dublin and their more expansive â but ruthless â game plan at murrayfield was delivered perfectly
ireland are rock solid , they are only going to get better and will not fall off the cliff like they did in the 2007 world cup in france
the irish will be a big factor at rwc2015
ireland have the best coach in joe schmidt and paul o'connell ( right ) is an outstanding captain and leader wales verdict they look very dangerous and threatening and are building their year nicely
warren gatland is another excellent coach â for some reason he never gets the full credit he is due â and he will have wales perfectly fine - tuned by september
their incredible defence against ireland impressed me most of all and they have dangerous backs all over the park
my one concern would be their front row , with injuries and the retirement of adam jones
even in that huge win in rome , italy pushed them about a bit at scrum - time
they ca nât afford that to happen at the world cup but warren gatland has been there and has the t - shirt , and wales really need to get behind him now
warren gatland never gets the full credit he deserves and he will have wales fine - tuned by september champagne moment in fact it was a eureka moment ! it was when george ford took that quick line - out throw on england âs own line in the first half on saturday and started a brilliant counter-attack that ended with ben youngs going in under the posts
that was this england team at their best and most dangerous and they need to be fearless and reproduce that in the very biggest games
will they do it in the first minute against a world - class team in the world cup ? that âs still the big question
george ford slides in to score england 's fourth try of the afternoon and first of the second half against france and finally the french ! i do nât buy for one minute this idea that the t14 is diluting their talent
they still have an incredible pool of players and any top coach would love the prospect of having the french national team
they just need to stop looking for excuses and start to leverage their amazing talent
yes , they have been a bit of a shambles at times in this tournament but , incredibly for a team who shipped 55 points , there were one or two hints at a brighter future on saturday
and i would say this : france turn up at world cups
they have reached three finals and there will always be an anxiety about playing them in the knockout stages
france still have an incredible pool and players and they need to stop looking for excuses
