' threat : the knife blade which was reportedly discovered in the pizza hut vegetarian pizza miss khan , who had ordered the takeaway pizzas to her parents ' house in slough , berks , pulled out the piece of metal and was stunned to discover it was the snapped - off tip of a knife blade
the mother - of - one , who works at a recruitment agency in slough , said : ' i thought it was tin foil but when i pulled it out it was the tip of a knife
everyone was horrified and shocked
' the thought of my daughter having to swallow that or put that in her mouth is horrific
' she could have cut her tongue or the inside of her throat
i could have been sat in a&e
' amana khan , 14 , bit into the vegetarian pizza before complaining to her mother that she thought there was something metal in it store : the pizza hut takeaway in slough , berks , sent a driver round to the family 's house and took away the knife blade miss khan immediately called pizza hut but felt like she was being accused of making it up
she said : ' i felt like i was being accused of putting the blade in there myself just to get a free pizza
' i had to explain to him if you looked at your records you will see how many times we order pizza from you
' a delivery driver came round to the house and provided a refund as well as taking the blade away - but miss khan is still frustrated with pizza hut 's response
mother khan , who ordered the pizzas , said she was not looking for compensation but wants pizza hut to acknowledge what happened she said : ' my daughter was not hurt so i am immensely grateful
' i am not looking for compensation or anything silly like that , i want acknowledgment that this was in their food because it is absolutely disgusting
' if my daughter or another child had swallowed that , or an adult , can you imagine ? it could have cut up the inside of their throat or the lining of their stomach
