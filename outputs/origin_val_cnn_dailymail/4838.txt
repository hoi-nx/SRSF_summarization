horner claimed after the opening race in melbourne , when his cars were considerably off the pace all weekend , that the renault engine was 100bhp short of mercedes
he also ruled out a victory this season
cyril abiteboul , seen here with team principal horner at the jerez test earlier this year daniel ricciardo finished a lowly sixth at the season opener , one lap behind race winner lewis hamilton but in a statement from renault ahead of this weekend âs malaysian grand prix , abiteboul shared the blame around , saying : â we need to work together to understand our issues , both within the power unit and the chassis
our figures have shown that the lap time deficit between red bull and mercedes in melbourne was equally split between driveability issues , engine performance and chassis performance
â it âs therefore the overall package that needs some help and we have been working with the team to move forward
â we âve been particularly aggressive in development and we should see the results a lot more clearly in malaysia
work is still ongoing but even now we are in a completely different place from where we finished melbourne
