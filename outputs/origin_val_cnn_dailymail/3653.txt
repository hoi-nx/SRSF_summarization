gay actor tovey has apologised after causing outrage for saying he was glad he did n't go to a drama school because its students are ' effeminate ' and ' prance around '
tovey , who plays a british convict deported to australian in the upcoming bbc drama banished , made the comments when discussing how the school his father forced him to attend helped ' toughen ' him up
the 33 - year - old 's remarks outraged many and were criticised as ' disparaging ' and helping to ' divide the gay community and propagate hate '
he went on to star in a series of bbc dramas , such as being human , him and her and most recently banished , while he is also well known to american audiences for his role as a gay man in the hbo series looking
during an interview with the observer at the weekend , he spoke of how disappointed he was as a teenager when his father refused to allow him to attend the famed sylvia young theatre school in marylebone , london
but he claimed that in retrospect this was a good thing because the school he did attend forced him to ' toughen up '
he said : ' i feel like i could have been really effeminate , if i had n't gone to the school i went to
' if i 'd have been able to relax , prance around , sing in the street , i might be a different person now
' i thank my dad for that , for not allowing me to go down that path
' he added that his upbringing gave him unique acting qualities and there were not many actors who audiences were ok with playing straight or gay characters
but the comments were quickly seized upon , with australian actor brendan maclean stating there was ' nothing unique about internalised homophobia ' and liberal thinkprogress editor zack ford saying he was ' disappointed ' to see tovey ' disparaging effeminate guys '
actor tovey posted a series of tweets yesterday ( pictured ) in which he apologised and backtracked on the comments , claiming they had been misunderstood another wrote that such statements ' divide the gay community and propagate hate towards us by others '
tovey responded yesterday with a series of tweets in which he claimed to ' raise the white flag '
he wrote : ' if you feel i have personally let you down i 'm sorry , that was never my intention
' i 'm proud to be who i am and proud for others
we 're in this together , i want you to know whatever you think i meant , i did n't
' i 'm gon na ride this out , and one day we will all look back on this moment with a half smile of fascination and satisfaction
