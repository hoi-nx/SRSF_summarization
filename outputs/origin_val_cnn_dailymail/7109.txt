road rage has become a major problem across the world , but in australia the first example of road reassurance may have taken place
motorcyclist mathew sant was travelling along canberra avenue toward the city on tuesday in an 80km/h zone when he was rear - ended
instead of reacting furiously though , he gave the guilty driver a thumbs up
' traffic had backed up ahead and come to a stop , ' he said on youtube after uploading a video of what happened
all things seem to be going well as motorcyclist mathew sant stops in traffic along canberra avenue suddenly he is thrown in the air off his motorbike after getting rear - ended by a car instead of losing his temper at what happened mr mathew sant gives the driver a thumbs up to make it even clearer there are no hard feelings he shakes the driver 's hand ' as i came to a stop i checked my mirror and moved to the right of the road in case the car behind was n't paying attention
' i saw him come to a stop and relaxed , looking away
the next thing i knew i was looking at the sky
' in the youtube video mr mathew sant is seen going steadily along , minding his own business , in a lane of traffic and all seems to be going well
however , after coming to a standstill because the cars in front have stopped , a car comes up behind the motorcyclist and crashes into the back of him
it 's only when he looks back that he sees the rest of the carnage that has taken place mr mathew sant would have been within his rights to give the driver what for , but flashes him a thumbs up instead
it 's the last thing the driver expects and he asks worriedly : ' are you all right mate ? ' even then mr mathew sant remains cool and composed
he shakes hands with the driver and laughs at all that just happened
it is only then that the motorcyclist walks back to see the carnage that occurred behind him
mr mathew sant has then a chance to see how lucky he was after the accident after breathing a sigh of relief he thanks his lucky stars the accident did n't turn out to be worse he soon realises that he was n't the only victim as the initial crash caused a three - car pile up , with other motors badly damaged
after surveying the scene the reality of how lucky he was finally dawns on him
' i ca n't believe i 'm all right , ' he says thankfully .
