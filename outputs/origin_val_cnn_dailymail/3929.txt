after getting out of the room where the prisoners were , he had to wait for cantlie who was to escape second

" i could n't leave jihadi john on his own " , foley said
' the attempts by foley and cantlie caused them weeks and weeks of punishment
" they were literally trying to kill us for weeks until they realised that we had given up trying to escape " , cantlie had said
