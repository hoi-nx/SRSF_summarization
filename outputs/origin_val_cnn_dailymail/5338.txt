a cheeky brown bear soaked its patient canine friend when it sprayed it with water from a garden hose
tima , a 300kg bear that has travelled the world performing with the german shepherd since it was adopted in 1995 , shows it knows how to have fun , delighting in the hose and even aiming at its companion
holding a garden hose in its paws , the bear lunges its arms back and forth and initially appears to get itself wet
the playful pair were filmed enjoying the sunshine â and the chance to cool off â near the southern city of jaen , in spain
the bear , originally from siberia , holds the hose straight out in front of it to allow the fountain of water to land just beside the dog
before it begins lunging its arms once more and spraying water everywhere â eventually managing to hit the dog
flinching slightly when sprayed , the german shepherd moves from its resting position and jumps up to its feet
the bear holds the garden hose in its paws and initially manages to spray itself with water the dog then sits with its ears pointing upwards as the bear moves to position itself better , still holding the hose in its paws
moving the hose down to the ground , the bear then begins swinging it more erratically and sprays the dog square in the face
despite getting wet , the german shepherd remains patient and stays rooted to its original position â in the bear âs firing line
twirling the hose , the bear then manages to wet itself again before redirecting its focus towards the dog and soaking it once more
the bear holds the hose in the direction of the dog and manages to spray it directly in the face the dog flinches and shakes the water from itself but remains patient and rooted to its original position the video concludes with the bear standing up on two feet to spray the dog from a higher vantage point the dog then opens its mouth in the hope of having a drink , before shutting it again , shaking off the water and licking its lips
the video concludes with the bear rising to its feet to spray the dog â who is also stood up on all fours â from a higher position .
