it is little surprise the former arsenal defender has chosen 11 players that once donned the red of the gunners , but who makes his best line - up ? watch # one2eleven every friday evening on the fantasy football club , sky sports 1 or catch up on demand
sportsmail columnist keown ( centre ) has chosen his best xi he ever played with in his career goalkeeper : david david has to be my no 1 goalkeeper
i 'd come from everton with gary neville
you could n't look at gary neville because if you looked at him he 'd blame you if the ball was in the back of the net
but david was the complete opposite
david had really sort of soft hands
he was able to take the sting out of a shot
we had a decent defence but it was nothing without david in goal
right back : lee dixon if i 'm having to pick one , it has to be lee dixon
he was sort of my eyes and ears
he was almost part of my own body
i never had to look to my right because lee dixon was telling me everything that was going on
arsenal 's lee dixon ( left ) and tony adams ( centre ) shout at barcelona 's phillip cocu after a penalty incident defender : tony adams first bumped into him at the age of 13
cockney lad , swaggering into the room
i was a little bit of a country bumpkin
we kind of set up a partnership in the youth team
i knew him inside out
i knew his strengths , i knew his weaknesses
he has to get into that team
there 's no doubt about it
defender : sol campbell he turned up at arsenal around all that publicity and expectation
it was on a train that did n't get out of the station to start with
eventually once that train got going , it was unstoppable
it was a real force
he 's quick , strong , could see danger
once he was focussed , he was as good as anyone
left back : ashley cole straight away i could see that this kid was going to be a bit special
ashley would park himself around the senior players
he would listen in , he was a very , very quick learner
just disappointed he had to leave arsenal early
gunners captain patrick vieira lifts the fa cup after arsenal beat manchester united in the final in 2005 right wing : robert pires just on another planet
the goal that stands out was at villa park when he knocks it over peter schmeichel
he 'd just embarrassed a top keeper
he was just capable of that
you 've got to look at what you see in training behind the scenes , and robert pires had people applauding the stuff he was capable of
midfielder : patrick vieira he was the catalyst for all the success that was to come
without patrick vieira there would n't have been any of these trophies
i can tell you that
he pretended he could n't speak english at the start , then everyone was talking about him , and i think he grabbed someone by the throat in the dressing room
it showed he had some fight about him
as it unfolded i became his minder
i think people could see he could react a bit and we needed him on the pitch
still to this day he 's the same person that walked through the door that very first day at arsenal
midfielder : emmanuel petit it was a competition between him and patrick vieira who was going to be man of the match
he was a warrior that could play with that finesse and gave us that buffer whenever we had to defend
those two in front made our lives very easy
patrick vieira and emmanuel petit celebrate during their premier league match against tottenham hotspur in 1999 left wing : marc overmars you 've got to ask gary neville how pleased was he to see him leave
he was so quick that it was almost as if someone had picked him up and put him there
you did n't see him travel
he put fear into teams
you could just see people backing off giving him space to play in
striker : dennis bergkamp his ability
the way he could bend balls around players
once he got away from you in training - i was no slouch - and you would n't catch him
slow start when he came
i think he was a little bit unsure of the situation he found himself in
again we were n't really ready
to play with dennis was a joy
i remember ian wright skipping down the marble halls at highbury when he heard dennis was coming , because he knew that meant goals
striker : thierry henry he had that sort of textbook finish
he was more basic in his finishing
you 've never seen anything like it
this was a top athlete without spikes , he had football boots instead
i gave him a hard time when he came , as i did with all the strikers
he had that swagger as he does now even in front of the camera
he was turning to the rest of the team : ' you better be able to stick with me
' whereas at the start we were demanding he came with us
those two together was an absolute nightmare and i used to giggle when i 'd see them in action because i had to train against them
