riding the crisp green waves that break into a whirl of foam on costa rica 's pacific shore , hill looks like he could surf before he could walk
however , for the 37 - year - old owner of surf simply , a surfing resort in nosara , the sport was an early love that blossomed later in life
he first paddled out to the big blue when he was a teenager , but his professional life took a different turn when he embarked on a fine art degree in london
in the end , the pull of the waves was too strong and hill decamped to costa rica with a goal to create a surfing school with a difference
" i wanted to create a really intimate space that was a long way away from the putting the lots of people in the water kind of business model that surf schools often are
i wanted to just have a few people , 12 people each week , and then this area is somewhere where they can completely decompress and just focus on being coached how to surf better , " he says
a large chunk of the school 's training is devoted to theory classes , and hill also films his students while they 're surfing so that he can show them what aspects of their technique they need to improve : " the first time you see yourself surfing , it 's kind of mortifying
it 's a little bit like hearing yourself sing for the first time
but , like most sports , it 's the best coaching tool we have , " he says
hill 's fine art credentials have not gone to waste though , as his creative training helped him design the website as well as the resort logo
while following his passion for surfing was important , hill stresses that figuring out how to make money out of it was equally significant
" the business side of it has to work , the numbers have to make sense
otherwise , what you 've got is a brilliant hobby that 's not a business , " he says
hill says that , while he feels fortunate that his work fulfills him , it still involves ordinary tasks that can sometimes be mundane
" i do n't think anyone is going to find a job that they love all the time , but if you can find something that you love most of the time , you 're luckier than most people in the world
