a father who believed he had the right to smack his young children has had them taken into care by social workers
the parent , from rotherham , told officials that he thought his children benefited from being smacked
he said that he hit his children on the bottom , legs and arms , using his hand , but that the red marks ' did not last long '
but a judge has now ruled that his ' entrenched ' views were harmful to their children
a father who believed he had the right to smack his two young children has had them taken into care by social workers following a ruling at the high court in london ( pictured ) the man has now had his third child , a six - month - old girl , taken into care by rotherham council officials
it comes after his middle child , now aged three , was also taken into care
it is not clear whether the man 's eldest child is in care , although there have also been care proceedings issued in relation to that child
handing down the judgement at the high court , judge sarah wright said she made the decision because there was no prospect of the father ever changing his ' domineering behaviour '
she added that the children 's mother could not protect the youngsters from her partner 's need to have ' total control ' over his family
she said : ' it was clear to me that she can not separate herself from the father and from his entrenched views
' sadly , she has put him before her children
she refused to accept any view or opinion that is not his
the parent revealed that he smacked his children on the bottom , legs and arms , using his hand ( picture posed by models ) ' she singularly fails to appreciate the risk that he poses to any child in his care '
during the hearing , it emerged that the man 's son , now aged three , had been removed from the family home when he was just a few months old
since then , he has been cared for by his ' quiet , considered and thoughtful ' maternal uncle
the judgement also revealed that care proceedings had taken place for another child , during which a family judge criticised the man 's ' rigid and inflexible thinking '
the court said the man was not prepared to ' settle for a shade of grey ' , but saw everything in black and white
he also insisted on his right to smack his children , believing he had done ' nothing wrong ' , the judgement said
it added that both parents had been ' uncooperative and obstructive ' with professionals
during the latest hearing , it emerged that , when the mother fell pregnant again , she tried to conceal her pregnancy so they would not flag up on social services ' radar
despite the mother arranging to give birth at a hospital in a different area , their attempt to conceal the birth failed
the little girl - known as e - was then taken from them under a police protection order
explaining her reasons for concealing her pregnancy with e , the mother said she feared she would be put under pressure to have an abortion
she also insisted there was no basis for social workers ' concerns , saying : ' there is no reason why we are here '
whilst agreeing he could be ' slightly dogmatic ' , she said he had never been violent or aggressive , the judgement said
but the court ruled that the mother had ' aligned herself ' with the father and said she was ' totally convinced ' that he posed no risk to the children
it added that the father ' must feel in control ' and was capable of rude , uncompromising and hostile behaviour in his determination to get his own way
' there is also very little prospect of the father accepting the need to change ' , said the judge
despite the parents ' objections , judge wright ruled that e 's welfare demanded that she also be looked after by her uncle and his partner , alongside her older brother
