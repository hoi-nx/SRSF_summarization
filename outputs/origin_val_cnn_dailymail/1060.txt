the one thing you can count on at poundland â according to its bosses â is that everything costs Â£ 1
and now the budget retailer has been told it must drop that claim after selling dvds and cds for Â£ 2
today âs ruling by the asa is a major blow for the company , which has built its empire on the boast that just Â£ 1 can buy anything in its stores
poundland has been told it must drop the claim ' everything costs Â£ 1 ' after selling dvds and cds for Â£ 2 the decision even calls into question whether the budget chain can legitimately continue to call itself â poundland â
before the advertising watchdog âs ruling , poundland 's website boasted : â everything for Â£ 1 was the idea of our founders in 1990 and we âre still true to that vision today
â under a heading â our values â , it added : â we âve grown to be the largest single price value retailer in the britain ... we are very proud to offer you a single Â£ 1 price , that has nât changed since we opened our first store
â however , people complained to the asa that these claims were no longer accurate because it was stocking dvds of blockbuster films in a concession partnership with another firm for Â£ 2 each
poundland defended the breaking of its normal Â£ 1 price barrier saying the Â£ 2 items were part of a special promotion run at the tills and sold to customers providing they met a minimum spending threshold
the asa said : â they stated that an average poundland store stocked approximately 4,000 products and that the â conditional spend â promotion was created in response to consumer demand
poundland has become hugely popular with wealthier shoppers after stocking baking products under the name of actress jane asher â in october 2014 , poundland obtained feedback from consumers regarding the promotion and found that a significant proportion agreed that they would buy items from poundland that cost more than Â£ 1 , provided they were clearly marked and located in a special place in the shop
â the company said the stock of Â£ 2 dvds and cds were on a specific display that was separated from the normal Â£ 1 products and there was no chance of shoppers being confused or misled
but that did not satisfy the asa , which said the claims on the poundland website suggested that all its products were no more than Â£ 1 â regardless of whether or not they were sold via a concession arrangement or as promotional goods â
it added : â because that was not the case , we concluded that the ad was misleading
â significantly , the asa said : â we told poundland that their future advertising must not state or suggest that every item they sold cost Â£ 1
â if this ruling sticks , it will be a heavy blow to one of britain âs fastest growing retailers
the company recently announced a plan to spend Â£ 55million to take over its deadly rival the 99p stores chain , which will add some 251 outlets to an existing empire of 534 stores
the company , which floated on the stock exchange last year , is worth almost Â£ 1billion and has become a fixture on many high streets , taking over outlets once occupied by the failed giant woolworths
it was shunned by the middle classes , at one time , but it is now hugely popular after making a concerted effort to attract wealthier shoppers with baking products under the name of cake maker and actress jane asher , a range of well received beauty products as well as gardening and diy items
poundland is not the first discount store to fall foul of the asa
last october , the watchdog issued a similar ban on claims made by the poundworld chain
the company was told to stop claiming everything costs Â£ 1 after it was found selling more expensive products under the heading â manager specials â
these included packs of 100 finish all - in - one dishwasher tablets for Â£ 8.99 , Â£ 3 for 10 cans of cola and Â£ 5.99 for a sex & the city gift set
poundland confirmed some â special promotion â items cost more than Â£ 1
currently , it is selling an easter bunny toy and a nivea skin set for Â£ 3 to customers who spend Â£ 3
the firm said it has changed its website claims following the asa ruling
a spokesman said : â following advice from the asa on the communication of our special promotions on the poundland website , we have amended the site and made the special promotions clearer
â poundland sells over 4,000 products at Â£ 1 , including over 1,000 well - known brands and we are proud of the amazing value we offer , to over 5.5 million customers every week
â our special promotions have been bought by nearly one million customers , and are an additional offer separate to our usual product lines for customers who qualify , by spending Â£ 3 or more in - store
' these items can not be bought separately
customer feedback has been outstanding
