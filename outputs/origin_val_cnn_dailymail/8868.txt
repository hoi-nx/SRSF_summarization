miss sara cutting , from brighton , east sussex , said : ' i shaved my hair off before it fell out because it felt like i would be taking control of the cancer , rather than the cancer controlling me
' life has to go on and you have to find a way of coping , so this has been a really good focus for me
it 's a reason for me to get my make up on , get dressed and put on a big smile , no matter how i 'm feeling
' i wanted to do something to raise awareness of breast cancer and to thank macmillan cancer support , which has supported me through all of this
' when sara cutting first started her challenge she was pleased to realise that she had raised Â£ 1000 in just two days sata has had to be very creative to come up with all of her ideas but she says that they have been helping her get through the process of chemotherapy this brilliant straw head - dress makes sara cutting look a little bit like a scarecrow as the straw covers her bald head during her journey sara cutting says that her friends have been kind enough to help her out not only with support , but with lending her some of her head gear miss sara cutting was applying moisturiser to her body after a shower when she discovered a lump on her breast in july last year
she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer , and within weeks she had surgery to remove the tumour and affected lymph nodes from her right breast
the operation was a success , but in october she began chemotherapy to ensure any stray cancer cells would be caught , too
miss sara cutting said : ' i went to the doctors about something unrelated to all this and just mentioned i 'd been getting some dry skin under my arm pit
' i was told to start using moisturiser after my shower to help prevent it , and one day when i was putting my body lotion on , i lifted my arm up and felt this lump on my breast
' the following day i went to my gp , who referred me to the local breast care clinic
within two weeks i was told i had a very aggressive form of cancer
it was such a shock - it still has n't quite sunk in now
' this look , which features long strands of chain dangling down into sara cutting 's face would n't be out of home in lady gaga 's wardrobe sara cutting says that the news that she had cancer still has n't really sunk in but her friends and family have been a great support maybe sara cutting was hoping to catch some rain water with this hairband complete with a bucket attached to it she continued : ' soon after i had the operation to remove the tumour from my breast and remove the affected lymph nodes from there , too
' the doctors think it went well as they ca n't see any more cancer there , but they still wanted to do the chemotherapy , just to be on the safe side
. ' it was then miss sara cutting decided to have her shoulder - length blonde hair shaved off and begin her one year different daily headgear challenge
she has since been inundated with donations from friends and strangers , and had several hats designed for her
the bubbly fundraiser is also accepting donations of headwear in her bid to reach her target of a daily selfie for 365 days

' she added : ' within two days of starting the campaign i 'd raised 1,000 pounds
