a second western australia man has come forward to claim he was the target of a cruel facebook hoax involving a photo of a person urinating on a war memorial
the image of a young man desecrating on a tribute went viral on social media , aiming to shame the person responsible
' this is liam powell from perth , western [ sic ] australia urinating on a war memorial - share if you 're disgusted , ' the image was captioned
however , the wrong person was vindicated in the campaign
it has since been revealed that the photo was taken in england six years ago and the real culprit was 19 - year - old named philip laing
contrary to the caption , this facebook image really shows mr philip laing , 19 , soaking the wreaths of poppies in 2009
liam powell from wanneroo in perth 's north is now hoping to clear his name , alleging that he was purposefully identified as the person in the image in an attempt to ruin his reputation
another liam powell , a footballer from perth , has already spoken out to allege that he was intentionally victimised by the post
both are insistent that the post was a personal attack , intended to ruin their reputation
mr liam powell from wanneroo told fairfax that he has an ongoing problem with internet trolls
' this was actually aimed at me , ' he told fairfax , refuting the earlier claims from the east perth powell
' i 've had a problem with people on facebook , ' he said but is bewildered as to why he is the supposedly subject of such a cruel bullying campaign
he is feeling victimised after receiving almost 300 mostly nasty comments on facebook regarding the viral photo
philip laing ( pictured ) pleaded guilty but escaped jail time and was instead sentenced to 250 hours of community service earlier , the other mr liam powell and his family explained that they felt shamed by the facebook hoax as they have a military history , wa today reported
liam powell 's father , andrew , said he 's been flooded with comments from those who saw the image and the offending caption naming his 17 - year - old son , who 's an perth footballer
' it 's not liam powell , ' mr liam powell told wa today
' it 's embarrassing for our family
' mr liam powell says he was particularly upset by the image due to his long military history
he says his father was in the navy , his grandfather was in the second world war and his great - grandfather also fought in the boer war
' even though it 's not him [ liam powell ] , i feel ashamed because people think it 's him , ' mr liam powell said
the real culprit , 19 - year - old mr philip laing , caused revulsion in 2009 after he was pictured soaking the wreaths of poppies during a mass student bar crawl in the british
the student , who pleaded guilty but escaped jail time and was instead sentenced to 250 hours of community service
philip laing , is thought to have no memory of the urinating incident , which happened on a night out in 2009 when mr philip laing has been buying drinks for Â£ 1 ( about aus $ 2 )
he was ordered to pay Â£ 185 ( about aus $ 366 ) in prosecution costs
the real culprit , mr philip laing , told probation officers back in 2009 that he had been buying drinks for Â£ 1 ( about aus $ 2 ) on the night security staff later washed the memorial
