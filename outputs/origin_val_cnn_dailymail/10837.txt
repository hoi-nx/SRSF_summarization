she been remanded in boulder county on $ 2 million bail
dynel catrece lane , 34 , ( pictured with her husband , david ridley ) was facing murder charges in colorado after she allegedly cut a baby from the womb of a seven months ' pregnant woman who she lured to her home with a craigslist ad for baby clothes police were investigating whether dynel lane knocked michelle wilkins her unconscious and then removed the fetus by cutting open her abdomen
michelle wilkins arrived at the home shortly before midday to buy baby clothes which had been advertised
she was also stabbed in the neck with a broken glass before being cut open
dynel lane , who has two daughters , was held on $ 2million bail during a hearing at boulder county , colorado ( pictured in booking photo ) in longmont this week , protesters took to the streets of the city , which has a population of 90,000 , to pressure police into charging the suspect with murder
the demonstrator 's held placards with messages such as ' murder is murder ' and ' justice for michelle wilkins '
among then were several pregnant women who got together to join the demonstration through social media
katelyn dunn , 26 , said : ' we feel so sorry for michelle wilkins
she had carried her child for seven months and must have been so excited about the future as a mother
' it is a very special thing to have a child and this is such an appalling thing to happen
we feel so much for her and want the attacker to be accused of murder and nothing less
' murder charges against dynel lane now depend on whether the child was alive outside of the 26 - year - old expectant mother 's womb , the district attorney 's office said last week
boulder county district attorney stanley l. garnett said : ' the issue of whether or not murder charges are appropriate involving a case involving the death of a fetus or a late - term pregnancy is always a difficult issue
' under colorado law , essentially , there 's no way murder charges can be brought if it 's not established that the fetus lived as a child outside the body of the mother for some period of time
' i do n't know the answer yet as to whether that can be established , what our facts are here
