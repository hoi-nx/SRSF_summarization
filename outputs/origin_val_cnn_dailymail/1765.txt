top players often try to find a way to avoid difficult questions from the press , but alves has found a more inventive method than most
the barcelona full back was hounded by journalists while travelling home from a few days off over the international break
alves has been linked with a move away from the nou camp when his contract expires this summer , and he was repeatedly asked where he would be going

eventually , when directly asked about a reported agreement with paris st germain , the brazil defender lost patience , grabbing the microphone off one of the reporters and bursting into song , blasting out a few bars of bazilian singer - songwriter xande de pilares fortunately alves is a better footballer than a singer , and despite not featuring during this international break , and being allowed to leave barcelona , is not without suitors amongst europe 's elite .
