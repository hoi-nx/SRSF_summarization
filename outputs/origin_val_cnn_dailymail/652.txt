' they told me they needed to use my garden to get through to a house and told me to go inside
' there are three of them there at the minute : one with what looks like a machine - gun , another one with a dog and the third what looks like a grenade launcher
' there 's also a very big vehicle pulled up outside
it looks as though it is an armoured vehicle '

i know the guy who lives in the house and he keeps himself to himself '
