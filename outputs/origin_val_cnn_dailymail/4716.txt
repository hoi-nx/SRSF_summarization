jeremy vine has been funnelling cash through a limited company , jelly vine productions , of which his daughter , martha , is a shareholder in a tongue - in - cheek guide to â tax accounting for the rich â , jeremy vine once advised the wealthy to find a â tax magician with the power to bend the rules , befuddle the tax inspector and make money invisible â
now it seems that the bbc star has taken his own advice to heart
mr jeremy vine appears to have been using his ten - year - old daughter martha to avoid tax payments
the presenter of the jeremy vine show and the tv quiz eggheads , has been funnelling cash through a limited company , jelly vine productions , of which she is a shareholder
the controversial move will highlight the bbc âs practice of paying some presenters off its books using money from the millions of pounds it earns in licence fee - payers â money
in 2012 , it emerged that more than 140 bbc stars were funnelling cash through private firms to avoid paying millions in tax
during the resulting furore , mr jeremy vine ran a spoof , â jeremy vine âs six - step guide to tax avoidance for the rich â , on his radio show
jelly vine productions had almost Â£ 810,000 in cash on its books in 2013 â the last accounts available , and Â£ 1million in 2012
if the funds had been paid to mr jeremy vine through the pay as you earn scheme used by most firms , it would have been taxed at 40 or 45 per cent
but by channelling them through a private firm , he can declare them as company profits , subject to corporation tax of 23 or 24 per cent
it is not clear whether these were earnings for mr jeremy vine âs bbc work or included other fees such as payments for speeches or book royalties
but by arranging his finances in this way , he ensured jelly vine productions could pay dividends to its shareholders
the firm is controlled by mr jeremy vine , who has 51 per cent of the shares
his wife , rachel , has 30 per cent and the remaining 19 per cent is owned by martha , one of their two daughters
murphy , an accountant at tax research , said : â he is obviously using the company to reduce his tax bill
it is perfectly legal , and perfectly allowed
jelly vine productions had almost Â£ 810,000 in cash on its books in 2013 â the last accounts available ' what is a little unusual is his daughter
let âs be honest , she is unlikely to have said , â daddy , i want to spend my pocket money on shares in the company â
â jelly vine productions â accounts do not disclose how much it has paid out or whether it has paid dividends to all three family members , or just mr jeremy vine himself
mr murphy said mr jeremy vine could have named his daughter as a shareholder for â long - term tax - planning â purposes , reducing the tax she would pay if she inherits part of the business
alternatively , mr jeremy vine may have made his wife and daughter shareholders to split the dividend payouts , keeping them just small enough to ensure they are taxed at a lower rate , rather than at 40 or 45 per cent
a spokesman for the presenter said the reason for making his daughter a shareholder was â private â but â perfectly legal â , adding : â i do nât think it is cynical
what jeremy vine is doing is very common
if the government makes laws that allow people to do things that are advantageous , it is up to the government to change the laws
â bbc contracts stipulate that presenters must pay the taxes they owe , and tells hmrc who it has paid each year
a spokesman said it would not comment on mr jeremy vine âs arrangements , adding : â it is the responsibility of self - employed individuals to ensure they are paying the correct amount of tax
