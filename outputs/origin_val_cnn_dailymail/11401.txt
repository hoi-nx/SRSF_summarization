a grandmother was left shaking with worry after being sent an energy bill demanding more than Â£ 9,000 - despite her really only owing her energy supplier Â£ 59
corey , 72 , was sent a letter by british gas claiming they were planning on taking the huge sum from her bank account within days
she was told she owed more than Â£ 8,000 for gas and over Â£ 1,000 for electricity - 150 times more than the amount she actually had to pay
corey was left shocked after she received two bills from british gas for a total of Â£ 9,000 mrs corey , from fulwood , lancashire , said : ' it said i owed Â£ 8,047 for gas and another Â£ 1,259 for electricity and that it would be taken out of my account on march 9
' i was in total shock
for an oap who lives on her own like me , it 's enough to make you ill. luckily i have a good neighbour who i went to see
' mrs corey said she ' could n't stop shaking ' after opening the letter , that outlined how her direct debit arrangement had changed after she 'd agreed to a new tariff
when she called british gas to inquire about the amount , she was told her combined bill should actually be Â£ 59
she said : ' the man i spoke to just said that it was a blip
he said that there 's quite a few , and its worrying that he was so calm about it
' i 'm worried about other people who have got these mistakes and how they will feel
' mrs corey said she feared the money would automatically be taken out of her account after getting the letter she added : ' and what if people do n't check things like i do and british gas try to take all that money out of their bank ? ' not many people will have that kind of cash in their account , so the payment wo n't go through , and that could cause all kinds of long - lasting problems
' a spokeswoman for british gas said it was an isolated error
leigh francis said : ' when mrs corey contacted us about her energy tariff we set up her payment plan incorrectly
' we 've now put this right and have apologised to mrs corey for the distress and inconvenience and offered her a gesture of goodwill
