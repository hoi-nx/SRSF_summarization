as bale 's season at real madrid continues to turn sour , the former tottenham forward is continually being linked with a move away from the bernabeu
man utd and chelsea have both been credited with having an interest in bringing the world 's most expensive player back to the premier league
sportsmail asked chelsea fan cody taylor of 90min.com to give his thoughts about a possible switch to the champions elect
bale has been criticised by supporters for his performances at real madrid this season bale performs his trademark celebration as he scored twice during wales ' 3 - 0 win against israel on saturday bale could be available this summer if various transfer reports are to be believed , so naturally chelsea are being linked with an eye - watering bid - but we have to ask ourselves the question , is he necessary ? on the face of it bale is a good player
at tottenham he dragged an average team out of hole after hole , but it 's easy to be a big fish in small pond
as he 's found out in spain it 's much harder in the big pond and that 's what it will be like at chelsea too
overall he 's not had the impact that the world 's most expensive player should
there are plenty who would give up everything to have him , but we really do n't need to be wasting time on a player that wo n't be a noticeable improvement , or even fit
bale holds his hands to his head after real madrid were beaten by barcelona 2 - 1 in la liga bale leads the wild celebrations after he nets his second of the game against israel in the euro 2016 qualifier even with his array of qualities , for the money , bale just is n't worth it
as good a player as he is , he was n't worth the world record Â£ 86m real madrid paid for him in 2013 , after what was effectively only one explosive season
he still is n't worth the Â£ 75m that the spain giants will allegedly settle for now
there 's simply no room for him at chelsea
mourinho already has a plethora of young , similarly able attacking players
willian is not as glamorous as the rest , but even he is a crucial part of the team and the fans love him
the brazilian does n't score as many goals or provide as many assists as others , but he is the one above all else that never stops working hard and that type of attitude and passion is more important than everything
bale reacts with disbelief after having a goal disallowed during the clasico on march 22 after the defeat by barcelona bale 's car was attacked by angry aupporters if bale arrives he is unlikely to do the same and it would negatively change the whole balance of the side which mourinho has worked hard to build
there is also juan cuadrado to think about
the colombian has n't shown anything like his best since arriving in january and is n't likely to before the end of the season
he is still settling in and just needs a bit more time before fans will eventually see the player that lit up last summer 's world cup
there 's absolutely no point replacing someone before they 've even started
bale is being linked with move back to the england with man utd and chelsea reportedly interested the former tottenham player attends an event with with young jewish and arab children in israel on sunday even just a few games away from claiming a well - deserved premier league title though , any chelsea fan claiming there is no need to improve with summer additions is a fool
the season has been far from flawless , but the key areas that need strengthening are defensive
if big money is to be spent it has to be used to address real issues , not bringing in additional unnecessary luxury
we are more in need of a centre - back , maybe a full - back , paul pogba even , but certainly not bale
mourinho has the good sense to see that and bale in blue is highly unlikely
besides , if he has any ambition to show himself to be anything other a massive flop , he should reject all offers and do his utmost to prove himself in spain
