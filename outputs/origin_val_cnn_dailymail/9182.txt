surgeons often describe the tricky operation to remove a brain tumour as â trying to pluck a spider out of jelly â
take out too little and the cancerous â legs â remain and regrow â but take out too much and there is a risk of cutting away healthy tissue and leaving the patient disabled
now a british hospital is trialling a laser that bleeps like a parking sensor on a car when the scalpel gets to the edge of the cancerous areas , letting surgeons know their margins for error
in a world first , neurosurgeons at london âs imperial college healthcare nhs trust have started using the pen - like probe , called the core , which shines a near - infrared light on to a tumour and scans for subtle differences between healthy and cancerous tissue
the device can read the differences in less than a second , and gives a warning sound if the surgeon is close to healthy tissue
about 16,000 british are diagnosed with a brain tumour every year , and more children and adults under 40 die from the condition than from any other cancer
there are more than 120 types
surgeons hope the core , which has already proved successful in skin - cancer surgery in canadian , will allow them to remove as much of the cancerous growth as possible and also speed up operating times
the probe was used for the first time during brain surgery at imperial last week as part of a trial that will involve 30 patients over the next year
senior neurosurgical trainee vaqas , who spearheaded the project to bring the core to the british , says : â there really is nothing like this at the moment
â brain surgery is a very complex operation â sometimes even taking just a millimetre too much can cause real damage , such as paralysis or problems with speech
having something that will make surgery safer and more accurate could be a real game - changer
â one of the major obstacles at present is that the boundary between the tumour and healthy brain tissue is very hard to distinguish , even with an operating microscope
currently , surgeons must rely on taking several tiny cuttings of tissue to ensure they are only taking away that which is cancerous
it can take up to 90 minutes for these biopsies to be tested and for results to be fed back to surgeons , all while the patient remains in the operating theatre
surgeons believe the pen - like probe could shave up to 30 minutes off the average three - hour surgery time ( picture posed by models ) instead of taking a physical sample , a surgeon holds the core over the area being operated on and a beam is emitted from the tip of the probe , scanning for changes in the chemical composition of brain tissue
a tumour molecule vibrates differently from healthy molecules under laser light , causing the light to bounce back in a different way
this is picked up by the probe , and the signal is then interpreted by a computer , giving an instant reading of whether the tissue is cancerous
mr vaqas believes using the core could shave up to 30 minutes off the average three - hour surgery time
â having a device that takes less than a second to tell the difference between healthy and cancerous tissue means we could potentially avoid taking unnecessary biopsies , and also perform more surgeries in a day , â he says
the core âs makers , canadian company verisante technology , hopes the work at imperial will replicate the success of a similar trial used to detect skin cancer on 1,000 patients at a hospital in vancouver
the imperial trial is being part - funded by charity brain tumour research campaign , which claims research into diagnostics and treatment is â woefully underfunded â
founder wendy fulcher says : â taking away healthy tissue can have disastrous consequences , so this probe is hugely exciting
