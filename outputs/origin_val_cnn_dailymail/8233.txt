the art of management is to create an aura , to brainwash the players into believing that they can routinely beat a team every bit as good as barcelona
it is to inspire , to send man city âs players into the tunnel at the nou camp in the minutes before kick - off and look down their noses at messi , iniesta , luis suarez or neymar
out on the training pitches , where the real work is done , the coaches must come up with a plan to squeeze the pips out of the players over two legs in the champions league
borussia dortmund coach jurgen klopp took his team to the champions league final at wembley against bayern munich ; last year atletico madrid reached the final under their clever coach simeone
unfortunately for pellegrini , he has come up short
this is no disgrace and there is no need to make his life a misery just because he can not find a way to beat barcelona
he just is nât good enough
pellegrini has not taken man city forward and looked clueless in the nou camp pellegrini could not alter the game or put the shackles on barcelona as man city 's euro dream died rakitic lifts the ball over the onrushing hart and into the empty net to give barcelona the advantage read martin samuel 's match report from the nou camp as barcelona beat man city 1 - 0 to progress to the quarter - finals of the champions league
the temptation , in the shakedown that will follow this champions league elimination for yet another english club , is to start over again
in the aftermath the cry now will be to send for simeone , to send for pep , to send for ancelotti , or to send for someone else to have a go
the brutal truth is that it âs coming to that
bayern munich âs exalted coach pep guardiola was here , settling down to watch his former club pass man city off the park in a series of dizzying spells
possession football is anathema to english football
man city spilt their guts here , exposing the size of the task to turn the current champions of the barclays premier league into a team capable of living with a group of players who can change the pace of a game at will
barcelona âs tempo is soothing and reassuring
if man city want to dominate in europe , in a way that barcelona did when they won the champions league in 2006 , 2009 and 2011 , then pellegrini is not the man
since he arrived at man city he has had four chances to beat barcelona and has yet to even secure a draw
team and coach are not up to it
city need innovation , a man with stature and the confidence to redevelop the team with some clever signings over the next couple of years
what man city would give for a player like messi , and you feel they would have to pay the earth messi glides past fernandinho during another masterful display from the little argentine david silva resorts to desperate measures to stop a free - flowing messi messi attempts to dribble past hart as the barcelona man shows his mastery once more the man city wall attempts to do its job as messi fires in a free - kick that dressing room is nât right , it ca nât be when a player of yaya toure âs supposed class can play as badly as this on a big night back at the nou camp
he gave up on his man rakitic as he roamed into man city âs penalty area and the ball inevitably needed up in the back of hart âs net
that aside , hart was immense here
if this is to be a slow , painful death for pellegrini , then the job is to breathe some life into this team for the final nine games of the league season
west brom this weekend is some homecoming
they will need leadership in the run - in , something that was missing from the sidelines as iniesta and rakitic splayed the ball out to the wings for neymar and messi to slice their way through man city âs defence
at times it was shambolic back there
when you come up against messi , the three - time winner of the ballon dâor , it is down to the coach to come up with a specific tactic to stifle his impact
here he set up the goal for rakitic with a ball that had a golfer âs draw on it when it pinged off his left boot to meet the barcelona midfielder âs run at the back post
sergio aguero reacts after seeing his late penalty saved by marc anrde ter - marc-andre ter stegen james milner goes to ground after challenging marc-andre ter stegen as as yaya toure looks on both vincent kompany ( left ) and martin demichelis play the blame game during the defeat in barcelona sergio aguero âs miss from the penalty spot in the 78th minute is no more than a footnote because man city were outclassed over two legs
the main man in abu dhabi will demand answers , a natural consequence of another premature elimination in the champions league
to pellegrini âs great credit , he is always unmoved by the speculation about his future , but the ball is now in sheik mansour âs court
sadly for a man of integrity and honour , he has lost his appeal .
