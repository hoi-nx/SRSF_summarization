camila batmanghelidjh , 52 , started kids company , a charity that provides support to vulnerable young people , as a drop - in centre in camberwell , south london in 1996
in the 19 years since , it has grown to support 36,000 children across the country , in walk - in centres , therapy groups and more than 40 schools
she invited the daily mail into her office and shared the story behind some of her most sentimental possessions
camila batmanghelidjh , 52 , in her kids company office in south london keep smiling i established kids company in 1996 , but we moved into this office five years ago
our doors are open to any neglected child who feels they need us , and we now reach 36,000 across london , bristol and liverpool
this is my office and it 's full of the children 's artwork â i ca n't bear to let it go and they love the fact i have it around me
like this laughing man picture â i just love the imagination
a lot of the art is made for the major donors whose cash keeps us going , but i thought , " no donor 's getting this ! " super annie one of our children , annie , has special needs but she 's extraordinary
her mother died , her sister was shot dead , then her grandmother , who became her carer , died
she was abused and ended up on the streets as a teenager being trafficked by drug dealers
she came here and started doing incredible art like this table
now she goes into neglected children 's houses and cleans up and then paints and decorates
this table was for a donor too but it 's going nowhere , it 's absolutely exquisite
this duck with a plastic crown is supposed to be camila batmanghelidjh quackers ! a little girl called ariana created the duck pond under the main table
the kids bring me plastic ducks and i use it for family therapy sessions when children want to show me what 's going on in their families , or in care
we also use it with the younger children because the table 's a bit big for them
they like to be on their stomachs , so they talk from under the table and move the ducks around
the house on the left is meant to be a castle
and the duck with the crown is supposed to be me ! a boy made this truck for camila batmanghelidjh free wishes this wishing tree was part of an exhibition we did , angels and demons , because we wanted to explore the way children are demonised
it 's adults ' choices that make these disturbed children
the idea was that children could hang their wishes on the tree , and i kept it because i feel i 'm propelled into action every day by them
what they want sometimes is so poignant , like ' a pair of shoes '
a third of our kids do n't have a bed to sleep on , and one in four does n't have any furniture
the love truck this very special boy who was in foster care decided he wanted to make me a truck
it has me driving and in the back are all the glittery things i bring for the kids
but when you open the bonnet you get a surprise â he 's put a heart in it
he wanted to show that the engine of my truck is love
he was just ten and i was so touched by his profound understanding of what we 're about â transporting love from those who can give it to those who need it
the love truck and the wishing tree really move me
a teenager that camila batmanghelidjh helped bought her this pink elephant to the rescue i found a teenager in a pitch - dark flat
he had no light , no fridge , no bath , no bed , just his clothes in a bin liner
he 'd had 64 care placements before the age of 16 , and social services never visited again
i burst into tears and said , " no son of mine is going to live like this ! " we decorated his room and got him furniture
we took him shopping and he saw this elephant and said , " it looks like camila batmanghelidjh ! it 's got to be in her office
" he must have thought , " it 's colourful , it 's big â and it 's got a big butt ! " as told to etan smallman
