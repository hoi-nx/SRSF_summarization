martin o'neill has admitted there are still places up for grabs in his republic of ireland team for sunday 's euro 2016 showdown with poland
the 63 - year - old republic of ireland boss has spent the last week keeping his fingers crossed over a series of injury doubts , all the while considering options to plug potential gaps in his starting line - up
everton midfielder darron gibson , who would have been in contention for sunday 's qualifier at the aviva stadium , has already returned to his club after admitting defeat in his battle against a groin problem , although martin o'neill received better news on friday when full - back stephen and winger james mcclean were both able to train in malahide
martin o'neill has admitted there are still places up for grabs in his republic of ireland team republic of ireland 's stephen quinn and kevin doyle during the training session at gannon park however , the team will not be named until the day of the game , and that means there is still time for men to force their way into his plans
martin o'neill said : ' i think there are positions up for grabs , like there have always been since i have come here , and i think any international manager would probably tell you exactly the same
' he 's got an idea that he can formulate a couple of weeks beforehand , but the first time that you really consider it is when you have players at your disposal for the week of the game
' of course , we have had one or two players who for one reason or another , generally through injury , have n't really been available for the start of the week , so then you have to formulate different ideas , different plans for the players that you think might participate in the game
' but overall , there have always been positions up for grabs here
' stephen and james mcclean have both been struggling with ankle problems and while the wigan winger has been a regular member of the starting xi under martin o'neill , it is perhaps the absence of burnley left - back stephen which would cause him the greater consternation
marc wilson can and has played at full - back , although has more recently been employed as a central defender by his country , while ciaran clark is also left - sided and could play in both positions
goalkeeper shay given ( right ) trains alongside fellow stopper david forde republic of ireland player daryl murphy talks to the media during training ahead of the poland clash however , there is a school of thought which suggests that any vacancy on the left side of the back four could be filled by hull winger robbie brady , who has operated there in the past for both club and country
indeed , he scored twice from that position in november 's 4 - 1 friendly victory over the united states in dublin , and that has not been lost on his manager
martin o'neill said : ' he did very well , really well , scored two goals and from that position on the field , was really excellent
' however , stephen 's fitness - he has suffered some irritation from screws used to repair his fractured ankle - and readiness to play will be fully assessed before a final decision is taken
martin o'neill said : ' i 'll have a word with him now and see how he feels
this was the first bit of work that he 's done , but we 'll see
' fitness is very , very important , but sometimes players can get through on adrenaline
you would n't want to be going in with four or five players not having done that much , but stephen knows himself now
if he thinks he can make it , well that 's good news for us
' james mcclean limped out of training on tuesday ahead of republic of ireland 's euro 2016 clash with poland republic of ireland assistant manager roy keane in action as his side prepare for the group d leaders poland currently lead group d by three points from germany , scotland and ireland , and while martin o'neill does not necessarily view sunday 's encounter as a must - win affair , he knows the impetus a victory would give his side
he said : ' naturally , we are at home and the onus is on us to try to get forward and try to win the game , and that 's what we are going to try to do
' but there are a number of games left in the competition
you mentioned the top two places [ qualify ] automatically - it 's a tough old group we are in , but we are going for it
' celebrations of republic of ireland 's rbs six nations championship victory last weekend are still very much ongoing , and martin o'neill is hoping to take a little of that into the game
he said : ' the irish rugby team has done fantastically well and maybe we could take something from that
they have given us a lead , let 's go and try to continue that
