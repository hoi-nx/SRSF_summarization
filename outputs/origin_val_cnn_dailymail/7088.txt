it âs the sort of meal that might have gone down well with john the baptist
but 21 - year - old oldham was less enthused to find a live locust crawling inside a bag of â ready to eat â rocket salad he bought from a sainsbury 's store in bath , somerset
the university architecture student filmed the fully - grown insect before going back to the store with the unopened Â£ 1 bag , which had contents that originated in spain
â â the person i spoke was quite humorous about it
sainsbury 's are now handling it
â mr oldham posted a video of the locust on his facebook page last wednesday - which has since been viewed more than 3,500 times - with the caption : ' today my salad came with extra protein
' similar incidents of locusts being found in supermarket salads in britain were reported by waitrose , marks & spencer and tesco customers in april , may and july of last year
' surprised ' : the architecture student mr oldham ( left ) filmed the fully - grown insect ( right ) before going back to the store with the unopened Â£ 1 bag , which had contents that originated in spain a sainsbury 's spokesman said : â we 've apologised to steve for this
' clearly it should never have happened and we have contacted him to make it up to him
â our supplier has stringent checks in place on the production line and we will be looking closely at how this occurred
â in the gospels of mark and matthew , john the baptist is said to live off locusts and wild honey .
