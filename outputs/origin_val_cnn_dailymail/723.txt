a mysterious san antonio ' priest ' is offering to absolve sins digitally - by taking confessions using snapchat
however , the move has raised eyebrows among the local clergy , who fear the sacrament is being abused on the smartphone app , which deletes pictures and messages seconds after receiving them
despite @ priestdavid claiming he wants to make confession easier , others see a cynical ploy to get people to admit their failings and mistakes to a complete stranger , who has not proven he is a member of any church or even a priest
available to hear your confession : christian priests in san antonio have warned against young people offering to confess their sins to @ priestdavid ' it 's not confession
it 's not what the sacrament is all about , ' said local san antonio priest , the reverend vilano to news 4 in san antonio
' he 's not a catholic priest
the church teaches when you go to confession , you should go to a priest either behind a divider or face to face
' while it is not known what christian denomination @ priestdavid is , he claims the snapchat confession is part of a college student 's project he is helping with
he also told news 4 4 he wants to engage more young people and claims he has been a priest for 23 - years
the confessions will be heard for two weeks from march 2 to march 16
unethical : confession as a sacrament is meant to be performed in person to a priest - either divided by a veil or in some cases face - to - face traditional : this is the way that confessions have been heard for over a thousand years ' doing it snapchat , i mean , you can do snapchat or through the internet and list everything you 've done and there 's no humility in there
there 's no ownership of the sins you 've committed , ' said rev. vilano to news 4
others are more damning of @ priestdavid
