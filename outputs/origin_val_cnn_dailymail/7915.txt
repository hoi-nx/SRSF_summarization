alice moffat received a parking ticket after leaving her car in front of her own family 's driveway - despite displaying her visitor 's badge a driver was left furious after she received a parking ticket for pulling up outside her parents ' home
alice moffat was hit with the Â£ 25 fine after she parked her car across the driveway while visiting april and steve moffat at their house in yeovil , somerset
the 23 - year - old , from redhill , surrey , had even placed the visitor 's permit in the window just in case and left it overnight
but she was shocked when she returned to the car the next morning to find a traffic warden had slapped a ticket on the red renault because it was parked just centimetres outside a marked bay
ms alice moffat , whose family have lived in yeovil for 15 years , said : ' i drove back to the family home late , and parked over my parents ' drive as i almost always do when i know they are not needing to go out that night
' just to be on the safe side , i also put the visitors permit in my car - not that it really needs to be there as i 'm over my parents ' drive
' my brother saw a parking warden looking at my car
he thought this was unusual so went out to see what was wrong
i was shocked to discover the parking warden was issuing me a ticket
' my younger brother immediately asked why , he said ' the permit is in , it 's my sisters car so we 're allowed to park over our own drive ' but the parking warden simply replied saying the car was ' outside of a marked bay
' he meant my wheel was a fraction over the white line of the bay behind , but not obstructing anyone or any car
' ms alice moffat , an actuary , said she and her brother had tried to reason with the warden , and had offered the move the car immediately to no avail
' the warden replied saying he had already printed the ticket so there was no point , ' she added
the 23 - year - old had parked in front of the drive in yeovil , somerset ( pictured ) but was given a fine after being told she had not parked in the correct bay ' i nearly always park over my parents drive , i had a permit in my car to be sure it was okay , and if i was a few centimetres forward , it would not have affected anybody or any car
' i am now left with fine to pay because my car was parked over my own family 's driveway
' i think this shows very clearly what all the national press are saying , councils in england are simply using parking fines as a ' cash cow '
' they were going so by the book and they did n't use any common sense
' alice moffat added : ' i have spoken to neighbours who said they have had a similar problem with getting parking fines while parked just slightly over the white lines
' it 's just so frustrating for my family , as they have to pay for their resident and visitor parking permits
the Â£ 25 fine , issued by a council civil enforcement officer has since been cancelled ' they pay their way , and do n't expect their family to get fined for parking over their own property
' a penalty charge notice was issued by council , stating the car was ' not parked correctly within the markings of the bay or space
' a council spokesman said the civil enforcement officer was correct to serve a penalty but yesterday confirmed the ticket had been cancelled
he said : ' having reconsidered the comments by the driver we have exercised our discretion and given her the benefit of the doubt and the penalty has been cancelled
