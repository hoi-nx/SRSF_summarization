former thai prime minister yingluck shinawatra has been ordered to stand trial over her role in a controversial rice subsidy scheme that cost the country billions
the first court hearing will take place on may 19 , a statement from thai 's supreme court said
" this case falls under the jurisdiction of the supreme court criminal division for persons holding political positions ... and the charges brought [ against yingluck shinawatra ] are accepted , " the statement said
if found guilty , she could face up to 10 years in prison
on her facebook page , yingluck shinawatra said she behaved with integrity and honesty during her time as prime minister
" i pledge that i have followed correct proceedings of the constitution , laws of the country in every way
" the rice subsidy program , introduced in 2011 , pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crop
but critics said it wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters , hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it could n't sell without losing money
anger over the scheme played a role in the protests that led to the downfall of yingluck shinawatra 's government and a military coup in may last year
in january , thai 's military - appointed national legislative assembly ( nla ) voted in favor of impeaching yingluck shinawatra for her role in the rice program
though the vote was largely symbolic , as she had already lost her post , it carries a five - year ban from politics
