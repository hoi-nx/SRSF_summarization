he was always a friend to britain , if sometimes a critical one , and many britain prime ministers benefited from his wise advice , including me

' his place in history is assured , as a leader and as one of the modern world 's foremost statesmen
' former prime minster sir john major said mr lee was ' one of the political giants of recent history '

he faced criticism , though , for using tough tactics to consolidate power
he jailed some political rivals without trial for decades and brought defamation lawsuits against journalists and opposition politicians , which had a chilling effect on dissent

' after completing his studies at singapore 's raffles college , lee went to england to study law at cambridge university
there , he married kwa , a fellow student , in 1947
he returned to singapore in 1950 and started the law firm lee & lee with his wife in 1955
in 1954 , lee helped found the people 's action party and he became singapore 's first prime minister in 1959 when britain granted it self - governance in all matters except defense and foreign affairs
singapore declared independence from britain in 1963 , and lee , believing his island could n't survive alone , brought it into the federation of neighboring states that became malaysia
but the malay leadership asked singapore to leave after two years because of ideological differences
lee wept on national television while announcing the breakup , which he later would call one of his biggest political regrets
he then turned to governing his tiny island state , imposing strict policies that some saw as micromanaging the daily lives of singapore
lee outlawed the sale of chewing gum , promoted english and mandarin while banning other chinese dialects from public schools , radio and tv
he also enforced ethnic integration by controlling the makeup of public apartment buildings , where 80 percent of the population lives
lee also cracked down on organized crime and imposed harsh penalties for minor infractions , a policy that has helped singapore maintain one of the world 's lowest violent crime rates
drug couriers face mandatory hanging , vandals are sometimes caned - such as american teenager michael fay in 1994 despite a plea for leniency from president bill clinton - and litterbugs must pay a hefty fine
