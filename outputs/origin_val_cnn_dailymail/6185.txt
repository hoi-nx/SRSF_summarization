' the doctors in the village could not tell us clearly what she is suffering from
we took aliya saleem to a doctor in ranchi
after the check up the doctor suggested that we go to another city , but we could n't afford that so we did n't take her
â however , aliya saleem 's parents recently managed to get a consultation at fortis hospital on the outskirts of delhi in a bid to try and get to the bottom of their daughter 's massive weight gain
dr krishan chugh , head of paediatrics at fortis hospital , said : â this is the heaviest baby at ten months of age that i have seen
this could be case of morbid obesity or even a hormonal imbalance
she is pictured above with her wider family â but we need to conduct some tests on her before making a proper diagnosis
the treatment depends on the diagnosis that we make
' there are some disorders that can be treated
as far as the reversal of this weight gain is concerned , that would depend on when we find a cause for it
