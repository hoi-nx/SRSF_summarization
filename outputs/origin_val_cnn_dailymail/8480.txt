jailed : marks stole Â£ 4,200 from vulnerable groucher while pretending to care for her a carer stole thousands of pounds from the 90 - year - old dementia victim she was supposed to be looking after finding her pin written in her diary
marks left her frail victim groucher ' heartbroken ' by abusing her trust to plunder Â£ 4,200 from her bank account over a seven - month period
the victim was so upset by the crime that she has had to leave her home in croydon , south london and move into sheltered accommodation
marks , 59 , visited mrs groucher twice a week and stole her bank card so she could withdraw large amounts of cash , using the code written in the elderly woman 's diary
she even stole money while mrs groucher was ill in hospital , croydon crown court heard
sentencing marks to 12 months in jail , reid told her : ' the victim was in her nineties , had problems with dementia , and , effectively , you inveigled your way into her family
' he added : ' it 's still unclear to me why you would do that to someone of that age , why you would cause her that much pain , which , in the end , was n't really for that much money
' but time and time again you took her card and took money from her account
it seems almost every time you went to her house you would have taken money
' mrs groucher , who has four children and eight grand - children , had lived at the same house for around 30 years , but she was so distressed by the crime that her dementia deteriorated and she had to move into care
' one of the features of this case which is disturbing is that she had to leave her home , ' mr reid said
in a victim impact statement read to the court , mrs groucher said : ' i know marks does not have a mother , but that is no reason to do what she did
' you were trusted by me and i 'm heartbroken
it 's disgusting what marks did to me
it worries me she could have done it to other people
' fairley , prosecuting , told the court that mrs groucher paid marks Â£ 10 every time she visited
the thief 's deception was found out when mrs groucher 's daughter baldwin , 70 , saw that there was money missing from her bank account in july last year
hearing : croydon crown court ( above ) heard marks even stole money while mrs groucher was ill in hospital ' she noticed there was Â£ 2,000 , or Â£ 3,000 less than what there should have been , ' mr fairley said
mrs baldwin then took a closer look at her mother 's bank statement and noticed ' a pattern of sums of Â£ 100 and Â£ 200 withdrawn over a significant period of time ' , he added
she notified the police who checked cctv footage from the lloyd 's bank branch in croydon and identified marks withdrawing Â£ 100 from the victim 's account the previous day
marks , from coulsdon in surrey , was arrested and pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing
speaking outside court today , mrs baldwin said her family was ' elated ' by the jail sentence , but added : ' it 's had a detrimental effect on mum - she has deteriorated badly
' part of that is due to her age , but every time i see her she mentions it and says , " why did she take it ? " and " how could she do that ? " ' when i told her about the sentence it was the first time i have seen her smile for a long time
' mrs baldwin said she was ' disgusted ' by marks , whom her family had known for around five years , saying : ' if she had been handed a suspended sentence she would have done it again tomorrow
' i think she has gotten away with it up until now , but we were n't going to let her get away with it
