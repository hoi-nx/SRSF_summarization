a serving ferguson police officer revealed that he broke down in tears after he read the department of justice report which condemned his force and said : â i just close my eyes and wish it was nât like that â
the officer said that his colleagues were â good cops â and that they were â hurting â just like the rest of the community
in an exclusive interview with daily mail online he said they were all standing behind embattled ferguson police chief jackson but were fearful they would lose their jobs if the department was shut down
he said : â people who do nât know me see me and then they hate me
that âs not fair ...
i âm not going to hate people because they are venting
â it âs tough but i still have to get to work
â i have to take it because they are venting and we have to let them vent , but i will protect this city , i will protect ferguson â
but a serving officer from the force said : ' we are not bad cops
' concern : outgoing attorney general holder focused the report on relations between police and citizens central figures : the shooting of michael brown ( left ) by officer darren wilson ( right ) in august created a firestorm over policing in ferguson and beyond
totemic : the image of officer darren wilson standing beside the body of michael brown became central to the controversy which surrounded the case the officer spoke out as the family of michael brown said they would file a wrongful death lawsuit over their son âs death
the 18 - year - old was shot dead by former ferguson officer darren wilson last august in a killing which sparked widespread looting across the city
the landmark department of justice report that was commissioned as a result painted a devastating portrait of a police force which unfairly targeted blacks for traffic stops and arrests
one ferguson city employee has been fired and two are under investigation but darren wilson did not face charges
critics however have called for the entire ferguson police force to be disbanded and shut down
as he released the report attorney general holder said that the conclusions were ' searing '
he said that in ferguson a ' deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and residents '
he said ferguson was : ' a community where this harm frequently appears to stem , at least in part , from racial bias â both implicit and explicit
and a community where all of these conditions , unlawful practices , and constitutional violations have not only severely undermined the public trust , eroded police legitimacy , and made local residents less safe â but created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under assault and under siege by those charged to serve and protect them ' if michael brown 's family win their civil lawsuit they could get a payout or the city of ferguson could reach a settlement before it goes to trial
wrong gesture : a protester makes the ' hands up , do n't shoot ' gesture which became the hallmark of the protests
but the official report said that michael brown did not use the words or the gesture
violence : the decision of the grand jury not to indict darren wilson was followed by rioting , arson and looting however another finding of the department of justice report was the michael brown did not have his hands up when darren wilson shot him , a finding which holder confirmed
' hands up , do n't shoot ' became the mantra of the protest movement after some witnesses said that they saw michael brown with his arms raised
speaking to daily mail online , the ferguson police officer said the report misrepresented not just the force , but the city
' the report is hard to read , but that âs not me , ' he said
â i am good with the people , the community
do they write more tickets than some people ? maybe
but they are good officers
â this hurts , it really does
when you read it , you read it as a city as a whole
you read it like everybody is like that , but not everybody is like that
â the statistics in the report are scathing : whilst ferguson is 67 per cent black , just three of the 53 officers on their police force are non-white , or six per cent
unending protest : demonstrators marched on the headquarters of pine lawn police in missouri , close to ferguson
it has also been criticized over its conduct
suing : michael brown 's parents - lesley mcspadden , his mother and michael brown snr , his father , are set to take their son 's death to court in a wrongful death suit defended : the officer defending his colleagues - one of whom is pictured above during the protests in the aftermath of the decision not to charge michael brown - said : ' we are good cops
' the 67 per cent of african in ferguson account for 93 per cent of arrests made from 2012 - 2014
african - american drivers were two times as likely as whites to be searched during traffic stops but 26 per cent less likely to be found in possession of drugs
among the most shocking revelations from the report were racist emails sent by ferguson city officials in which they made jokes about president obama
one questioned his suitability for the job because â what black man holds a steady job for four years â
when asked about the emails , the officer said he was â stunned â to read them but that he had not received any such messages himself in the past
another issue raised in the report was how black residents were disproportionately targeted for traffic tickets which contributes to the expected court revenue of $ 2.4 million this year
according to the report residents are seen â less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue , â the officer said : â there are guys who write a lot of tickets , yeah , but i do nât think it was any different from other departments

the officer said that in the wake of the report the mood on the street had been hostile
he said : â when we get to some of these calls people are yelling profanities ... they are filming us and that did nât happen before
he added : â the biggest thing that hurts is how the community feels , what are they feeling
that âs very important to me
â sometimes i just sit there and cry
â we need to open a dialogue with people
â officers need to go on diversity courses
what i would like to see is that that the community sits with us
â instead of yelling at us we need to start from the beginning and work our way up
we need to bridge the gap
we need to get back to community orientated policing
â the community need to know that if they call me i will protect them
â the only public comment from ferguson officials has been a brief statement from the city âs mayor james knowles , who refused to answer questions
the officer however said that as far as the cops went , he had their backing
he said : â we have to stand by chief jackson
i think everybody is standing behind him
' he âs been there for us
