balaam , 41 , took the funds from pembroke college to shore up a crippling gambling habit that saw her wager more than Â£ 6million over eight years

cambridge heard how balaam was gripped by a gambling addiction when she joined historic pembroke college , whose alumni include 19th century prime minister william pitt and poet ted hughes , in 2009
three years later she was abusing her trusted position as a purchase ledger clerk to duplicate invoices , paying the money into her own account
balaam , who was in charge of paying suppliers of goods and services , would then use her work âs accounting system to change details and cover her tracks
her crimes were uncovered when the college carried out an internal audit , revealing she had taken more than Â£ 285,000
police also found she had stolen Â£ 3,000 over four years from a village social club near cambridge where she volunteered to act as treasurer
staff at pembroke college ( pictured ) only uncovered her crime in january 2014 after an audit revealed she had stolen Â£ 285,986 during interviews she admitted she was hooked on jackpotjoy after joining in 2006
the site , which describes itself as the uk âs biggest online bingo site , also offers gamblers the chance to play online fruit machines
prosecutor sara walker told the court : â she told police that she had a gambling addiction and that she played online on a laptop given to her by the social club
â balaam , said to have wagered a total of Â£ 6,383,126 using the stolen money and her own cash , took an overdose on the day she was arrested but recovered after hospital treatment
she admitted a series of fraud charges in court yesterday , where she was supported by her partner
jackpotjoy , fronted by barbara windsor in its adverts , claims to be the uk 's biggest online bingo site balaam told the court she had an addiction to online gambling website jackpotjoy , and has made ' real efforts ' to tackle her addiction since her arrest mark shelley , defending , said his client had been led astray by her gambling habit
â she must have spent a lot of time on this addiction and she knew she was losing everything , â he added
â there were no expensive holidays or cars or anything like that
it was all spent on gambling
â judge gareth hawkesworth told balaam : â it is clear that your taking of this money was prompted by an addiction and it is equally clear that such was your addiction that you made no real profit from it and no money was spent for the benefit of your family
â i can not suspend the sentence because of the sheer scale of what you did and the length of time which you proceeded with it
you are an intelligent woman and you were well able to seek help during that period and you did not do so
â balaam , who lives in a Â£ 250,000 terraced house in cambridge , was sacked after her arrest
pembroke college , which was founded in 1347 and whose master is former mi6 chief sir richard dearlove , said it had now changed its accounting processes following the frauds by balaam .
