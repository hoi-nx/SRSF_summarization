nascar announced wednesday that it has lifted its suspension of driver kurt busch , making him eligible to return to the sport immediately -- albeit " under indefinite probation
" kurt busch was suspended after a delaware civil court found that he probably committed domestic violence against his former girlfriend , driscoll
she accused the standout driver of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against a wall in his motor home at delaware 's dover international speedway in september
twice , the nascar 2004 cup champion appealed his indefinite suspension and lost both times
that meant he missed the season - opening daytona 500 as well as two subsequent sprint cup races
but he should be able to compete through the fall , and nascar says that it will waive its requirement for him to compete in all championship events
the case against kurt busch took a significant turn last week , when the delaware department of justice announced that charges would not be filed against him
" as i have said from the beginning , i did not commit domestic abuse , " kurt busch said then
" i look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life
" a kent county , delaware , family court commissioner ruled in february that kurt busch must stay away from driscoll for a year
nascar officials decided to lift kurt busch 's suspension because he complied with the requirements of the racing circuit 's reinstatement program , completed behavioral assessments and got the ok from a behavioral health care expert to race again
he 's not totally out of the woods
in a news release , nascar said kurt busch must " undergo additional steps to address the behavior for which he was penalized
" o'donnell , nascar executive vice president and chief racing development officer , said the lack of charges against kurt busch expedited his return
" we have made it very clear to kurt busch our expectations for him moving forward , which includes participation in a treatment program and full compliance with all judicial requirements as a result of his off - track behavior , " o'donnell said
