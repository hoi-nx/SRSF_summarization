parents have criticised wolstanton high school ( pictured ) in newcastle - under - lyme where 20 pupils fell ill after using a nicotine spray prescribed to a 12 - year - old frantic parents were called to wolstanton high school in newcastle - under - lyme , staffordshire , last wednesday after 20 pupils became ill during lunchtime
one father , whose daughter suffered vomiting and dizziness , expressed his disbelief that a child had been given the spray in the first place
he said : ' it is ridiculous that the school are allowing a girl so young to be prescribed something this dangerous
i agree they should be giving them advice , but she is only 12
' it could have been a lot more serious , one of them could have been seriously poisoned
' a mother , who also asked not to be named , said her 12 - year - old son tried the spray , adding : ' when he was collected he was extremely pale , holding on to the rail outside and some of the others had been sick
he 's suffered a toxic overdose
' it is understood one pupil even attended the royal stoke university hospital 's a&e for a heart check - up
but despite parents ' concerns , the school 's headmaster aston appeared to downplay the ' regrettable ' incident as a practical joke
he said : ' the spray was shared with other pupils and they became nauseous
we have dealt with the pupil involved using our own sanctions ... unfortunately this was a prank that went wrong
' manufacturers say the anti-addiction product ( pictured ) is safe for ages 12 and up â but experts claim it can cause acute poisoning in non-smokers the girl was prescribed the nicotine spray by staffordshire and stoke-on-trent partnership nhs trust , which ran an anti-smoking course called ' time to quit ' at the comprehensive school
ian saberton , the scheme 's service manager , said his staff had followed the proper procedures
he added : ' all pupils who request support receive an appointment , after which they are required to do some preparation for a quit attempt
medication is only recommended at the following appointment
' mr aston defended the course , saying that as most of the school 's pupils are underage , ' smoking is illegal , which we take very seriously '
johnson & johnson , which makes the spray , says it is safe for adults and children over 12
but the electronic medicines compendium ( emc ) , whose information is vetted by regulators , warns : ' products containing nicotine should not be left where they may be misused , handled or ingested by children
' although the spray 's 1mg dose is small â a lethal dose for an adult who does n't smoke is 40 to 60mg â the emc says those who are not used to nicotine can suffer poisoning symptoms such as vomiting and dizziness .
