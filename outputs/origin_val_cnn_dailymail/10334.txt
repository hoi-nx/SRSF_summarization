world cup chiefs have warned fans not to buy tickets from unofficial sources after it emerged that a single ticket for the final is being advertised for Â£ 59,000
the category a ticket , which has a face value of Â£ 715 , is up for sale on a secondary ticket website , stubhub.co.uk , for 82 times its original price
the site also has category d tickets for the final at twickenham on october 31 which originally cost Â£ 125 for sale for Â£ 7,500 , some 60 times the face value
debbie jevans , chief executive of england , said organisers hoped new legislation forcing secondary websites to publish the exact row and seat number would prove a deterrent - people buying tickets from unofficial sources can be refused entrance
world cup chiefs have warned fans not to buy tickets from unofficial sources ahead of the tournament debbie jevans said : ' our message is to buy those tickets through the official sources - not least to ensure that it is a genuine ticket and not a fraudulent one , and to ensure fans are not ripped off
' the new legislation means secondary ticket websites will have to show the row , the seat and access of that ticket
that brings greater transparency which will allow us to have more exposure to who is selling those tickets and at what price
' we will be monitoring these sites , this gives us the ability to do so to a greater degree and we do reserve the right to refuse access
one ticket on stubhub.co.uk for the showpiece final has been advertised for sale at a price of Â£ 59,000 ' our terms and conditions reserve the right not to allow access if that ticket is sold through an unofficial source
' we have the ability to track the tickets down
' stubhub did not respond when asked to comment
meanwhile , debbie jevans said the success of the world cup , which is being hosted by england in the autumn with some matches in wales , will not depend on whether stuart lancaster 's side make it through their tough group
england are in pool a along with australian and wales , with only two countries going through to the quarter - finals
tickets to watch england are expensive , and the tournament 's success will be judged on the team 's progress world rugby 's chief executive brett gosper , an australian , reacted to england 's early exit from the cricket world cup by tweeting : ' england fail to exit pool in world cup ? ... ? not the words we want to hear during # rwc2015
' debbie jevans said : ' of course you think about it when you at the tough group england are in and the impact that may or may not have , but from our perspective it does n't make a difference
' as a fan i would be very upset but from a delivery perspective we are looking at it being about 20 teams and ensuring they can all compete to the best of their ability
debbie jevans , chief executive of england 2015 , said those using unofficial sources could be refused entrance ' we want to celebrate the sport and our focus is not about who wins or who is the final
when you look at the ticket sales we have only 10 matches left with tickets available and i think that demonstrates the country is getting behind the event , so i am not at all concerned about england being the sole focus
' wales head coach warren gatland said last week he was ' surprised ' by the tweet , adding : ' probably the head of world rugby does n't need to be doing that , but that 's his own personal views and his own personal decision
