' the road of about 30 semi-detached houses is on the same site as hq wootton hall
they were formerly owned by northamptonshire police before being sold off privately and many were bought by serving and retired officers

a black renault espace people carrier was also cordoned off on the green outside the house , where the downstairs curtains were drawn
neighbours of pc goldsmith described him as ' a really good guy ' who had lived on the street for at least 15 years
pc goldsmith was presented with the long service and good conduct medal in may 2009
he was pictured with sir john robinson , vice lord lieutenant for northamptonshire , who presented him with the award at the police hq in northampton
resident gary mcbain , 58 , said : ' otis goldsmith is a good guy
i have been here since 1999 and they had been living here for a while then
' we know him quite well , as do the whole street
all the children used to play outside on the green when they were growing up
so it is a close community
' otis goldsmith has been in the police force for at least 20 years
i am not sure who has died or what has happened exactly
' but otis goldsmith is a really good guy
everyone on this street will tell you that
' he added : ' he has several children from several marriages
he has a few children
today , a black people carrier was cordoned off outside the property where pc goldsmith lives today , the house was cordoned off , with a police officer on guard
curtains at the downstairs window were also drawn ' this is a highly sensitive area
people here generally know each other
' these houses were sold and most of the people living in them now are either retired or serving police officers
' a retired officer , who lives nearby , said : ' it happened at lunchtime
we have been advised not to talk about it
' they added : ' it must have been lunchtime when they cordoned it all off
' i did n't hear anything but saw them out of the window
we are used to seeing police cars on this road so it is n't unusual but i knew it was serious when there was a cordon
' the incident happened at number 11 and i understand the officer arrested was mr otis goldsmith
' another neighbour added : ' he is known as otis goldsmith , but i think his first name is adrian
' he 's been in the force a long time and is close to retirement
all i will say about him is that he is a good guy
' meanwhile , shocked neighbours who lived next door to jill for 12 years at her previous address in northampton described her as a ' lovely and friendly ' woman
the couple said jill had one child from a previous relationship , a grown up son in his 20s , named charlie
the investigation will not involve officers from this force the male neighbour , who did not wish to be named , said : ' she was a cleaner but she had stopped working just before she sold the house
' she moved about 18 months to the police house
i understand otis goldsmith had worked with the police a very long time
' she had been seeing him for perhaps a year before she moved
he never lived there but would stop overnight once or twice a week
' so they must have been living together in wootton hall park for nearly two years now
' his wife added : ' jill was a lovely woman
she was very friendly as well
she congratulated us when we got married
' i think otis goldsmith had four or five children
i know she had a son called charlie
it 's an absolute tragedy
' this should have been their honeymoon period
it 's desperately sad news
' during his career with the force , pc goldsmith has been vocal in his fight against street robberies
in june 2003 he led a campaign in northampton urging people to keep an eye on their possessions during the summer months
speaking at the time , he told the bbc : ' i would like to reassure people that we have taken a number of measures such as increasing patrols in a bid to deal with this , but i would ask people to think about their own personal safety and be streetwise
' the fear of crime is often much greater than any risk of becoming a victim , but it is a good opportunity for us to remind people of the need to be sensible and take care of themselves and their property
' the force said the murder investigation will not include anyone from northamptonshire police and will instead be led by an east midlands special operations unit , headed by detective superintendent kate meynell
the case has already been referred to the independent police complaints commission
detective superintendent kate meynell , who is heading up the investigation , said : ' a full and proper investigation is taking place
northamptonshire police will not be making any further comment on this investigation at this stage
