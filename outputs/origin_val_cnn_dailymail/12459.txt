under harsh lights in a private , rented room in berlin , women face each other in violent , sometimes bloody battles of brute strength
there are no official rules to this female fight club
the fighters are both beginners and professionals , anywhere from age 20 to 50 , said photographer mazur , who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014
led by founders nicknamed anna konda and red devil , a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master
they can wrestle , throw punches or " cat fight
" there 's no judge , just someone who knows the parameters they 've decided for the match
the small audience is mostly made up of men , but it 's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside
" when i saw this kind of fighting for the first time , i was quite shocked
i had never seen something like that before , and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close , " said mazur , who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school
" inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat. " at first , mazur said , she shot the fight club in color , but the look of the blue mat and neon lights did n't satisfy her
she shifted to black - and - white images and reduced her point of view , getting as close as she could to the action
" it was not easy to work like that , because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable , " she said , although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt
" i had to be very careful not to get hit
fortunately , there are chairs on the side , so i could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet
" for all the aggression built into fighting , mazur said , the project required a lot of sensitivity
she had to work quickly , and she did n't always know her subjects well
the bouts , the motivations , the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation
mazur said she had to examine her own limitations , questioning " how far can i go ? do they trust me ? am i allowed to do that ? " social media follow @ cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography
" i enjoy exploring new worlds , especially a world which exists in a gray area , " she said
she also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside , too -- they 're mothers , partners , friends
their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives
even years later , the fight club is still running and is " better than ever , " mazur said
" very often , i was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures , realizing what exactly happened there , " mazur said
" it is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and ( an open mind )
" mazur is a polish photographer based in berlin
