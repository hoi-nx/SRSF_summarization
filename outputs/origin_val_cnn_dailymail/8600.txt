lasting love : the star with husband grant roffey having forged a career starring in hollywood blockbusters and packed theatres , people might assume walters to be brimming with confidence
but the veteran star has revealed that when it came to romance in her younger years , she relied on a helping hand from alcohol to bring her out of her shell
the mother - of - one , 65 , has admitted that before meeting her husband grant roffey , 57 , thirty years ago , she had never had sex while sober
however , now she has been diagnosed with a yeast allergy she almost never drinks and , on the rare occasions she does , hates the effect it has on her health
in a candid interview , she also reveals she is finding it increasingly difficult to learn her lines , a problem she has increasingly found as she stars in new series indian summers
the mamma mia ! star met mr grant roffey while she was starring in a production of macbeth and began a whirlwind romance almost immediately but they only married in 1997 , 11 years into their relationship
talking to saga magazine , she has said how their first encounter ended with a drunken tryst and that , at that time in her life , she always needed to drink before being able to have sex
she described how she and a friend had drunk three bottles of champagne before bumping into her future husband at a bar in leicester
she said : â it was full of hooray henries
i remember saying , â i bet nobody here âs a member of the labour party
â and he turned round and said , â well i am , actually
â â â cor , you âre massive ! look at this bloke âs neck
god , it âs as big as my thigh ! â i was so embarrassing
we started talking about god knows what , and when ros [ her friend ] and i left he said , â i âll see you home
â and we staggered out with him
â so we walked ros home , then he walked me home
i said , â come in ! â he said , â no , it âs all right
â i said , â come iiiiinnn ! i âve got a bottle of beaujolais nouveau ! â he moved in and never moved out
it was instant for me
â i remember saying , â do you want my children ? â that first night â terrible things ! â it was driven by alcohol
i was shy like that
who âd have sex without alcohol ? especially the first time
he was really sweet about it
before we were together , i do nât think i âd ever done it sober
â while she might owe her happy marriage to alcohol , she now hardly touches a drop due to a yeast allergy
she explains that she had always felt ill after drinking but assumed it was the same for everyone
it was only well into adulthood that a doctor suggested an allergy test that revealed the true cause
the actress met her husband in 1986 and began a whirlwind romance almost immediately
pictured , walters flaunts her sexy side that same year in comedy car trouble she said : â if i were to have marmite , it would just take the roof of my mouth right off
anything with yeast makes my eyes go funny , makes me a bit wheezy
â and before , when i âd had a few drinks , the next day i âd always have these flu - like symptoms
i thought everybody had those , and i was telling this gynaecologist â¦ and she suggested a skin test to see if i was allergic to anything
and the yeast went , whoo ! so now i know
â even so , she still occasionally has the odd glass of champagne if she needs a quick boost of confidence
she said she never drinks , â except , say , if i got on graham norton where you have to be jolly with people you âve not met before , and i have a glass of champagne
but i do nât like the effect on my body
â this is not the only problem alcohol has caused for her health
ever since she entered menopause at the age of 50 , she had been unable to sleep after drinking
she has spoken before of her struggles with menopause and again said how she continues to suffer with hot flushes after 15 years
she said : â it was like a chimney and came from the base of my spine
i was doing this tv called murder , and every take there âd be , â stop , she âs having a flush ! â the actress also revealed she is finding it difficult to learn the lines for current channel 4 series indian summers , in which she plays cynthia ( pictured ) â at the national i âd come off stage for a quick change and have to shout , â garth , the tray ! â and this guy would come with this big tin tray and fan me
harry potter , i was in a wig and padding , and they had to put this big tube of air conditioning in my face
â a more pressing issue caused by her advancing years is a difficulty with learning her lines
veteran star michael gambon , 74 , recently announced his retirement from the stage because of his fading memory and dame judi dench , 80 , has previously revealed she takes supplements to help her memory
while still perfectly capable of working , miss walters said it has started to become a concern , especially for her part in channel 4 series indian summers
she revealed she flew out a week early to the set to give herself time to commit her role to memory
she said : â i âm too old now to just go out there and start shooting
i worked out how many days and hours of jet lag
otherwise i âd never remember the lines
â i have to learn things ahead of time now , which i âve never had to do in my life
the night before , i âd just have a look and lie in the bath and think , â oh yes , right â
the next day i would hardly look at my lines , and they âd be there
now ? i âm going through them , going through them
