a six - year - old albino boy had his hand hacked off in tanzania in a savage attack by a gang who use body parts for witchcraft the latest assault comes days after tanzania 's president kikwete blasted the wave of killings and attacks against albinos as a ' disgusting and big embarrassment for the nation '
he said : ' i believe that with close co-operation between the government and society , we will succeed in ending these killings of persons with albinism and rid our nation of this shame
' a police spokesman said : ' the gangsters got hold of the victim 's mother , prisca shaaban , and beat her severely after she refused to hand over the boy
tanzania president kikwete ( above ) blasted the wave of killings and attacks against albinos as a ' disgusting and big embarrassment for the nation ' ' the assailants later used machetes to cut off the boy 's right palm and walked out
' albino body parts are thought to sell for around $ 600 ( Â£ 397 ) with an entire corpse fetching nearly $ 75,000 ( Â£ 49,685 ) , a un expert said
at least 75 albinos have died in the region since 2000
earlier in the week four people were sentenced to death for the murder of 22 - year - old albino woman zawadi mangidu
tanzania police on monday banned a planned demonstration by the tanzania albinism society in the country 's commercial capital , dar es salaam , citing security reasons
but kikwete has said he had agreed to meet albino leaders next week to discuss possible solutions to the killings
the murders have been concentrated in the gold - rich regions and fishing communities surrounding the country 's lake victoria , where superstitious beliefs are rampant
albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin , hair and eyes
it affects one tanzania in 1,400 often as a result of inbreeding , experts said
in the west , it affects just one person in 20,000
albinos are seen as curses , or ' ghosts ' who can be wiped off the face of the earth in many parts of tanzania
families are often told to kill the children at birth
yet , conversely , their body parts are highly prized
witch doctors claim albino body parts are capable of bringing riches , power and success , if used in potions , while a un report report into the trade revealed miners used the bone as amulets , or would bury them where they are drilling for gold
fishermen are said to weave the hair into their nets to help them catch more fish
children are particularly vulnerable - their innocence is highly valued and they are not as strong as the adults attacking them
most of the time , limbs are taken but a recent report noted that there have been cases where victims were beheaded , or had their genitals , ears , and bits of skin removed
tongues can also be cut out or the eyes and the heart gouged out
other types of attacks reported include rape for healing purposes
possibly , most shockingly , some believe the louder the screams while the limb is removed , the more potent the charm .
