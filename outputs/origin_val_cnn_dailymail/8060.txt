a brave rape survivor took the podium at a maryland state senate meeting this week and told the frightening tale about being stalked by a man she never met
jacqueline kahn was speaking in support of a measure that would allow residents in maryland to carry concealed weapons for self - defense
the state is currently one of just a handful in the nation that does n't allow residents to carry firearms on the basis of protection alone
in her presentation , jacqueline kahn told the senators about how a man was once arrested in her back yard with duct tape and a knife
' i wish i could tell you that 's the only time i 've been stalked , or that 's the only man who has stalked anyone in the state of maryland
but there 's a huge number of women , who like me have been raped , who like me have been sexually assaulted â and we want the right to be able to do what we would be allowed to do throughout the majority of the rest of the united states , ' she said
jacqueline kahn did n't speak about the details of her rape
right to bear arms : the above states in green allow residents to carry concealed weapons for self defense
maryland is considering joining these states jacqueline kahn says she enjoys spending her time in ' secluded places ' like the beach or on mountain hikes , but that she does n't feel safe going on these adventures alone , unarmed , in adherence to the current laws
on one outing , jacqueline kahn says she was sleeping in a tent , when woke up to a man trying to enter
' when i 'm in my house , i 'm allowed to protect myself
but walking along the sidewalk , i 'm not
so you make me into a criminal
you force me to decide , do i want to be judged by 12 or carried by six
' jacqueline kahn also pulled out a map that shows that most states allow citizens to carry concealed weapons for self - defense purposes
the maryland state senate is currently deciding whether to add self - defense to concealed handgun permits .
