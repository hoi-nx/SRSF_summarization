the former that âs life ! presenter who is now 74 said yesterday : â listening to the music of our youth - which reminds us of the time we dreamed , fell in love , went out with friends , the world was in front of us and nothing seemed impossible - makes us feel young
â it has been found to turn the clock back , physically , mentally and emotionally
so it âs really good for us
â the music on the Â£ 12 album , which is being sold by amazon , hmv and itunes , was chosen by dame esther and the people who benefit from silver line
former that âs life ! presenter , dame esther rantzen ( pictured ) believes music from a bygone age can help benefit the mental health of older people among them is 93 - year - old bob lowe , who moved radio 5 live listeners to tears last year after sharing a poem that he wrote to his late wife kath following her death from alzheimer âs
in their youth mr and mrs lowe danced to many of the songs on the album
a black and white image on its cover captures the couple dancing in high spirits
the music on the album is also a soundtrack to dame dame esther âs life and she shares one of her memories , involving her former husband wilcox who died from heart disease in 2010 , on the sleeve notes : â ella fitzgerald [ ella fitzgerald ] singing every time we say goodbye is a lovely but sad ballad , expressing the pangs of parting
' my late husband , wilcox , used to sing it to me when he had to leave , but as he was completely tone - deaf , we used to dissolve into laughter , and that eased the pain and gave us a joyous memory , until we met again
â and up , up and away [ by the fifth dimension ] always reminds me of the balloon flight he gave me as a birthday gift , when i flew so fast in a beautiful balloon that we landed with a crash in a bramble bush
' you , too , will have so many personal memories as you listen to this collection , of tears and laughter
â dame esther âs relationship with mr wilcox began as an affair in 1968 , when they both worked at the bbc
they married in 1977 , had three children and spent 30 years together until his death , aged 69
three years ago , after her youngest child joshua moved out , dame esther sold the family home and moved into a two - bedroom flat
at the age of 71 she found herself living alone , and the experience prompted her to set up silver line
tom jones ( left ) , petula clark ( right ) and dionne warwick are also among artists who feature on the album music by dionne warwick ( pictured in 2013 ) also features on the album which is being sold by amazon , hmv and itunes
all proceeds from the Â£ 12 compilation will go towards dame esther âs silver line helpline charity last year dame esther said : ' i was coming home to a dark flat with no one to make a cup of tea with and no one to ask about my day , it hit me quite profoundly
' when i started to talk about it working in the elderly care sector , i realised how it resonated with so many hundreds of thousands of people
' one of the things i discovered was the stigma attached to loneliness , people do n't like admitting it , partly because they do n't want to be a burden , and partly because they 're ashamed , they feel humiliated by this feeling nobody wants them or cares about them
' so there is a pride and an independence in the older generation
we want them to know that they 're not alone and that we do care
