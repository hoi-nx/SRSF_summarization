authorities have arrested a gunman suspected of randomly opening fire on five public places in maryland over the past week , in attacks that left two injured
what appears to be the same blue car had been linked to the attacks in which a gunman opened fire on a driver at a mall , a walmart , a movie theater , a truck on a highway and headquarters of the nsa over the last seven days
if the same gunman is behind all the attacks , it would be a case with chilling similarities to the dc sniper attacks of 2002 when muhammad and malvo killed ten people with gunfire from a hidden firing spot in the back of their blue chevrolet sedan
early morning reports on wednesday revealed that a suspect was in custody who was believed to be involved in the shootings that occurred since last tuesday in the baltimore - washington dc metro area , according to the washington post
lt. kevin ayd , a spokesman for the police told the baltimore sun. of the five shootings : ' they 're looking into whether these are linked together
' so far , only two dump truck workers have been hurt in the attacks - they suffered only minor injuries when the gunfire shattered the windshield of their vehicle and by a bullet fragment

the back - to - back shootings in maryland on tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 , when a sniper , muhammad ( left ) and his 17 - year - old accomplice malvo ( right ) terrorized the washington dc area in a series of seemingly random shootings back - to - back shootings in maryland on tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 , when a sniper terrorized the washington dc area in a series of seemingly random shootings
ten people were killed and three injured in the 14 october shootings which authorities eventually connected to two perpetrators working in tandem
shooter muhammad and his 17 - year - old accomplice malvo started their spree in february 2002 , with murders in alabama , arizona , california , florida , georgia , louisiana , texas and washington state
that cross-country spree resulted in the deaths of seven people and left seven injured
it was only in october though that the murders became more targeted on the virginia and maryland areas immediately surrounding washington dc - earning the name the beltway sniper attacks
the attacks left washington dc residents afraid to leave their homes for weeks , since the nature of the shootings were random , and the shooter fired from a distance and never confronted his victims face to face
but muhammad apparently grew tired of the anonymity and started leaving behind objects at the crimes scenes including a tarot card inscribed with the phrase ' call me god '
muhammad and malvo 's reign of terror was finally brought to an end on october 24 when they were found sleeping in a car in myersville , maryland and taken into custody
the following september , muhammad went on trial for his crimes and was sentenced to death
his accomplice malvo testified at his trial saying the two planned to shoot six people a day for 30 days - though that plan failed
when malvo went on trial , his attorneys painted him as being under the influence of muhammad and therefore not as equal a partner in their crimes , which is perhaps the reason he received a lesser sentence of life in prison without parole
muhammad was executed by lethal injection on november 10 , 2009 .
