new york head coach kreis has refused to dwell on the furore surrounding lampard 's delayed move to the club and says his arrival midway through the season could actually provide a well - timed boost
former chelsea midfielder lampard agreed to sign for the new mls franchise last july and was set to join up with his new team - mates in january ahead of the new season , which starts on sunday
the 36 - year - old then joined new york 's sister club manchester city - both part of the city football group - on what was initially reported to be a short - term loan deal
lampard agreed to join new york when he left chelsea last summer former england international delayed move to the mls franchise until the end of the premier league season lampard joined manchester city at the start of the season on a short - term deal head coach kreis says lampard 's late arrival can provide the team with a boost during the season as it transpired , the deal at manchester city was in fact a standalone one which , after a number of impressive performances for manuel pellegrini 's side , was extended beyond january until the end of the premier league season
lampard 's decision to remain in manchester and miss the start of new york 's debut mls campaign riled supporters of the franchise , but kreis appears to have taken the potentially exacerbating episode in his stride

' when you get to the end of the season and there 's some real fatigue , injuries and suspensions , you need guys to be able to step in and not miss a beat
i think this affords us that opportunity
' we 're going to be having a player that 's going to be at the top of his game , extremely fit , coming right out of a premier league season , which hopefully will he will have another medal to put in his pocket , and we can have a really significant , positive boost in the middle of the season
