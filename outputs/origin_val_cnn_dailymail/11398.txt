this is the dramatic moment a mother antelope clashed horns with a three - tonne rhino which strayed a little too close to her calf at a safari park
the stand - off in wiltshire saw the antelope refuse to back down when the beast approached her calf - and at one point even clashed horns with it
the antelope , ramina , kept her baby phoenix behind her at all times as she charged at the massive rhino , njanu , despite it being 15 times heavier
dramatic : the stand - off saw the antelope refuse to back down when the beast approached her calf - and at one point even clashed horns with it coming together : the antelope , ramina , kept her baby phoenix behind her at all times as she charged at the massive rhino , njanu keepers say ramina , a scimitar oryx antelope , was being overly defensive of her baby on her first outing in the park following a difficult birth
this saw the calf , who lives at longleat safari park near frome , brought back to life by mouth - to - mouth resuscitation
dan gray , a keeper at the park , said : â phoenix is ramina 's seventh calf but her birth was not an easy one
â in fact i had to give her mouth - to - mouth resuscitation soon after she was born as she had stopped breathing
â taking him on : keepers say ramina , a scimitar oryx antelope , was being overly defensive of her baby in the park following a difficult birth coming together : the calf , who lives at longleat safari park in wiltshire , was brought back to life by mouth - to - mouth resuscitation after birth but he added : â happily phoenix made a full recovery and that was why she was allowed out in to the park properly
â however , it may be that ramina was even more protective than usual as a result and decided to stand her ground
njanu was almost certainly just being inquisitive and meant no harm at all
' but i guess ramina did n't know that and she displayed real maternal courage to stand up to him so bravely
