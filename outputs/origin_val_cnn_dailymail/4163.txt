really , the only surprise was that it took him three touches
kane had already chested one down in midfield and rolled a pass to fellow substitute barkley
but his third touch ? well , that was headed into the net
that âs more like it , kane
so much for the cries for patience
here was goal no 30 of the season for a young man who simply can not stop scoring
twenty nine for his club and now one for his country at senior level
sterling clipped an inviting ball up to the back post , where kane âs instinct had taken him
there was just a thin slice of goal to aim for , but he was never missing
arlauskis , unaware of the script , attempted to recover , flinging himself across his goal - line but lithuania âs goalkeeper could only help it into the net

the 21 - year - old spurs striker , who has been on fire in the barclays premier league , was off and running in international football 79 seconds after replacing rooney
who needs time to adjust ? this was the third - fastest goal by an england debutant and the quickest since bill nicholson in 1951
quite understandably , kane could barely control his delight , pushing the referee aside as he sprinted into to a jubilant knee - slide by the corner flag while the wembley crowd leapt to hail their newest hero
all this was quite surreal
no wonder he described it as â just a blur â
the fourth goal of an easy win against a team ranked 94th in the world in the midst of a humdrum campaign has no right to command such excitement but it is impossible not to be swept along by this incredible story
until then it had all been about rooney âs steady pursuit of sir bobby charlton âs england goal record and welbeck âs wonderful display of attacking verve , which rightly earned him the man - of - the - match vote
rooney needed less than six minutes to score the opener and might have had more on a night when he hit the woodwork twice in the first half
england âs second was probably an own goal but was claimed by welbeck , who deserved it in a way for a display which justified roy hodgson âs decision to select him and leave kane on the bench for three - quarters of the game
sterling converted the third â his first international goal â timing his run to perfection and tucking away rooney âs cross from the right
it meant england had secured their fifth successive win in group e long before kane came on to thrill wembley
roy hodgson will reflect on the game with satisfaction
his team are six points clear with one foot already across the channel at euro 2016 , and promising young players like kane are forcing their way into contention
kane comes on for rooney for his first england cap and the spurs striker made a dramatic introduction to international football sterling wheels away after giving england a three - goal cushion on a comfortable night for the runaway group e leaders rooney is all smiles after welbeck made it 2 - 0 just before the half - time whistle kane and gary cahill greet each other following the final whistle with england maintaining a six - point cushion at the top of group e the manager will also have been content with his team âs balance and shape , which flexed from a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 into a classic 4 - 3 - 3 when england had the ball
carrick sat in front of the centre halves and supplied a trio of mobile strikers , while henderson and delph covered the midfield miles
it will be different in a tougher game when carrick is expected to shield his back four , but here is the perennial problem
england need one method to qualify â breaking down teams who surrender possession and offer no ambition â and an entirely different one when they reach the finals and come up against more clinical and potent opposition
lithuania started nervously at wembley and roy hodgson âs team were smart enough to take advantage
rooney hit the inside of a post having been released by delph , before scoring his 47th england goal with a simple header after arlauskis had pushed a fine effort from welbeck into the air
england âs captain hit the other post midway through the first half
again , welbeck created it , this time by driving to the by - line and picking out rooney at the far post
his header was firmly sent back from whence it came , as in the textbooks , and wembley held its breath as it looped through the air and hit the frame of the goal
delph was denied a first goal in an england shirt as his crisp volley was repelled by an excellent reflex save from arlauskis roy hodgson will be a very happy man after another convincing win with four different scorers and another clean sheet sterling and vytautas andriuskevicius collided in what looked like a 50/50 challenge and the england man was unfortunate to be booked nathaniel clyne clears the ball upfield despite pressure from saulius mikoliunas as england launch another attack as england began to wonder if they would extend their lead , they enjoyed a little luck by way of a scruffy second
henderson worked a short corner with leighton baines and delivered an inswinging cross towards welbeck , who stooped and skewed a glancing header off his shoulder which was deflected into the net from the right thigh of lithuania captain tadas kijanskas
it was swiftly declared as welbeck âs goal , and the arsenal striker seemed happy to claim it
arlauskis reacted well to keep out delph âs volley after the break and welbeck deserved a penalty as england dominated
sterling , who grew into the game and was far more influential as lithuania tired , celebrated his first international goal by tucking in a cross from rooney via the near post
and then kane appeared to a raucous reception
this crowd believed the hype
they had cheered through his warm - up routine and they demanded a goal as he sprinted on
it was nât an easy finish
but it was never really in doubt , was it ? on the bench , rooney stood to applaud and like everyone else present , he could not help but smile and shake his head
rooney makes a nuisance of himself in the lithuania box , stealing the ball off the toe of marius zaliukas in a typical act of doggedness tomas mikuckis clears the ball in an acrobatic fashion as lithuania repel wave after wave of england pressure the england players huddle together before kick - off looking to maintain their 100 per cent record in the qualifying campaign kane was named on the bench but when his chance came he grabbed it with both hands as england now look to tuesday 's friendly with italy
