' he said he was going to give me $ 50,000 to fix up the house , ' tanya fox told the free-press , adding : ' robertson was not a neat person ; he got grease all over the wall ' in the apartment he rented from her for 15 years
fox is just one of many in robertson 's old neighborhood who he has completely cut ties with
' i may have been born there , but god knows i do n't belong there anymore , ' robertson said about his old neighborhood near detroit 's new center area
the plastic - molding operator also said he did n't tell people in his old neighborhood where he was moving
the 56 - year - old gained celebrity after the newspaper reported earlier this year that he began walking to a job at an auto parts factory when his car stopped working in 2005 and bus service was cut back

it led to $ 360,000 eventually being raised and robertson receiving a new , $ 35,000 ford taurus from an auto dealership
he still works at the same factory in rochester hills which pays him $ 10.55 an hour , but the hours - long walking trip now is done in a 20 - minute drive
' i 'm going to keep working â that 's for sure , ' he told the newspaper
financial experts are donating their service to help robertson manage his money
the 1 - bedroom apartment in troy costs him $ 800 a month in rent
he had been paying $ 880 per month for less space in his ex-girlfriend 's home in detroit
most of his money now is in a trust that has a principal amount of $ 351,000
the earnings from the trust should be enough to keep robertson 's nest egg untouched until he retires , said sorensen , a ubs financial services senior vice president for wealth management
she is part of the financial team helping him
people have stepped up because robertson is unselfish and deserving , sorensen said
' he wants the majority of the funds he received to be invested in a way that will someday provide an income stream when he retires , ' she added .
