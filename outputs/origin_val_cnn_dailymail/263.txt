declaring palestinians youths a ' symbol of freedom ' , anonymous says it will take down ' servers , government websites , israeli military websites , and israeli institutions ' in a move that will ' erase [ israel ] from cyberspace in our electronic holocaust '
' we are coming back to punish you again , for your crimes in the palestinians territories , as we do every year on 7 april , all we see is continuous aggression , bombing , killing and kidnapping of the palestinians people , as in the last war against gaza in 2014 , ' the voice in the video says
' our message to the foolish benjamin netanyahu and all leaders in the zionist entities , we will continue to electronically attack until the people of palestine are free , ' it adds
' a message to the youth of palestine , you are a symbol of freedom , resistance and hope : we are with you and will continue to defend you , ' the voice goes on to say
the video is subtitled in arabic and the description posted on the youtube page suggests it has been uploaded by a group calling themselves ' anonymous arab '

speaking to newsweek , decker , a senior intelligence analyst at tel aviv - based risk consultancy the levantine group , said it is not the first time anonymous has issued such a threat - adding that it happens every year , with israel able to limit the impact further each time
' for the most part , this is posturing
this is actually the fourth year that anonymous has carried out this israel attack and called on their supporters to erase israel from the internet , ' he said
' as the years have progressed we have seen that , despite their increasing sophistication in hacking techniques , we have seen less damage against israeli cyber infrastructures , largely due to israel 's pioneering of most cyber warfare tactics , both offensive and defensive , ' mr decker added

the conviction could land olmert five years in prison , in addition to a six - year prison sentence he received last year in a separate bribery conviction , all but ensuring the former premier will not return to politics for many years to come
' his behavior constitutes a breach of trust which harms the public , harms morality , and harms the public 's trust , in how he behaved corruptly , ' prosecutor uri korev said following the verdict

a sentencing hearing is slated to take place in may
olmert has claimed he was on the brink of a historic agreement with the palestinians when he was forced to resign in early 2009 amid corruption allegations
his departure cleared the way for hard - liner benjamin netanyahu 's election , and subsequent peace efforts have not succeeded .
