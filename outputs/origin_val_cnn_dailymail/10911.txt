agbonlahor salutes the villa park crowd in celebration after opening the scoring against west brom agbonlahor threads the ball through foster 's legs to give the hosts the lead in the midlands derby agbonlahor has been criticised for inconsistent performances in recent years but tim sherwood believes he can now be villa 's trump card
he said : ' it 's about this time when agbonlahor normally comes out and starts keeping this team in the league
' i had a lot of chats with him , a lot of chats with christian and every player
the strike partnership outside the top six , they 've got to be the best two
' but on paper does n't make any difference , you have to go and prove it and go and do it
' it should n't be ignored and i think it was appreciated by the fans the other night , they were singing his name , you ca n't imagine how much players grow from that
i 've managed one of the hottest strikers in english football at the moment , harry kane , he had to win over those tottenham fans
' tim sherwood said that agbonlahor would be key to villa 's premier league survival the villa manager said he thought his strikers were the bets outside of the premier league 's top four tim sherwood wants to tap into agbonlahor , villa 's record premier league goalscorer with 70 , and admitted he made special plans to combat the 28 - year - old while tottenham boss last season
' absolutely , ' he said , when asked whether he identified agbonlahor as key to villa
' every game i 've told him to play on the shoulder and look to get in behind , because once he gets in behind you he 's very quick and hard to stop
' he 's had a lot of games now , a lot of experience , and i 'm saying : ' just go out there and play where you think you can hurt them , you take up positions '
agbonlahor beat foster for a second time but joleon lescott raced back to clear the ball off the line agbonlahor reacts after foster almost dropped the ball over his own goal line in their recent match ' i brought sandro back into the team ( last season ) to sit in that pivot , everyone else went forward
we had three defenders to look after the counter-threat of agbonlahor
' tim sherwood is without the suspended alan hutton but could welcome back ron vlaar after a calf problem , with the skipper being assessed
aly cissokho , kieran richardson and nathan baker are out but tim sherwood will take a repeat of tuesday 's drama against the west brom
he added : ' if i knew the outcome of the script , i would have taken that , win 2 - 1 , local derby , 94th minute , two strikers scoring , blooding a young kid ( jack grealish ) for 35 minutes - the longest he 's played on the pitch - i do n't think i could have dreamt it up
