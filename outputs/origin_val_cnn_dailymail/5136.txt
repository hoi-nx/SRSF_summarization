these magnificent snow - capped mountains , found deep within a country very few western tourists dare to visit , are virtually untouched
every year a handful of adventurous skiers are brave enough to make the long trek to bamyan , in afghanistan , even though it âs one of the most dangerous countries in the world
those who make the trip are being inspired by locals , who are some of the poorest people on the planet , and joining in a grassroots effort to grow the sport in afghanistan and develop the region into a destination for tourists
but bamyan , which lies on the silk road that cuts through asian , is a picturesque setting in the winter thanks to the snow - covered hindu kush mountains , one of the least explored ranges in the world
for years , locals have been using primitive skis fashioned from planks of wood and homemade poles to go up and down the mountains , which are home to peaceful minority groups
they âre now being joined by more westerners who are looking for adventure , including a select few who are trying to improve their lives
a professional snowboarder from australia leaps over a donkey and locals during a film shoot a grassroots effort is underway to transform bamyan into a destination for ski tourists organisations and companies are introducing modern equipment and training , and providing jobs to locals
the aga khan foundation launched the programme in 2008 , with swiss brand volkl providing equipment and training for locals , and the swiss ski resort of st moritz raising funds and inviting two afghan skiers to the alps for training
in 2011 , untamed borders , a british tour operator , became the first company to take ski tourists to afghanistan
since then it has been bringing 10 to 20 foreign skiers to the mountain range every year , taking great care with respect to safety and security , said co-founder kausar hussain
with no ski lift or rope tow , skiers must hike up the mountain before skiing back down but bamyan , which lies on the silk road that cuts through asian , is a picturesque setting in the winter each holidaymaker pays Â£ 1,700 for a 10 - day trip , which includes accommodation , food , local transport and instruction from an internationally qualified ski guide
they are usually joined by local guides as well
mr hussain said : â the ski conditions are good
afghanistan does have a high risk of avalanches , so on many days we have to stick to low elevations
â in bamyan , in winter it is cold , it snows
however there are many more clear days when in europe
in the summer it has warm days and cool nights
â it is the definition of raw skiing , as there are no ski lifts , meaning skiers must hike up the mountain
a ski tourist has a laugh after taking a tumble while on holiday in afghanistan the hindu kush mountains in afghanistan are one of the least explored ranges in the world unlike other areas in afghanistan , bamyan is not under threat from insurgent groups and is quite safe for tourists , said mr hussain
he said : â bamyan is one of the few places in afghanistan where it is possible to do such type of outdoor activities
afghanistan is a melting pot of different religious and ethnic groups
â whilst this is one of the reasons for its troubled history it is also why certain areas of the country can be perfectly safe , or at least no riskier than other asian developing countries , to visit whilst others would be extremely dangerous
â the tour groups avoid dangerous areas , including unstable regions in the pashtun heartland , and they keep a low profile and are cautious when they travel into kabul , the capital , about 100 miles south - east of bamyan
a professional snowboarder soars through the air during a visit to bamyan in afghanistan in 2011 , untamed borders became the first company to take ski tourists to afghanistan the british tour operator takes 10 to 20 ski tourists to afghanistan every year mr hussain said : â if we walk in the city we will always have a car nearby , we will continually check safety reports and we will stay in discreet guest houses , not in the big hotels that are well - known targets
â however , the cities are well covered by security personnel and are generally very calm
if we thought that there was a major risk in any particular city then we would avoid it
â he added : â driving between cities is also something we take a long look at with regards to security
we check reports from a service that provides security updates to ngo workers and also ask drivers we know who regularly take passengers on the roads we take
we also get calls and texts from a security service should there be problems on the road
â â the security on the road is actually currently not too bad but it has been bad in the past and it makes sense not to take any undue risk if flights are available
bamyan is home to afghanistan 's only ski race , which pits locals against ski tourists competitors in the afghan ski challenge race up the hill before skiing back down â many of our guests have some safety concerns
it is afghanistan after all
however by the end of their trip their perception of afghanistan has changed a lot
â of all the things that help to change visitors â perceptions of afghanistan , the locals of bamyan play a massive role
tourists have plenty of opportunities to interact with them as locals work as ski guides , drivers and tour organisers , and some sell drinks and snacks
another opportunity is the annual afghan ski challenge , an incredible event where local and foreign skiers compete in a race up and down the slopes
the event , afghanistan âs only ski race , is operated by the bamyan ski club , which also arranges training and equipment for local skiers
kausar hussain said the local skiers usually beat the tourists in the afghan ski challenge mr hussain said locals , who strap planks of wood to their feet , usually beat the foreigners as they ski up the mountain and then ski back down
last winter three professional snowboarders visited bamyan to record afghanistan âs first ever snowboard film , calling it white silk road
during the summer , bamyan is a popular stop for afghan tourists , who visit the lakes at band-e-amir national park
the region is also a draw for those who compete in or watch buzkashi , the country âs national sport
it is a fierce competition where athletes on horseback carry the corpse of a decapitated goat , instead of a ball , and attempt to throw it into a scoring circle .
