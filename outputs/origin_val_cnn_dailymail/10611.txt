australian babies have the highest instances of food allergy in the world , with a recent study finding that one in 10 children suffer from the condition
the study , by professor katie allen from the murdoch childrens research institute , was based on children from melbourne aged 12 months who suffer from a food allergy
and the paediatric gastroenterologist says emerging evidence of an increase in anaphylaxis rates caused by eating nuts suggest it 's a health issue that 's only getting worse
but prof allen says there are some factors to acknowledge that may help australian avoid developing food allergies
this includes our modern lifestyle , ditching our obsession with cleanliness and ensuring an adequate supply of vitamin d in our diets
shocking figures have revealed that australian has the highest record of food allergy in the world
some of the most common food allergies in australian are nuts a seafood allergy which may include fish and shellfish is also common among australian pregnant women and new - born babies do n't need avoid cow 's milk as a means of trying to prevent such food allergies in 2011 prof allen conducted the study which reported the highest incidence of food allergy in the world , she told daily mail australia
in the same study , it was also revealed that one in 30 australian had a peanut allergy
' i was astounded by the figures , ' prof allen said
' and i 'm a little embarrassed by how high they are
i thought food allergy was all a bit of a beat up by the media
' but the evidence speaks for itself and this has become a public health concern
' professor katie allen at murdoch childrens research institute is also allergic to peanuts prof allen says food allergy is getting worse in australian
professor katie allen shares her ' five ds ' which may help prevent food allergy : ' emerging evidence of rising anaphylaxis rates also show that food allergy among australian continues to be a growing problem , ' she said
although the causes of this increasing concern is unknown , prof allen says research shows that one of the main problematic factors could be our modern lifestyle
prof allen recommends that recent study shows that pregnant women no longer need to avoid eating peanuts , eggs or cow 's milk in a bid to avoid developing a food allergy
' in fact , such foods such be introduced to infants in their first year soon after they 've started on solids , ' she said
the allergist adds that there 's a higher risk of food allergy among those who lack vitamin d - not just from sun exposure but in food
' the quality of vitamin d in our foods like the way eggs and fish are farmed has changed over time , ' she said
' also i think it 's worth saying that we are being too clean
that includes our water supply and the over use of antibiotics
as a result , this shows the darker side of public health
' prof allen also suggests that dogs and siblings offer protection against allergic diseases while those with eczema are more likely to have food allergy
an epipen , often carried by people with severe allergies , particularly to peanuts , and who are at risk of anaphylactic shock prof allen says her perspective on food allergy changed , particularly when she developed a peanut allergy during her pregnancy
she says although the common food allergy among children - such as eggs , soy , milk and wheat - can be outgrown , there are others that can be developed at a later stage in life
' tree nuts and seafood is most commonly developed during adulthood , ' she said
' and these can be the most concerning as they can be the ones that stick around - like allergies to peanuts , tree nuts and seafood
' in my case , i developed my peanut allergy when i became pregnant as that can reset the immune system
' i had also moved to the us and i was exposed to different environment of foods and microbes
' there was also possibly different levels of vitamin d and all of these could have been causes to the development of my allergy
' overall the most common food allergies among australian include cow 's milk , soy , egg , wheat , tree nuts , peanuts , fish and shellfish , prof allen said .
