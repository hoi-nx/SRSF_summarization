fewer families are taking holidays during term time in the wake of a government crackdown on absenteeism , new figures suggest
the number of days missed by holidaying pupils decreased by almost a third in the past year after a ban on taking children out of lessons for trips
parents have been fined up to Â£ 1,000 and even taken to court since the new policy came into force in september 2013
drop : figures reveal just 3million school days were missed by pupils last year - down 1.4million on 2012 - 13 yesterday , department for education figures showed 3million days were missed for holidays in 2013 - 14 , down from 4.4million in 2012 - 13
the latest figure represents a decrease of more than two fifths from 2009 - 10 , when 5.3million days were missed
government statisticians said the drop has been fuelled by a fall in the number of authorised breaks - trips approved by the school
there has been a slight rise in the number of unauthorised holidays - indicating that some parents may be deciding to take their child out of school without permission , and instead run the risk of a fine
the latest figures , for the last academic year , are the first to show the impact of strict new rules on pupil absence introduced by former education secretary michael gove
under the changes , heads are now only able to grant leave in â exceptional circumstances â and parents can be fined Â£ 60 per pupil for taking term time holidays without permission
the cost rises to Â£ 120 if it is not paid within 21 days
fines : the drop is being credited on the new fines system , which sees parents landed with a Â£ 60 penalty if they take their children out of school for an ' unauthorised ' absence those who fail to pay can face prosecution , with a maximum fine , if convicted , of Â£ 2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months
the national association of head teachers released guidance stating exceptions could be made for family funerals and religious events , but family holidays were unlikely to meet the criterion
campaigners have said the rules impact the hardest on poorer families who can not afford high travel costs during school breaks , and families with parents that work shifts on or rosters
travel companies increase their prices significantly in peak seasons when there is more demand
school reform minister nick gibb said : â every single lost day counts - which is why as part of our plan for education we have put teachers back in charge so they can clamp down on classroom absence
â fewer school days are being lost than ever before thanks to our reforms - giving children the best possible chance to succeed
