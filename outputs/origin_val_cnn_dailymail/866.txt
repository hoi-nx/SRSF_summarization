it 's the run of games which will go a long way to deciding whether united are playing champions league or europa league football next season
four of the premier league 's top six - tottenham , liverpool , city and chelsea - in their next fives games
make - or - break for louis van gaal and his players
other than the home clash with relegation - threatened aston villa on april 4 , sunday 's visit of tottenham would appear to be united 's best hope of three points over the next month and a half
but recent results tell a different story
marouane fellaini , michael carrick and wayne rooney ( l-r ) look dejected during defeat by arsenal christian eriksen scores tottenham 's winning goal against united at old trafford last season christian eriksen is mobbed by his team - mates after helping tottenham to their second consecutive win at old trafford 29.09.2012 - united 2 - 3 tottenham 20.01.2013 - tottenham 1 - 1 united 01.12.2013 - tottenham 2 - 2 united 01.01.2014 - united 1 - 2 tottenham 28.12.2014 - tottenham 0 - 0 united having won 17 and drawn five of their previous 22 games against tottenham , united now find themselves without a win in their last five matches with the north london outfit
pochettino 's men battled to a 0 - 0 at white hart lane in december but tottenham have won their previous two visits to old trafford , ending a 23 - year wait for victory with a 3 - 2 triumph in september 2012
united had gone 26 games without defeat at home to tottenham in all competitions - winning their previous nine - before a jonny evans own goal and strikes from gareth bale and clint dempsey gave andre villas-boas ' men a memorable win in manchester
and tottenham proved that result was no fluke last season when goals from emmanuel adebayor and christian eriksen sealed a 2 - 1 victory for tim sherwood 's side
gareth bale scores during tottenham 's 3 - 2 victory at old trafford in september 2012 - their first in 23 years clint dempsey celebrates after netting tottenham ' winner against sir alex ferguson 's side then tottenham manager andre villas-boas shows his delight after the final whistle two draws at white hart lane - 1 - 1 in january 2013 and 2 - 2 in december 2013 - were sandwiched between those victories , taking tottenham ' unbeaten run to an impressive five games
so impressive , in fact , that they are only the third team to manage such a run against united
liverpool did the same between 2000 and 2002 , winning four consecutive games against their great rivals - including two at old trafford - and drawing once
blackburn rovers also went five games unbeaten against the red devils between 2004 and 2006 , winning at old trafford in september 2005 and coming out on top in two fixtures at ewood park
just three points behind united going into sunday 's game , tottenham have a major incentive to pull off their third successive win at old trafford and become the first team to go six games unbeaten against united in the premier league era

and in harry kane , the premier league 's hottest striker and premier league player of the month for february , tottenham have a man capable of causing united 's frail defence all sorts of problems
their games against in - form liverpool , local rivals city and league leaders chelsea will be extremely tough but van gaal should be just as wary of tottenham
after decades of domination , tottenham have quickly become united 's bogey team .
