chelsea football fans have allegedly been caught chanting the n - word and anti-semitic slurs in a new race hate storm - prompting three asian women and a black man to leave a train
after the club âs victory over tottenham on sunday , a man was heard to say on the london to manchester service : â paris , paris , paris , that âs the way we like it , a n * * * * * on the door â
this was a reference to the shocking incident that saw a group of chelsea fans prevent a black man from getting onto a train on the paris metro last month before a champions league game
