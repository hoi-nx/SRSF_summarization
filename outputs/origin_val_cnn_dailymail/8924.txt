jonny brownlee came a disappointing fifth after a poor bike leg in the world triathlon series in abu dhabi gomez 's spanish compatriot mario mola was the class of the field over the sprint distance and pulled away during the second half of the five kilometres run to clinch a comfortable victory
jonny brownlee 's brother alistair missed the race because of a minor ankle injury but , with olympic qualification to be decided in august and september at the test event in rio and the world series grand final in chicago , none of the leading triathletes will want to peak too soon
jonny brownlee , 24 , said : ' i wanted better than that
i messed up everything i possibly could
that 's what the first race is about
' i thought my running was going well , but obviously not so well off the bike
i got into it later on but it was too late then
i just need to iron out the mistakes and sharpen up a little
