the iran nuclear negotiations in lausanne , switzerland , reportedly have made substantive progress , inching closer toward a provisional agreement between the p5 +1 and iran
while the talks continued to unfold this week , israel prime minister benjamin netanyahu restated his concern about an agreement with iran , vowing " to continue to act against any threat
" if an agreement is reached , the international spotlight will turn to israel , in anticipation of its possible reaction
israel defense minister moshe " bogy " yaalon stated that a deal is " a tragedy for the whole world
" the question is , however , what can israel really do once a deal is signed ? in recent days , notable conservatives in the united states have attacked president barack obama 's handling of the negotiations with iran , arguing that a bad deal will force israel 's hand , leaving it with no choice but to attack iran targets
but is this a realistic conclusion ? israel 's stated " all options are on the table " policy toward iran has been in place for years and is based on the assumption that if a diplomatic solution to the nuclear problem can not be reached or is not to its liking , israel can decide to opt for a military strike on iran 's nuclear facilities
thirty - four years after the successful israel bombing of the osirak nuclear facility in iraq , military experts have little doubt that the israel air force today is capable of reaching iran airspace and bombing targets above and below ground
therefore , the question is not one of military capability but more about domestic political and geopolitical strategy
with an iran deal in place , the israel leadership may face stern objections from the heads of the israel defense establishment , which will make it difficult but not impossible to take such a decision
nevertheless , if it remains keen on pursuing a military option , the israel leadership will have to consider the following set of consequences that will likely result from such a decision : a successful military strike on iran installations may degrade iran 's nuclear program , setting it back several years , but it would not completely eliminate iran 's nuclear capabilities
iran would likely be able to resume activity in new facilities soon after such an attack , with more international legitimacy to embark on a military nuclear program , in the face of future military challenges to its sovereignty and stability
a deal between the p5 +1 ( the united states , china , france , russia , united kingdom and germany ) and iran is expected to include a 10 - year ( or more ) " sunset provision " that is much longer than the period it will take iran to get its program back on track in case of an israel attack
a military attack against iran after a deal is signed would put israel on a collision course with the p5 +1 + 1 , who were negotiating the contours of a deal with iran , as well as with other members of the international community
bilateral ties and cooperation with member states of the p5 +1 may suffer , as well as intelligence sharing between the relevant intelligence agencies
in addition , countries are likely to seek ways to " punish " israel for its actions , in the form of a u.n. general assembly or security council resolution condemning israel behavior , calling for operative measures against the jewish state
an israel attack would likely lead to the collapse of the international sanctions regime on iran , which israel has worked to consolidate and which has been a very effective mechanism in pressuring iran
the understanding between israel and moderate arab regimes on the need to prevent a nuclear iran would not be likely to dissipate in the aftermath of an attack , but israel - arab coordination and cooperation on this issue is bound to suffer
finally , an israel attack would spark a direct iran military reaction against israel , as well as an indirect reaction against israel in the region by iran 's proxies hezbollah ( from southern lebanon and war - torn syria ) and hamas ( from gaza and perhaps the west bank ) and against israel targets abroad
in the aftermath of a deal with iran , israel 's response is expected to be harsh
it will include strong public criticism of the deal , a vow to continue the fight against the agreement in the u.s. congress and other relevant venues , a call for the international community to continue the sanctions regime , and a pursuit of coordinated public messaging with moderate arab regimes on this issue
these israel public diplomacy measures will be complemented by continued intelligence monitoring of iran 's activities in the nuclear sphere as well as its involvement in regional conflicts
opting for a military strike against iran , however , must take into consideration the consequences of such a decision
in light of all that is at stake , it does not seem like a plausible option at present .
