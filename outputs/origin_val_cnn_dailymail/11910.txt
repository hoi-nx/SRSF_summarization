sam twiston-davies says rocky creek is in flying form as it emerged that the crabbie âs grand national hopeful could have been given a big advantage by the handicapper
trained by nicholls , rocky creek â last seen when impressively winning the betbright chase at kempton in february â was among 74 horses after the latest forfeit stage for the aintree showpiece on april 11
lord windermere , the 2014 cheltenham gold cup winner trained by jim culloty , heads the weights on 11st 10lb , but rocky creek could have 9lb in hand

while public sentiment will be with ap mccoy for the big race , smith , the bha âs head of handicapping , warns that dangers to shutthefrontdoor lurk all around , not least from rocky creek , who is available at 12 - 1
champions jockey ap mccoy exercises ante - post favourite shutthefrontdoor at southwell smith said : â rocky creek was very impressive when he won at kempton
if i was framing the weights now , i âd have him 9lb higher
i âd also have the druids nephew ( a winner at the cheltenham festival ) 10lb higher
â rocky creek will be one of six bullets that nicholls aims at the Â£ 1million race , which he won in 2012 with neptune collonges , and the horse has been trained with aintree in mind â he finished fifth 12 months ago to pineau de re sam twiston-davies added of the gelding , who has run only three times this season : â fingers crossed , the horse seems to be in good order
hopefully he âll get there in one piece
i schooled him and he was very good
he did it well at kempton and let âs hope he âs ahead of the handicapper
sam twiston-davies believes rocky road has a good chance of winning the big race at aintree â when he ran in the hennessy ( in november and was pulled up ) it was really bad ground and i would just write that run off altogether
we have to go to aintree with an open mind
â as for pineau de re , his trainer dr newland could require a new jockey as the veteran chaser bids to become the first horse since red rum in 1974 to win back - to - back grand nationals
leighton , who did the steering a year ago , could be claimed to ride many clouds
newland said : â i might have a few calls to make
it is leighton âs ride if he is available
it is pointless getting worried at this stage
i âm sure there will be a few interested jockeys if leighton is nât available
