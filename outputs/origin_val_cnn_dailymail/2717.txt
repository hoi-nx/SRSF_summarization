the police force that guards the desert state of utah will soon ask for volunteers from among its members for a particularly macabre duty
five - man firing squads are to be formed and trained in preparation for a move that critics say risks dragging u.s. back to a ' more barbaric past '
facing a crisis in the lethal injection system by which most death row inmates are normally executed , utah 's leaders have just approved a solution that harks back to the violent spirit of its wild west past
pictured is the utah firing squad execution chamber , where death row inmates are strapped into the seat in front of a wooden board to stop bullets , and beside sandbags that absorb blood splatters the state has become the first to bring back the firing squad
gary herbert , utah 's republican governor , conceded that he found the concept ' a little bit gruesome ' , but stressed that it would be used only if injection drugs are not available 30 days before a scheduled execution
yet such a scenario looks increasingly likely
thirty - two states still have the death penalty , and u.s. 's death row are clogged with more than 3,000 condemned prisoners because of a string of botched lethal injections
these have allowed lawyers to halt the scheduling of supposedly painless executions on the grounds that they breach a constitutional ban on ' cruel and unusual ' punishment
to make matters worse , supplies of the sedatives used are drying up
many of the most effective drugs are made only in europe , but the eu has told manufacturers they can not sell them if they are to be used for lethal injections
u.s. drug manufacturers have already stopped making them , worried about being associated with executions as a growing proportion of u.s. come out against the death penalty
the result ? in 2014 , 35 people were executed in the u.s. â the fewest since 1994
last july , appalled witnesses described how convicted arizona double murderer joseph wood lay gulping and gasping like a landed fish for two hours as a cocktail of drugs failed to do their job of sedating him and then stopping his heart
now , with utah 's dramatic announcement , opponents of capital punishment are questioning whether even joseph wood 's fate is less barbaric than a squad of shooters blasting away at someone tied to a chair
witnesses described how double murderer joseph wood ( pictured ) lay gulping and gasping for two hours when a cocktail of drugs failed to sedate him although a firing squad may sound like a long - gone relic of frontier justice , the largely mormon state of utah did use one five years ago
in 2010 , gardner , a convicted murderer who had killed a lawyer during a court escape attempt , threatened to sue utah if it did n't allow him to be shot
the state had stopped offering death row inmates the option of a firing squad in 2004 â but because gardner had been convicted before the law was changed , he was still able to choose it
gardner , who had been on death row for 19 years , said : ' i guess it 's my mormon heritage
it 's so much easier
and there 's no mistakes
' even though history has shown the killer 's statement is not true , utah 's executioners will attempt to carry out the gruesome ritual with clinical precision
attached to the state prison at draper , the small execution room â built in an old canning factory â is flooded with fluorescent light from the ceiling and has no decorations on its white cinderblock walls
there are two slits for the marksmen cut into a wall , through which they aim their rifles
observation windows â protected by bulletproof glass â line the side walls of the square chamber
screwed to a raised platform 25ft from the shooters ' wall , a chair is flanked by sandbags to absorb blood and prevent ricochets
behind the chair is thick wooden panelling to stop the bullets
the entire structure is painted black
the inmate is bound to the chair with leather straps around the wrists , ankles , shoulders , waist and forehead â his immobility is crucial if the shooters are to hit his heart
locating the heart with a stethoscope , a doctor fastens a piece of white cloth two inches square , with a circle in the middle , over the left breast of the prisoner 's jumpsuit
unseen by the condemned , or the victim 's relatives and media representatives witnessing the execution on either flank , the squad of marksmen file in to take up position behind the wall facing their target
gardner appears before a judge where the date for his execution by firing squad was set for june 2010
gardner was a convicted murderer and said death by firing squad was ' so much easier ... and there 's no mistakes ' the officers are chosen from a pool of volunteers , with priority going to those from the local force where the inmate 's crimes were committed
there are always more volunteers than places on the squad
each officer is given an identical .30 calibre winchester rifle , loaded with a single round
following a utah tradition which means no marksman knows whether he has fired a lethal shot , one of the rifles contains a blank round made of wax
more ammunition is on hand if a second volley is needed
when the moment comes , the prison warden will pick up a microphone in the execution chamber and typically give the prisoner two minutes to say his last words
the governor then pulls a black hood over the inmate 's head and leaves the room
unable to hear the countdown in the marksmen 's enclosure , witnesses at gardner 's execution said they waited in awful suspense for 30 seconds until a deafening burst of almost simultaneous gunfire rang out
the target over his chest had three , possibly four , holes
a watching reporter said he saw gardner then move his left arm , briefly clenching and unclenching his fist
he also saw , under the bottom of his hood , what looked like his jaw moving
as two minutes passed , he wondered if gardner might need to be shot again
murderer gilmore 's ( pictured ) last words were ' let 's do it ' , moments before he was killed by firing squad
the phrase later became the inspiration for nike 's ' just do it ' slogan instead , a prison official wearing blue plastic gloves stepped into the chamber , lifting the hood just enough to check the pulse on his neck
he then raised the hood further , shining a torch into his eyes to confirm he was dead
in this situation , death is technically caused by blood loss from the rupture of the heart or tearing of the lungs
the prisoner is meant to lose consciousness when shock causes a fall in the supply of blood to the brain
if the shots are accurate , he is dead in seconds
however , if the marksmen miss the heart â intentionally or by accident â the inmate will bleed to death slowly
this occurred in utah in 1879 when a firing squad missed murderer wilkerson 's heart
a white paper target had been placed over it , but wilkerson â who had not been tied down â stiffened at the final moment
his movement dislodged the target just as the marksmen fired , and wilkerson leapt up screaming : ' oh my god ! they 've missed it ! ' it reportedly took him 27 minutes to die
anti-death penalty campaigners claimed the shooters missed his heart on purpose to prolong his agony
utah 's death penalty supporters insist that a well - trained firing squad would be faster and more humane than the protracted deaths caused by botched lethal injections
opponents counter that a firing squad is ' brutalising ' and barbaric
in the past , politicians have also complained that condemned men have chosen a firing squad as a last burst of attention - seeking
in utah , condemned men have opted for it over lethal injection because it seems more manly
in 1977 , gilmore , one of the most notorious death row inmates of modern times , became the first person executed in the u.s. after a ten - year moratorium was lifted by the supreme court
the double murderer demanded to be executed by firing squad
asked if he had any last words , he simply replied : ' let 's do it
' ( this week , the advertising executive who came up with the sports brand nike 's ' just do it ' slogan revealed he had been inspired by gilmore
) utah , in fact , has dispatched all three of the prisoners killed by firing squad in the u.s. since the death penalty was restored in 1976
the third was murderer john albert taylor , who refused to be sedated before he was shot in 1996 ( though he did ask for a cigarette )
utah â a state founded in bloodshed between mormon settlers , native tribes and federal troops â may have a sentimental attachment to the law of the gun
but other states are proving no less ruthless in their determination to find an alternative to lethal injections
death by lethal injection remains the most common method of state - sanctioned execution
pictured is the gurney at the oklahoma where death row inmates are injected politicians in alabama and tennessee have voted to bring back the electric chair , while wyoming 's state assembly passed a bill to reintroduce firing squads
in oklahoma , where prisoner clayton lockett writhed and groaned for 43 minutes in a lethal injection disaster last year , they have voted to execute people by gassing them with nitrogen
but only in tennessee and utah have these macabre initiatives made it onto the law books
even texas , which in some years executes more people than the rest of u.s. put together , recently announced it is down to its last dose of lethal injection
will a well - aimed shot to the heart kill a man as surely and humanely as a lethal injection in the arm ? the next man to find out may be former cult member ron lafferty , utah 's longest - serving death row inmate , who claimed god told him to kill his sister - in - law and her baby daughter in 1984 because she opposed his belief in polygamy
lafferty has requested a firing squad â no doubt when the time comes , his execution will spark a fierce bout of soul - searching in a nation that longs to be regarded as modern and compassionate , but on this issue is dragged back to its blood - soaked pioneer past .
