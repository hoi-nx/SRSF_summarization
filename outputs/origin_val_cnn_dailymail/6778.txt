graves says he wants to ' jazz up ' test matches by reducing them to four days graves has risked offending cricket âs purists , saying he wants to â jazz up â test matches by reducing them to four days from the traditional five
graves , who takes over as ecb chairman from giles clarke on may 15 , believes test cricket faces an identity crisis
and , while he was expressing his personal views only , it seems probable they will get an airing when he meets his international counterparts in the icc boardroom
â you ca nât continue to leave test as it is , â graves told the lords.org website
â if you look at it worldwide , test cricket is shrinking in the number of people who are watching it on tv and in the grounds
â somehow , somewhere , there is a way to improve test cricket
it âs the bastion , but we âve got to modernise it
we âve got to jazz it up
â i think we should look at four - day test cricket and play 105 overs a day starting at half past ten in the morning , with the ground drainage you âve got now , and finish when you finish , as all the grounds now have lights
â every test match would start on a thursday , so you have two days for corporates , and two days for families
from a cost point of view you âd save that fifth day , which would save a hell of a lot of money from the ground âs point of view and the broadcasters
â in reality , there âs not many people who turn up and watch it on the fifth day
â graves â formula would trim a total of only 30 overs off a test : the current format is five days of 90 overs each )
but it leaves little wriggle room in case of bad weather â a perennial problem during the british summer
and , while he has a point about poor fifth - day attendances , his plan would risk sacrificing some of the thrilling finishes test matches have witnessed over the past few years
only last season the games against sri lanka at lord âs and headingley both came down to the final over
stuart broad celebrates taking the wicket of dimuth karunaratne during day five of last season 's test match an attempt to squeeze in an extra 15 overs a day would not be without its drawbacks either : test teams habitually struggle to bowl the current minimum of 90 without making use of the extra half - hour allotted to them
cricket would also lose one of its enduring charms : the deteriorating fifth - day pitch , even if these are less common than they used to be
and that âs all before the broadcasters have their say
at least graves âs thought process suggests the kind of open - mindedness too often lacking among cricket âs administrators
too many have harrumphed ineffectually over the future of the test game in those parts of the world that favour the shorter formats â only then to announce the formation of yet another domestic twenty20 tournament
a few weeks ago , graves insisted pietersen , who recently joined surrey , must be playing county cricket to stand any chance of appearing for england whether or not his comments amount to anything other than a personal opinion , they confirm the view that graves will be very much his own man once he replaces giles clarke , who will assume the new role of ecb president
that much was evident a few weeks ago when graves appeared to offer a route back into the england team for pietersen , saying he needed to be playing county cricket to stand any chance
graves has been perplexed by the spin placed on those comments , insisting england âs stance on the pietersen issue has not changed
but , with six weeks still to go until he assumes office , graves is already carving out a reputation as a man who means business .
