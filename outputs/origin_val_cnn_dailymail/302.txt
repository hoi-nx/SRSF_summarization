it will be announced mid-may , before the barbarians game , which is the same weekend as the premiership final
â the side to play the barbarians will probably be made up of younger players
no - one in the squad will play in that , though one or two who have had injuries might come back into the equation
â from a selection point of view , we will use the first warm - up match to look at wider options
as you narrow down to the second game , the world cup squad and the ireland game , they will be proper games then

they will vary in intensity as we go through june and july

â one man who certainly â had a bash â against france on saturday was courtney lawes
the northampton lock was reportedly cited by the visitors after his monster hit on france fly - half jules plisson , but the match commissioner has seen no need to take the matter any further .
