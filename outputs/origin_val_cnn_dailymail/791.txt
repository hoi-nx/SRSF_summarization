the world is finally in the grip of a long - awaited el niã±o event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected
scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central pacific ocean and have started to alter wind patterns
the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance el niã±o will continue through the summer
the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration and atmosopheric administration has detected warmer than average water surface temperatures around the equator of the pacific ocean ( shown above ) which indicates the arrival of el niã±o however , they say that the el niã±o conditions are currently ' extremely weak ' and come at a time of the year when the influence of el niã±o on weather patterns usually declines
this means that while el niã±o conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer , it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring
el niã±o is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the pacific ocean around the equator
usually the wind blows strongly from east to west , due to the rotation of the earth , causing water to pile up in the western part of the pacific ocean
this pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern pacific ocean
however , in an el niã±o , the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east
this causes the eastern pacific ocean to get warmer
but as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents , this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer , meaning the el niã±o grows
this change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere
the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration said that it was unlikely the phenomenon would bring enough rain this spring to break the three - year record - breaking drought that is currently affecting california
some meteorologists , however , have warned that this el niã±o could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the pacific ocean called the pdo ( pdo )
the pdo reached record levels in december last year and january this year , and should it stay strong , it may combine with el niã±o to increase global temperatures
mike halpert , deputy director of us national oceanic and atmospheric administration 's climate prediction centre , said : ' based on the persistent observations of above - average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial pacific ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure , we can now say that el niã±o is here
' many climate prediction models show this weak el niã±o continuing into summer
' the arrival of this el niã±o is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year , but the conditions failed to materialise
according to the met office el niã±o conditions generally bring warmer temperatures to europe during the autumn and colder winter temperatures
the above diagram shows the sea surface temperature ( sst ) in the pacific ocean on 25 feburary 2015 and it can be seen that around the equator the temperature was above average ( marked by red ) on that date it can also make sourthern europe wetter during the late summer and autumn
perhaps the greatest impact is felt in the monsoon regions of south east asia where the climate is usually drier than normal in el niã±o years
el niã±o is one of the most powerful climate altering phenonoma on the planet
it is the result of the el niã±o , which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the pacific ocean
this cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years
when the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months , the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration officially classes it as el niã±o conditions
california is in the midst of the worst drought in 1,200 years and has caused severe drying of the stevens creek reservoir ( shown above )
it is unlikely the el niã±o will bring enough spring rain to ease the drought the last el niã±o , in 2009 - 2010 , was a moderate to strong event
this brought freezing weather to northern europe in the winter of 2009/2010 and the uk was exceptionally cold
the vancouver winter olympics also suffered a far warmer than average winter during the same event
other recent el niã±o âs in 2002 - 2003 , 2004 - 2005 and 2006 - 2007 have been weak to moderate in strength
the last very strong el niã±o was 1997 - 1998 and was known for providing heavy rainfall in the west of the us , especially california
the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration said that last week the sea temperature across much of the equatorial pacific ocean has been above average
they also found that unusually weak easterly winds have persisted across the eastern pacific ocean
in late january and february there were a couple of westerly wind bursts of over the central tropical pacific ocean and forecasts for march suggest these will continue
the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration said that this mean the equatorial southern oscillation index , which is uses to monitor the el niã±o , has been a negative value for the second month in a row
the above diagram shows the impacts of a typical el niã±o on seasonal temperatures around the world the above diagram shows how a typical el niã±o is expected to change seasonal rainfall around the world in a blog post on the onset of el niã±o , the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration said : ' at this time , these are extremely weak el niã±o conditions , during a time of year when the influence of el niã±o on weather patterns in north america or other locations outside of the tropics is weakening
' from an impacts perspective , this is not particularly momentous , as el niã±o impacts are weak in the spring and summer
' still , after months of hovering under the threshold , we can now say that el niã±o conditions have arrived
' us national oceanic and atmospheric administration scientists are to continue monitoring the situation and will issue an update in april
however , eric holthaus , a meteorologist writing for new scientist , warned that the arrival of el niã±o could result in this year being especially warm
he said : ' el niã±o transfers huge amounts of heat from the oceans to the atmosphere , and there are hints that this el niã±o , combined with the already very warm global oceans , could bring about a new phase in global warming
' an associated slow - moving indicator of pacific ocean temperatures , called the pacific decadal oscillation ( pdo ) , reached record levels in december and january
' a persistently strong pdo is associated with cold winters in the eastern us and drought in california â we 've had both in abundance this year
' should the pdo stay strong , it will essentially join forces with el niã±o and increase the odds that 2015 will rank as the warmest year on record globally
