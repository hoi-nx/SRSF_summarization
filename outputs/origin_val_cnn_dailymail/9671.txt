messi and suarez fired barcelona to the top of la liga by scoring five of their six goals at the nou camp on sunday
suarez scored the first and last goals in the 6 - 1 win
' he is giving us more and more with every week that passes â said luis enrique
messi scored a 12 - minute second - half hat - trick to take him level with cristiano ronaldo for 30 league goals this season
it was also a record breaking 24th la liga hat - trick taking him one clear of the portuguese and setting a new domestic record
messi scored a hat - trick but his first came from the penalty spot against rayo vallecano at the nou camp messi celebrates after scoring during the la liga match as barcelona won 6 - 1 at the nou camp on sunday messi goes round the goalkeeper to score en route to a 12 - minute hat - trick at the nou camp for barcelona messi looks on as his shot goes into the empty net as barcelona hammered rayo vallecano at the nou camp messi is congratulated by partner suarez during the la liga win that moved barcelona top ahead of real madrid barcelona moved top of la liga with a 6 - 1 win over real madrid at the nou camp on sunday lunchtime messi was mesmeric for the catalans and walked off with the match ball after a scintillating display barcelona : claudio bravo , gerard pique , xavi , pedro , iniesta ( rafinha 66 ) , suarez , messi , javier mascherano ( rakitic 66 ) , alba ( adriano 76 ) , dani alves , mathieu subs not used : ter stegen , bartra , sergi roberto , munir goals : suarez ( 6 , 90 ) , pigue ( 49 ) , messi ( pen 56 , 63 , 68 ) bookings : javier mascherano , alba , adriano sent off : alves rayo vallecano : alvarez , tito , amaya , abdoulaye ba , insua , trashorras , lica ( aquino 71 ) , jozabed ( quini 66 ) , alberto bueno , kakuta , baptistao ( manucho 83 ) subs not used : cobeno , nacho , pozuela , moreno goals : bookings : tito , trashorras , aquino sent off : tito rayo vallecano are more used to lunchtime kick - offs than barcelona but suarez had no problems with the early start as he put the home side ahead after just six minutes
he received the ball from xavi having sprung rayo vallecano âs adventurous offside trap and , with the outside of his right boot , spun a shot past the advancing alvarez
it was one of his best goals since joining the club , and it was also his ninth since the turn of the year
barcelona should then have wrapped up the three points in the next 20 minutes but were wasteful in front of goal and unfortunate with a penalty decision that went against them
first suarez was sent racing away once again as rayo vallecano persisted with a suicidal high defensive line but his cross to pedro was cut out by a recovering defender
the former liverpool striker then went through on alvarez but was bundled down from behind by abdoulaye ba only for the referee to wave play on
pedro was next to go close went put through by messi but his effort was saved by alvarez who was helping to keep rayo vallecano in the game
he was also spending a lot of time sweeping up outside his area
the visiting manager jemez had said before the game that losing by seven would be the same as losing by a single goal and his attacking tactics were keeping him to his word
rayo vallecano had their chances too
trashorras in particular tested claudio bravo from open play and from a free - kick after javier mascherano had fouled on the edge of the area and been booked for his trouble
barcelona could not extend their lead before the break but they came close just before the half time whistle with what would have been one of the goals of the season
suarez lofted a pass over the top of rayo vallecano âs defensive line to messi and flicked it first time over the goalkeeper but just wide of the target
if jemez spent the break convincing his players they get back into the game the belief was undone within five minutes of the restart
xavi took a corner , jordi alba headed it on to a post and when it came back down in the six - yard box gerard pique forced it over the line

full - back tito had been booked in the first half and when he grappled suarez to ground inside the area the referee pointed to the spot and pulled out a second yellow and then the red
it was messi âs first spot - kick since having his penalty saved by joe hart at the etihad
he seemed to wait an age before steering it to the keeper âs right and seeing it comfortably saved
there was a let - off to come however with the referee deciding it needed to be taken again
at the second attempt he put it to the keeper âs left and this time the ball nestled in the corner
the roof was coming down on rayo vallecano now and messi soon made it 4 - 0 turning in a suarez pass
alvarez then saved the barcelona number ten âs free - kick to deny him a hat - trick
he was nât denied for long however
on minute 63 substitute rafinha sent the ball out to alba and he crossed for messi to quick - step around the last defender and convert for his third goal of the game , his 30th of the season and his 24th la liga hat - trick â no one has ever scored more
dani alves was sent off for bringing down alberto bueno
he looked to get the ball before the player but the referee pointed to the spot and the former real madrid youngster scored the penalty
there was still time for suarez to get his second of the game
he raced clear of rayo vallecano âs still stubbornly high line but played in messi instead of finishing himself and watched as the pass just run away from his team - mate
messi repaid the favour when he slipped suarez through and with seconds of normal time remaining he made it six
