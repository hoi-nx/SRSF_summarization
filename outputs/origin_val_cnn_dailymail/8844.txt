a former soldier is suing a hospital in romania after he went to have a kidney operation and ended up having his penis amputated
maroleanu , 55 , had gone to the county hospital in the town of buzau in eastern romania suffering from kidney failure
although the operation , carried out by surgeon dr iurie ciochina , was successful , a nurse subsequently fitted his catheter incorrectly , causing mr maroleanu 's genitalia to become severely infected and leaving doctors with no option but to remove the penis in order to save his life
victim : maroleanu , 55 , had gone to the county hospital in the town of buzau in eastern romania suffering from kidney failure but an incorrectly - fitted catheter left his penis severely infected speaking of the botched catheter fitting , mr maroleanu said : ' after the operation they told me there were some complications
apparently the nurse had not properly fitted a small plastic pipe to help me urinate , and my penis became red and infected
' i was moved to intensive care and four days later was moved to the nephrology department where they took a sample , but then they just left me there for 10 days
eventually they did an operation , but then doctor went on holiday
' shortly afterwards mr maroleanu was transferred to the bucharest military hospital
there he underwent a series of examinations with doctors concluding that the only thing they could do was to amputate the infected penis , otherwise there was a strong possibility he would die
a spokesman for the hospital said : ' the foreskin was stripped away completely and most of the cells in the organ were dead
' the member was black and the only remaining skin was at the base of the shaft and highly infectious
it was recommended to remove the necrotic elements , meaning amputation
' surgeon : although the operation , carried out by dr iurie ciochina ( pictured ) , was successful , a nurse subsequently fitted his catheter incorrectly , causing mr maroleanu 's genitalia to become severely infected speaking of this shock after the operation , mr maroleanu said : ' it was totally cut off
now i urinate through an orifice that doctors made between my anus and my testicles
' i urinate just like a woman
' now the former soldier is demanding Â£ 362,450 compensation from the original hospital for malpractice
he said : ' if they had n't botched things up at the beginning this would n't have happened
' but professor nicolae calomfirescu , head of romania 's sexual medicine association said : ' i 'm not sure he will win by saying he is devastated and has to go to the toilet like a woman
' it depends on the patient 's image of himself
if you cut my right hand with me being a surgeon , i will be devastated
if you cut the left hand of a violinist , he will be devastated , ' he said
' but should he be devastated by the loss of his penis ? i would say the man needs to be evaluated by a psychologist , ' he added .
