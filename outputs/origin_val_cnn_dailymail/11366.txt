inter manager mancini has stepped up his charm offensive in an attempt to spark a move for manchester city midfielder toure
the former city manager wants to bring toure to inter after his spell as boss of the ivorian midfielder powerhouse at the etihad stadium between 2010 and 2013
and mancini has cheekily hinted that toure would fancy a move to italy after a difficult season with manchester city chasing chelsea in the premier league title race
toure ( left ) is wanted by mancini ( right ) at inter after their time at manchester city mancini poses with aleksandar kolarov , david silva , toure and jerome boateng ( l-r ) when signing them ' toure has played in every top league , apart from germany and italy , ' mancini said
' if , as it seems , he wants to have an experience in italy , then there is this possibility he could come here
' it wo nât be easy , but he âs a player with incredible technique and character
would inter be his first choice ? that âs certain
' mancini claims toure ' seems ' to want a move to inter despite having two years left on his manchester city contract mancini is back as inter manager and wants to bring high - profile players to italy 's serie a toure has two years left on his manchester city contract , and there seems no chance that the premier league champions would be interested in selling a star player and part of the spine of manuel pellegrini 's team
and manuel pellegrini has spoken out previously to confirm that toure will not be leaving - not that it 's stopping mancini
last month manuel pellegrini said : ' i do nât have an opinion about what another manager says about toure
' of course , every manager of every team would want toure in their team but i do nât have anything to say about that
' toure rues a missed chance for manchester city - and he has struggled to match their usual standards at times this year manuel pellegrini says mancini can forget about signing toure but the italian wo n't seem to back down and mancini certainly seems interested in his former players , having also tried to sign manchester city youth product from fiorentina , where he is on loan , in january
' we did try to get him , as he was my player at manchester city , ' mancini told gazzetta tv
' fiorentina seemed open to it , but the move did nât go through
' mancini 's inter are struggling in serie a this season and face missing out on champions league football again , with the inter sitting ninth in the table .
