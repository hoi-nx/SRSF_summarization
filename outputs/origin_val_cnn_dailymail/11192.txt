oh gawd , not more kitchen scenes ! after the milibands â two - kitchens saga , last night the bbc took us to david cameron âs constituency kitchen in oxfordshire in the latest example of â hello â television political coverage
it was there that the pm announced that he might not look for a third term in downing street
er , might be worth waiting until you âve won a second one before you start talking about a third , comrade

â calm down dear â sign , Â£ 16.99 , amazon â unclear if this appeared before or after the pm âs infamous commons jibe what is it about kitchens ? whatever , the bbc âs landale was shown chopping vegetables with the pm as lunch was prepared for the david cameron family
the slinky samantha , looking as though she was just out of some foam - scented bath , wandered towards the cooking area in a loose - fitting lumberjack shirt and announced that her husband was â definitely the best man for the job â
she added that â me and the family â ( did they not teach grammar at her public school ? ) kept him grounded
kept him in the kitchen chopping carrots , more like
but what a healthy lot the cams are
did you see those lettuce leaves in the colander ? no wonder he has lost weight , poor man
can a man really run a country on rabbit food ? this latest up - close - and - gooey film with a party leader â which came after the ed miliband domestic epic disaster , and a little - noticed shocker with nick clegg and his parents â started with mr david cameron on the touchline at a children âs football game in his witney constituency
his son elwen , aged nine , was playing
â come on , chads ! great save ! â bawled the pm , making sure the camera crew had a good view of him
mr david cameron said that he felt â fit enough â for another term of the premiership , and would be gutted if he lost the election
it was country casuals time
the aesthetic was one of boden clothes and gummies and chelsea tractors in oxfordshire lanes
in the kitchen it was belfast sinks and nourishing stews
then came a moment from the carry on films , surely
we followed mr david cameron on a visit to his butcher
chicken was on the shopping list
past : david cameron invited the cameras into his kitchen in oxfordshire in 2006 - and commenters said that it now looks a lot more cluttered labour leader ed miliband previously allowed the cameras into his ' second kitchen ' - an area for snack - making in his north london home mr david cameron : â i like the thighs because they âre very juicy
kenneth williams or frankie howerd could not have delivered it better
the butcher did not seem entirely keen to take part in the political promo â
reporter landale enquired if â david cameron â was the shop âs most famous customer
no answer from the man with the sharp knife and bloody apron ( borrowed from the pm after his last reshuffle ? )
but mr david cameron announced that one clarkson sometimes visited the butcher
so now we know where clarkson gets his old beefs
talking of the top gear presenter , mr david cameron disclosed that his daughter nancy , 11 , had threatened that very morning to go on a hunger strike if clarkson was dropped by the bbc
tricky moment for landale and his editors
but to their credit they kept it in
mr david cameron said he had told nancy that this was â not exactly gandhi â ( a reference to the emaciated indian mahatma who used to fast in protest at british imperialism )
later we learned that nancy had tucked into a hearty lunch , so her hunger strike had â lasted five minutes â , said her father
longer than some election promises , darling
kitchens update : not to be outdone , itv earlier in the day gave us an interview from the sparse wee scullery of gnasher - toothed scots nationalist leader nicola sturgeon
it looked about as warm and inviting as the sea off aberdeen .
