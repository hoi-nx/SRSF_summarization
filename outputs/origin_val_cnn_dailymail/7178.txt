california company pebble has broken the all - time kickstarter record
they raised more than Â£ 9.7 million in just a week - with 23 days still to go
so far more than 60,000 people have backed the new smartwatch ( shown )
but pebble has been criticised for still using kickstarter to raise funds pebble time beat the previous overall funding record of Â£ 8.7 million ( $ 13.3 million ) set by the coolest cooler , a drinks cooler that comes with a built - in blender , wireless speaker and usb charging points - and there are still 23 days of funding to go in pebble 's kickstarter
pebble 's original smartwatch is third on the all - time list , having raised more than Â£ 6.5 million ( $ 10 million ) after having an initial funding goal of Â£ 65,000 ( $ 100,000 )

the watch is also water resistant
the pebble time will have a retail price of Â£ 129 ( $ 199 ) once the kickstarter campaign ends on march 28 , but those who choose to fund the pebble time have been able to pre-order the wearable device for less

some experts , however , have criticised the use of kickstarter by established companies like pebble - and say it should be the reserve of startups only
more than a million units of the original pebble have been sold since it was funded in 2012 , making it one of the most successful wearables on the market
â i 'm not saying that successful people ca n't use kickstarter but , to me , their cap - in - hand use of the platform has always felt fraudulent , â said daniel cooper for engadget

the watch is also water resistant â it 'd be like watching bill gates , mark cuban and warren buffett panhandling on the streets of seattle
â he added : â it 's a romantic notion , but i always saw kickstarter as a way to empower inventors ( and creatives ) who could n't get backing any other way
â at the mobile world congress technology show in barcelona this week , pebble announced they would also be selling a high - end steel version of the time that would cost around Â£ 160 ( $ 245 ) , and look similar to the premium version of the apple
some experts have suggested this week that the premium apple watch edition could cost as much as Â£ 425 ( $ 650 ) , meaning pebble may be able to draw attention and possibly some sales away from the technology giant by undercutting them in price
apple is set to announce the final details of its own wearable at a press event in san francisco next week , including a launch date and full price options of the three versions of the device
last month , apple chief tim cook confirmed the wearable would go on sale in april .
