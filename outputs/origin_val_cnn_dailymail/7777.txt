' i accept that you were under pressure at home in relation to your son but many people have those sorts of pressures but get on with their life without resorting to dishonesty
' the court heard that spruce , of bilston , in the west midlands , bought the items for her son who was ' very controlling and aggressive '

' wendy miller , defending , said : ' this was not a sophisticated fraud and was always going to be detected
' she was trying to satisfy her only son who is difficult to control
the items bought for herself were few and far between
