masa had many breath - taking moments in her life
she was born on december 1 1997
since birth she was bursting with life , vitality and passion
she was 17 , sparking , outgoing , funny , intelligent and simply one of a kind
masa loved life and was eager to embrace all it had to offer
as a perfectionist she excelled in everything she did but she especially love reading , travelling and spending time with her family and friends
the devastated family of murdered melbourne teenager masa have issued a deeply moving statement about losing their ' ambitious , passionate ' daughter and sister she loved to dance and perform
for those of you who do n't know what that is cosplay is a performance art where costumes and fashion accessories represent a specific character or idea
masa had more costumes and accessories than anyone
she used to take her mum shopping and she 'd always buy another dress to take home and add to her collection
masa also had an unrivalled love for fashion which she said she developed as a baby as a result of her mum changing her outfit three or four times a day to take baby photos
on a recent trip to paris and montenegro she managed to pack , among many other things , four heavy winter coats so she would n't be photographed in the same one
her room is all pink with her collection of costumes , quirky posters and so on
she had skill to take selfies like no other and she was indeed the princess of selfies
she made many many friends in her short life
masa loved her sister nadja and brother petar dearly
she shared a special bond with them both and that is a bond that only family who are close with siblings share
you 'd hear masa and nadja talking together , performing various roles in front of the camera
masa and her mother were very close
they laughed together and often debated together
masa always seemed to win the debate
masa wanted to become a lawyer and dreamed of enjoying drinking lattes in a range of different outfits
masa was an inspiration to many
her motivation and drive were exceptional and would have been an outstanding wife
she used to go on walks with her father which would usually end up in some make - up store
the family would like to express their gratitude for the love and support they received from their family and friends and community at large
a particular thank you to victoria police
masa touched all our hearts
even if you do not know her personally
we miss her beautiful smile , her funny little mannerisms and the sparkle in her eyes
masa we love you , you will be in our hearts forever
