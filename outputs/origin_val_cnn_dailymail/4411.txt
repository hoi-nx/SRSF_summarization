a florida teacher is facing suspension for calling a 14 - year - old muslim student ' rag - head taliban '
deyab - houssein wardani , from weston , said valdes first called him names in his french class at cypress bay high last month when he walked in wearing a hooded sweater
' and she said , " oh , no , the taliban is here " , ' he told wsvn
' and at first i took it as a joke because i did n't really know what taliban was
' i raised my hand , and she said , " yes , taliban " , and everyone just kind of laughed
' over the next several days , the 64 - year - old teacher , who often nicknames her students , continued referring to deyab-houssein as ' taliban ' - even calling him ' rag - head taliban '
they have called for the teacher to be fired or suspended the teenager , who is an honor role student and a boy scout , asked his parents what the word meant , and they were shocked when they learned where he had heard it
' he 's a 14 - year - old boy , ' his father youssef wardani , a lebanese immigrant whose wife is from morocco , told cbs
' he should not have to worry about these kind of actions from a teacher in a class in a school and in a state that advertises diversity
' the parents contacted the assistant principal of the school , and when asked about the name - calling , mrs valdes admitted that she had called their son ' rag - head taliban ' , wsvn reported
the school then told the wardanis that their son could move into another french class
' seriously ! ! ' mr houssein wardani wrote on a facebook page detailing the incident ' she does the crime and he is the one to be punished
' accomplished : the houssein wardani family , right , said their 14 - year - old son ' dh ' is a hard - working boy scout and honor roll student who should not have to worry about such name - calling - especially from a teacher and when mr houssein wardani asked the teacher about what she had said , her response was less than reassuring , he wrote on facebook
' she responded with huffing and puffing accompanied with rolling eyes and arrogance , ' he wrote
' she showed no remorse whatsoever ! ' he said that at first he only wanted an apology , but now he is calling for the teacher to be fired or suspended without pay for a year
broward county public schools has launched an investigation into the incident
' this situation is being taken seriously , ' it said in a statement
' the district launched an immediate investigation into the matter and will be bringing forward to the school board in march a recommendation for disciplinary action regarding this situation
' taking action : administrators at cypress bay high said they are investigating
they will reportedly not fire the teacher but could suspend her for five days - but the wardanis say that is not enough cbs reported that the teacher , who has worked for the district for 11 years and has no prior disciplinary record , will not be fired but could face a suspension
mr houssein wardani said he was told she would be suspended for five days - but he said that is not enough
the school district is expected to take disciplinary action during a meeting on march 17
in the meantime , deyab-houssein , who is known to friends and family as ' dh ' , has been returning to the same french class but admits it 's awkward now
' i am extremely disappointed with her , and i guess you could say it 's sad that someone would think like that to this day , ' the boy said .
