iowa mom lauer has a personal motto she is trying to pass on to others : ' if you have baby on one side , it âs best to have gun on the other
' the 30 - year - old mother - of - three from des moines and former gun shop worker has started a new safety class that claims to teach women how to carry a firearm and their child at the same time
despite being a gun enthusiast , lauer maintains her controversial class does not encourage women to conceal a weapon , but shows them how to do so properly
' i have seen a huge insurgence in young mothers , mothers of young children , wanting to get into firearms , ' lauer told abc 6
' so they just do it
they do n't do it right and then they end up having an accident
' the class is called ' babywearing and carrying ' and the first seminar was in february
lauer says it has quickly become quite popular and is being hailed the first of its kind
' to our knowledge , nobody is doing this yet , ' barry snesll , who runs crossroads shooting sports shooting range in des moines , said
' the interest was so great that she actually had to turn off or shut off the registration
' otherwise , we would have had two - three times as many people here
' safety : lauer 's motto is iif you have baby on one side , it âs best to have gun on the other ' pro-gun : mother - of - three lauer said parents should be responsible enough to learn to carry a weapon safely safety : lauer became dedicated to learning the correct safety measures associated with firearms lauer got her gun permit at 21 to appease her husband , who said he would be more comfortable with her increasing travel commitments for work if his wife were armed
she became dedicated to gun safety and learning how to use the weapon properly
the idea for a class was then recently borne out of tragedy , she said
' the idea for the class came out of hearing about the kid in idaho who shot his mom recently , ' lauer told yahoo! parenting
' that touched me in a very deep way because my daughter was 2 at the time
' i thought , there âs no reason this should happen
we are adults and can be responsible
' because of the popularity in des moines , lauer is now looking at ways to expand , and perhaps plan a weekend event
