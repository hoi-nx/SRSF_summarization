poor olive harvests last year may mean a shortage of olive oil
dietitian dr sarah schenker offers some alternatives : poor olive harvests last year may mean a shortage of olive oil - so here are some alternatives best to roast veg : rapeseed rapeseed oil has 6 per cent saturated fat compared with olive oil 's 14.3 per cent
it also has ten times the amount of omega - 3 fatty acids and 50 per cent more vitamin e. expert verdict : one of the healthiest oils , with a subtle , grassy taste
one concern with heating oil is how soon it starts to smoke
this is when the fatty acids in it oxidise , creating harmful free radicals
rapeseed oil has a high smoke point , so use for frying or roasting
best in risotto : rice bran taken from the bran ( the vitamin - rich layer below the fibrous hull of rice ) and germ ( the oily , nutrient - rich part of a rice grain )
high in protective antioxidants such as vitamin e. expert verdict : as well as heart healthy vitamin e , this contains ferulic acid , which has powerful anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory effects , helping to protect the immune system and prevent disease
coconut oil makes great stir - fries best in stir - fries : coconut extracted from the white flesh of coconuts , this is almost 50 per cent lauric acid , a ' healthier ' saturated fatty acid
solid at room temperature , so ca n't be used for salad dressings , but its high smoke point makes it ideal for cooking
expert verdict : though it 's 86.5 per cent saturated fat , research suggests the saturated fat in coconut may be used up more quickly by the body and is less likely to be stored as body fat
however , use in moderation
best on salad : walnut with useful amounts of fatty acids , walnut oil may help lower heart disease risk
a distinct walnut flavour and low smoke point , so best for dressings
expert verdict : delicious , but not particularly versatile
buy small bottles and keep in a cool , dark place as it goes rancid easily
best for baking : hemp seed richer in the essential fatty acids omega-3 , 6 and 9 than other culinary oils , and has half the saturated fat of olive oil
one tablespoon provides 94 per cent of your daily recommended intake of omega - 3s
expert verdict : versatile - can be used for stir - frying , dipping and salad dressing
one of the healthiest alternatives to olive oil , though the flavour may not be to everyone 's taste
disguise with dried fruit and spices
rapeseed oil ( l ) , walnut oil ( c ) and hemp seed oil ( r ) are all good for different dishes
