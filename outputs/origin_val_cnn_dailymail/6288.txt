bobbi kristina 's relatives have denied report that they are part of a reality tv show which shows them coming to terms with the singer being in an induced coma in hospital
a source had previously told tmz at least three relatives of the 21 - year - old 's father bobby brown have taken part in the unnamed show , part of which documents bobbi kristina fighting for her life
' yet again , tmz has chosen to engage in false news reporting , ' said bobbi kristina âs attorney christopher brown

bobby brown , the 21 - year - old 's father , is not part of the show , his lawyers told tmz bobbi kristina 's attorney then added in a statement to rumorfix ; ' there is no brown family reality show that is in production which chronicles bobby brown , bobbi kristina or the medical emergency she presently faces at emory hospital
these reports are irresponsible and warner brothers as the owner of tmz , should be ashamed to publish such nonsense , particularly one day before bobbi kristina âs birthday
' he ended by saying ; ' bobbi kristina and bobby brown are dealing with enough right now
the fact that tmz / warner brothers has decided to inject negativity into their lives at this critical time is plain insanity

there are also tensions between family members and her boyfriend gordon , who launched a twitter rant against bobby brown last week
gordon , who has reportedly been banned from visiting bobbi kristina , told bobbi kristina to ' grow up ' - insisting she will hate him when she wakes up
the angry tirade came hours after attorneys from the bobbi kristina family told gordon he will not be allowed at her bedside until he reveals exactly what happened the evening before bobbi kristina was found face down in a bathtub
gordon also insisted he has taken care of his girlfriend ' 24/7 ' since her mother died in 2012
last monday , he first tweeted : ' okay , so i 'll probably get in trouble for this , ' before uploading a screenshot of damning text messages he claimed to have sent bobby brown

' doctors were unable to take bobbi kristina out of her medically - induced coma last week
the 21 - year - old , who is on life support at emory university hospital in atlanta , georgia , began having seizures when they began taking her off various medications , it was reported
it was then decided to keep her in the coma
the 21 - year - old is on life support at emory university hospital in atlanta , georgia last week , she was given a tracheotomy
few details about the young woman 's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital , and her father , bobby brown , has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter 's condition
a lawyer for bobbi kristina 's father , bobby brown , said in a statement that bobbi kristina 's partner , gordon , was offered an opportunity to potentially visit her if he agreed to meet certain conditions
' obviously mr. gordon is not as desperate to visit bobbi kristina as he wants the world to believe
at least not desperate enough to inform bobby brown , in writing , what happened to bobbi kristina , ' attorney christopher brown told e !
but gordon 's attorneys said r&b singer bobbi kristina has consistently denied gordon permission to visit
they said they advised gordon not to agree to the conditions set by bobbi kristina
the conditions have not been made public
the attorneys said gordon has repeatedly offered to discuss the issue privately with bobbi kristina
a report which surfaced last month claimed bobbi kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub
in addition to this , she had been using cocaine , heroin and xanax in the months before the january 31 incident , according to multiple sources who spoke to people
bobbi kristina had also been ' in and out ' of rehab for three years these same sources claimed , and still was ' distraught ' over her mother 's death three years ago
one of the sources who regularly saw the 21 - year - old said bobbi kristina seemed to frequently be ' high ' and was often ' slurring her words '
gordon and bobbi kristina referred to each other as husband and wife , but father bobby brown said they never legally married .
