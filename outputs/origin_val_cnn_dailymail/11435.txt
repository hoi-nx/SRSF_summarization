drilling has begun beneath a german city by a team of indiana jones pensioners who believe they are on the trail of the fabled amber room of the tsars
the oaps treasure hunters are digging beneath the streets of the old industrial city of wuppertal
the amber room - valued at around Â£ 250million in today 's money - was looted from the palace of peter the great in russia by invading germany troops in 1941
it is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from second world war never to be found and has captivated treasure hunters ever since it was first plundered
some say the panels were destroyed by russia artillery fire on the prussian city of koenigsberg , others that they were dumped in an alpine lake by the ss in the closing days of the war
but karl-heinz , 68 , and his bowling club pals , say they have proof it was entombed by the nazis beneath the streets of wuppertal
it is here , said karl-heinz , that he has received information that the crates arrived from koenigsberg early in 1945 to be hidden
he said : ' erich koch , the germany gauleiter of prussian who died in a polish prison in 1986 , came from wuppertal
' as the red army closed in on koenigsberg , he ordered the treasure to be packed up and brought back to his hometown
we have studied records and spoken to people from the time
' he did not want to leave the world 's greatest treasure in a region with an unknown political future ; rather he brought it to a place he knew where he had a good chance of accessing it in the future
' in search of lost treasure : a group of bowling club friends say they have proof the amber room was entombed by the nazis beneath wuppertal following the scent : the group claim to have received information that the crates arrived from koenigsberg early in 1945 to be hidden in the german city of wuppertal opulent : a complete restoration of the amber room in the catherine palace of tsarskoye selo near st petersburg , the original of which was plundered by the nazis in second world war , but has since disappeared the Â£ 250million room , consisting of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin , took ten years to complete
it is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from second world war never to be found the local authority have given karl-heinz and his four friends permission to dig in the germany structures and a local building firm has loaned them some heavy drilling equipment
' i ca n't reveal who our sources are , but we are not doing this for fun , ' he added
' we will find the amber room here
' others have been just as certain in the past
the maigret author georges simenon founded the amber room club after second world war to track it down once and for all
everyone had a different theory of what might have befallen the work
plundered : the remains of the amber room after it was seized by the nazis , who packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to germany , where they vanished never to be seen again stripped bare : some say the panels were destroyed by russia artillery fire on the prussian city of koenigsberg , while others claim they were dumped in an alpine lake by the ss in the closing days of the war destroyed : peter the great received the room as a gift from the king of prussia in 1716 and brought it to his new capital , st petersburg
here it is seen before restoriation the amber room consists of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin , took ten years to complete and is valued at some Â£ 250million in today 's money
peter the great received the room as a gift from the king of prussia in 1716 and brought it to his new capital , st petersburg
the 16 - feet of jigsaw - puzzle style panels were constructed of more than 100,000 perfectly fitted pieces of amber
in 1755 , it was moved to the catherine palace at tsarkoe selo , 17 miles south of the imperial russian capital
in 1941 , the approaching germany army surrounded the city , then known by its russia name of st petersburg
tsarkoe selo was one of the outlying areas occupied by the german
they packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to germany , where they vanished
dozens of theories have been put forward for their whereabouts and in some cases , millions spent trying to unearth the treasure , but as yet nothing has been found
in 2006 an us team spent Â£ 7million diving into the glacial waters of lake toplitz in austria
norman scott , the founder of global explorations , said he had a witness who he says specifically counted 27 crates going to the waters of the lake in april 1945 , one month before the capitulation of germany
paperwork from the reich main security office - the reich main security office of the ss in wartime - shows the amber room was packed into precisely 27 crates before it was taken away by the german from russia
the team also say the cyrillic lettering on the remains of a wooden crate they found , bearing the words ' fragile ' and numbered could mean it once contained a piece of the amber room jigsaw
lake toplitz was used by hitler 's forces in the last two years of the war for secret underwater experiments using dynamite and rockets
it later turned it into a dumping ground for anything the nazis wanted to hide from the advancing allies
but the lake has yielded little since second world war , except for forged Â£ 5 notes which were printed by the nazis and intended to cause chaos for the british economy
in 2011 , a book published in germany claimed the room lies hidden in old mine workings in a forest in east germany
' the puzzle of poppen wood ' by ulbrich unleashed a fresh wave of treasure hunters who arrived at weekends with shovels , metals detectors and vast reserves of optimism to scour for the artwork
casualties of war : inhabitants of st petersburg ( now st petersburg ) flee after a german bomb attack in the winter of 1941 when the nazis seized the amber room during their assault on the city the catherine palace in st petersburg ( as seen in 2010 ) where the amber room is housed ulbrich interviewed foresters , policemen , miners and old nazis for his work which chronicles two decades of largely unreported quarrying in the wood near zwickau
gluba , a civil engineer and hobby historian on second world war , has triggered another amber room frenzy after researching wartime records of the town of auerswalde near chemnitz
auerswalde was the place where hitler built the two biggest guns in history - dora and gustav - both mighty railway mounted monsters capable of hurling shells weighing tons
as he probed into the history of the cannons he discovered plans for secret underground workings
then he found details of a clandestine shipment from the city of koenigsberg - now kaliningrad and part of russia but in 1945 the main city of germany 's province of prussian - which was the last known storage place of the amber room before it fell to the red army
art haul : the room was plundered by hitler 's nazis during the second world war prussian count sommes laubach , the german ' ' art protection officer ' and holder of a degree in art history , supervised the room 's transport to koenigsberg castle from the soviet union
in january 1945 , after air raids and a savage ground assault on the city , the room was lost
gluba found documents about an air raid on the marshalling yards of wroclaw - then german , now the polish city of wroclaw - on 4 february 1945
the army report stated that 40 wagons from koneigsberg , which had fallen days earlier to the red army , were undamaged in the attack and were moving down to auerswalde ' under conditions of the greatest secrecy
' gunter richter , now 80 , is an auerswalde resident who told glube that , as a child , he remembered in the muna forest outside the town a massive shelter built for munitions works employees that he went into as a boy
it vanished off of maps after the war but in march 2011 he and gluba managed to find a ventilation shaft that leads down into a subterranean structure they believe is the old shelter
they , and others , have still not managed to access it
many amber room purists believe the treasure lies in the jonas valley in what was the former german democrat republic
it is the most dangerous of the hunting grounds and draws scores of illegal searchers every weekend
the centre of the jonas valley is at ohrdruf and was the site of the s-iiifuhrer headquarters
it is a tunnel system many miles in length with thousands of caves , bunkers and storerooms
it was intended to be the alamo of the third reich leadership
us liberated it and us authorities have since classified all 1945 documents relating to ohrdruf for a minimum of 100 years
' like no other place in germany this wild canyon has ignited the fantasies of an international league of conspiracy theorists and treasure hunters , ' wrote der spiegel , germany 's top news magazine
both above and below ground , the area is littered with shells and bombs big enough to destroy a city block
at weekends authorities play cat - and - mouse with the treasure hunters who enter the sealed - off area illegally in ones and twos - and sometimes in mini-bus groups - armed with metal detectors and a belief in the stories
fortune hunter stade , author of ' amber rooms in thuringia and other hollow spaces , ' likes to guide treasure seekers through the jonas valley
stade believes that hitler had ufo - like flying saucers developed in bunkers at the site - as well as using one of the chambers as a repository for the amber room .
