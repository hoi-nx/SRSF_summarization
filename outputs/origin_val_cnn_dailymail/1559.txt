a woman has swapped playing combat computer games for fighting for real after shedding 19 stone
amy graham , 48 , from salt lake city , utah , weighed 470lb ( 33st ) at her heaviest and because she was a dress size 32 , she could only find men 's clothes to fit her
speaking of her weight gain , amy graham told mailonline : ' i have always been a big girl
i was a fat child , i was a fat teenager , i was a fat twentysomething
it 's surprisingly a much smaller amount than a normal - sized person
it 's more about poor choices really
eating something filled with fat and sugar instead of eating whole , natural foods
' i was an avid online gamer and that contributed to my sedentary lifestyle
i played various games for many years
' i stopped weighing myself at 450lbs because i could n't find a scale big enough to weigh me over that
i know that i probably got up to around 470lbs at one point , and that scared me
' i knew i never wanted to hit 500lbs in my lifetime
my dress size was probably a 32 at that point
i wore mostly men 's clothes at that time because they were easier to find
' amy graham used to struggle to find clothes to fit her when she was overweight , left , but now she 's fighting fit , right , and competes in medieval combat fighting using real swords when she turned 40 , amy graham realised she had to do something to change her lifestyle as her size meant she was suffering from a number of health problems
she and her husband , greg , had tried for a baby but she believes her weight meant she was never able to conceive
she said of her health at the time : ' i developed sleep apnoea to the point i could not be regulated
' i have pcos ( polycycstic ovaries syndrome ) , i had type 2 diabetes , i started to develop edema in my lower legs
' i carried all my weight in my middle region and because of that i was also getting lower back pain
' once i hit 40 , i knew things were only going to get worse for me
' amy graham decided to have gastric bypass surgery but to qualify , she would first have to lose weight

he needed room to work inside my abdomen , so i had to drop weight to even qualify for surgery
' i crash dieted to get the weight off to the point he was ok moving forward
it took me two months
' amy graham was than able to have the gastric bypass - and the operation was life - saving
' turns out having gastric bypass actually saved my life in ways i had no idea , ' she said
' when the doctor went in they found out that my liver was three times the size it should have been
' my surgery took more than nine hours instead of the two it normally takes , because they had to work around my enlarged liver
' my doctor came to me in recovery and told me that i needed to realise this surgery saved my life
amy graham pictured with her husband greg before her weightloss , left , and after , right ' if i had n't had it when i did , i would have been dead in two years because i would have needed a liver transplant and i would have never qualified to even be considered to be put on the list , much less be in any situation to get a new liver
' i could never have lost the weight by diet and exercise to have saved my life in time
that is a sobering thought
' so no matter what i crave , what i want to eat or drink now , i will always remember that my life would have been much shorter than even i expected had i not chosen this path
' following the surgery , amy graham lost 100lbs ( 7st ) in the first 100 days and continued to lose weight over the following years so she now weighs 204lbs ( 14st ) and is a dress size 12 - 14
her lifestyle is now completely different to how it used to be and she had discovered a love of exercise after becoming involved in an unusual sport - medieval combat fighting

explaining why she was attracted to the sport , amy graham explains : ' when i first saw a fight , something awoke inside of me and i knew i had to do this
' but i got told that because i was a girl , i was not allowed
but i was told in january 2012 that the usa team was going to start a league and that they would eventually allow women once we had enough interest
' i kept hoping and supporting the team and on may 31 , 2013 it was announced that for the first time women were going to be allowed to fight

now amy graham is keen to carry on her training and keep winning battles
she said of taking part in the contact sport : ' what 's it like to compete in the tournaments ? it is quite possibly the most adrenaline filled , satisfying , challenging yet amazing thing in the world for me
' i am proud to be a female fighter
but i am also proud to be treated with the respect and comradely just like any male fighter is
' i no longer look for excuses to not work out
i have a much harder time fitting everything into my world with my training schedule but i would n't trade my life for anything
' i love how my body works
i love being 48 - years - old and fighting women and men half my age
