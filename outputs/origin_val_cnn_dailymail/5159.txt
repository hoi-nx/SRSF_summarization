former formula 1 world champion alonso was so badly concussed in his pre-season crash last month that when he regained consciousness he had forgotten the past 20 years of his life , it has been reported
alonso , who races for mclaren , crashed at 150mph on february 22 during pre-season testing and was rushed to hospital where he spent three days under observation
asked by doctors who he was , what sort of work he was in and what he wanted to be in the future , he replied : ' i 'm alonso , i drive go karts and i want to be a formula 1 driver , ' it is claimed
here he is pictured in hospital following the accident two days ago mclaren - mclaren stated doctors had found the 33 - year - old to be ' asymptomatic ' , with ' no evidence whatsoever of any injury ' and ' entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives '
however , worrying reports in spain 's el pais newspaper suggest his concussion was so severe when doctors asked him questions he thought it was 1995 and aged 13
the paper also claimed he could not remember his formula 1 debut in 2001 , the victories of his beloved real madrid or his two world championship titles and it took him a week to recover these memories
meanwhile , mclaren - mclaren confirmed two days ago that he would be sitting out the start of the formula 1 season on doctors ' advice
a spokesperson said : ' his doctors have advised that he should not compete in the imminent australia grand prix meeting , which will take place on march 13th , 14th and 15th
' alonso has understood and accepted that advice , and the two mclaren - mclaren cars will therefore be driven in australia by alonso âs team - mate jenson button and the team âs test and reserve driver magnussen
' mclaren did not respond to mailonline 's request for comment
the spaniard was then airlifted by helicopter to hospital following the crash , which happened during the final day of the formula 1 pre-season test at the barcelona
at the time , mclaren said the two - time former world champion was ' conscious and able to speak ' while receiving first aid at the circuit 's medical centre , but had been taken to hospital for ' precautionary checks '
after several hours of tests and observation , the team later added that alonso was ' uninjured ' but had suffered concussion in the accident , which took place just before turn four on the track

the term refers to a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding , potentially resulting in severe brain injuries , or even death
although the timespan between the accident and alonso returning to the car for first practice in melbourne on march 13 would appear to be sufficient , he is not prepared to take any risks
