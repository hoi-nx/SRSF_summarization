most pregnant women ca nât help but feel apprehensive about the pain that they will experience when they give birth , but the consequences of not feeling anything at all are far more horrific
marie , 34 , did n't suspect a thing when her fourth child , eloise , came into this world in may , 2012
in fact , she thought that she had soiled herself
it was nât until she noticed her baby âs head dangling between her legs that she realised in horror that it was arriving four months too early
â marie , who lives in basildon , essex , with her husband andrew , 50 , had already had three children ; jack , nine , adam , eight , orla jane , four , by the time she fell pregnant with eloise
so she knew that when her waters broke just after 23 weeks of pregnancy that something was very wrong
she said : â i did n't expect it to be an early birth at all because my three other pregnancies were all full term
' i had been quite ill just a couple of weeks before , i had a very bad throat infection around 21 weeks pregnant , which turned into streptococcus a. â then ten days later i lost my mucus plug and i started wobbling â just three days later , my waters broke
â eloise in neonatal intensive care at portsmouth marie was rushed to basildon hospital but the staff there were unable to deal with babies born more prematurely than 27 weeks and instead arranged for her to be admitted to portsmouth hospital , two hours drive away
after administering her with an injection that helps babies to develop lungs in the womb quicker if they are at risk of premature birth , marie was taken by ambulance to portsmouth
eloise weighed just 1lb when she was born once there , marie had just two days to settle in before the shock birth occurred
she said : â i thought i had to go to the toilet - i thought i had been blocked for several days but unconsciously had not been wanting to let go because of the baby
â as i went into the bathroom , i thought i had defecated , but there was a mirror in front of the toilet and as i looked up , i saw this tiny little head between my legs , so i knew what was happening
â i pulled the emergency cord and within seconds , the midwives and the neonatal intensive care unit were there
â two of the midwives supported me while the third one helped to deliver eloise
â i did n't feel anything because she was so small
â she was as big as my hand , she fitted on my hand - she was really , really small
â luckily i was in hospital because she was given to the doctors within seconds and they put breathing tubes in her
â but being born so premature was nât the only battle facing eloise , she had also severely ill after picking up streptococcus a and b from her mother
marie said : â she was infected by the streptococcus a and b , because in the meantime i had also developed streptococcus b. â so , as she came out and we were n't prepared , she picked that up too
â she was pus - covered , she was smelly , she made no attempts to breathe and she also had two small bleeds in her brain - it did n't look very positive
â marie practised reiki and psychic surgery on her daughter alongside traditional medicines given by the nhs but while the future looked bleak for her daughter , marie , who works as a spiritual healer , says that as she was put back into her hospital bed and her baby was rushed to the intensive care unit , she was possessed by total calm
she said : â i had this spiritual calm come over me , knowing that i had to do the healing i 've learnt and that all would be well
â the comments from the doctor were n't good because that 's how the situation was , but i refused to have any negative dust in my mind
â as the doctors used their traditional medicine on eloise , marie supplemented it with reiki and what she called â psychic surgery â
she believes it was a combination of these two methods that enabled eloise to fight through
father andrew with his daughter eloise in hospital marie said : â i would do reiki , which is universal energy giving
â it was like her physical battery was very low and mine was full , so by putting my hands on her , i charged her battery
â it comes from my head , through my hands , into her body and this made her able to fight better and overcome everything
â i would also do psychic surgery , which is healing with the mind
â i would imagine her blood with the bacteria in it and imagine sucking it out of the blood , so i can see it flowing beautifully
â it 's all about the positive mind and intentions
â i strongly believe it was the collaboration between medical and spiritual healing that made her so good
â when eloise was taken home , she has to continue to be given oxygen after four months and two days in hospital , eloise was finally well enough to go home
doctors took the precaution of hooking eloise up to a portable oxygen tank for the following eight months
marie said : â she was on home oxygen but an incredibly small amount - 0.02 of home oxygen so a very low flow
â but that 's because it was in september and autumn was coming , so they took no risks
â it was quite difficult because a small baby is attached to oxygen anywhere you go
â you have a bottle underneath your pram and everyone is looking at you and wondering what 's wrong with your baby
â she was on that until april - a month before her first birthday and then she just came off it
â eloise is now a healthy two year old girl marie ( right ) with eloise , and her other children from left : adam , eight , jack , nine , and orla jane , four since then , the family have nât looked back â eloise is now as healthy as any other child her age
marie said : â she sailed through for a baby who had given birth ill and so early
â one in ten who are born that prematurely are healthy and have no long term problems , but she was n't just premature , she was also ill when she was born
â most children born at this age have chronic lung disease , but she has been followed up by the nhs incredibly well
the healing of the 1lb baby by marie â these micro preemies [ babies born before 26 weeks gestation ] are also at the risk of major eye problems , blindness , healing problems , growth problems and development problems in movement
' ' but the specialist told me even when she was one year old that she âs a miracle
â â she went to nursery when she was one year old and she has had no more coughs and colds than any other children
â â i saw the specialist in romford six months ago and she has fully caught up with her age group which is a miracle for that kind of baby
â i 'm 100 per cent convinced that it was the co-operation between the spiritual and medical
â she 's very special
' all of my children are special to me but when you go through something like that , it makes them extra special
