and this graphic shows how a â middle - class migration â is seeing affluent buyers leave kensington and chelsea in favour of chiswick and clapham
herne hill and kensal rise are the new â nappy valleys â , while well - off couples who can not afford to live where their parents did are heading to kilburn

but he told mailonline : â it can take a decade easily for these areas to go through a period of transformation - it tends to be a relatively long time
â mr cook added that buyers who want to be close to their friends but can not afford to live in a certain place will often move to neighbouring areas
