the national office of sae fraternity changed its tune
just two weeks ago , the national office condemned a racist chant that resulted in the shutdown of the ou sae chapter , saying , " the national fraternity does not teach such a racist , hateful chant , and this chant is not part of any education or training
" the fraternity brothers probably " learned the song from fellow chapter members , " sae said
but in a friday statement , the sae national office said otherwise
the ou chapter , sae said , " likely learned a racist chant while attending a national leadership school about four years ago
" the fraternity invites hundreds of leaders to a six - day conference every year , sae said
" while attendees have little social time , there are occasions when participants can gather socially , " the statement said
" [ executive director blaine ] ayers said it is likely that during one of these social gatherings , some members shared the racist song that was recorded on video at the ou and shared through social media earlier this month
" ayers said the organization has no evidence the chant is widespread across the fraternity 's 237 groups
" our investigation to date shows no evidence the song was widely shared across the broader organization , " ayers said
" the song is horrific and does not at all reflect our values as an organization
" but ou president boren , in revealing details of the university investigation on friday , said the chant was an integral part of life in the local chapter
" over time the chant was formalized in the local sae chapter and was taught to pledges as part of the formal and informal leadership process , " he said
" it is clear that during the four years since the chant was brought to the university campus , its existence was known by recent members and ... it became part of the institutionalized culture of the chapter
" boren said " alcohol was readily available at the fraternity house " on march 7 and some chapter members were drinking
he also said about a dozen high school students had been invited to the event and " were exposed to the chant
" the chant was discovered by the school newspaper and a student organization , which received the video clip via anonymous messages
the video shows party - bound students on a bus clapping , pumping their fists and laughing as they chant , " there will never be a ni * * * * sae
you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me
there will never be a ni * * * * sae
" the university cut ties with sae after the video surfaced , as did the national fraternity , and both launched investigations
the university has disciplined fraternity members with punishment ranging from permanent withdrawals to sensitivity training
fraternity officers have issued apologies
sae issued questions - and - answers about the controversy , noting the fraternity plans to hire a director of diversity and inclusion
about 20 % of sae members self - identify as a minority or non-caucasian , sae said .
