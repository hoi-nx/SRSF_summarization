new zealand are on course for a first ever world cup title after a thrilling semifinal victory over south africa , secured off the penultimate ball of the match
chasing an adjusted target of 298 in just 43 overs after a rain interrupted the match at eden park , grant elliott hit a six right at the death to confirm victory and send the auckland crowd into raptures
it is the first time new zealand has ever reached a world cup final , and it will play either australia or india on sunday
te pair face each other in sydney on thursday
not the first time in the sport , rain played a part
south africa were motoring with the bat before a two - hour delay for poor weather
though its total was escalated by the duckworth / lewis method -- used to calculate a revised target in the event of a rain delay -- new zealand held firm thanks to grant elliott
his 84 not out underpinned its innings and it was fitting that he delivered the final blow , smashing steyn for six off the second last ball to spark jubilant scenes at eden park
" i do n't think this win is for myself or the team , but everyone here , " grant elliott said at the post-match presentation
" the supporters have been amazing
" i think we timed the pace of the innings to perfection
i was n't as calm as i looked
when you have 45,000 fans screaming at you every ball ... " it has been an absolute pleasure playing in front of this crowd
we have had a good run
it is the first final we have been in as new zealand
" we are a very level team , we will approach it as any other game
nothing going in my mind when i hit the six
i do n't even know where the ball went
" south africa , who themselves have never reached the final , have been accused of choking in past installments of the one - day competition
but that indictment can not be leveled at it after one of the most dramatic matches in world cup history
it had recovered from 114 - 3 in the 27th over to 216 - 3 after 38 overs thanks to some fierce hitting from captain ab de villiers and faf du plessis , before the rain came
with the game stopped for two hours , it finally reached 281 off its reduced 43 overs , du plessis top scoring with 82
new zealand 's target was upgraded via duckworth / lewis , a calculation that takes into account how many overs were left and how many wickets had been lost , to 298
kiwi skipper mccullum got it off to a fast start with a 22 - ball half - century but after he was dismissed it wobbled , and needed 139 from 22 overs
but grant elliott was the steadying hand , judging his innings perfectly
and though he was dropped in the penultimate over , he struck the telling blow off steyn to seal victory and inflict a fourth semifinal defeat on south africa
" it was a great advertisement for cricket , " mccullum said at the post-match presentation
" everybody involved will remember this for the rest of their lives
" what a great innings from grant elliott
he came out of wilderness not long ago
the greatest time of our lives
we have enjoyed the experience
" i hope the crowds are all dreaming the way we are
gee it would be nice to win it
we do n't mind whom we face in the final
" they are both quality sides , but we know if we play the way we want to we are a good chance
" should australia beat india at the sydney cricket ground , then the joint hosts of the world cup will meet in the final in melbourne
" it was an amazing game of cricket , " ab de villiers said
" probably the most electric crowd i have ever heard in my life
i guess the best team has come out on top
we gave it our best
" we left it all out there
it is going to take a while to recover
the bigger picture is for the people back home
i hope they can still be proud of us
