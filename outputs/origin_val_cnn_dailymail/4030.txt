last year âs champions league finalists atletico are still in the champions league ... just
after 120 exhausting minutes diego simeone âs side won on penalties with fernando torres scoring the home side âs last spot - kick and kiessling missing his to put atletico through
the dramatic climax began with raul garcia blazing the first kick over the bar
substitute goalkeeper jan oblak saved hakan calhanoglu âs awful spot - kick hit low and straight down the middle to put the spaniards back in with a chance of progress

rolfes did likewise to level the scores and mario suarez scored his second goal of the night having put atletico ahead in normal time
when toprak put his kick nervously over the bar atletico looked to have the finish line in sight only for leno to save koke âs kick
gonzalo castro then scored but after fernando torres had snuck his penalty just inside leno âs right hand upright kiessling missed and the vicente calderon erupted with joy
atletico came into the game one goal down from the first leg and struggled to make in - roads early on with a koke free - kick not really testing leno
simone âs team knew one lapse on the break would need them leaving to score three and when son heugn-min was put through by lars bender on 22 minutes it was his miscontrol that prevented him getting a shot on target
as he came out to close down son , atletico goalkeeper miguel angel moya pulled a hamstring and had to be replaced by jan oblak
losing their keeper and having to use a substitute so early was a major set - back for diego simeone but four minutes later he was running along the touchline as atletico took the lead
cani headed the ball down for mario suarez and his shot through the crowded penalty area caught and went past leno to put the home side ahead on the night
with their next attack atletico could have got the all - important second goal but a brilliant tackle from wendell denied mandzukic
it was arda âs pefect through ball that put the croatian striker through but as he delayed his shot the brazilian defender clean swept the ball away from him to safety
it was brilliant defending but would any of atletico âs previous strikers â sergio aguero , radamel falcao , diego costa â have buried it before the defender could react ? probably yes
turkish midfielder arda turan ( right ) was unable to watch the action during the penalty shootout diego simeone was forced to make an early substitution following the injury for no 1 goalkeeper miguel angel moya gimenez ( left ) was shown a yellow card for this late challenge on hakan calhanoglu gimenez and his atleti team - mates plead innocence as referee nicola rizzoli shows the defender a yellow card mario suarez ( left ) strikes from the edge of the box to put atleti into a 1 - 0 lead and level the aggregate scoreline to 1 - 1 against leverkusen atletico : raul garcia-misses leverkusen : chalonoglu-misses atletico : scores leverkusen : rolfes - scores atletico : mario suarez - scores leverkusen : toprak-misses atletico : koke-misses leverkusen : castro-scores atletico : torres-scores leverkusen : kiessling - misses final score : atletico 3 - 2 leverkusen battering ram mandzukic perhaps has other qualities but he was battered himself just before half time and left the pitch limping at the break
surprisingly when the two teams emerged for the second half he was still on the pitch and diego simeone had taken off cani and put on raul garcia
the midfield so nearly turned the ball past leno from koke âs cross in atletico âs best chance of the second half
koke had been inspirational throughout as atletico took the game to leverkusen
and as the clock showed 20 minutes of normal time left the crowd responded by cranking up the vicente calderon noise levels
it spurred the team on and griezmann hurtled down the left and crossed for arda turan who flicked the ball behind him where there was no runner to finish the move
griezmann then crossed again for arda turan and this time he got his shot away only for leno to save
raul garcia went down in the area under a challenge from toprak but the referee waved away appeals
raul garcia stayed down , simone urged him to get up and turned to atletico supporters once more to lift his team
everyone in the vicente calderon got a lift with eight minutes left when fernando torres was roared on to the pitch to replace mandzukic
could fernando torres win the game for them ? video simeone proud to again be in europe 's elite mario suarez 's 27th - minute finish took a large deflection which leverkusen goalkeeper leno was unable to stop the 28 - year - old midfielder wheels away in celebration of his first half effort at the vicente calderon stadium arda turan makes the most of the celebrations as mario suarez is congratulated by atletico defender miranda ( right ) the atleti players smother mario suarez in front of the home fans following the first goal of the game atletico boss diego simeone sprints down the touchline after watching mario suarez give the home side a first half lead real madrid , porto , bayern munich , paris saint-germain , monaco , atletico wednesday : barcelona ( 2 ) vs man city ( 1 ) ; borussia dortmund ( 1 ) vs juventus ( 2 ) with the match still on a knife - edge hakan calhanoglu upended jesus gamez and became the third leverkusen player to be booked
atletico had also picked up three yellow cards and there was no let - up as the clock ticked down
wendal became the seventh player to be booked when he chopped down fernando torres as he charged down the right with a minute left
the free - kick came to nothing but fernando torres kept going and forced a corner but koke âs near - post kick was cleared and the referee blew for full time
kiessling was booked at the start of extra time â the germans team âs fifth on the night â and they then had to take off the injured lars bender replacing him with kyriakos papadopoulos
fernando torres was still stretching the opposition and with leverkusen on the back foot a stinging shot from raul garcia was pushed away for a corner by leno but over the two legs the germans had proved as good at defending them as atletico at taking them
with five minutes to go fernando torres so nearly won it with a diving header from koke âs cross
there was direction on the effort but not enough power to beat leno
it did nât matter , he scored his penalty and his dream of reaching another champions league final - this time with his home town club - lives on
