a congresswoman has come underfire after her bad parking was caught on camera
democrat eleanor holmes norton , 77 , who represents by the district of columbia , was secretly filmed on wednesday morning as she drove into a spot on capitol hill at the wrong angle
instead of pushing forwards at 45 - degrees , she blindly performed a perpendicular maneuver
as a result , the back and front ends of her car were almost touching other vehicles , while her bumper also rested well over the curb
but he decides there is little he can do to help the situation and goes over to help norton out of the silver sedan instead
as he strolls to the driver 's door , around the 40 - second mark , a u.s. capitol police officer zooms by on a motorcycle apparently oblivious to the parking offense
norton , a yale alumni , then locks her car and walks away
but before getting too far she stops and returns to her vehicle
it looks like she might have spotted her bad parking
however , it transpires that she 's merely forgotten something
after retrieving the possession she locks up and walks off
in the spotlight : norton is a delegate to the u.s congress representing the district of columbia the tipster who filmed the incident can be head tutting in the background
' eleanor holmes norton is struggling to park her car right now and she has hit that red car next to her ... repeatedly , ' the unidentified man says
' if she parks like that , she should not be in congress
' to date the clip , leaked by the political website roll call , has been watched more than 74,000 times
many viewers have questioned norton 's political ability after seeing her behind the wheel
a spokesperson from the widowed mother - of - two 's office told roll call that there was no harm caused from the not - so - great parking job ' after the congresswoman parked her car , we assessed the cars on either side to see if there was any damage
we could not find any
' but we left a note with a business card so the congresswoman could be contacted in case we missed any
