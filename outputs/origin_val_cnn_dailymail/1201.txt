deco is part of an elite group of players to have won the champions league twice - with jose mourinho 's porto in 2004 and with barcelona in 2006
the portuguese also played in europe 's elite club competition with chelsea , playing a total of 103 matches in europe and scoring 19 goals
looking back over his career , the playmaker here selects his dream team of leading players to have graced the champions league
deco scores for porto against monaco in the 2004 champions league final in gelsenkirchen deco ( centre ) then lifted the champions league with barcelona two years later the portuguese star celebrates with didier drogba during his time at chelsea goalkeeper neuer when i was playing in europe he was not so well known , but he has turned into the best i have ever seen
his performances for both germany and bayern munich are exceptional
neuer makes a penalty save from ronaldo in the 2012 champions league semi-final defenders puyol was such a leader for barcelona
that is not to take anything away from his ability as a defender , but he was as important in the dressing room as he was on the field
barcelona legend puyol lifts the champions league after their win over manchester united in the 2009 final john terry very similar to how puyol was for barcelona , john terry was the leader of chelsea and is still doing it now
when he does decide to retire , he will be so hard for chelsea to replace
john terry lifts the famous trophy after chelsea 's win over bayern munich in 2012 ricardo carvalho one of my best moments is winning the champions league with him , then it was great to play with him again all those years later at chelsea
without doubt he is the classiest defender i have ever played with
ricardo carvalho carries pedro mendes after porto 's triumph in the 2004 champions league final midfield diego simeone diego simeone was a really tough competitor ; he would always let you know he was there
he was nât just tough though , he had a really excellent range of passing
diego simeone guided atletico madrid to the champions league final last season scholes it is not coincidence so many professionals talk so highly of scholes
of course he is one of the best midfield players of my champions league , but also i think you can call him one of the best midfield players in the history of the game
scholes won the champions league for the second time when manchester united beat chelsea in 2008 xavi at the peak of barcelona he was at the centre of everything that was good about barcelona
maybe the other players got more headlines , but xavi was the catalyst for it all
xavi takes on manchester united 's ryan giggs during the 2011 final at wembley zinedine zidane the one player of my generation i wish i could have played with
just a fantastic player in every single way
zinedine zidane scores his famous volley as real madrid beat bayer leverkusen in the 2002 final attack messi messi is a natural born talent , that is not to say he does nât work hard , but you ca nât teach what he can do him and ronaldo are actually i think very different , but at the moment they are the two best in the world
messi lifts the trophy for the third time after barcelona 's 2011 win over manchester united ronaldo what a lot of people do nât see is just how hard ronaldo has worked to get where he is , he is the ultimate professional
of course he has natural ability , but not many people know how hard he has worked to be voted the best player in the world
ronaldo celebrates after scoring for real madrid in last season 's champions league final ronaldinho i always remember when we ( barcelona ) would go two or three goals up , and ronny would start to enjoy himself
he done things that you just think are not possible with a football , he is the best i have ever played with
ronaldinho celebrates scoring for barcelona in a 2006 champions league tie with werder bremen former chelsea midfielder deco has selected his champions league xi
