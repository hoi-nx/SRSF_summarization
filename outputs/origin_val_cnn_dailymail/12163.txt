in an audio message purportedly from an isis spokesman , the group announced that a pledge of allegiance from nigeria - based boko haram has been accepted by isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi
the 28 - minute message , which can not be independently authenticated by cnn , was posted online by isis supporters
the message says that the caliphate , or islamic state , has expanded to western africa and congratulated " our jihadi brothers " there
the spokesman , abu mohammed al adnani , encourages people to join fighters in africa if they can not make it to iraq or syria
boko haram 's leader , abubakar shekau , announced in an audio message last week that the islamist terror group was going to ally with isis
zenn , a terror expert who lives in nigeria , told cnn on saturday the alliance would make sense for both groups
" boko haram will get legitimacy , which will help its recruiting , funding and logistics as it expands , " zenn said
" it will also get guidance from isis in media warfare and propaganda
previously boko haram was a sort of outcast in the global jihadi community
now it is perhaps isis 's biggest affiliate
" isis gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate
" boko haram , whose name translates as " western education is sin , " has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of sharia law
boko haram 's tactics have intensified in recent years , from battling nigeria government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages , mass kidnappings , assassinations , market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques
much of this violence has taken place in nigeria
but neighboring countries , such as cameroon and chad , have also been hit increasingly hard
what boko haram 's pledge of allegiance to isis means cnn 's paul cruickshank contributed to this report .
