the spokesperson for the missouri auditor 's office has taken his life - just a month after his boss , schweich , took his own life amid claims he was being politically bullied
jackson , 44 , took a sick day on friday and shot himself either friday night or early saturday , authorities said on monday
his body was found in his bedroom on sunday during a well - being check around 7pm after his mother called police when she was unable to reach him
a gun was found near his body
police spokesman captain shoemaker said that investigators also found a note in jackson 's apartment , but he declined to detail what it said
his death comes weeks after his boss , schweich , shot himself dead minutes after telling a reporter he wanted to go public with allegations he was being bullied by fellow gop
police said there was no physical evidence of a forced entry or struggle , but that an autopsy is planned for monday and detectives are continuing to investigate the case
schweich , who launched his gop gubernatorial campaign in january and was considered a frontrunner , was targeted by state gop chairman hancock , according to his supporters
hancock allegedly told people that schweich - who was christian but had jewish ancestry - was jewish with the implication that it was a negative attribute in a gubernatorial campaign
the auditor had expressed angst to friends that he believed he was the victim of ' an anti-semitic whispering campaign '
on february 26 , he shot himself at his clayton home just minutes after telling an associated press reporter about the tactics
schweich , 54 , left behind his wife kathleen and their two young children , emilie and thomas

just moments earlier , he told reporters he wanted to go public with the bullying claims at his funeral days later , former u.s. sen. john danforth , an episcopal priest , suggested during his eulogy that schweich had been driven to kill himself by political bullying
some schweich supporters called on hancock to resign or for the gop state committee to remove him
jackson was among those who had called for hancock 's resignation
but a week ago , clayton police detective lt. bass said schweich left behind no suicide note and that detectives have found no evidence that he was the target of political bullying
' i think everybody 's looking for a rational reason for an irrational act ... but right now we 're not finding anything , ' bass said , adding that based on ' the leads and sources that we have heard from , we have not been able to prove that there was a whispering campaign '
hancock has also denied the allegation and said that he has received support from the state committee to continue in his role
