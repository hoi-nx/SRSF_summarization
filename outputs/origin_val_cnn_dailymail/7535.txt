a foreign mother who was jailed for stabbing her baby has been granted the right to stay in uk
the bangladeshi woman , who can not be named , served five years for attempted murder in 2009 after she attacked her daughter in the midst of a marital breakdown
on her release , a tribunal decided not to deport her â as is usually the case with foreign criminals â so she could still see the child
the bangladeshi woman , from tower hamlets , east east london , who served five years for attempted murder in 2009 , has been allowed to remain in the uk after the court of appeal ruled it was a ' truly exceptional â case the government appealed but the woman , of tower hamlets , east london , was yesterday granted leave to remain
court of appeal judge lord justice pitchford said the case was â truly exceptional â
he said : ' the circumstances of the offence , the bitter suffering of [ the mother ] following the offence and the clear benefit to the victim of the offence of continued face to face contact with her mother rendered this case truly exceptional
' in short , despite the generic public interest in deportation of foreign criminals , there was no public interest in further punishing the victim of the crime
' in my view , the combined circumstances of the crime and its consequences were exceptional and the tribunal was entitled to conclude that separation , which was likely to be permanent , would be cruel both to the offender and to the victim
' the judge heard the appeal with lord justice sullivan and lady justice king , who both agreed with the decision
