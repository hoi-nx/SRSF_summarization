the march toward publication of another book by the reclusive " to kill a mockingbird " author continues forward
many people who know her have raised questions about 88 - year - old lee 's ability to consent to publish another book , while others have said she knows what she 's doing , according to a new york times report
alabama officials have found lee wants to publish the book
since lee wrote " to kill a mockingbird " in 1960 , she had steadfastly refused to publish another book
lee now lives in an assisted living facility in monroeville , alabama , and some friends say her forgetfulness makes her unable to knowingly consent to publishing the book , " go set a watchman
" after receiving an anonymous complaint of elder abuse about lee , the state of alabama sent investigators from the securities commission to talk to her and others around her
" it was clear to our investigators that she fully understood the questions that were being asked , that she indicated she certainly wanted her book published , and she had her opinions that were voiced during the interview , " borg , the agency 's director , told cnn
" and at that point we decided that she certainly knew what was going on
" lee wrote " go set a watchman " before " to kill a mockingbird , " and it features some of the same characters
lee lawyer tonja b. carter found the " go set a watchman " draft in the author 's belongings in august and negotiated a publishing deal with harpercollins
for now , " go set a watchman " is still scheduled to be released by harpercollins in july
the securities commission investigation is closed
" should something come up a later date that shows something was wrong , which we have no indication of , we could take another look , " borg said
" but since we had no complaint from the person who in the middle of it all , so there was no reason to maintain the case open
