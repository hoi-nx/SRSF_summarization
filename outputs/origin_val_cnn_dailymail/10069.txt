if recent pictures are anything to go by , taylor and calvin harris are set to become pop 's biggest power couple
after a month of rumours about a possible romance , the twosome were spotted hanging out in whole foods in nashville , tennessee earlier this week
but if 31 - year - old calvin is to become the new mr taylor then he should be aware that he might end up becoming the subject of one of her songs
taylor herself even admits that her relationships do inspire her musically
however , she 's always careful not to go into specifics

joe jonas actually wrote an open letter about the situation saying : ' for those who have expressed concern over the â 27 - second â phone call â¦ i called to discuss feelings with the other person
' those feelings were obviously not well - received
i did not end the conversation
' phone calls can only last as long as the person on the other end of the line is willing to talk
a phone call can be pretty short when someone else ends the call
' the only difference in this conversation was that i shared something the other person did not want to hear
there were later attempts at communication that had no response

' i 'm pretty good at taking accountability now and i never did anything to deserve that
it was a really lousy thing for her to do
