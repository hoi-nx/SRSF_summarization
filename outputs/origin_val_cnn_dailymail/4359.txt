' mrs caroline , who now has three children , daisy , six , tizzy , four , and teddy , two , with husband andy , 37 , a warehouse manager , said she was embarrassed by what her daughter saw when she looked at her 19 - stone mother
she said : â it was so embarrassing when i saw the picture that daisy had drawn
i did nât realise that my children saw me as looking so huge
' caroline , 33 , used to weigh nearly 19 stone ( left ) but was shocked into losing seven stone ( right ) after her daughter drew a picture of her as a ' fat blob ' despite having broken a chair just by sitting on it while pregnant , caroline says it was the embarrassment of seeing a drawing by daughter daisy ( left drawing in picture ) , which really gave her the motivation she needed to lose weight caroline continued : â i got so tired running around after them all the time , my weight meant that i could nât keep up with them properly at all , which did upset me
' when i saw that picture i knew that i really had to do something about losing weight
' though it was n't the first sign that her weight was getting out of hand , caroline admits it was the trigger she needed
she said : â i âd tried to push it to the back of my mind
with three young children to look after , my own appearance was nât a priority , but my health was suffering too
' when i was 12 weeks pregnant with teddy i actually broke a kitchen chair
i âd sat down on it , and it completely gave way beneath my weight
' the mother of three , pictured here with son teddy , two , and daughters daisy ( left ) , six , and tizzy ( right ) , four , says that she now feels like a completely different person after dropping five dress sizes before her weight loss caroline used to skip breakfast , and snack on bread and crisps all day
instead of home - cooked dinners , she says she 'd eat takeaways several times a week with husband adam she continued : â this drawing really brought it home to me
i did nât want my children drawing pictures of their fat mummy anymore
' before she changed her diet , caroline ate crisps and up to three sandwiches or sausage rolls for lunch , before gorging on pizza and takeaways for dinner
she said : ' my diet was awful before
' i âd completely skip breakfast then have lots of bread and crisps or sausage rolls for lunch ' drawing of caroline before weight loss , left , and drawing of her after the diet , right she continued : ' we would have takeaways several times a week too and i just snacked on crisps all the time
â when i started on the diet i still had takeaways but in moderation and i would snack on low fat crisps , fruit and yoghurt instead
â after seeking help from her local weight watchers group , caroline says she started to lose the pounds quickly
swapping her old diet for low fat cereal with skimmed milk at breakfast , and homemade , healthier lunches , caroline has now dropped five dress sizes and weighs a much lighter 12 stone
she said : â everything has totally changed since i âve lost all this weight , i feel like a completely different person
' i feel so much healthier and i âve got much more energy to run around and look after the children now
' andy says its like having a new wife
he âs very proud of me ' left picture : daisy and caroline with the two pictures of caroline as a slim mother ( left drawing ) and a larger mother ( right drawing ) , right picture : caroline holds up the pictures she continued : â my children draw pictures of me now looking lovely and slim
' i âm no longer a fat mummy , instead i âm a yummy mummy
â despite all the praise from her husband however , along with being able to fit into slinkier , more fashionable clothes , caroline says it was the first drawing from daisy of her as a slimmer woman , which really gave her the reward she was looking for
she said : ' when i saw that new picture that daisy had drawn , i felt very proud of what i had achieved
' i ca nât believe that i managed to lose so much weight
' ' it was only a child âs drawing but it meant the world to me
' caroline says it was the first drawing from daisy ( left ) of her as a slimmer woman , which really gave her the reward she was looking for .
