the brownsville , texas federal judge who blocked president obama 's executive action on immigration has ordered the justice department to answer allegations that the government misled him about part of the plan
us district judge hanen on monday denied the obama administration 's request to lift a time - out he enforced on feb. 16 , when he ruled that a lawsuit filed by 26 states might succeed
his order was designed , he said , to prevent a situation that could n't be undone if it were declared unconstitutional
it also seemed to fire a shot across the white house 's bow , blaming the administration for failing to keep illegal immigrants out of the country
hot seat : president obama , seen tuesday signing the ' student aid bill of rights ' law in the oval office , faces the possibility that his immigration plans will die in federal court here comes the judge : federal jurist hanen is calling the obama administration on the carpet about the president 's immigration plan ' the court finds that the government 's failure to secure the border has exacerbated illegal immigration into this country , ' hanen ruled in february , saying that states were being financially ' drained by the constant influx of illegal immigrants
' his stay will remain in place for at least another 10 days , pending a march 19 hearing where the justice department will have tough questions to answer
last week the government 's lawyers admitted in a paper filing that the obama administration had already granted three - year deportation reprieves to 100,000 people , and granted them work permits , as part of the 2012 daca ( daca ) program
that program 's guidelines provided only for two - year reprieves , unlike obama 's latest executive actions
plaintiff : texas gov. greg abbott is spearheading the lawsuit along with 25 other governors justice department attorneys had previously told hanen that the federal government would n't accept daca requests with longer timeframes until feb. 18
the judge 's order came on the 16th , legally prohibiting them from issuing any three - year permits
the president 's more recent attempt to mainstream illegal immigrants , announced in november , will cover 5 million or more people and will ultimately go into force unless the judiciary blocks it
the group of 26 states suing to stop obama 's immigration plan argue in their legal complaint that the government falsely claimed it had n't implemented any part of the november plan before hanen blocked it
hanen 's injunction had no effect on the daca program , but his demand for a new hearing suggest he 's looking at that program in addition to obama 's more recent executive actions , which concern illegal immigrant parents of us citizens born in the us , and other permanent residents who have been in the country for years
the government has asked him to lift the stay completely while they appeal it to the 5th u.s. court of appeals in new orleans , or at least to limit the impact of his decisions to texas
with monday 's ruling , that wo n't happen until at least march 19
anger : conservatives have bristled at the idea of the white house tossing border security overboard in favor of letting 5 million or more illegal immigrants stay demands : more than 11 million illegal immigrants are living in the us , including millions who were brought to us as children and many born here to illegal immigrant mothers advocates on both sides of the immigration fight told the times on tuesday that hanen is seen as a fairminded jurist
' that gentleman is constantly hearing the prosecution of drug cartel violence in his courtroom , ' democratic state rep. eddie lucio iii told the times
' when he says we need to have proper border enforcement , it âs because he sees the worst of it
' and a houston trial lawyer who was among hanen 's law school classmates said that he supports the white house 's position ' 100 percent
' but still , he said , ' i would disagree with anyone who would say andy hanen has any prejudice
his decisions will always be based on sound legal grounds
' another classmate , u.s. court of appeals judge priscilla owen , sits on the 5th circuit panel that will likely hear the case next .
