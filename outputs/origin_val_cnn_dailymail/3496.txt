phil jones played as a deep - lying midfielder , but it did nât feel like a midfielder âs performance
he was embarrassed by giorgio chiellini for their goal , and he was lucky to get away with losing his man at the previous set - piece
when england were in possession , he did nât work hard enough to get on the ball â he was happy to let smalling bring the ball out
manchester united defender phil jones failed to impress after being handed a midfield role phil jones ( right ) returns to the centre circle after playing a part in conceding italy 's opening goal roy hodgson 's ' experiment ' of playing phil jones as a deep central midfielder did n't pay dividends read martin samuel 's full match report from the juventus stadium out of possession , he often flew out in an attempt to deal with the danger
this is fine when he wins the ball , but a very risky tactic
in fairness , he dropped back nicely in between the centre halves regularly , which is clearly what he feels comfortable doing
the main problem is that he has a habit of chasing the ball when he ca nât win it
he looks like he âs been fired out of a cannon ! he âll need to assess situations better and hold his position in front of the back four
sir alex ferguson famously labelled phil jones the next edwards , but he did nât look very edwards - like
at 23 , it feels like we âre still trying to figure out his best position
he is being asked to play a role that needs to be filled by a more technically - proficient player â like andrea pirlo
wayne rooney looked excellent against italy , like the elder statesman leading his younger team - mates
he does everything with intelligence and showed his quality with 30 - yard diagonal balls and a fine effort against the crossbar
wayne rooney stepped to the fore in his role as captain and was unlucky not to score in turin england captain showed a good understanding with kane on their first start together he also linked up really well with kane , especially in the second half
it looked like they had a kind of telepathic togetherness
i âm sure that will be something roy hodgson will be keen to see more of in the future
it âs interesting how , recently , strike partnerships have seemed like a thing of the past , but wayne rooney and kane demonstrated they have an excellent understanding and play like a pair , not individuals
phil jagielka shows why he 's still valuable to roy hodgson when you look at phil jagielka âs rise in international football , it has been completely without fanfare
he had a couple of hairy moments , but still looked the best defender on show in turin , weighing in with countless clearances and blocks
he also reads the game very well
everton centre - back phil jagielka proved he is england 's best defender with a fuss - free performance phil jagielka fared better than fellow defender smalling who was forced to withdraw after feeling unwell he was relegated to the championship with sheffield united in 2007 and bought by everton , where he took a while to mature
but right now , he looks better than smalling and phil jones , who have had a lot more hype surrounding their breakthroughs into the england squad
phil jagielka was left out against lithuania , but showed he should still be first - choice
substitute andros townsend rescued england with a late super strike to earn a draw
