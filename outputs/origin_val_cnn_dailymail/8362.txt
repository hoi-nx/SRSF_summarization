when a legendary figure like pat jennings says none of the other 1,097 matches in his career was comparable with the 1979 fa cup final between arsenal and united , you know it was something special
forever known as wembley 's ' five - minute final ' , arsenal threw away and then regained the trophy in an incredible late sequence that saw them squander a 2 - 0 lead going into the 86th minute before winning 3 - 2 in the final moments with a goal that put alan sunderland 's name in fa cup folklore
it created a superstar in arsenal 's man - of - the - match brady and broke the career of united manager sexton

rice recalls : ' prince charles was there to present the trophy
he said , ' congratulations ' as we shook hands but as soon as i saw the cup , i turned around to lift it up to the arsenal fans
' i did n't realise he was still waiting to give me my medal
it was only when i turned back , i saw him with it in his hand
it must have looked insulting but it was n't meant like that
eager is the polite way of putting it
just a couple of minutes before i 'd been out on the pitch thinking ' f * * * , we 've blown it '
' mcilroy , who had scored united 's dramatic equaliser on a baking hot may afternoon , says the impact of the game has not diminished with time
' it 's 36 years on and people still ask me about it every week , ' he adds ruefully
' they always want to know about that final rather than the one we won against liverpool two years earlier
' united and arsenal meet again in the fa cup on monday in a quarter - final at old trafford but it is impossible that wayne rooney and alexis sanchez will grip the nation like their predecessors did
' there has not been a final before or since with the twists and turns of that game , ' says brady , who helped set up the winning goal when arsenal were on their knees reeling from mcilroy 's equaliser
' i played two short of 1,100 games and i have never known four minutes like that , ' adds pat jennings , a gentle giant of a goalkeeper who otherwise stayed unflappable in a 23 - year career with watford , spurs , arsenal and northern ireland
mcilroy ( left ) scored united 's equaliser against arsenal in the dramatic 79 cup final alexis sanchez ( left ) of arsenal and wayne rooney ( right ) of united will lock horns on monday the 1979 showpiece took place eight days after margaret thatcher had been elected great britain 's first female prime minister and given the prestige of the fa cup final in those days , the two events seemed equally important at the time
a full house of 100,000 and a tv audience of 15 million was guaranteed
united travelled to their team hotel a full three days before the match to fulfil the insatiable demands of the press , photographers and television cameras , with bbc and itv planning their entire saturday schedules around the final
then , as now , arsenal and united were big clubs in transition
arsenal had not won a trophy for eight years , while united were rebuilding after the glory days of best , denis law and bobby charlton
they had been relegated to the second division five years earlier
both sets of supporters flocked down wembley way convinced good times were about to return for their club
for 85 minutes , the match appeared routine , with brian talbot scoring for arsenal after 12 minutes and frank stapleton adding to it with a 43rd - minute header
the only talking point was over who should be credited with the opening goal â brian talbot or sunderland , who appeared to connect at the same time
' i know it was mine
i 've got a picture on my trophy cabinet showing me kicking the ball and alan sunderland kicking my boot , ' says brian talbot
with arsenal leading 2 - 0 going into the final minutes , complacency crept in
' it was unprofessional but i met eyes with brady as if to say , ' yes , we 've won it ' , ' says rix
' we were coasting , comfortable , ' adds brian talbot
even the experienced pat jennings says : ' i was imagining myself going up the steps
' brian talbot ( right ) opened the scoring for arsenal after only 12 minutes in the cup final against united gordon mcqueen ( fifth left ) pulled a goal back in the 86th minute to give united hope then , with just five minutes left , arsenal boss neill decided to send on substitute walford for david price as a thank - you for his performances in earlier rounds
out of nowhere , in the 86th minute , gordon mcqueen drove in a loose ball from a set piece to make it 2 - 1
just 106 second later , mcilroy jinked past david o'leary and walford before toepoking past an onrushing jennings to equalise
pandemonium ensued in the stadium as arsenal fell apart
' i knew the cameras were on me so i put on my best acting , trying to look concerned but not terribly worried , ' says neill
' in reality , my insides were going up and down
' reflecting now , mcilroy says : ' the arsenal boys were gone , on their knees
if we 'd taken it into extra-time , we would have won
' i went crazy , i could have run out of wembley and back in again after that goal
after the game , bob bishop [ the scout from northern ireland who discovered both mcilroy and best ] told me we 'd celebrated too long , we should have gone back to the halfway line and concentrated
' he was probably right but it was not what we wanted to hear after throwing it away
' at 2 - 2 , united were now red - hot favourites but what happened from the restart is part of fa cup legend
brady surged into the united half past thomas , then past lou macari , and slipped a ball to rix on the left
frank stapleton in possession for arsenal in the cup final against united at wembley in 1979 brady ( left ) , frank stapleton ( centre ) and david o'leary ( right ) were in arsenal 's winning squad rix , a 21 - year - old from a south yorkshire pit village , delivered a cross that arced away from united goalkeeper gary bailey , leaving sunderland the chance to score from close - range
the picture of the bouffant - haired forward running away in total ecstasy chased by the most - relieved substitute in history , walford , remains an iconic image
' when i picked up the ball , i was initially just trying to get the ball away from our goal , ' says brady
' i went past one challenge , two challenges and i was in the final third and i saw rix outside me
' rix takes up the story
' i did n't know sunderland was at the far post , my only thought was to take the cross away from the goalkeeper
it was something i 'd trained on with [ coach ] don howe all those wet and windy wednesday nights : keep it out of the keeper 's grasp
' sunderland says : ' i went into auto - pilot and when the ball went it , the pent - up emotion came out
' just two minutes , 59 seconds had elapsed between the three goals and history had been made
more than 250,000 arsenal fans greeted the team 's heroes in islington the following day
the arsenal players collected bonuses nearly three times their Â£ 1,000 - a - week wages but for some the long - term rewards turned out to be far greater
brady 's performances against juventus in the following season 's european cup - winners ' cup persuaded the italian giants to sign him and he blazed a trail for many other first division stars like ray wilkins and paul gascoigne to go to serie a. for united , being a runner - up was not good enough and sexton was sacked within two years
' he was unlucky , if we 'd won the final , he would have been given more time , ' says thomas , a comment that will be of interest to louis van gaal
more than 250,000 supporters came out to greet arsenal the day after their fa cup triumph arsenal parade the trophy around wembley after securing a dramatic victory over united arsenal 's class of ' 79 still meet up for reunions at the emirates and rice will be at old trafford tomorrow with the club 's board of directors
' i still remember the elation , ' says the former arsenal captain
' when sundy scored , i thought , ' right , we 're not going to bloody lose this again '
' if monday 's tie produces just a quarter of the late drama of ' 79 , it will be a thriller .
