six weeks into the murder trial of former nfl star hernandez , jurors in fall river , massachusetts , are getting more pieces of a time line leading up to the 2013 shooting death of odin lloyd , a semi-pro football player who was dating the sister of hernandez 's fiancÃ©e
taking center stage this week -- videotape never before seen in public , taken from hernandez 's own home security system
prosecutors are using that grainy footage to suggest hernandez is holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind police say was used to kill odin lloyd
hernandez is seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after odin lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from hernandez ' boston home
" in my opinion , the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol , " glock sales manager aspinwall testifies
hernandez , wallace , and ortiz are seen on the same security video , recorded at about 3:30 a.m. on june 17 , 2013 , after the men walk into hernandez 's home
all three have been charged with murder in the death of odin lloyd and have pleaded not guilty
wallace and ortiz are being tried separately
the video is time - stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say odin lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car driven by hernandez
jurors lean forward in their chairs , peering into monitors and scribbling notes as aspinwall , a former massachusetts state trooper and new hampshire police chief , takes them frame by frame through video during two days of testimony
aspinwall tells jurors hernandez appears to be holding the pistol by its muzzle as he 's standing at his basement door
the defense will have none of it
they attack aspinwall 's credentials
aspinwall is well - schooled in glocks but admits he does n't consider himself a gun identification expert
hernandez 's lawyers then show a different part of the video time - stamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appears to be a shiny object in one hand , suggesting it may be an ipad
" glock pistols do n't have white glows to them , do they ? " defense attorney sultan asks
" no , they do not , " aspinwall answers
sultan then displays a soft - pellet gun similar in shape to a glock , suggesting it could also be the object hernandez is holding
" are you aware of anybody going pellet gun shooting at 3:30 in the morning ? " bristol county assistant district attorney patrick bomberg asks aspinwall
university of new hampshire law professor michael mccann calls the glock expert 's findings powerful ; yet , he thinks the defense did a solid job of raising questions about the fuzzy video
" the jury might think that the defense is just throwing things against the wall , " he says
" but on the other hand , the jury may feel like it could be one of a dozen things
" one thing not in dispute : the alleged murder weapon remains missing
so does a solid motive
prosecutors could be laying the groundwork for showing more surveillance video of hernandez -- who at the time was a star receiver for the patriots -- partying with odin lloyd and hernandez 's personal barber at rumor nightclub two nights before odin lloyd 's death
investigators say hernandez was angry that odin lloyd was talking to some people that night
hernandez and odin lloyd are not seen together on a camera pointed at the club 's bar , and they appear to be separated for a time when they leave , but so far there 's no testimony about what may have gone wrong
what might hernandez 's fiancÃ©e say ? akil joseph , a longtime friend of odin lloyd 's who takes the stand , tells jurors he talked with odin lloyd at the club and says he appeared " normal
" when azil joseph leaves the stand , he keeps his eyes locked on hernandez until he walks past the defense table
cameras show hernandez leaving the bar , but they do not show the moment when a parking valet testified he saw what he believed to be a gun in hernandez 's waistband
the valet 's hotel security boss tells jurors he did n't see a weapon under the football player 's shirt
near the club , hernandez is in his suv with odin lloyd and another friend
hernandez offers a ride to fortier , his babysitter , who happened to be nearby with a friend
fortier tells jurors hernandez and odin lloyd were smoking pot. despite her objections , hernandez drives her and the friend to hernandez 's so - called " flophouse " about 20 minutes from gillette stadium , the patriots ' home field in foxborough
fortier testifies that hernandez " tried kissing me
" " i told him ' no , i 'm your nanny
i ca n't do this , ' " she adds
" he said he understood ... and he was n't mad at me
