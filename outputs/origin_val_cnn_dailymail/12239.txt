he 's a virtual unknown to american audiences , but corden proved he had what it takes as a late night host
corden 's debut as the fourth host of cbs ' " late late show " on monday night was one of the smoothest first episodes of any new talk show hosts in recent memory
ignoring the usual five minutes or so of monologue jokes , corden launched right into a star - studded pre-taped bit that showed how he got the job of host : by picking up one of cbs president les moonves ' willy wonka-esque golden ticket dropped by chelsea handler ( a joke referencing rumors that she was in talks for the job corden won )
corden received advice from jay leno , arnold schwarzenegger and meryl streep as he trained to be the best host he could be
in a nod to one of his influences , graham norton , corden brought out his two guests , mila kunis and tom hanks simultaneously
in the midst of their conversation , mila kunis , who was sporting a ring , seemed to confirm ( with a " maybe " ) that she had just married ashton kutcher , though that still has n't been confirmed and it may be that corden , tom hanks and mila kunis are pulling our leg
the highlight of the show , however , was corden and tom hanks ' rapid fire rundown of his movie career , which has to be seen to be believed
corden 's predecessor , craig ferguson , sang the new show 's theme song , and corden - who co-starred in the musical film " into the woods " - ended his first show with an original song
if twitter reaction is any indication , corden charmed enough viewers to draw viewers back tuesday night .
