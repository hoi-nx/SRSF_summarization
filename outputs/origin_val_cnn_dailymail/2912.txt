the team with the lowest transfer outlay this season rose unassumingly into eighth place on wednesday night
stoke city beat everton , to nobody âs great surprise , and look on course for their best premier league finish yet â a year after their last
mark hughes really should be in the running for those annual accolades saluting success amid all this
manager of the year ? quite possibly
mark hughes looks on with a smile as his stoke city side cruise to a 2 - 0 win over everton on wednesday he has signed with remarkable shrewdness , shaped his players into a cohesive style , and overcome the set - backs of regular injuries to key players to guide stoke city to 42 points after 28 games
his team registered 50 premier league points in reaching ninth last term , two club records , but are currently in a rich vein of form and likely to go higher
seven wins from 11 in the league have seen stoke city nudge past west ham united and swansea â both clubs with claims to good seasons
and all the while forking out less cash on recruits than burnley
that is the bit to amaze
mark hughes has committed Â£ 1.2million on bringing in new players this season : Â£ 800,000 on brilliant bojan from barcelona , and Â£ 400,000 on young centre - back dionatan teixeira from slovakian side dukla banska bystrica
diouf , scorer against everton to take his tally to seven premier league goals ? free from hannover
jon walters ( centre ) congratulates diouf after he scored stoke city 's second goal on wednesday phil bardsley , a regular at right - back with 22 premier league games ? free from sunderland
steve sidwell , who has been adept when called upon , also cost nothing after leaving fulham
moses , whose uncommonly good header broke the deadlock at the britannia on wednesday , is on loan from chelsea
philipp wollscheid , who has come into defence at a vital period to instant effect , is on loan from bayer leverkusen with view to permanent move this summer
by contrast burnley , hardly the most lavish of spenders , have parted with around Â£ 8m on transfer fees
michael kightly was one of sean dyche âs purchases , at Â£ 1.5m , from stoke city
stoke city also sold cameron jerome to norwich and ryan shotton to derby county for a combined cost of Â£ 2m â so in all are around Â£ 2.3m up on net transfer spend
no wonder mark hughes is being rewarded with a new three - year contract that he is expected to sign in the coming days
his connections , influence , and words of persuasion played a big part in producing such positive market returns
the acquisition of bojan , once the rising star of barcelona , was smoothed by mark hughes âs association with the catalan giants
the player âs glistening form before he suffered a cruel knee injury , after initial struggles , a testament to mark hughes âs motivational skills
bojan hit a rich vein of form before his season has ended by a knee ligament injury clearly the support network from chairman coates , a stoke city fan since a boy and generous benefactor , and chief executive tony scholes enables mark hughes to work to his full potential
the foundations laid by pulis in getting stoke city up from the championship seven years ago and stabilising the club as a premier league presence will never be forgotten
but mark hughes has built on that , altering the side âs style to please the eye while retaining the strength of conviction which made pulis âs reign so successful
the four forwards in his 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system are interchangeable , with moses , diouf , bojan , jon walters , arnautovic , ireland , charlie adam , and peter crouch forming various combinations throughout the campaign
no shining lights as such , they offer a mixture of pace , nimble dexterity , and brawn
again the cost is worth noting
arnautovic was Â£ 2m from werder bremen , ireland a free from aston villa
mark hughes âs other signings since taking charge have been erik pieters , Â£ 3m from psv eindhoven , muniesa , free from barcelona , and odemwingie , a swap with cardiff with kenwyne jones heading the other way
chelsea loanee moses ( right ) celebrates scoring stoke city 's opener against everton mark hughes has spent Â£ 6.2m in four transfer windows and improved
in this climate that is phenomenal
equivalent to one 10th of angel di maria , let âs say
stoke city are not averse to opening the wallet
a Â£ 10m package for xherdan shaqiri was put together in january before the swiss forward elected for inter
but when stoke city have suffered injuries it has not provoked a sudden splurge
bojan has been out since late january after rupturing his cruciate ligament and is not back until september
odemwingie has been out the entire campaign with the same injury
captain shawcross has missed the last six weeks with a back injury and is not fit yet
moses missed two months with a thigh problem , glenn whelan was sidelined for five weeks
now ireland is out with that gashed leg
mark hughes has rebuilt his managerial reputation after a disastrous spell at queens park rangers there have been other knocks but these are important players absent for extended periods
mark hughes has addressed each situation as arisen and found a formula to cope
when muniesa and marc wilson were injured at the same time as shawcross last month it looked foolhardy to have sent robert huth out on loan to leicester
but stoke city adjusted and came through
after his disastrous spell at queens park rangers , it appeared mark hughes âs stock had fallen below premier league level
coates had faith and is being rewarded
up next is a trip to face west bromwich albion and pulis on march 14
last year â s premier league manager of the year and former stoke city boss versus his successor in both respects ? victory for mark hughes would only strengthen that argument .
