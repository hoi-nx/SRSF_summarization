an angry christian mother fears her daughter will â become a religious minority â after she was allocated a place at a sikh school
jarvis said 11 - year - old freya has been looking forward to moving up to secondary school in september
but they have been left â shocked and upset â by the decision by council admissions officers to give her a place at the khalsa secondary academy , despite it not being named as one of her preferred choices
khalsa secondary academy , where jarvis does not want her 11 - year - old daughter freya to go as she would be a ' minority ' the sikh faith school opened in the village of stoke poges , buckinghamshire , last september despite protests from residents
mrs jarvis , who lives in the nearby village of farnham royal , said most of freya âs friends have been allocated places at a school in the town of beaconsfield
â we âre a practising christian family and while we are nât wanting her to go to a christian school , my daughter should not be expected to attend a sikh school , â said mrs jarvis
â we knew we were ever so slightly out of the catchment for a number of our first choices but we never thought we would be given khalsa
â in this day and age i could not imagine ever sending my child to a school where she would become a minority
' although it âs open to all , each day they take students off for morning prayers and my daughter would not be doing that , and she would , therefore , be taken out and isolated
i âm not sure she would be able to cope with that
khalsa secondary academy opened in the village in september khalsa secondary academy opened with 180 pupils , and aims to build up to 850
the school intends to cater for students from all backgrounds , with â 50 per cent of places prioritised for non-sikh students â
plans to open the school were put forward by slough sikh education trust in 2013
khalsa primary school was already open in slough , which is just across the border in berkshire and has a large sikh population
but the trust said there was no suitable site for the new school in slough
there was a legal battle over the plans to open the school after people in stoke poges protested , saying they were worried about extra traffic and the â urbanisation â of their village
a buckinghamshire county council spokesman said : â where we ca nât meet any of a parent âs preferences , then the nearest school is allocated
â in mrs jarvis âs case , khalsa academy is the nearest school at 1.771 miles away , although burnham park e-act academy is the catchment school where there are still places
' the advice to parents is â accept the place at this point and then appeal for preferred schools
