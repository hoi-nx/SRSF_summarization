scientists believe they have got to the bottom of anal evolution
a team of norwegian researchers has identified two sets of genes that cause some creatures to have a fully - functioning anus , while other only have ' transient ' ones
the study also reveals how some creatures , such as the penis worm , have very similar digestive systems to humans , even though they are very different species
' while several organ systems have been investigated , such as the nervous system , the anal opening has been largely neglected , ' dr hejnol told bbc
the study , published in the journal zoologischer anzeiger , identified genes known as brachyury and parahox , that are crucial to the development of an anus
according to a report by matt walker at the bbc , their study reveals how the anus is perhaps one of the most important organs in our body , helping our digestive system work
he notes that , interestingly , not all animals have one
some animals have simpler versions , in others the organ appears to be transient , while another has multifunctional anuses
animals that do have an anus , however , often grow to be larger , more sophisticated creatures
a team of norwegian researchers has identified two sets of genes that cause some creatures to have a fully - functioning anus , while other only have ' transient ' ones in 2013 , researchers discovered that one of our earliest ancestors was a worm with no anus
the worm , named xenoturbella bocki , has no brain , no sex organs and no vital organs
the 1m worm is regarded by some scientists as a key biological link between many species
researchers believe the worm is a distant progenitor of humans and a host of other animals living today
swedish researchers say the worm might belong to a branch of the animal family tree called deuterostomes , of which humans are also members
trying to understand when and why the anus evolved is also complicated because it also appears and vanishes again within various groups of animals , such as flatworms
the latest study builds on earlier research which looked at the genes expressed during the development of intestines , stomach and anus in the penis worm
what surprised the researchers was not just that the development was the same in the worms as in humans , fish and frogs , but that exactly the same genes were involved in the process
penis worms live in shallow parts of the oceans , including off the swedish west coast where they propagate during the winter
' this means that the origin of the human stomach is further back in time than previously thought , probably about 500 million years ' , says ralf janssen , postdoc in professor graham budd 's research group on paleobiology at uppsala university
the team are now conducting further research into whether the anus has evolved independently a number of times among animals
' the pattern of presence and absence of the anus in animals is quite fascinating , ' dr hejnol told the bbc .
