the supreme court has given a former ups driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duties while she was pregnant
on a 6 - 3 vote , the justices on wednesday revived peggy young 's discrimination claim against ups and sent the case back to a lower court
the case concerned employers ' responsibilities under the 37 - year - old pregnancy discrimination act
atlanta - based ups maintained that it obeyed the law because it provided light - work duty only in limited situations and did not single out pregnant women
peggy young ( pictured in december last year ) , a virginia woman who lost her ups job because she became pregnant , speaks to reporters outside the supreme court in dc , dc. the supreme court is giving the former ups driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duty when she was pregnant but the company changed its policy as of january and said it now tries to accommodate pregnant workers
the justices gave young another chance to litigate whether ups should have granted her request for temporary changes in work duties - she asked not to lift heavier packages - after she became pregnant in 2006
writing on behalf of the majority , liberal justice breyer said the lower court is required to determine if the employer had ' legitimate , nondiscriminatory , nonpretextual justification ' for treating employees differently
breyer said the lower court failed to consider the effects of ups policies that covered non-pregnant workers who might have disabilities , injuries or otherwise might need accommodations , and asked , ' why , when the employer accommodated so many , could it not accommodate pregnant women as well ? ' breyer said there is a ' genuine dispute as to whether ups provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation can not reasonably be distinguished from young 's '
the outcome reflects a ' middle ground ' that justice elena kagan suggested during arguments in early december
courts must now re-examine young 's case with a more accepting view of the discrimination claim
a federal district court judge and an appeals court had ruled in favor of ups , which was backed by business groups in the case
the two sides in the case disagreed over whether ups agreed to accommodate non-pregnant workers requesting light - duty assignments
ups and other employers facing similar suits still are able to argue their policies were legal because they were based on seniority or some other acceptable reason
the case concerned whether the package delivery company violated a federal law , the pregnancy discrimination act , by denying young 's request
young , who worked at a maryland facility , had acted on a midwife 's advice that she not be required to lift packages weighing more than 20 pounds ( 9 kg )
young , now 43 , said she dealt almost exclusively with overnight letters , but ups said its drivers must be able to lift packages weighing up to 70 pounds
young left the company in 2009
the virginia woman lost two rounds in lower courts
ups has since changed its policy , and now says it will try to accommodate pregnant workers
nine states also have adopted laws directing employers to do so
in recent months , the equal employment opportunity commission has updated guidance to employers to make clear that they should accommodate people in young 's situation
yet the u.s. postal service said it has made no change in policy and maintains the practice that ups has now abandoned
