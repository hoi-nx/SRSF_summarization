giant â cannibal â slugs are set to wreak a trail of destruction in gardens across britain , experts have warned
two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for spanish slugs - an horrific , aggressive species which grows up to six inches long - to expand their territory
the species , nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives , was first spotted in this country in 2012
the giant spanish slug , pictured , was first spotted in the britain in 2012 and is now starting to take hold sightings have since been reported in norfolk , suffolk , essex , kent , london and hampshire
but this year it is expected to tighten its hold on the country and spread even further
dr bedford , the expert who first identified the species three years ago , warned that it is likely to thrive after two very mild winters
â if this warm weather continues and we do not have any cold spells before may we could see very high numbers of the spanish slug this year , â he said
dr bedford , head of entomology at the john innes centre in norwich , said the slug - which officially is called arion vulgaris and originates in southern europe - can not survive extreme cold temperatures
common native slugs , although less aggressive , are much better at surviving cold conditions
experts say it is too early to know whether common varieties will have a boom year , because the volumes of rain we see this spring and summer will be much more closely tied to their fortunes
the winter of 2012/13 saw several cold snaps , blizzards and frosts , which hit the new population of spanish slugs hard
but the intervening two winters have been much warmer , particularly in southern english which has barely seen any snow in 24 months
the average temperature in english for december , january and february this year was 4.4c ( 39.9f ) , and the year before was even warmer at 5.8c ( 42.4f )
the average english winter temperature is 4.2c ( 39.6f )
slug expert dr bedford , pictured , said britain was on course for record numbers of spanish slugs the slug , pictured , is not able to survive extremely cold winters and frozen conditions the spanish slugs , which are thought to have made it to the britain mainland on imported vegetables , have been recorded feeding on dead mice , meat and each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets
they also devour garden plants - terrible news for gardeners
unlike native species , they produce so much slime that birds and hedgehogs tend not to eat them
they also produce twice as many eggs as native slugs , so are more likely to increase their populations and expand their territory quickly
dr bedford said : â if you spot these in your garden the best way to deal with them is to drown them in a bucket of soapy water , add a bit of household bleach , and then bury the remains 18 inches deep
â if they spread it could really affect britain farmers
we found in 2012 that farmers were having to replant oil seed rape because of these slugs
â if we allowed large numbers to develop in our gardens it will be a problem for commercial growers to control them because they are only allowed to use a certain limit of pesticides each year
â anna platoni , entomologist at the royal horticultural society , said it is too early to tell how much of a problem normal native slugs will be this year
â although native slug damage can be predicted by the temperature and humidity , it is really the conditions over spring and summer that are important , rather than over the winter , â she said
â they tend to overwinter in sheltered spots so are protected from the worst of the weather
â sarah fuller , marketing director at wyevale garden centres added : â slugs and snails are a real problem for gardeners , making this hobby and pastime a true 24 - hour activity
â last year gardeners removed up to 4,000 slugs a month
â it âs likely more slugs have survived this winter so gardeners will be fighting larger numbers and need to use really effective methods
