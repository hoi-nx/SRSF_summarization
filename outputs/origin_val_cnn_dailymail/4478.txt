confirmed : miliband will take part in the three leaders ' debates during the election miliband has said he will take part in all three televised leaders ' debate during the election campaign - the day after david cameron flatly refused
the labour 's campaign chairman douglas alexander confirmed in a letter to broadcaster that mr miliband was prepared to appear
his willingness to appear is in stark contrast with that of mr david cameron , who last night made it clear he was willing to do one seven - way debate at the end of march , but no more
meanwhile , the four broadcasters - the bbc , itv , sky and channel 4 - announced they will stick to their previously - announced plans for three debates during the election campaign
in a joint statement , the broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven - way debate involving mr david cameron , labour 's miliband , nick clegg of the lib dems and the leaders of the greens , ukip , snp and plaid cymru on itv on april 2
this would be followed by a second show on bbc featuring the same line - up on april 16 and a final one - on - one clash between the tory and labour leaders on sky news and channel 4 on april 30 - exactly a week before the may 7 election
they urged the prime minister to ' reconsider ' his refusal to take part in these shows
but mr david cameron 's chief spin doctor oliver said their response was ' disappointing ' and restated the prime minister 's ' final position ' was for a single debate to take place in the week starting march 23
in a speech to his party 's scottish conference mr miliband is expected to say : ' today the labour party has written to the broadcasters saying with or without david cameron , i will be at the debates
' and every day up to these debates he [ mr david cameron ] will be asked : what are you hiding from ? ' mr miliband is expected to use his conference speech to accuse mr david cameron of ' duplicity ' and of trying to ' chicken out ' of the debates
he will say : ' this is what david cameron used to say about tv election debates : that they were essential to our democracy
contrast : the labour 's confirmation is in contrast to david cameron 's refusal to take part ' chicken ' : mr miliband is expected to accuse the conservative leader of ' running away ' in his speech a labour grand coalition could be needed after the election to stop the snp holding the balance of power and provoking a constitutional crisis , a former conservative home secretary has said
baker of dorking said a deal between the two largest parties could be necessary to ensure the ' continuing unity ' of the united kingdom
the former mp said such an agreement could avoid the ' nightmare ' of a minority labour administration depending on snp support to govern - something which could ' stretch the constitution of our country to breaking point '
writing in the independent , the former cabinet minister accepted that a deal between david cameron and miliband was ' quite unthinkable ' at the moment , but pointed out it worked in germany
lord baker argued : ' what is at risk is the continuing unity of the united kingdom
in order to preserve that unity another way should be found
' this could be a joint government of the labour and conservative parties : quite unthinkable at the moment , and at this time likely to be rejected by both of them - but this is what has happened in germany
' he said it would be possible for the two parties to find areas of agreement - defence , counter-terrorism , infrastructure investment in schools , road , rail and in the reform of skills training and energy - while more controversial manifesto promises would have to wait until 2018
lord baker 's intervention follows a warning from former prime minister sir john major that the snp would enter any deal with labour with the ' overriding aim ' of ' prising apart ' the union
' that every country apart from mongolia had them
' that he was n't going to have any feeble excuses to get out of debates
' and now he is doing everything he can to stop them
' and it is on the issue of leadership debates that david cameron 's duplicity has caught up with him
' he says this election is all about leadership , all about the choice between him and me , and when it comes to a debate between him and me , he 's running scared
' he 's running away
' i say to david cameron : you can refuse to face the public , but you ca n't deny your record
' you can try to chicken out of the debates , but do n't ever again claim that you provide strong leadership
' you can try to escape the people 's debates , but you ca n't escape the people 's verdict
' he will add : ' when all people will see is an empty chair , his claims of leadership will be exposed as empty
' in a letter to mr oliver , the broadcasters made clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if mr david cameron decides not to take part - effectively ' empty - chairing ' the prime minister
but mr oliver replied : ' i made the prime minister 's final position clear in my last letter - he is willing to do a seven - way debate in the week beginning march 23
' clearly it is disappointing that you are not prepared to take him up on that offer
' i am ready to discuss at your convenience the logistics of making the debate we have suggested happen
' with neither side in the stand - off backing down , the debates are set to go ahead without mr david cameron 's participation .
