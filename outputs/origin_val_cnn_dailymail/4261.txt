after winning the super bowl , revis is heading back to the jets

at 29 , the six - time pro bowler and four - time all-pro is among a number of new additions as the jets look to break their four - year spell without a play - off place
revis defends jeremy kerley in the patriots 's narrow 17 - 16 win over the jets in december revis lasted a year with the buccaneers after penning a six - year , $ 96m deal with no guaranteed money
the patriots moved swiftly following his release last year , with the parties agreeing on a $ 32m two - year deal
owner robert kraft declined to take up the $ 20m second - year option , opting to re-sign safety devin mccourty on big money instead
the deal appears a questionable one for the super bowl - winning patriots
revis and the recently released brandon browner gave them a secondary that was the envy of the afc
but they lose a locker room leader to an afc east rival and bill belichick has to rebuild his secondary once more
with $ 50m cap space , it has already been a busy free agency for gang green and new head coach todd bowles
alongside the marquee signing of brandon marshall , cornerback buster skrine joined from cleveland , guard james carpenter comes in from seattle and linebacker david harris was re-signed .
