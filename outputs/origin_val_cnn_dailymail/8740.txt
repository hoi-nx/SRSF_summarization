a limp and lifeless queens park rangers were destroyed by palace , leaving their premier league future severely in doubt
in a first half of utter domination the home side went three goals ahead with only three shots on target , while queens park rangers failed to muster a single one
already three points adrift of safety ahead of kick - off , queens park rangers manager ramsey knew how imperative it was to get something from this game
his players did not respond

click here to see more from sportsmail 's match zone the first came after 21 minutes , bolasie bursting down the left , easily past 19 - year - old right - back darnell , and sending a low ball across the box which wilfried zaha was able to slide in at the back post
he was almost split in two by the upright in the process , and was eventually substituted in the second half , given a standing ovation by the adoring selhurst park crowd for netting his first goal since making a permanent move back to south london in january
â if it meant colliding with the post , i had to get my goal , â said zaha , who had gingerly limped off , afterwards
â it will definitely hurt , but no pain , no gain
â we âve been talking all week about getting into the box so as soon as bolasie got the ball i knew i had to get in there and get on the end of it
â it took another 20 minutes for the second , bolasie again simply out - pacing darnell down the left and crossing low again
this time goalkeeper rob green got a hand to the ball but could not divert it out of the path of james mcarther who finished into the open net
matt phillips unleashed a ferocious strike from 40 yards that found the top corner to pull a goal back for the visitors phillips ' effort dipped and swerved past speroni but it was too little too late for queens park rangers , who fell to another away defeat phillips grabs the ball in a hurry as he makes his way back to the centre spot as queens park rangers sense a late comeback bolasie âs relentless dismantling of teenager darnell was painful to watch , like a grown man putting a puppy into a sack and repeatedly kicking it
but he was afforded some respite , at least , for the third , just 60 seconds later this time
palace probed down the other flank , zaha using skill to outwit a few queens park rangers players before passing into joel ward who took a touch before bending the ball through a flurry of players and bouncing agonisingly into the far left of goal
darnell , playing only his third game for queens park rangers , was hooked at half - time , clint hill coming in at centre - back and nedum onuoha moving to right - back to try to deal with bolasie âs threat
queens park rangers manager ramsey claimed it was due to injury
â darnell came off for no other reason that he âs got a bad calf , â he said
â his calf stiffened up and it would nât be fair to the boy to keep the boy on there hobbling
â joel ward is congratulated by team - mates james mcarthur and scott dann after firing palace into an unassailable lead against queens park rangers james mcarthur doubled the home side 's lead five minutes before half - time after tapping bolasie 's low cross into an empty net james mcarthur leaps to his feet in celebration as he heads towards the provider bolasie as palace took a firm a grip on proceedings midfielder james mcarthur points to his shin with a smile on his face appearing to suggest the ball had n't gone in off his boot if darnell was the puppy of the side , his team - mates finally produced some bite in the second half , even if it was all too late
they finally got an effort on target , after 72 minutes
from who else but charlie austin ? the striker reached a cross first but could only direct at tame header down the middle which palace goalkeeper speroni held
then , out of nowhere , they pulled one back in the final 10 minutes , with one of the strikes of the season
matt phillips picked the ball up in the middle of the park and took a touch before belting an effort over speroni and into the top left corner from 40 yards
with one minute remaining of the 90 he almost struck again , this time hitting a first - time drive from slightly to the right of goal , but speroni was alert and dived to push it wide
former manchester united winger zaha slid in at the back post to turn home bolasie 's low cross to give palace a first - half lead the 22 - year - old beat team - mate puncheon and queens park rangers full back yun suk-young to poke the ball home from close range zaha 's momentum took him and puncheon crashing into the post as both palace players required treatment zaha and puncheon both lay on the floor in pain after colliding with the post before both players were able to continue james mcarthur calls over to the bench for medical assistance as palace 's celebrations were cut short after taking the lead in the 21st minute palace manager alan pardew is targeting finishing above former club newcastle , who he left in a shock move in december but has since reeled them to within reach
â i said to the players when i arrived to look above because if you look below there is anxiety and pressure , â alan pardew revealed
â you ca n't play like that
â you have to try to newcastle , whoever is above us
we 're above everton , that was a bit of goal for us
can we stay above them ? â but time is running out for queens park rangers to stay in the league
â i âm hoping nine games is enough , â ramsey added
â that âs all that i âve got , so we âll go for it as best we can
â they âre still unified in what we âre trying to do , and all we can do really is to keep fighting
â even getting a stunning consolation goal flattered queens park rangers at the final whistle and the fight is beginning to drain from them .
