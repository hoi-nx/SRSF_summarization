arrest : joe was found dead at home two days after being accused of drink - driving by police a â perfect son â killed himself two days after being arrested for drink - driving because he believed he had â ruined his future â
joseph , described as an â exemplary student â , was found in his family âs farmhouse alongside a shotgun and a police charge sheet
joseph , 17 , was caught drink - driving on his way home from a party just four weeks after passing his driving test
he was kept in the cells overnight at cheadle heath police station in greater manchester without his parents â knowledge
two days later he used his father âs shotgun to kill himself at the Â£ 850,000 family farm in disley , stockport
the charge sheet and a letter were at his feet when his father found him
following his death , his parents nick and jane successfully lobbied the government to change the law so that 17 - year - olds are treated as children in custody
an inquest into joseph âs death heard the model pupil â who had recently gained one a and four bs in his as - levels â was working on his university application and travel plans and had shown no signs of depression or anxiety
but the note found next to his body said he feared being a â constant disappointment â and felt his arrest had â ruined his future â
the jury at macclesfield coroner âs court heard that joseph was kept in a police cell overnight after being arrested in august 2012
the youngster was driving his new peugeot 107 home from a party with his friends when he was stopped by police and breathalysed
he was over the legal limit and was taken to a police station , where he was detained for more than seven hours overnight
his parents were unaware he had been arrested
mr joseph , 53 , who runs a building supplies company with his wife , said : â he was 17 and had been treated as an adult and i said straight away that was wrong
there was an anomaly in the system
â cctv showing joseph arriving at the police station and undergoing further searches and tests was shown to the jury
as the footage was played , mrs jane , 49 , left the courtroom
mr joseph said of joseph âs letter : â what he means by that is he can see himself being a disappointment in the future
he had never been a disappointment â he was a very high achiever , he did everything that was asked of him
father : nick lawton told an inquest that joe was a ' perfect son ' who had never disappointed the family â he was a perfect son and loved by everyone
he thought he âd ruined his future and he would nât be able to reach the standards he wanted to reach
â joseph âs family did not know of his drink - driving arrest until after his death because he was treated as an adult in custody without the need for a parent or guardian
his parents have successfully campaigned for a change in the law to see anyone aged 17 or under treated as a child in custody
the previous age limit was 16
in a statement , the lawtons said joseph had made a â bad decision â to drive after the party
they added : â we were not called when he was arrested or given the opportunity to give him the support he needed
campaign : joe 's parents nick and jane outside the high court after winning a change in the law â the fact that a 17 - year - old is treated as an adult while in custody is an anomaly of british law
once they are charged , they are then treated as children
this simply does not make sense
for someone of any age , being held and charged in a police station is a traumatic experience
â few 17 - year - olds could make a rational judgement about contacting family or legal advice in that situation without support
perhaps most importantly of all , they are fearful of disappointing and letting down their families
we believe if the law had been different , joe would still be alive
