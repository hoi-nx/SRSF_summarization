a year - and - a - half ago , when the jesus edition of o'reilly and martin dugard 's ongoing book series about the deaths of famous people was released , o'reilly did the talk show circuit to promote the book
to " 60 minutes " o'reilly professed that his " killing jesus " is not a religious book
it was purely historical , said the fox news host
he said it investigates the political circumstances surrounding the most famous death of all time
when asked why jesus was killed , o'reilly said , " he was upset that the jew were taxing -- and overtaxing , extorting -- the folks
" jesus was executed , according to o'reilly , not because he claimed to be god , but because he interrupted the " money flow " of taxes to the romans and the jew temple leaders
as a theologian , i must say that o'reilly buried the lead
the death of jesus , at least historically speaking , was just one more ignominious execution of a peasant jew in a long line of such executions
a century before jesus ' death , the romans crucified about 6,000 slaves on the roads leading to rome , putting to an end the third servile war
like jesus , these slaves stood up to the roman and were quickly defeated
five things o'reilly flubs in ' killing jesus ' jesus ' death was unique because of its theological and religious import
at least that 's what his earliest followers decided upon reflection
jesus was not the messiah that the hebrews had anticipated
in fact , he 'd done just about the opposite of what was expected : preached peace , lived in relative obscurity , and died young
jesus was most definitely an outsider -- on this o'reilly and i agree
he lived in the outer reaches of the empire , a non-citizen with few rights
even his galilean accent was considered backwoods in the metropolis of jerusalem
whether it was the roman occupying force or the powerful temple leaders , they must have thought , " jesus is not like us
" so it 's pleasantly surprising that the tv movie based on o'reilly 's book casts a muslim actor , sleiman , as jesus
sleiman was raised in lebanon
he is thick - featured and broad - shouldered
and he is robustly hirsute , the very opposite of the wispily - bearded ted neely from the jesus christ superstar of my youth
speaking of ted neely , he is just one in a long line of blue - eyed jesuses in art and film
for a long time , the actors chosen to play jesus have looked more like o'reilly and me than like a judean
sleiman is a welcome break from that tradition , but some people have voiced displeasure at his casting
having a muslim portray the founder of christianity , they contend , is an offense
" my religion is inclusivity , " sleiman told me , and he is an effective evangelist of that religion
he is unashamed to talk about his connection to god , his respect for all three abrahamic faiths -- judaism , christianity , and islam -- and in the " beauty and magnificence of humanity
" to play jesus , sleiman said , he simply focused on the divinity that he believes is available to all human beings , a divinity that jesus was specially aware of
when o'reilly portrays jesus as a champion of low taxes and an opponent of big government , he 's not committing a mortal sin
he 's doing what so many have done before : seeing in jesus what they want to see , and making jesus into someone who looks , talks , and thinks like they want him to
so maybe the best thing that christians can do during this holy week is to watch a muslim portray jesus
in that portrayal , we might be reminded that jesus himself did n't look like the dominant culture of his day , and he practiced a religion that the romans did not understand or respect
we live in an uneasy time between christians and muslim , between christianity and islam
and it was n't so different in the first century
then , an obscure figure who was little understood preached peace and died a sacrificial death
now a muslim actor is bringing him to life , and that is no more scandalous than jesus ' own life .
