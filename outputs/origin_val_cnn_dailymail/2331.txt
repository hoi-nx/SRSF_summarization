for rangers captain lee mcculloch , the spfl championship table has become a torment
a headache the arrival of a new board of directors simply ca nât cure
lying 22 points behind relentless leaders hearts , there is now no hiding place for the ibrox players
the off - field problems have eased , stuart mccall is in place as manager and , simply put , there are no excuses left
â it is time for everybody to stand up and be men , â said lee mcculloch
â take the ball , demand the ball in front of a crowd , do nât hide and go and show that you â re good enough to be here
â rangers captain lee mcculloch has urged his team - mates to stand up and be counted under mcdowall , rangers played as if a grey , leaden cloud hung over ibrox
in comparison , a home game with doomed livingston offers stuart mccall the chance to be a breath of fresh air around the place
rangers need something to rescue a flailing season and advance from the play - offs to the premiership by hook or by crook
â it âs been a frustrating season for everyone , fans , players , off - the - field , â added lee mcculloch
â i think it would be a wasted season if we do nât go up
it would be a season that would go down as a massive failure
â for everyone , it has been frustrating , but it âs still in our own hands as players
everything else seems to have been sorted out , so it âs basically up to us now to try and get a play - off place and see what happens
â currently third in the league , the gap on second place hibernian is a manageable five points
rangers have two games in hand and winning them would ease concerns they might slip out of the play - offs altogether â a state of affairs which would be completely unacceptable to their captain
â it âs not as if i âve been going home and made a cup of tea and thinking everything âs all right , â lee mcculloch insisted
â it âs killing me inside , to be honest with you
to see hearts so far clear in the league and we âre nowhere near them
it âs not nice and it âs not what we want or are used to
â the weeks ahead will reveal much about this rangers team
off - field turmoil drew attention from their failings
the managerial situation , where mcdowall was a reluctant frontman , provided a further shield
lee mcculloch says rangers must finish in the play - off positions this season lee mcculloch and stuart mccall referred to a crisis of confidence repeatedly yesterday
for many of these players , the suspicion is that rangers may simply be too big for them
â the players have probably felt it even more since ally ( mccoist ) left , â added the captain
â it is amazing what he took on his shoulders
he shielded the players away from it
since he left , the players as a squad have been getting it from all angles
â i think confidence has probably dipped because of that
â everybody knows we have nât been playing as well as we can or as well as we should have been
i think there are loads of small things that you can make excuses for
but even though there has been a lot of off - field stuff going on , you ca nât really make an excuse for how we have been playing
â this season , whoever has been on the board , we âve not lived up to the standard that we should have for many different reasons
but it is nothing to do with who was in charge or on the board
â since the new owners have come in , everyone around the place , the players and the staff , has had a wee bit of a spring in their step
it is probably a good thing
â for a dozen of the players , out of contract in the summer , these are crucial days
lee mcculloch is one of them and , while some of the players wo nât be sorry to leave , the 36 - year - old wants to complete the journey back to the top division as a rangers player
â the new manager has come in and said : â well , it âs up to yourselves to go out there and earn it
if you want to be here next season then go and earn your contract and show that you are worthy of one â
i think that is the best thing for it
â it is a big motivation for me
i âm not getting any younger
stuart mccall begins his reign at rangers with home game against livingston â it would be amazing , it would be brilliant to go back to the top and it would be nice
but at times football is nât nice
â so i would love to be here , but i need to go and earn that myself
i know that as does every other player here
â some have a head start
nicky was a stand - out under stuart mccall at motherwell and for the new manager bringing the best out of him and others is the key to earning the job on a permanent basis
â i want everyone to go out and express themselves , â said stuart mccall after his second training session
â not just nicky but i know there âs more in his locker
i know he can do more and like a lot of the players when you lack a bit of that confidence you can go into your shell
â we want the players to go and express themselves , there are some good footballers in there
â a lot of players have shown good stuff in training
â in a supreme irony , the most impressive of all has been one of mike ashley âs january imports on loan from newcastle
â haris vuckic has been absolutely outstanding in training , bright and bubbly and a fantastic lad , â reported stuart mccall
â he had nât had much football but is certainly a talented individual and has been really bright in training
â he has been terrific but i was coming in thinking there might be three or four of these lads up and running
â in reality , remie streete is ill and injured , kevin mbabu played an under - 20 game on thursday but is well short , shane ferguson has yet to cross the border and gael bigirimana has a medical condition
â one out of five is nât bad , â grinned stuart mccall after waking at 5am in anticipation of his return to ibrox as a rangers employee
â it âs been a whirlwind
i have nât even had the chance to think about it
â hopefully tomorrow at 5pm â or when i get home tomorrow â i will look back on it
â but right now i âve not had the chance to go , â this will be great â
i âve not given it a thought
