' and he stimulates also the other players , so that 's also an aspect of the profession
' ' but it is now easy for you to say that ( criticism of falcao ) , and that 's why you are saying that
and you are very happy to say that , i see that in your face
' when the journalist then pointed out that four goals is not very much for a striker on Â£ 280,000 a week , van gaal seemed to agree , but continued to take issue with the line of questioning
the 63 - year - old took issue with the line of inquiry about falcao , interrupting a journalist 's question falcao has scored four goals since joining on loan , a meagre return for Â£ 280,000 per week van gaal issues tactical instructions during the game , but was unable to stem the tide against arsenal ' yes , ' he responded
' i can not change that
i can not change facts , and you know that
' the manchester united boss then called an end to his press conference , before leaving with a sarcastic jibe of ' very good question ' to the offending journalist , and giving him the thumbs up .
