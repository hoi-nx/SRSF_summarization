manchester city go into wednesday night 's champions league game against barcelona knowing that only a win - and a win in which they score twice - will be enough to secure progress
it might therefore worry them to know that beating barcelona is something that their manager , manuel pellegrini , has failed to manage since 2008
manuel pellegrini has now managed three clubs without any successes against barcelona , losing all of his games so far as manager of manchester city to match his record at real madrid , and managing just a single draw when in charge of malaga
manchester city manager manuel pellegrini has lost 12 of his last 13 games against barcelona the last time manuel pellegrini beat barcelona , in 2008 , yaya toure was playing for the spanish club in fact , you have to go back to march 2008 , more than eight years ago , to find manuel pellegrini 's last win over barcelona , on a day that his star man yaya toure was lining up for the nou camp outfit
as villarreal boss manuel pellegrini did manage four wins against barcelona , while drawing three times and losing the remaining five of his twelve games
however , only the last of those wins came away from home , and none of them in the champions league , while his career record against barcelona sees him triumph only 16 per cent of the time
city know they need to produce something special to progress - if they do beat luis enrique 's team by the required margin , it will not just be a remarkable achievement for the club , but also for their manager
