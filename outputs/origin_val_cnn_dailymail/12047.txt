hogg has been warned he may provoke a furious england backlash at twickenham after suggesting scotland âs calcutta cup rivals do not respect them as a rugby nation
while stuart lancaster , who represented scotland at age - group level , dismissed any notion that his team will take saturday âs six nations visitors lightly , hogg âs incendiary remarks to sportsmail drew a stern response north of the border
former lions prop peter wright accused the full - back of a â misjudgment â in making what amounted to a familiar claim of english arrogance
hogg claimed england have ' no respect ' for scottish rugby ahead of saturday 's twickenham clash hogg breaks away to score the opening try during the six nations game against wales in february â under previous england coaches maybe there was a lack of respect for scottish rugby but under stuart lancaster that has changed , â said peter wright
â he always gives respect to the opposition
the england lads will be angry to be accused of not respecting scottish rugby because they do and that could fire them up even more
â peter wright âs comments followed a twitter reaction to hogg âs outburst by will carling , who said : â i always thought you earned respect through your performances
old fashioned i know â¦ â his point was a clear reference to the fact that scotland have failed to win at twickenham for 32 years
hogg ( centre ) wants to record scotland 's first win of the tournament against england at twickenham peter wright added : â will carling has every right to suggest respect has to be earned by scotland
he is a former england captain who led them to three grand slams , played in a world cup final and went on tour with the lions , so he has every right to take issue with hogg
â i am surprised hogg said it in the first place and i hope he is nât made to regret his comments by an england side that will respect scotland on saturday but may now want to beat them even more
â there was a more measured response from within the scotland camp yesterday
brad barritt injured his ankle in saracens ' win over wasps on sunday and is now a doubt for england exeter ' 21 - year - old fly - half henry slade earned himself a call up to stuart lancaster 's england squad assistant coach matt taylor added : â i do nât see a lack of respect at all
under stuart lancaster they are quite a humble group and they will be taking us seriously
â stuart lancaster said : â we have a healthy regard for their team , their players and their coaching team
â england have been forced to rule out brad barritt ( ankle ) , tom croft ( shoulder ) and henry thomas ( shoulder ) from the rest of the championship
exeter âs henry slade has been called into the squad and while he may push billy twelvetrees for a bench place , he is being viewed as a rising world cup candidate
luther burrell and mike brown are expected to start against scotland .
