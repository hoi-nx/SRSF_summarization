the 25 - year - old allegedly loaded 11 bull terriers in his car and took them to bushland at mcleods road , kurri kurri - north of sydney - on wednesday afternoon
police say an advertisement on gumtree was placed online last thursday for the sale of 11 bull terriers cross puppies
almost a week later , it is alleged the owner had not sold the dogs and offered the puppies free of charge to the 25 - year - old who accepted
it 's alleged that a witness saw the 25 - year - old man begin to kill a number of the puppies , aged six to eight weeks , by hitting them over the head with a rock , then throwing them into the bush
the witness confronted the man , who drove from the area with five of the dogs still alive
the rspca were contacted and attended the location , before taking the attacked puppies to a vet
only one of the animals , named lucky , survived
o'shannessy , rspca nsw 's chief inspector , told daily mail australia he was shocked by the incident
' we deal with a lot of cases but in this particular incident someone has allegedly gone out of their way to do something to the dogs which makes it even more concerning for us , ' he said
' this sort of situation does n't have to occur
' mr o'shannessy says by the time the rspca arrived at the scene only two dogs were alive
thompson , the man accused of horrifically murdering 10 puppies , pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty ' there were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased , ' he said
' most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there
' the inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way
' police and rspca arrested the 25 - year - old at a house in kurri kurri on thursday
police say the man allegedly told them four of the five remaining puppies were destroyed and the fifth was re-homed
' something 's not quite right with the numbers so we 've made some inquiries about the other dogs , ' mr o'shannessy said
lucky , the surviving dog , is in the care of the rscpa and is stable , however mr o'shannessy says he has ' grave concerns ' for her
' she appeared to have some injuries and had blood shot eyes when we rescued her , ' he said
' but who knows what lucky 's witnessed
