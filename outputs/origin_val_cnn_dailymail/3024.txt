the days of long , luxurious showers on holiday could be numbered
that 's if the environmental protection agency ( environmental protection agency ) gets its way
the agency has paid researchers $ 15,000 ( around Â£ 10,000 ) to develop a wireless device for monitoring water use in hotel room showers
' hotels consume a significant amount of water in the u.s and around the world , ' says a proposal on the environmental protection agency 's website
the gadget will fit onto hotel shower fixtures and transmit data back to an accounting system using an app ' most hotels do not monitor individual guest water usage and as a result , millions of gallons of potable water are wasted every year by hotel guests
' which is why they want to create an app to monitor the amount of water hotel guests are using - and , they hope , compel people to shorten their shower time by a minute
the gadget will fit onto existing hotel shower fixtures and transmit water usage data back to a central hotel accounting system using an app , which it is hoped will be doled out in major hotel chains
it will be made up of a flow metre , an embedded system and software , and a resource accounting system , and will allow hotel guests to monitor their daily water online or using a smartphone app. the environmental protection agency has paid researchers $ 15,000 ( around Â£ 10,000 ) to develop a wireless device for monitoring water use the proposal will be marketed to the hotel industry to reduce costs by promoting water conservation among hotel guests
the current average length of shower is estimated to be 8.2 minutes or 17.2 gallons - but it 's unknown how hotels will encourage guests to limit this
a spokesperson for the environmental protection agency told the washington free beacon that calling for the device was not intended to enable the monitoring of guests shower time
' it âs ultimately up to hotels to use technology like the monitors being developed at the university of tulsa
environmental protection agency is encouraging creativity with water conservation efforts , ' they said .
