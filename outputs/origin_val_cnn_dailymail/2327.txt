wrexham were all set to celebrate their 150th birthday and had their eye on a rather nice present - the fa trophy
coasting at 2 - 0 with just a quarter - hour remaining here at wembley stadium , wrexham had their celebrations well underway
then , united decided to roll up , gatecrash and ruin everything
goals from moult and jay harris had the welsh side in complete control but ferriby , who play a division below , forced extra time through liam king âs penalty and kendall âs late leveller
players of united celebrate after winning the fa trophy on penalties then , incredibly , they took the lead as kendall pounced again , only for moult to send this magnificent advertisement for the non-league game to penalties
the first five spot - kicks were all scored , the next four saved and the four after that all scored
and so it was wrexham âs steve tomassen , under the pressure of sudden death , who had to be the fall - guy
his penalty was kept out by adam nicklin and so ferriby were the ones who ascended the 107 steps to lift the handsome silver trophy

for wrexham , the national stadium has become something of a second home
this was their third visit in as many years - in 2013 , they beat grimsby town in the fa trophy final before returning later in the same campaign for the conference play - offs final , losing to newport county
ferriby is a village on the north bank of the humber , not too far from hull
it has a population of under 4,000 and most of them seemed to have decamped to wembley stadium for the day
the place itself must have been eerily empty
players of both team prepare for extra time which ended up finishing 3 - 3 after the 30 minutes among those watching on was hull city chairman assem allam , while tigers manager steve bruce had fixed it with his pal sam allardyce for ferriby to use west ham âs training facilities on the eve of the game
the villagers , ninth in their league , had played under the wembley stadium but not under the arch. it was 1997 when they last came to wembley stadium , losing to whitby town in the fa vase final
the welsh side were backed by some 10,000 supporters and , as expected , they made the early running
it took just 11 minutes to make the breakthrough as moult continued his marvellous run of goals in this season âs trophy
moult of wrexham scores the first goal of the game as they took control early on in the final moult ( centre ) celebrates with clarke after putting his side into the lead early on in the game he scored at stockport county in the second round , two more in the replay , and in both legs of the semi-final with torquay united
in all , he has 16 goals this season and this was the most significant
clarke advanced down the left and exchanged passed with connor jennings before crossing low for moult to finish from about eight yards
it was an accomplished finish , though the ferriby defence allowed him ample time and space
ferriby âs best opening of the half came when a neat ball over the top sprung danny clarke who did well to hold off two defenders before forcing goalkeeper coughlin into a block at his near post
kay harris scores to make it 2 - 0 during the fa carlsberg trophy final but it was n't enough for wrexham early in the second - half , there was encouragement for ferriby when jason st juste , an international for saint kitts and nevis , shrugged off steve tomassen and was only denied when coughlin dived at his feet
a minute later and connor jennings should have found the net
set clear by a brilliant through ball , he rounded goalkeeper andy nicklin only for hone to clear his shot off the line
on the hour , wrexham did claim their second
jay harris , part of the team that won here two years ago , was played into acres of space on the right by connor jennings , raced clear and calmly slotted the ball past adam nicklin
king of united scores a penalty to make it 2 - 1 during the fa carlsberg trophy final wrexham : coughlin ; steve tomassen , smith , blaine hudson , neil ashton ; connor jennings , jay harris , keates ( c ) ( evans 72 ) , clarke ( andy bishop 102 ) , morris ( york 87 ) ; moult substitutes not used : carrington , waterfall scorers : moult 11 , 117 ; jay harris 60 booked : coughlin united : adam nicklin ; topliss , hone , matt wilson , wilde ( nathan peat 88 ) ; bolder ( nathan jarman 61 ) , fry ( kendall 79 ) ; liam king ; clarke , denton , st juste substitutes not used : nicholson ( gk ) ; gray scorers : liam king ( penalty ) 75 ; kendall 86 , 100 booked : nathan jarman referee : michael oliver ( northumberland ) attendance : 14,585 man of the match : jason st juste the goal showed how ferriby had been stretched and connor jennings nearly capitalised on a carbon copy opening minutes later , only to drag his shot wide
wrexham seemed to be cruising but things were back in the balance when danny clarke broke through the heart of the defence and was fouled as he tried to get round coughlin
ferriby captain king assumed responsibility and hammered the spot - kick home to reinvigorate the match
after that it was all ferriby and , with four minutes left , they drew level
st juste did well to retrieve the ball wide on the left and , cutting in from the byline , he delivered a low cross on a plate for substitute kendall to turn home
â you âre not singing anymore , â sang those from humberside
kendall is the equivalent of wrexham âs moult
this was his sixth in the fa trophy this season after earlier strikes against mickleover sports , boston united ( twice ) , hyde and farnborough
ryan kenda of ferriby scores the teams third goal of the game in extra time a wembley stadium kenda celebrates with his team - mates after equalising late at wembley stadium for minnows ferriby liam king ( ferriby ) scored 1 - 0 wes york ( wrexham ) scored 1 - 1 nathan jarman ( ferriby ) scored 2 - 1 andy bishop ( wrexham ) scored 2 - 2 kendall ( ferriby ) scored 3 - 2 connor jennings ( wrexham ) saved 3 - 2 jason st juste ( ferriby ) saved 3 - 2 neil ashton ( wrexham ) saved 3 - 2 tom denton ( ferriby ) saved 3 - 2 moult ( wrexham ) scored 3 - 3 matt wilson ( ferriby ) scored 4 - 3 blaine hudson ( wrexham ) scored 4 - 4 nathan peat ( ferriby ) scored 5 - 4 steve tomassen saved 5 - 4 all of a sudden , wrexham were clinging on and clarke forced coughlin into a fine save with a dipping shot from outside the box in stoppage time
st juste marauded again down the left , crossed and kendall tried to flick it in , only to be denied by blaine hudson âs desperate sliding block
coasting with 15 minutes left , wrexham were somewhat fortunate to reach extra time
still ferriby were the better side
st juste again accelerated into space down the right and was denied by coughlin
and guess who was the provider for kendall âs second in minute 100
jason st juste âs ball looped up off the boot of steve tomassen and found its way to kendall for the simplest of close - range headers
cue delirium among those wearing green and white
hone had saved ferriby once and he did so again with a vital slide tackle when andy bishop pulled the trigger with 10 minutes left
the villagers were clinging on for dear life and their resistance was overcome just three minutes from time
a barrage was only half - cleared and it fell perfectly for moult to thump home sweetly on the half - volley and ensure the drama of penalties
