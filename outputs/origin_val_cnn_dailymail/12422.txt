and now that senate minority leader harry reid is planning to retire -- creating an opening in the top senate democrats job -- you are about to hear this : draft warren has to run for leader because chuck schumer is too cozy with wall street
the senator from massachusetts is likely to give the same answer as she did on a presidential run , but kucinich of the daily beast says the liberal clamoring tells us something about anxiety on the left
" what this does show is there is a lot of skepticism with the base with chuck schumer , because he 's so close to wall street , and it 's an issue they 've really been hammering on , " kucinich said
" so watch for more of that , because i have a feeling that they are going to make their voices heard , through draft warren or not
a good week for john boehner
yes , you read that right
it has been a rocky year for house of representatives speaker john boehner , but his allies think they may have just turned a corner
the house of representatives passed the gop budget last week as well as a big medicare change known as the " doc fix " because it clarifies reimbursement rates to medicare providers
npr 's summers shared reporting on how team boehner hopes that ending the month with a little momentum will carry over when other big legislative battles come to the fore
" part of ( his success ) is because of the speaker 's willingness to use unconventional tactics , to work with democrat nancy pelosi for that medicare reform , " summers said
" congress has a lot of big deadlines when they return
so whether or not he can hold onto that power instead of seeing it slip will be really fascinating

ted cruz wants to " rock " the youth vote
much was made of the fact that liberty university students had no choice but to attend the campus convocation at which ted cruz announced his bid for the gop presidential nomination
but it gave ted cruz a big crowd -- and costa of the washington post reports that team cruz is determined to build a relationship with young conservatives such as those on hand for the announcement

is john kasich waiting for a " summer wave " ? john kasich had a well - regarded visit to new hampshire last week
and he got a decent buzz out of a new york fund - raising stop , too
so is he ready to launch and join the crowded gop 2016 presidential field ? not so fast
two new hampshire republicans keeping close tabs on gop visitors say he would n't give a firm answer about his intentions -- something they took as a hesitation to run
a national gop source plugged into to the john kasich operation says the governor has n't made a firm decision , and is talking about waiting until the summer to make a final call
that , too , is interpreted widely as a reluctance to run
this national source said john kasich is one of two gop governors who want to wait and see if those in the current field stumble after their official spring rollouts and create an opening for a " summer wave " of new entries
the other , according to this source , is gop michigan gov. rick snyder .
