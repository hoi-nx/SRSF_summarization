theresa may has shelved a decision on whether water cannon can be used on the streets of uk until after the election , in a major snub to boris johnson
mrs may has refused to sign off the controversial riot control machines despite pressure from the london mayor , who last year spent Â£ 220,000 buying three cannon for use in public order emergencies
home office sources confirmed last night no ruling on permission would be made this side of the election
that means the machines will lay idle , in a potential embarrassment for the mayor
boris johnson spent Â£ 220,000 last year buying three water cannon to use in public emergencies , such as the london riots , but theresa may has today refused to approve their use ( file image ) soon after buying the three germany machines last year , mr boris johnson said it was â highly likely â the home secretary would sign them off , adding : â my view is we need to get on and equip the police with the water cannon they need , or might need
â but in the past she has expressed concerns about whether they fit with the uk model of policing and is thought to have concerns about their safety
the standoff over the issue cast light on the ongoing rivalry between the two , both of whom are seen as potential tory leadership candidates should david cameron lose the election and step down
mrs may 's home office has been locked in a row with the london mayor over the decision to buy the machines and whether they fit with uk policing last night city hall sources insisted mr boris johnson had known about the timetable for some time and was â very relaxed â about the delay
a spokesman for the mayor âs office for policing and crime defended the decision to purchase the cannon , pointing towards support for them among londoners
he said : â independent polling shows that the majority of londoners support the police having water cannon at their disposal for use in exceptional circumstances
' the mayor has made his position clear and awaits the home secretary âs licensing decision
â but critics of cannon warn that in incidents on the continent they have led to serious injury and even death
in one case in germany a man was blinded and in another a protester was stunned and then killed after being run over
water cannon have been used in northern ireland to quell public order incidents , but never on the uk mainland
calls for their introduction came during the 2011 riots and later student protests in the capital
last summer the prime minister âs spokesman also endorsed their use , saying the prime minister â supports â the police âs application for water cannon
mrs may and mr boris johnson two regularly appear at or near the top of polls on who tories would like as a future leader
she is known to regard the mayor as a ' faintly ridiculous ' figure
at the time the mayor purchased the machines , he was warned it could be a waste of taxpayers â money
when mr boris johnson purchased the machines he said it was ' highly likely ' the home secretary would sign off on their use , a political gamble that seems to have backfired mr boris johnson has previously urged police to get ' medieval ' on rioters , and said officers must never again be left powerless in the face of overwhelming violence like that seen during the riots
but he stressed the chances of the machines being used in the capital , or other mainland cities , remained ' vanishingly rare '
police argue water cannon would be useful in a static confrontation where there is a need to create space between police lines and violent crowds
they said it could have helped protect firefighters and paramedics after shops were set ablaze as rioting spread to croydon in 2011 .
