the thought may have occurred to sam robson that there has never been a better time to be an england specialist
as the nation rakes over the debris of yet another world cup fiasco , the test squad named on wednesday for next month âs three - match series in the caribbean will be depicted as english cricket âs chance to start the clean - up operation
and though the australian - born sam robson had his first taste of the big time last summer , he has not represented his adopted country since the oval test against india in august
selection for the west indies â for the first of 17 tests in 10 months â will almost feel like starting afresh , all over again
sam robson ( centre ) is ready to battle for his england place after a mixed maiden summer in test cricket sam robson celebrated his first england century in just his second test as he scored 127 against sri lanka sam robson âs quest to resume his opening partnership with cook will face competition if jonathan trott is deemed ready to resume his england career following his stress - related condition
but the prize is glittering on the horizon : the chance to help win back the ashes this summer
â to play in an ashes series would be massive for me , â sam robson told sportsmail
â i âd be lying if i said i was nât super keen
but there are five tests before then , and i âm hoping first and foremost to play in them
â sam robson âs first challenge will be to quell the chatter about his technique and nail the only spot in the test batting line - up that remains up for grabs
after scoring a composed century in only his second game for england , against sri lanka at headingley , he began the series against india with a steady 59 at trent bridge
six more test innings brought him a top score of 37
and , as one of the few batsmen not to cash in against a mediocre indian attack , he repeatedly found himself on the wrong end of the pundits â analysis
but sam robson 's judgement outside off stump has been questioned after dismissals caught behind and bowled sam robson tucks into the indian bowling at trent bridge last july , but failed to notch a ton against the tourists robson tests : 7 innings : 11 runs : 336 batting average : 30.54 hundreds : 1 fifties : 1 top score : 127 ( vs sri lanka ) trott tests : 49 innings : 87 runs : 3763 batting average : 46.45 hundreds : 9 fifties : 18 top score : 226 ( vs bangladesh ) last summer , he was caught in the cordon five times , bowled four times and lbw twice
experts made a simple diagnosis : sam robson had a flaw around off stump
â it is something i âm conscious of , â he said
â knowing where your off stump is as an opening batsman is crucial
i âve worked on it just as i âve worked on other areas of my game
but i âm not walking out there expecting never to nick another one
â i was a little bit disappointed not to get another big score last summer after i âd set myself a good base
but i still look back with pride on the 3 - 1 series win against india , and the test hundred was something which made me feel comfortable with the environment
â there was a very welcoming culture in the dressing - room , which helped all the young guys coming in
after the disappointing loss to sri lanka , that helped us turn things round pretty quickly
i âm hungry if i get another chance to score some big runs
â while many of the colleagues he hopes to team up with in the caribbean have spent the last few months confirming england âs traditional struggle with 50 - over cricket , sam robson has been assiduously working on his game in south africa with the ecb âs performance programme and the lions
and he reserves special praise for the coaching of andy and graham thorpe
â i âve always been someone who likes to hear as many views as possible , especially from guys who have played lots of test cricket , and then apply it to my own game , â he said
â in the end you âve got to work things out for yourself
jonathan trott could be ready to resume his england career , which would pile pressure on sam robson 's place the 25 - year - old opener has been able to learn from andrew strauss and chris rogers at middlesex â andy talks a lot about your approach to batting â how to score runs , as opposed to just technique
if he notices something technical , he âll say it
but he does nât just say stuff for the sake of it
he likes to keep things simple
they spot things , but they do nât go on and on
â only 25 , sam robson has already been privileged to open with andrew strauss and australia âs chris rogers at middlesex , as well as cook last summer â that âs 50 test centuries â worth of experience to learn from at the other end
â my game âs in good order , â said sam robson , who is currently in abu dhabi for a spot of pre-season training with middlesex
â i âve had enough cricket over the winter to work on it , and i feel refreshed
i feel ready to go and really hopeful of getting picked in the squad
i just want to get out there and do the job
