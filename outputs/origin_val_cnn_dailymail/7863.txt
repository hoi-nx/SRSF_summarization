' it would be an awful system , but at least a system , a manageable system
' but i feel , unfortunately , this is not the case
' there is no putin who gave a command to kill
but there is a putin who has built a hellish terminator and he has lost control of it
' she also warned : ' there is no one controlling the process any more - there is chaotic hatred
' hatred that is fuelled every day by the federal mass media
