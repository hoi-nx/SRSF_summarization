at the etihad stadium last month , one of the most gifted players of his generation was given the run of the place during barcelona âs 2 - 1 victory
it was an exhibition from the very best
andres iniesta took 112 touches in barcelona âs midfield , five more than his celebrated team - mate lionel messi and far more than any player in a city shirt
james milner , anointed by manuel pellegrini as one of his team âs most important players , was the highest with 64
the numbers simply do nât add up , which is one of the reasons english football is struggling to make an impact over two legs in champions league ties
when will our game learn ? probably never
andres iniesta , rested in barcelona 's win over eibar , is expected to return to the starting line - up against city barcelona 's croatian midfielder ivan rakitic controls the ball as xavi and pedro look on during training neymar aims a friendly kick at fellow barcelona striker luis suarez after the uruguayan had gone down the brazil captain was in high spirits as barcelona prepared for their champions league last 16 second leg â we play in a comprehensive manner and we want possession so that they suffer , â admitted andres iniesta as he prepares to pull on the red and blue stripes of barcelona once more
â we need to find our superior skills and minimise their potential
we want to control what goes on in every moment
we have to beat city with a complete performance
â barcelona are conditioned to play a certain way , all possession - based and keeping the ball in circulation until they can find a way through the gaps in city âs defence
andres iniesta is a slave to the game , a man still seeking perfection even after three triumphs in the champions league , plus two european championships and the 2010 world cup , in which he scored the winner for spain
barcelona will be hoping to reach the champions league quarter finals by holding off manchester cit barcelona have not failed to reach europe 's last eight since 2007 , and saw off city at the same stage last season his incredible strike against chelsea in the 2009 champions league semi-final , second leg at stamford bridge is one of the most dramatic goals in the history of the game
at the age of 30 , he wants more
â we do not gather as a team to discuss what we can achieve , but the important thing is that we know what the possibilities are , â he added
â there are no guarantees , but we know that we are doing well and we are prepared for this match
â enrique âs team are in fine fettle , a point ahead of real madrid at the top of la liga ahead of el clasico on sunday and on course for the champions league quarter - final if they can protect their 2 - 1 advantage
the barcelona players move the ball around during a training exercise ahead of the vital showdown with city manager enrique will be hoping his team take another step on the road towards berlin the final of the copa del rey awaits later in the season , when andres iniesta can add to his extensive list of honours when enrique âs team face athletic bilbao
â we do nât think beyond city because we have to concentrate , even if we had a good result in the first leg , â he said
â right now the team is in good shape , but this is a difficult period of the season
we are in the final of copa del rey , the champions league and all the little details will play a role tomorrow
â on sunday we have an important match against our rivals , but this is the champions league and city have great players
â andres iniesta is wary of the threat posed by former barcelona midfielder toure much will be expected of toure , returning from suspension to play against his former team at the nou camp as city attempt to overturn a 2 - 1 deficit
this will be a tough night for a team who can not keep the ball , but toure âs goalscoring ability , along with those powerful runs that start from deep - lying positions , could give them a chance
andres iniesta added : â he is very important for them , he is very powerful physically and he has important qualities because of all his skills
â we âll try to minimise his potential
