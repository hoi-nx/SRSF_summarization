berry was visited by his aunt on saturday and he told her that he had been jumped by ten people who beat him and ' choked him to sleep
' ' pretty much they left him there for dead , ' said shavondria wright
the incident happened at 3:15 p.m. but he was left unchecked by the guards until 9:45 p.m. that night , she said
' no one deserves this , ' said harris
' they 're not being protected
i do n't care what they 're there for , they still need to be protected
' the attack also appears to be gang related
the caption of the photo posted on facebook reads : ' when you disrespect the g.d. nation , it brings nothing but pain and suffering
' that is understood to be a reference to the gang , g.d. nation , short for ' gangsta disciples
