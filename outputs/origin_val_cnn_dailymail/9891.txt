a police mugshot of mukesh singh : one of four men convicted for the rape and murder of jyoti singh , he says women are ' far more responsible ' for rape a man who took part in the notorious gang rape and murder of a medical student in new delhi blames her for the attack , saying ' you ca n't clap with one hand - it takes two
' ' a decent girl wo n't roam around at 9 o'clock at night , ' said mukesh singh , one of four men condemned to death for the hideous sex attack that shocked the world two years ago
' a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy
boy and girl are not equal
housework and housekeeping is for girls , not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things , wearing wrong clothes
' about 20 per cent of girls are good
' the depraved murder of jyoti singh in december 2012 sparked revulsion across the world as well as a wave of protests in india , where people demanded a change in attitudes towards women
the 23 - year - old student had been returning from a cinema with a male friend on a sunday evening when she accepted a lift from the off - duty charter bus
once inside , bus driver mukesh singh , his brother ram , gym instructor vinay sharma , 20 , bus cleaner akshay thakur , 28 , fruit - seller pawan gupta , 19 , and an unnamed teenager subjected to a horrific rape
she died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen , genitals and intestines
jyoti 's death sparked a period of deep soul searching in india , where equal rights for women are enshrined in the constitution but rarely effective in practise
but even today , mukesh singh remains unrepentant
in an in - depth interview with filmmaker udwin , as part of a documentary to be broadcast on bbc four , he blamed jyoti for daring to fight back against her attackers
' when being raped , she should n't fight back
she should just be silent and allow the rape , ' he said
' then they 'd have dropped her off after " doing her " , and only hit [ her friend ] the boy
' his impending execution , he suggests , is a foolish move that will only endanger future rape victims
' the death penalty will make things even more dangerous for girls , ' he said
' now when they rape , they wo n't leave the girl like we did
' before , they would rape and say , " leave her , she wo n't tell anyone
" now when they rape , especially the criminal types , they will just kill the girl
' mukesh singh and his accomplices treated jyoti no better
after luring her aboard the bus , they took turns raping her and beat her with an iron rod when frantically tried to fight them off
two blood stained metal rods were later retrieved from the bus ; medical staff confirmed that ' it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals , uterus and intestines '
and after the rapists had enough , rather than ' dropping her off ' they threw her and her friend from the moving bus
mukesh singh then allegedly tried to run them over , but her friend had enough strength left to pull jyoti out of the way
despite efforts to get her the best medical care , even flying her to a hospital in singapore , jyoti died 13 days later , having suffered brain damage , pneumonia , and abdominal infection
doctors had already been forced to remove most of her intestine
protest : jyoti 's death sparked outrage in india with many taking to the new delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second - class citizens anger : protestors had given jyoti - whose name was at that point still barred from release - the name damini after a bollywood film of the same name where the protagonist fought for justice after a rape ordeal outrage : protestors hold candles in new delhi during a night vigil following the 23 - year - old student 's gang - rape and murder
it was this outpouring that inspired the documentary about jyoti 's death for filmmaker ms udwin it was not the horror of the attack that compelled her to make her documentary , but the outpouring of anger in india at the social conditions that allowed it to happen
' when news of this gang - rape hit our tv screens in december 2012 , i was as shocked and upset as we all are when faced with such brazen abandon of the norms of â civilised â society , ' she said
' but what actually inspired me to commit to the harrowing and difficult journey of making this film was the optimism occasioned by the reports that followed the rape
' courageous and impassioned ordinary men and women of india braved the december freeze to protest in unprecedented numbers , withstanding an onslaught of teargas shells , lathi charges and water canons , to make heard their cry of " enough is enough "
' in this regard , india led the world by example
in my lifetime , i ca nât recall any other country standing up with such commitment and determination for women âs rights
' mukesh singh , who denies raping jyoti but admitted driving the bus where she was attacked , and three others are currently awaiting the outcome of appeals against their convictions
his brother ram , widely considered leader of the group , was found dead in his cell in march 2013
the fifth , juvenile perpetrator was also convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to three years in a reform facility
passing sentence on the gang in september 2013 , a judge condemned their ' exceptional depravity ' .
