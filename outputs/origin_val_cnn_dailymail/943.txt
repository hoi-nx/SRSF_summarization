mixed martial arts is the biggest growing sport in the world and every thursday , bleacher report will bring you a buzzing story
their five - star mobile app â team stream â helps you follow the mma 24 - 7 : download now ufc title shots do n't come around all too often
they are rarely earned without sacrifice and can serve as a fighter 's career - defining accomplishment
but as difficult as it is to cement a shot at promotional gold , it 's even tougher to take advantage of the opportunity
and for those challengers who taste defeat only to feel their time in the spotlight slip away , forging a divisional comeback is the only way to patch the wound
here are three recently vanquished title threats who may be close to earning another shot at gold
joseph benavidez team alpha male standout joseph benavidez resides in a division dictated by arguably the most dominant champion around in demetrious johnson
but considering joseph benavidez is the flyweight version of urijah faber , meaning he does n't lose outside of a title fight , the two men should cross paths once more
joseph benavidez ( right ) kicks ortiz in their flyweight bout during the ufc event in november ortiz ( right ) punches joseph benavidez in their flyweight bout during the ufc fight night event expected to take on fellow mighty mouse leftover john moraga at ufc , the 30 - year - old has a chance to extend his current win streak to three
and in a weight class as shallow as a glass of water , joseph benavidez could once again find himself fighting for a title by the end of 2015 ( if not early next year )
he 's a premier draw at 125 pounds , and one of only a few contenders who can actually instil some doubt about the champ 's unheralded reign
benson henderson despite a recent jump up to welterweight and an impressive finish over rising contender thatch , former lightweight champ benson henderson is still in the mix at 155 pounds
add in the fact that anthony pettis just handed his title over to rafael dos anjos at ufc 185 , and benson henderson should have an easier track back to contention considering showtime had beaten him twice
benson henderson ( left ) lands a kick to the body of thatch in their welterweight fight benson henderson attempts a submission against thatch in their welterweight fight last month while rda also defeated smooth via knockout less than one year ago , it was a close contest before the brazilian landed on unforeseen uppercut that shortly put benson henderson on another planet
needless to say , the 31 - year - old is still in the pinnacle of his career and remains one of the most dangerous entities in the deepest division in mma
he 'll be able to log two more octagon appearances by the end of the year and will have enough momentum to earn a shot should he win both outings
ricardo lamas with an epic showdown between featherweight kingpin aldo and irish sensation mcgregor looming in the distance , guys like ricardo lamas are being drastically overlooked
while aldo swiftly defended his title opposite the bully at ufc 169 , ricardo lamas did enough in the championships rounds to suggest an upset could happen should he dominate early
ricardo lamas punches bermudez in their featherweight bout in mexico city last november ricardo lamas knocks bermudez to the mat with a kick in their featherweight fight but in order to get back into the mix in a division ruled by two international dynamos , the 32 - year - old chicagoan must debunk the evolving arsenal of former title contender mendes when the two collide at ufc fight night 63
mendes is another name that could easily make this list , but he is at least two impressive victories away from a trilogy fight with the champion
of course , if mcgregor captures the title from aldo in july at ufc 189 , then all slates will be wiped clean .
