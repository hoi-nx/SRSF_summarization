emotional france coach saint-andre has launched a scathing attack on his own players following saturday 's lackluster 20 - 13 defeat to wales in the rbs six nations , saying the team has become ' the father christmas of international rugby ' because it gives away so many points
his voice trembling with emotion , saint-andre looked on the verge of tears sunday as he made it clear he feels extremely let down
' international rugby is about combat , humility
but above all it 's a collective sport
we do n't need starlets , ' he said
' in rugby , the team is the star and we need champions
yesterday , i did n't see any champions , or not many

next up is a tricky away match in italy followed by a full - blooded showdown with england at twickenham
flyhalf camille lopez was particularly poor , missing two of his four penalty kicks - and yoann huget 's first - half try was ruled out because of lopez 's careless forward pass
' for my part , i do n't think i played badly , ' a defiant lopez said
' i tried different things ... let 's keep on daring

asked if some players are now playing for their futures , six months ahead of the world cup , saint-andre replied with an emphatic ' yes ' - although he stopped short of saying some would never play for france again under his leadership
' i only want players who are ready to go to the end of the world
if anyone thinks that international rugby is too difficult , then they have my telephone number , ' he said
' they can call me and i 'll take someone else
i 'll even take a 20 - year - old lad who 's never played in the top 14 ( french league ) before

almost all of that side has gone and saint-andre has been rebuilding ever since , although his habit of constantly tinkering with the side has not helped instill continuity
but he feels the players should take more responsibility and show more pride
' i 've covered and supported them for three years
at some stage you need to know how to win games at the highest level , ' he said
' the french jersey should not only be something you 're proud of but also something that enables you to surpass yourself
you need to be a gladiator
it 's thumbs up for wales star jamie roberts after their win against france at the france ' we 've lost four in a row to the welsh , this has to stop
we have guys who started playing ( regularly ) three years ago and now have 30 caps
it 's time to stop hiding
' an irate saint-andre raised his voice several times during a passionate news conference
' at some point you have to ask the right questions
we 're at our level , that 's the truth , ' he said
' it takes the welsh 30 seconds to score three points and it takes us four minutes
we 're the father christmas of international rugby and that 's what i told the players
' however , saint-andre is no mood to quit
' i 've never abandoned ship , whether as a player , as a captain or as a manager
i 've been given a role : to prepare this team for the world cup , ' he said
' i 'll fight every day to do that
