the emotional two - hour season finale of fox 's " glee " went full circle from the show 's roots to the future , reminding gleeks why they fell in love with the musical sitcom
few would disagree that the show 's first season was its best , winning over a dedicated fan base who stuck with the show through an uneven six seasons and the loss of star monteith
for its final episode friday night , the show that made it cool to join the high school glee club focused on core characters introduced in the first season
the first hour of friday 's season finale , aptly titled " 2009 , " was a retelling of the first episode , which included a memorable performance of journey 's " do n't stop believing " by the original members of william mckinley high school 's glee club
instead of telling it again through finn 's perspective , the finale showed what led the other characters to join new directions , culminating in an edited version of the performance that packed an emotional punch by featuring monteith
the second hour brought us to the present day , with will passing new directions on to sam so he can take charge of mckinley high as a fine arts school

the entirety of new directions , past and present , gathered one last time in the auditorium , now named after finn
