' they were two exceptional young men with such promise - kind , funny and full of life
their deaths have left their families and many good friends utterly devastated
' neil dalton and aidan brunger were having a wonderful time in borneo working in sarawak hospital and also travelling around seeing as much of the beautiful country as they could
' both boys said how very welcoming and friendly the people were
our sons would soon have qualified as doctors
' their unprovoked and senseless murders as they were walking home after a night out with other medical students mean that aidan brunger and neil dalton will never have the chance to spend their lives caring for and helping others
' they would have given so much to the world
we are so very proud of both of them and in what they achieved in their all too short lives
' although we are pleased that the man responsible for their murders has been held accountable , the guilty verdict does not bring our sons back
' zulkipli abdullah ( pictured at an earlier hearing ) has been found guilty of murdering the two students they thanked their families and friends for helping through ' these distressing times ' and asked to be allowed to ' grieve in peace '
their british lawyer , kieran mitchell , from slater and gordon , said : ' this was a savage and unprovoked attack which lead to the death of two young men who had travelled to borneo with the sole aim of using their medical skills to help people
' since that day the families have put their faith in the borneo justice system , which is very different to our own , adding further strain and difficulty during this devastating ordeal
' after a long and complicated trial they are relieved that justice has been done
' violent crime against tourists and expatriates is generally rare in the muslim - majority southeast asian country
but some recent incidents have sullied that image
malaysia police in june last year found the body of a 34 - year - old british tourist on the resort island of tioman
the case is still being investigated
a month later , a court sentenced to death a malaysia shopkeeper for the killing of a french female tourist in 2011 , also on tioman .
