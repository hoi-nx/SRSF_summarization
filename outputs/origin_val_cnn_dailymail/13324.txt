flying with your cute little bundle of doggie love ? each airline has its own rules about how to bring a small dog in the cabin or a larger dog in its crate with the checked luggage
not in the checked luggage , as an independent chihuahua discovered on tuesday
the dog was discovered in its owner 's checked luggage by tsa officers at laguardia in queens , new york
luckily for the dog , the tsa screens all checked luggage
the officers in search of more dangerous items found the dog and called the owner , who had not intended to bring her darling dog on her tuesday trip
the woman 's husband took the misbehaving pooch home
the tsa 's security procedures do not prohibit you from bringing a pet on your flight , but a more breathable crate is suggested
on the other hand , traveling with torch lighters that look like grenades ? those are always prohibited
