per per mertesacker says that a frank team meeting between the defenders has sorted out the problems that bedevilled arsenal 's first leg of their champions league tie against monaco
the gunners face monaco on tuesday night knowing they must score at least three times after their 3 - 1 defeat at the emirates stadium last month
but per mertesacker , the arsenal vice-captain claims that the response of the team since that result â with four straight wins , including the cup sixth - round victory at united , and in conceding just two goals since then â is an indication that the team is ready to overturn the two - goal deficit and produce an extraordinary comeback
per per mertesacker speaks to the assembled media ahead of arsenal 's champions league tie in monaco the world cup winner shares a joke with mesut ozil as the gunners prepare for their second - leg clash ' we speak a lot to each other , even when we win , ' said per mertesacker
' we need to learn after defeat and winning
we always try to improve as a defensive unit
it âs always a topic to analyse things that went right and things went wrong
â after that game lot of things did nât go well
that is a mental thing for tomorrow
we know mentally that we were nât really up for it and at times we could feel there was a bit of pressure and we could nât really cope with that
' but we feel after the game we moved on from that and that âs why we âre confident we can beat any team in the world
â we âre coming out of great week with two important wins and a good level of confidence
there is always a good mood in the squad and during the season we âve responded well
but we have to face truth and show a different face tomorrow
we need to embrace the challenge
