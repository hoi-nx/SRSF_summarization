islamist campaigner : asim qureshi is research director of the cage human rights pressure group the islamist campaigner who described jihadi john as a â beautiful young man â claims he himself was turned into an â anti-white racist â at private school
asim qureshi , 33 , said he and other ethnic minority children were ghettoised at Â£ 18,000 - a - year whitgift in croydon , south london
rich white boys â particularly rugby players â apparently bullied and racially abused â five foot nothing asians â
the campaigner sparked outrage last week when he made himself chief apologist for the suddenly - unmasked british islamic state killer mohammed emwazi , claiming the terrorist was radicalised by security service harassment
mr asim qureshi , the research director of the controversial cage human rights pressure group , has known emwazi for years , and has previously been caught on camera urging muslims to support jihad during a rally the american embassy in london
but the daily mail can reveal that the campaigner had previously told how he became actively â anti-white â himself â and blamed it on rich white pupils at elite whitgift
fees for full boarders there are Â£ 35,000 - a - year
mr asim qureshi , who lives in a Â£ 530,000 detached house in surrey , was born in britain to pakistanis parents and â thanks to his mother âs ice - cream business â was sent to 400 - year - old john whitgift
he said : â it is a very expensive private school
it is one of those schools that has every single facility available
i did not necessarily , from an academic perspective , take the best advantage of it
bullying claims : mr asim qureshi said he and other ethnic minority children were ghettoised at Â£ 18,000 - a - year whitgift ( pictured ) in croydon , south london â every single student who goes to that school is expected to come up with straight as
â but even within that school , we formed a ghetto very , very quickly amongst our ethnicities because , even though these kids came from very well - off families , they still had an intense level of racism
â especially the rugby lads , who were known to be extremely racist because they were built like tanks , all of them
american small asians , five foot nothing , would not stand a chance against them
â mr asim qureshi , speaking to american academics four years ago - a transcript of which has now surfaced - continued : â we formed cliques very quickly
â the chinese , the blacks , the pakistanis , and the indians , we would all be together in the same crowds
we would move around in the same circles
â many of the white kids would be coming from very rich areas , and we would be taking the bus
terrorist : mohammed emwazi was suddenly unmasked last week as the islamic state killer jihadi john â their parents would be picking them up in their bentleys , and their rolls-royces , and their aston martins from the front of the school
â we would be going to bus stop at the back of the school and going back down to our area , which was not so affluent
in fact , there was a bus stop in croydon , which is on our way back home
we used to call this bus stop terminal three
in heathrow airport , terminal three is the terminal that all the ethnic minorities take to go back to their countries of origin
â mr asim qureshi added : â sports was one of the things that helped get me through in many ways
i played squash at a county level
â he said that after his gcses his parents could no longer afford the whitgift fees so instead sent him to grammar school wilson âs , in nearby wallington , surrey
in marked contrast to the public school , he said , the races mixed freely
mr asim qureshi continued : â when i turned up , i came with the same kind of anti-white racist attitude that i had developed in whitgift because i felt that all white people must be like this
outspoken : mr asim qureshi has known emwazi for years , and has previously been caught on camera urging muslims to support jihad during a rally the american embassy in london ( pictured ) â what was amazing is how that was broken down completely
for the first time in my life i had white friends
for the first time in my life i could relate to white people
â after â doing not very well â at a-levels â spending much of his time listening to â hardcore hip hop â - mr asim qureshi went on to study law at london guildhall university , which he described as â not a great university but i did enjoy my time there â
while a student he said he â began to choose an islamic identity â for himself
the whitgift headmaster from before mr asim qureshi started until today has been dr christopher barnett â who says in his welcome to prospective pupils the school staff â welcome boys from a wide variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds â , and â regard the diversity and richness that this brings as a real strength of the school
â he was unavailable for comment last night
the historic school was founded in 1596 by queen elizabeth i âs last archbishop of canterbury john whitgift
it now educates 1,300 boys in the former stately home of lord howard of effingham , who fought the spanish armada
the school motto is vincit qui patitur â â he who perseveres , conquers â .
