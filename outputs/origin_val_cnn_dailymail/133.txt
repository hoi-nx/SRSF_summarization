i 'm 33 and have been single for nearly four years
most of my friends hint , imply or say it 's my fault for being too shallow , picky and prone to falling for bad boys
i use tinder , the dating app synonymous with casual sex , to meet attractive men who meet my high standards
yvette caster , 33 , had been single for four years , before she decided to do an experiment where she swiped right to all men on tinder for a week it 's a great way of filtering out those you find physically unattractive - just swipe left and they ca n't even message you
if you like them you swipe right and , if they feel the same , you can chat
most of the time i swipe right to one in 50 - many are too old ( over 35 ) , too young ( under 25 ) , too dull ( into sport ) , too much of a party animal or simply too ugly
but , after another friend accused me of being picky , i decided to see what would happen if i swiped right to all men on tinder for a week
sunday the first day is the worst
within a few minutes i 've swiped right to someone with head to foot tattoos , a man with his three children and lots of frowning blokes in their pants
after an hour i 'm exhausted , depressed and have opened the flood gates for 80 , mostly unsuitable , suitors
monday i get up at 6.30am to swipe right to man who looks like a serial killer , a ricky gervais double and a range of football logos ( you can put any image as your profile picture )
then a message from tinder appears
they 've noticed my promiscuous swiping and i ca n't ' like ' another man for another 24 hours
why would i want to ? i 've already received 43 matches and seven messages before 9am
after the first day of swiping right to all men , the london - based journalist was met with 43 matches and seven messages , all before 9am tuesday i have messages from 22 men and am chatting to all of them to avoid being ' too picky '
the fact they want to talk to me is a revelation
i usually have messages from two men a week , tops
of the 22 , a couple are lascivious but the majority are from nice , down to earth guys
it 's just a shame so few of them can spell
i have n't messaged any of them first , either , as i prefer them to do the chasing
wednesday it 's only just dawning on me how much admin is involved in being promiscuous
keeping 22 different chats going is hard work and confusing , especially when so many men are called dave
at times i copy and paste the same message to all the guys , which is rude but it 's either that or no reply
i ca n't quite believe so many of them are being so polite
my normal tinder experience , picking only the hot guys , is sleazy pick up lines followed by unsolicited pictures or their penis or even indecent videos
maybe i really could find a boyfriend this way after all
tinder clocked on to yvette caster 's promiscuous swiping and sent her a message banning her from ' liking ' anyone else for 24 hours thursday the chats have gone so well that i 've given my number to three men , although i 'm still doubtful about whether i could be physically attracted to them
on the one hand , this whole thing feels slightly immoral , or at least an exercise in leading men on
but on the other , if i think about my exes , i 'd probably have swiped left to at least a couple as they won me over with charm and humour , not looks
friday i 've been asked on three dates - nice dinner dates , not hook ups
one guy has outright asked to be my boyfriend
another , who is far too young really , has been keeping me entertained with perfect flirty texts
i 'm starting to think this is the way forward
the 33 - year - old found that attractive men were more likely to message sleazy pick - up lines ( left ) , whereas less attractive men tended to be more polite and seek relationships saturday just because i can , i go back to swiping right on all men again - men with big beards ( yuk ) , men pictured with their much better looking friend and men who think women are attracted to star wars screen grabs
i also have 69 matches and those dates to prepare for
in the end , none of them prove to be the one , but i did have some lovely evenings - good company and intelligent conversation
would i do it again ? why not ? some men need a chance to win your heart while others , well , they 're just very bad at choosing profile pics .
