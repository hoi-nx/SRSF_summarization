banks will be hit with an extra Â£ 1billion tax until the deficit has been completely cleared , under new lib proposals
the new 8 per cent levy - which effectively strips the banks of the benefit of the government 's corporation tax cuts â will form a key plank of the party 's election manifesto
treasury secretary alexander said the tax hike will help the next government find the Â£ 30billion of savings after the election needed to balance the books
the lib economic spokesman alexander wants to introduce a new 8 per cent levy on banks like the conservatives , the lib are committed eliminating the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18
but unlike the tories - who say they would do it through spending cuts alone - the lib say they would seek to raise at least Â£ 8 billion through extra taxes
the annual levy on banks , which was introduced in 2010 , currently brings in around Â£ 2.5billion a year
mr alexander 's proposals are expected to take that up to Â£ 3.5billion a year
a ' mansion tax ' on homes worth over Â£ 2million will raise an extra Â£ 1.5billion , and a crackdown on tax avoidance could save Â£ 6billion , the lib claim
the lib economic spokesman said : ' failings in the banking system were a major factor in the great crash of 2008
' that 's why we have always insisted that the banks help fund repairing the economy
' to that end , we introduced the bank levy which is on track to raise Â£ 8billion in this parliament
' with the final stage of deficit reduction requiring around Â£ 30billion of savings , it would be totally wrong for all of that to be found from cuts to public services as the conservatives propose
' lib believe that we must balance the books and do so fairly , so it is only right to reconsider whether banks are making a fair contribution to deficit reduction
' this tax would remain in place until that job is complete
' the tories and lib are committed eliminating the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18
but the lib want to raise at least Â£ 8 billion through extra taxes , while george osborne ( pictured ) insists it can be achieved through spending cuts alone all the revenue raised from the new bank tax will go towards paying down the deficit
the lib will push for the measure to be included in the forthcoming budget â but if the tories resist , it will be included in the lib manifesto
mr alexander added : ' many banks were left seriously weakened after the crash
' but as a result of our comprehensive range of reforms , and the strong economic recovery , the banking sector is now returning to health and profitability
' so now is the right time to ask the sector to contribute a little more to help us balance the nation 's books
that 's the right way to keep our strong economy on track , and build a fairer society too
' industry group the british banking association criticised the proposal , saying that banks in the uk already pay more tax than any other industry
labour 's shadow treasury secretary chris leslie added : ' nobody will trust what the lib say after they broke their promises on tax by raising vat on families while giving millionaires a huge tax cut
' labour will introduce a tax on bank bonuses to pay for a jobs programme for young people
we 'll reverse this government 's Â£ 3billion a year tax cut for the top 1 per cent of earners to help get the deficit down fairly
' and we 'll increase the bank levy , which has raised over Â£ 2billion less than the government promised , to pay for more free childcare for working parents
the lib have joined the tories in opposing all these fair policies
