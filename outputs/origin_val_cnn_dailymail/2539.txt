the homeland security department is investigating two senior secret service agents accused of crashing a car into a white house security barrier
mark connolly , the second - in - command on president barack obama 's security detail , and george ogilvie , a senior supervisor in the washington field office , reportedly drove a government car into the barricades after drinking at a late - night retirement party last week
secret service spokesman robert hoback said recently appointed director clancy has been briefed on the march 4 incident and that clancy has asked the homeland security department 's inspector general 's office to investigate the incident
officers on duty who witnessed the incident reportedly tried to arrest the agents and conduct a sobriety test , but a supervisor said to let the men go home
president barack obama is aware of the incident and the investigation
the washington post reports that the men had been at a bar to celebrate the retirement of departing secret service spokesman edwin donovan
mark connolly and george ogilvie have declined to comment , though it is believed that the incident was likely caught on secret service video , which feeds to the agency 's command center
according to witnesses , the two men had their flashing lights on and were showing their badges as they tried to get through a section of the grounds that had been closed as a suspicious package was being investigated at around 10:30pm
it was then that they struck the barricade , after also driving through some security tape
it is illegal to use the flashing lights on a government vehicle without a security reason , or to drive a vehicle after consuming any alcohol
in 2013 a civilian who crashed into a barricade at the white house was chased by police and shot and killed
' the secret service is aware of the allegations of misconduct involving two of our employees at the white house complex , ' said secret service spokesman brian leary , a spokesman for the secret service
' if misconduct is identified , appropriate action will be taken based on established rules and regulations
' also commenting on the situation were house oversight chairman jason chaffetz of utah and member elijah cummings of maryland who said in a statement ; ' the fact that this event involved senior - level agents is not only embarrassing but exhibits a clear lack of judgment in a potentially dangerous situation
' the committee as a whole remains committed to restoring the integrity of this elite agency and improving accountability at all staff levels
' the crash investigation is the latest embarrassment for the agency tasked with protecting the president
in the last six months , several top agency officials , including former director pierson , have been forced out amid revelations of multiple , serious presidential security breaches
in september , a texas man armed with a knife was able to climb a white house fence and run deep into the executive mansion before being apprehended
an internal investigation and an outside panel report both described serious problems within the agency
a four - member panel of former senior government officials concluded in a report released last year that the agency was too insular and starving for leadership
the panel recommended an agency outsider to replace pierson , but barack obama earlier this year tapped clancy , a retired agent who led the agency on an interim basis after pierson 's ouster
