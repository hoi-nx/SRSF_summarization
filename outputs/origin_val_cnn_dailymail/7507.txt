irwin has hailed daley 's versatility and backed him to retain a place in the united starting xi , even when injured players return
the former united left - back , who made 529 appearances for the club between 1990 and 2002 , was impressed by blind when he played in that position during sunday 's 3 - 0 win over spurs
it was united 's best performance of the season , keeping them anchored in the premier league top four and boosting confidence ahead of this weekend 's crunch trip to anfield to play liverpool
daley ( right ) was impressive for united in sunday 's 3 - 0 win over spurs irwin , seen here celebrating a goal with david beckham in 1997 , believes daley deserves his place in the team sunday 's clash between united and liverpool will be pivotal in the top four race ' daley 's a good , honest pro , ' irwin told manutd.com
' he can play at centre - half if you need him , left - back if you need him , and obviously he 's played mostly in midfield for us this season
i think he 's been a really good signing
' he 's a player who reads situations very , very well , i thought he played extremely well on sunday
it 'll be interesting to see the team the manager picks against liverpool , but it would n't surprise me if he picks the same 11 players , because they played so well
' that 's the manager 's decision and he 's got one or two back from suspension and injury , but i thought the team played very well on sunday
' blind sets off in pursuit of arsenal 's francis coquelin during last week 's fa cup sixth round tie blind celebrates scoring a late equaliser for united at west ham last month the dutch international also scored a crucial late goal at west brom earlier in the campaign dutch international blind , who arrived at old trafford from ajax for Â£ 13.8m last summer , has at times struggled for form this season but is showing signs of adapting to the english game
irwin added : ' i know blind can fill in places and he 's done tremendously well for us in midfield
' he has n't played at left - back that many times , he 's not played centre - half in a three that many times for us but we know he can play there
' i thought phil jones and chris smalling were aggressive , did n't give harry kane much room , and antonio valencia played really well at right - back , so it was good to see and we 'll need plenty of that at anfield
