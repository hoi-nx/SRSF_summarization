it seems everyone is getting in on the " ghostbusters " reboot action
but not everyone is happy about it
deadline reports that sony is planning an all - male " ghostbusters " reboot starring channing tatum and directed and produced by brothers anthony russo and anthony russo
the studio is also creating a production company , ghostcorps , which will include reitman and dan aykroyd , who were among the original " ghostbusters " team , according to deadline
" we want to expand the ghostbusters universe in ways that will include different films , tv shows , merchandise , all things that are part of modern filmed entertainment , " deadline quoted reitman as saying
the film " has a wonderful idea that builds " on the premise of an all - female " ghostbusters " reboot expected to begin filming this summer
that film is expected to star melissa mccarthy , kristen wiig , leslie jones and kate mckinnon
" it 's just the beginning of what i hope will be a lot of wonderful movies , " deadline quoted reitman as saying
" ghostbusters " is , after all , a well - loved comedy classic that gave the world the stay-puft marshmallow man
but the news , close on the heels the much - lauded all - female " ghostbusters " reboot , has met with mixed reviews
" could n't u just let the girls have this one one freaking time ? " twitter user jessieroro13 posted
others think perhaps it 's time to derail the hollywood reboot train , no matter which gender is in the driver 's seat
" how about no # ghostbusters reboots , redos or remakes , " twitter user ea_creative wrote
" why mess with perfection ? " the all - female " ghostbusters " film is expected to be out next year
all all - male version is tentatively expected to begin filming in the summer of 2016 , to be released the following year , reitman told deadline .
