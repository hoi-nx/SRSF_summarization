tierney hinde , pictured with son presley , suffered a nightmare pontins holiday a young mother has told how her first holiday away with her son was ruined after she discovered blood splattered on her chalet windows and mould throughout
tierney hinde , 28 , from dartford , kent , was disgusted with the state of her pontins apartment , with the nightmare starting when she discovered the dirty bed linen
things got worse when she was offered a different room on a higher floor with blood - spattered windows at the resort in camber , east sussex
' it was supposed to be the first trip with my son but it was a farce that 's all i can say , ' said ms tierney hinde
i do n't really get like that but it was just a complete waste of time
' she chose pontins over other resorts because the locks on the doors would provide security for autistic son presley , four , who has a tendency to wander off
the windows were cleaned off but tierney hinde was still unhappy because being higher up meant more danger for presley
as she predicted the youngster , who has poor co-ordination , fell down the landing steps , although no fault has been attributed to pontins for this
tierney hinde was also disappointed by the lack of activities available for presley
she said : ' pontins should be getting involved with all of the kids and it was n't like that at all
' all he wanted to do was go towards the arcades because there was nothing else for him
' i went there when i was 15 and nothing had changed since then and they were supposed to have had a rebirth in 2011
' tierney hinde became upset after discovering the bed linen was filthy in her pontins chalet the mould in the bathroom added to the young mum 's worry , and she requested to move rooms tierney hinde was so upset that she gave up on her week - long trip , which cost Â£ 500 , after three days
she has since been offered 50 per cent off vouchers and vip treatment on her next stay , but refuses to step foot in the resort again
