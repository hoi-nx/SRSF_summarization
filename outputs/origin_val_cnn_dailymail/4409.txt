farage was likened to nazi propagandist goebbels last night as he was forced to backtrack over a call to scrap most of british âs race relations laws
the ukip leader prompted a storm of controversy by suggesting he wanted to reverse legislation dating back to the 1960s which bars discrimination at work on the grounds of race or colour
his remarks were condemned by the leaders of the other three main parties
david cameron said mr farage appeared â desperate for attention â , while ed miliband said the comments were â wrong , divisive and dangerous â
nick clegg said mr farage created fear by confusing ideas
iraqi - born conservative mp for stratford - on - avon nadhim zahawi , a member of the no 10 policy board , told lbc radio : â the remark i found most difficult , and certainly hurt by , [ is when ] he talks about employers being able to discriminate in favour of british - born citizens
â i was nât born in british , but i feel equally british to farage or anyone else
these remarks make me feel very frightened that a man like farage , who aspires to lead the country , who says that he âs leading a serious party , actually takes the attitude that if you are not british - born , you âre not equal
it âs a dog whistle
' it âs a remark goebbels would be proud of
his remarks are deeply racist
he should withdraw and apologise
â last night the ukip leader claimed his remarks had been misinterpreted and that he did not want to scrap anti- discrimination legislation
instead , he focused on less controversial suggestions that firms should be allowed to favour british job applicants
he said : â what i am saying is very simple : i âm saying that i think british companies should be allowed the presumption of favouring british applicants for jobs over those from southern and eastern europe
â both labour and conservative politicians , notably former prime minister gordon brown , have made similar proposals of a system of â british jobs for british workers â
the row erupted after mr farage , interviewed by trevor phillips , the former chairman of the equality and human rights commission , for a channel 4 documentary to be screened next week , said british faced an â especial problem â with some muslim immigrants
iraqi - born conservative mp for stratford - on - avon nadhim zahawi compared the ukip leader to goebbels while david cameron said he was ' desperate for attention ' â people do see a fifth column living within our country , who hate us and want to kill us , â he said
mr farage then suggested that race and other anti-discrimination laws could be abolished on the grounds that people were now â colour blind â
pressed on which legislation he would get rid of , the ukip leader said : â much of it
â asked whether there would be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour if ukip were ever in power , mr farage added : â no â¦ because we take the view , we are colour blind
we as a party are colour blind
â i think the employer should be much freer to make decisions on who she or he employs
i think the situation that we now have , where an employer is not allowed to choose between a british - born person and somebody from poland , is a ludicrous state of affairs
â i would argue that the law does need changing , and that if an employer wishes to choose , or you can use the word â discriminate â if you want to , but wishes to choose to employ a british - born person , they should be allowed to do so
â in the channel 4 interview : trevor phillips : â in ukipland there would be no law against discrimination on the grounds of nationality
would there be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour ? â farage : â no. we are colour blind
we as a party are colour blind
â yesterday : farage : â i did nât mention race at all â it was no part of that interview with trevor phillips at all â¦ i am not proposing abolishing the race relations laws in british
â challenged later about his remarks , the ukip leader appeared to reverse his position , insisting : â i did nât mention race at all
i am not proposing abolishing the race relations laws
i âm talking about lightening employment legislation so that small employers â and do nât forget , there are nearly five million in british â are less fearful of taking on young british workers
â mr farage suggested his critics were racist , rather than him , since they assumed he meant â white â when he talked about â british â workers , while he insisted his proposed changes would help â young black and white british people â
last night the prime minister said : â what farage has said is completely wrong and , frankly , pretty appalling
the reason these laws are in place is to stop people being discriminated against on the basis of the colour of their skin
â sadiq khan , labour âs shadow justice secretary , said : â this is one of the most shocking things i have ever heard from a mainstream politician , and demonstrates breathtaking ignorance
â we have made huge progress on tackling racial inequality and discrimination in this country , but things are still far from perfect
â when my parents moved to london [ from pakistan ] they frequently saw signs saying â no blacks , no dogs , no irish â
what ukip is suggesting would take us back to those days
