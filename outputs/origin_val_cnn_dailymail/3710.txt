our investigation proved that in reality he was a professional courier who travelled to the netherlands to source drugs

' paul morgan , director of border force south east and europe , said : ' this seizure means a significant quantity of drugs failed to reach the streets and demonstrates border force 's commitment to keeping them out of the uk
' we work closely with law enforcement colleagues , including the nca , to prevent drug trafficking and do all we can to put those responsible behind bars
