a son took the stand in his mother 's murder trial wednesday to testify against his father
pelle testified in a salt lake city , utah courtroom and described how happy and energetic his mother , uta von schwedler , had been in the year before she died , a death that was initially thought to be a suicide but is now believed by authorities to be a carefully plotted out murder on the part of her ex-husband and pelle 's father , john wall
' he said on the stand the two would often argue when it came to the children , and that the last time he saw the two together , john wall rolled up his car window and drove off with the couple 's four children in the middle of a conversation that the two were having in von schwelder 's driveway
uta von schwedler ( above ) was found in her bathtub on sept. 27 , 2011 with multiple cuts to her body and a high level of xanax in her system the next morning pelle said he father was nowhere to be found , and when he returned home from school that afternoon he said the man had a large cut above his eye
von schwedler was found in her bathtub later that day with multiple cuts to her body and a high level of xanax in her system
that night , john wall woke his son up while he was sleeping and began displaying ' erratic behavior , ' saying ' uta von schwedler 's dead and they think i did it
' he then asked his son , ' am i a monster ? ' and ' what if i killed her and i do n't remember ? ' pelle testified that his mother had never taken any prescription pills or antidepressants to his knowledge , remembering her as ' happy ' and ' energetic
' he also said that while his father initially seemed sad following the death of his ex-wife , that soon turned ' more toward anger , hatred
' he also noted that after his parents first divorced , while he was still in elementary school , the children spent most of their time with their father , but that had changed in the years leading up to his mother 's death , with custody split between the two parents , something that angered his father
the 21 - year - old has long believed his father killed his mother , moving out of his home when he turned 18 and petitioning the court to remove his three younger siblings from his father 's care shortly after
john wall , a pediatrician , has pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder .
