washington maryland authorities said wednesday that a former state correctional officer has been arrested in connection with a recent spate of shootings , including one on the intercounty connector in maryland and one at fort meade , where the nsa office is located
officers stopped hong young , 35 , of beltsville , maryland , at around 10:30 p.m. tuesday
the officers recognized hong young 's vehicle -- a 1999 lincoln town car -- as matching authorities ' description of a car seen in surveillance footage near some of the shootings
a gun in the car matched evidence found at the shootings , authorities said at a press conference , and hong young was arrested
hong young is in the hospital and under police guard , though when reporters asked why he was being treated , officials would only say he was arrested without incident
he is charged with attempted first - degree murder , first - and second - degree assault , weapons violations and reckless endangerment
hong young worked as a correctional officer at a jessup facility from 2012 until his resignation in 2014 , maryland secretary of public safety stephen moyer said
there was nothing significant in his employee file , moyer said
police said that there are no links to terrorism , and no motive has been determined
