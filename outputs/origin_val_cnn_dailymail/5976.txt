prince charles is considering adding to his already impressive property portfolio he is renowned for his fearless passion for preserving historic property for the nation
and with the keys to nearly a thousand bedrooms and more than 250 bathrooms â not to mention acres of gardens , forest and moorland â you might think prince charles had quite enough property on his plate
but now he is planning to acquire more â he is considering buying the 123 - room , 16th century port eliot house in cornwall from the eccentric earl of st germans for a reported Â£ 10 million
charles âs official residences are highgrove , clarence house , llwynywermod and birkhall
however , his property empire includes two ancient farmhouses in transylvania â where his neighbours include wolves , lynxes and brown bears ; more than 25 holiday cottages in the scilly isles , wales and cornwall ; the 23,000 - seat oval cricket ground in london and half of dartmoor , including its prison
and that , it seems , is just the tip of the iceberg
of course , the properties do not technically belong to charles , being owned by either the queen , one of his charitable foundations , or the duchy of cornwall which has properties worth Â£ 763 million spread across 131,000 acres and 23 counties
but it does provide the charles with a â salary â which rose to a record Â£ 19 million last year
it âs also seen as something of a trust fund for prince william , though charles has voluntarily paid tax on the duchy income â Â£ 3.4 million in 2013 â for the past 20 years
his property buying has at times raised eyebrows
while he has made canny conservation purchases , he has also spent wildly â such as when he urged his charitable foundation to borrow Â£ 20 million to help secure 18th century dumfries house after a deal to sell the 2,000 - acre property to the scottish national trust fell through
charles heard about the dilemma at a dinner at windsor castle and was so dismayed at the thought of the house and its chippendale furniture going under the hammer after a local charity failed to raise more than half the purchase price that he offered to â make up the difference â
though he had never visited the property
financiers warned it could prove a â financial banana skin â
but the loan has since been paid off and the charles seems ready for more deals
here we offer a glimpse into his extraordinary property empire .
