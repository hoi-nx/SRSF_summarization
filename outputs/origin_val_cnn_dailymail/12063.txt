eighty drivers a day are being snapped by a new speed camera on the m4 motorway , generating Â£ 450,000 worth of fines , it has emerged
the traffic camera is on a notoriously busy stretch of road and has already snapped 4,500 motorists in a two month period
drivers had been used to slowing down for a fixed camera in the 50mph zone at port talbot , south wales
the traffic camera is on a notoriously busy stretch of the m4 ( pictured ) near port talbot , south wales but since november last year , it has been replaced with an ' average speed ' check - meaning motorists have to drive more cautiously
chris hume , from gosafe , the wales road casualty reduction partnership , said he was ' disappointed ' by drivers speeding between junctions 40 and 41 of the motorway
he said : ' excessive and inappropriate speed remains a factor in collisions , associated fatalities , serious injuries and , in this case , also contributes to the traffic congestion
' on average day there are still 80 motorists showing a complete disregard for the speed limit and putting lives at risk
' drivers who are caught will either get three points on their licence with a Â£ 100 fine or the option of a speed awareness course for Â£ 85
the new cameras measure the speed at which a vehicle is travelling by tracking it over a set distance
using data from several locations , it can tell how fast a motorist is driving based on its average , rather than at a set moment .
