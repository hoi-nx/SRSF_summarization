reaching down the rabbit hole by ropper & b. d. burrell some years ago a policeman stopped a driver who had been circling a roundabout for nearly an hour
when he asked him if there was anything wrong , the man replied : â i do nât know how i got here
â ropper gives a fascinating account of his work as a neurologist in boston ( stock image ) the confused driver , a salesman , was taken to hospital , where a junior doctor found nothing wrong with him , apart from memory loss
he concluded that it was an episode of transient global amnesia ( tga ) , a dramatic , but harmless condition
the junior doctor asked dr ropper , then the hospital âs senior resident in neurology , to authorise the patient âs discharge , expecting that his memory loss would , as usual in incidents of tga , return within hours
ropper examined the man himself
together , they worked out that the roundabout incident had come at the end of a 12 - hour drive
the patient recalled only getting in his car that morning and heading for somewhere completely different
he could nât retain the names of the doctors examining him or what he âd just eaten
unconvinced by the tga diagnosis , ropper decided to keep him in overnight , suspecting a stroke
the following morning , the salesman âs memory had returned , but with huge gaps : had he been suffering only an episode of temporary amnesia , it would have returned completely
after 23 hours , the patient âs speech became slurred and ropper knew instantly he was suffering a stroke
an arterial blockage was restricting blood flow to part of his brain
treated with anticoagulants and other drugs , the man quickly recovered with only minimal memory difficulties
ropper âs fascinating and gripping account of his work as a neurologist at boston âs brigham and women âs hospital in massachusetts reveals what a mysterious and little understood organ the brain is , not least in the list of all the things that can go wrong with it
sometimes it simply seizes up because of psychological pressure , as in the case of a 23 - year - old woman who was admitted after suddenly losing the power of speech
extensive testing showed no evidence of brain damage , seizure or stroke
but questioning of her family revealed she âd broken up with her boyfriend that day
next day , she âd recovered
so - called hysterical symptoms that have no basis in disease often present like neurological diseases
they include paralysis , the inability to walk or talk , blindness , deafness and weakness
spotting genuinely serious malfunctions and distinguishing them from merely harmless tics and tremors is far from easy , but there are some symptoms a neurologist does nât want to see
in the case of a young mother admitted with what appeared to be a severe asthma attack , ropper âs heart sank when he spotted the muscle between her thumb and forefinger twitching
he knew he was looking at als or lou gehrig âs disease , a fatal illness that would see her body begin to shut down until it was kept alive solely by machines
at some point this woman would have to decide when her life became so unbearable she would ask for the machines to be switched off
quite how someone works with that kind of trauma almost every day is unimaginable to the layman
what comes over in this remarkable book is ropper âs humanity and his unremitting sympathy for his patients
if only all doctors were like him .
