home helps must stay for at least half an hour with frail pensioners under new rules to end the scandal of â drive - by â visits
updated guidance published yesterday insists that calls last for at least 30 minutes if they are offering personal care such as washing or dressing
the advice , published by nhs spending watchdog nice , said 15 - minute drop - ins should only be considered in certain cases such as checking if someone has taken their medication
better care : health watchdog nice has published new guidelines in bid to stop ' drive - by ' visits of carers ( stock photo ) in a sign of how bad things have become , guidelines have to spell out the care offered to the elderly â telling home helps to leave enough time to â talk to the person â
care workers are also reminded to treat people with â empathy , courtesy , respect and in a dignified way â
the move marks a victory for the daily mail , which has highlighted care visits lasting as little as five minutes as part of our dignity for the elderly campaign
last month a daily mail investigation revealed that 70 per cent of councils are still allocating visits of just 15 minutes â with six authorities offering 200,000 slots of just five minutes
some staff were even told not to chat because it wastes time , while visitors are sometimes poorly trained contractors or ill - suited to the job
in crisis : the recommendations come as local government association say funding for social care is ' in crisis ' ( stock image ) the guidance called on councils to ensure home care workers â have time to do their job without being rushed or compromising the dignity of the person who uses services â
it also attempts to stamp out the conveyor belt culture under which pensioners can be seen by ten or 15 different carers in a fortnight , saying â continuity of care â must be a priority
last night care minister norman lamb called on councils to adopt the guidance as soon as possible , saying that many authorities were â complicit â in providing poor care
however , the local government association , which represents councils , said money was just too short to end 15 - minute care visits once and for all
chairman david sparks said funding for adult social care is â in crisis â
gps are being urged to visit the elderly at least once a year to check they are not too cold , nice guidance says
meter readers could also check the temperature in pensioners â homes and alert surgeries , it advises .
