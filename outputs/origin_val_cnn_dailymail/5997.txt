saturday night live pushed the envelope this week with a parody of a car commercial that had a young girl joining isis , and not the us army , at the end
the segment was laid out the same as the recent dad spot in which a father tearfully drops off his daughter to join the military in his toyota camry
the spot that first aired during the 2015 super bowl and was seen as a touching look at what it is like to say goodbye for those that have family members in the service
in this version however , the father , played by taran killam , dropped off his daughter , played by dakota johnson , and as he tearfully said goodbye she says to him ; ' dad , it 's just isis
' when the father then says to take care of his girl , one of the men yells ; ' death to america
' then , as the commercial ended , a message appeared on screen ; ' isis , we 'll take it from here , dad
' dakota johnson winked at her father to assure him everything was all right in the parody some on twitter found the parody ' depraved ' others on twitter found the bit ' hysterical ' dakota johnson teels her father not to worry saying , ' dad , it 's just isis ' this all comes on the same week three men were arrested in the america with ties to the terrorist organization and three female british teenagers left to join the group
the skit was met with outrage by many on twitter , who took the program to task for being insensitive
' ca n't be serious
isis skit ? like going to college ? when so many people are being kidnapped and killed ? depraved , ' wrote raine lachance
' apparently nbc and saturday night live thought it was funny to have a skit showing isis driving to an airport to pick up an america girl
tasteless scum ! , ' said jim ematrudo
others however found the skit ' hilarious
' this also comes the same week that the identity of isis member john was revealed and the group destroyed a collection of priceless statues and sculptures in iraq dating back thousands of years in mosul
john is british citizen mohammed emwazi , the man who is responsible for the high - profile beheadings of america james foley , peter kassig and steven sotliff as well as british citizens david haines and alan henning in the name of the terrorist organization
his identity was previously unknown as he always wears a mask
canadians this week also said that they believe four missing teenagers may have traveled to be in isis .
