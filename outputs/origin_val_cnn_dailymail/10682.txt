while kane was scoring on his debut for england , alvaro morata was scoring on his first start for spain to give the reigning european champions a 1 - 0 win over ukraine
the former real madrid striker , who nearly joined kane at spurs as part as the deal that took gareth bale to spain , settled the match in the first half in what was a largely unconvincing performance from del bosque âs team
franco baldini wanted alvaro morata to move to north london but he ended up staying in real madrid before moving to juventus last summer
his goals have helped them into the last eight of the champions league and he took that form with him into this group c qualifier
alvaro morata opened the scoring for spain as his looped effort evades the gloves of pyatov alvaro morata beats ukraine defender khacheridi to loft the ball into the back of the net spain : iker casillas ; juanfran , pique , sergio ramos , alba ( bernat 79 ) ; busquets , koke , iniesta ( cazorla 74 ) ; david silva , isco , alvaro morata ( pedro 65 ) subs not used : albiol , bartra , fabregas , de gea , carvajal , juanmi , mario suarez , asenjo , vitolo scorer ( s ) : alvaro morata 28 booked : sergio ramos manager : del bosque ukraine : pyatov ; fedetskyi , khacheridi , kucher , shevchuk ; tymoshchuk , taras stepanenko ( garmash 76 ) ; konoplyanka , rotan , yarmolenko ; zozulya ( kravets 32 , budkivskiy 91 ) subs not used : boyko , husyev , morozyuk , bezus , rakitskiy , oliynyk , burda , rybka , rybalka booked : fedetskyi , kravets , kucher manager : mykhaylo fomenko referee : cuneyt cakä±r playing instead of the injured diego costa he converted a koke pass on 28 minutes but spain failed to find the second and still look a long way from the form they showed when they won the euros three years ago
they also lost jordi alba to a groin injury in the second half
spain applied all the early pressure but isco and alvaro morata sent their first shots wide and david silva missed the target with a diving header 12 yards out from an isco cross
ukraine looked dangerous on the coutner attack in the first 20 minutes and artem fedetskiy sent a wayward volley wide of iker casillas â goal from a corner
from the edge of the area rotan also went close , but again spain âs goalkeeper was able to watch the ball go wide
spain attacked with more quality than the visitors and just before the half hour they were in front when iniesta found koke and his first time ball sent alvaro morata through
he held off the last defender and when ukraine keeper andrei pyatov went to ground early he lofted the ball over him to score
spain then enjoyed their best spell
david silva tested pyatov with another shot and iniesta began to lead ukraine a merry dance in midfield
on the day that xavi showed up in qatar to sign a three - year contract spain could easily have been reminded of how much they miss him
pyatov looks back in despair as spain take the lead at the estadio ramã³n sã¡nchez pizjuã¡n alvaro morata celebrates his first international goal on his third cap for del bosque 's side but his barcelona team - mate was running the midfield until the break
they could have gone in at half time 2 - 0 up but sergio ramos ' header from david silva âs free - kick came back off the frame of the goal
encouraged by spain âs narrow lead ukraine had their chances at the start of the second half with iker casillas saving rotan âs free - kick
the keeper then gave dnipro âs rotan another chance kicking the ball straight to him but then parried his shot
the juventus striker is congratulated by his team - mates as spain made their first - half dominance pay barcelona midfielder iniesta controls the ball as artem fedetskiy closes in to make a challenge that was typical of the sloppiness that had crept into spain âs play at the start of the second period
they needed the second goal â it might have come when iniesta fed alvaro morata but his shot was closer to the corner flag than pyatov âs goal and that was the last thing he did before being replaced by pedro
at least he had his debut goal
it was still far too easy to reach the edge of spain âs penalty area and they were saved by ukraine not being able to make the most of arriving there â rotan again shot straight at iker casillas after meeting yevhen konoplianka âs cross
manchester city midfielder david silva is halted in his tracks by two ukraine defenders real madrid playmaker isco evades the outstretched leg of ukraine forward taras stepanenko spain continued to over-elaborate at one end and leave too much space at the other and when jordi alba went off holding his groin with 12 minutes left even barcelona supporters were worried
they played out the final minutes to take the three points and they stay second behind slovakia but del bosque will not need telling there is work to be done if they are to retain their crown in france next summer
iker casillas kept his place in the spain goal despite the imperious form of david de gea this season the two sides line up prior to kick off at the estadio ramã³n sã¡nchez pizjuã¡n to observe the national anthems
