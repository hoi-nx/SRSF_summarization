five generations of kangaroos have been regular guests at this home on queensland 's sunshine coast and the generous hospitality is what keeps them coming back ' our place is like a little sanctuary for them â they have grass , food , water and protection , ' linda told daily mail australia
' during the day they go off and they come back in the afternoon to eat ... sometimes they lay under the trees at our place all day
' they are wonderful animals â we sit down in the afternoon and just watch them
they are just like cats and dogs
' the couple , who leave bowls of water , pellets and rolled oats out for them everyday , treat the kangaroos like their very own pets
their property has even been dubbed the ' kangaroo hilton ' by animal groups

the couple regularly snap photos of their clan eating and lazing about on the property , which have often then been shared on facebook by the australian society for kangaroos
the kangaroos started coming to the property after the koala and deer sanctuary next door to their 10 acre property closed down years ago
' with australia zoo opening they shut down because no tourists were coming through
the animals were all sold off , but the kangaroos were all wild and they stayed
' it took many years for them to become used to us and a couple ended up being very friendly and we could scratch their heads
