crucial negotiations on iran âs nuclear programme stalled last night with the deadline for an international agreement due to expire at midnight tonight
officials say they remain â hopeful â of a deal but expect a day of â brinkmanship â with iran trying to win concessions on crippling un sanctions in return for agreeing to limits that would prevent tehran from producing enough fuel for a nuclear weapon within a year
foreign secretary philip hammond stressed as he arrived in lausanne for the talks : â we are here because we believe a deal can be done but it has to be a deal which puts the bomb beyond iran 's reach
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , who has campaigned vehemently against the negotiations , said in jerusalem that the agreement being put together in lausanne sends the message â that iran stands to gain by its aggression â
the six - nation group is offering a package of relief measures , lifting the eu oil embargo and removing banking restrictions , in moves synchronised with the suspension of corresponding us sanctions
but it insists that some un sanctions must stay in place until iran has convinced the international community it has no intention of pursuing a weapons programme , something that could take many years
iran appears unwilling to compromise further , its supreme leader , ali khamenei , has left them no negotiating space insisting yesterday : â sanctions must be lifted in one go , not as a result of future iran actions
â a western diplomat warned : â there are still some quite important gaps , â amid warnings that â an agreement is far from certain
it could all still break - up

â much appears to hinge on iran âs willingness to sacrifice a considerable proportion of its 9,900 working centrifuges and export a large amount of its 7.9 tons of low - enriched uranium
the us and its european allies want a mechanism that would allow suspended un sanctions to be put back into effect rapidly if iran reneges on a deal
russia reportedly accepts this , but wants to ensure its security council veto rights are protected
russia âs foreign minister sergei lavrov announced he was to break - off from lausanne to meet with officials in other countries but not elaborate
his officials appeared more optimistic than many of an agreement
russia âs foreign minister sergei lavrov ( pictured right ) announced he was to break - off from lausanne to meet with officials in other countries but not elaborate despite deep disagreements on several points , western officials said the two sides had previously been closing in on a preliminary deal that could be summarized in a brief document which may or may not be released
officials said the talks could run at least until the deadline of midnight on tuesday or beyond
if there was a deal in lausanne , the parties might move to geneva for a ceremony
the six powers want more than a 10 - year suspension of iran 's most sensitive nuclear work
tehran , which denies it is trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability , demands in exchange for limits on its atomic activities a swift end to sanctions
one sticking point concerns iran 's demand to continue with research into newer generations of advanced centrifuges that can purify uranium faster and in greater quantities than those it currently operates for use in nuclear power plants or , if very highly enriched , in weapons .
