the chive , an entertainment site which used photos of a former anorexic 's recovery from her reddit page without her permission , claiming they were an example of an ' amazing weight loss transformation ' , has issued her a public apology
' we obviously had no idea anne marie had anorexia , but that does nât excuse the action at all
it was a mistake , completely unintentional , ' the website stated , having left anne marie sengillo , 27 , from cincinnati , ohio , ' sickened ' to see her photos used , in her words , ' as inspiration for a disorder that nearly killed me '
the chive added : ' we had previously discovered the photo somewhere out there in the internet echo chamber , which contained no frame of reference whatsoever ... the photo was removed the second we found out about it
' wrong message : the chive has apologized for using photos anne marie sengillo , 27 , had posted of herself before anorexia struck ( left ) and at her sickest ( right ) for an ' amazing weight loss ' slideshow the chive used two photos anne marie had uploaded to reddit , under the thread : ' my recovery from an eating disorder , updated ' - and added them to a slideshow featuring 27 other similar snaps under the heading : ' these weight loss transformations are amazing
' the photo anne marie posted to her reddit thread of herself dangerously thin at 90lbs was used as the ' after ' snap in the chive 's weight loss slideshow , and the photo she posted of herself prior to her developing anorexia was used as the ' before ' snap
as part of its apology , the chive made sure to bring light to the intended nature of anne marie 's photos
' a few days ago , anne marie took the time to put together an inspirational gallery about how she overcame the disorder , even after relapsing , ' it reads
' there is an amazing positive in all this and we âre proud to share her story with the chive community and we hope it helps others who might be suffering from the disorder
' apology : ' we obviously had no idea anne marie had anorexia , but that does nât excuse the action at all , ' the website wrote as part of the above statement doing better : ' for them to put my disordered weight as " ideal " was a punch to the stomach for me , ' said anne marie yesterday , pictured during her recovery , after posting the photos to reddit to chart her progress speaking to daily mail online about the publication 's response , anne marie said : ' i am so pleased that they apologized and featured my story
' i have no bad blood with them anymore and so happy that they owned up to the mistake ! it takes a very strong person to admit when they are wrong , and even stronger when they admit it to a very popular site
' yesterday , after annie marie was originally sent the chive 's article by a concerned reddit member , and prior to its apology , she told daily mail online : ' for them to put my disordered weight as " ideal " was a punch to the stomach for me
' this disease left me bankrupt and almost killed me
i posted my photos to give hope to others who may have body image issues
the least i could get from the chive is an apology
' anorexia took the best years of my life
to wake up to that image [ on the chive ] - i can not even begin to explain
' yesterday , we posted a 28 - photo gallery called these transformations are amazing on the chive
one of the photos depicted a girl named anne marie in a dress who had lost weight , the photo had no text accompaniment whatsoever
as it turns out anne marie used to suffer from anorexia
we had previously discovered the photo somewhere out there in the internet echo chamber which contained no frame of reference whatsoever
we obviously had no idea anne marie had anorexia but that does nât excuse the action at all
it was a mistake , completely unintentional , and the photo was removed the second we found out about it
we usually do nât air these issues out in public , because i think the true apology belongs to anne marie personally , which we have also sent
we are deeply sorry for having posted this photo , but i âm posting this out here on the chive because i think you should know about anne marie âs story
a few days ago , anne marie took the time to put together an inspirational gallery about how she overcame the disorder , even after relapsing
there is an amazing positive in all this and we âre proud to share her story with the chive community and we hope it helps others who might be suffering from the disorder
deleted : the chive removed anne marie 's snaps from their slideshow ( pictured ) ' the second ' it realized its mistake as it appeared : the chive 's post , was titled , ' these weight loss transformations are amazing ' and featured 27 other people 's ' before and after ' snaps ( pictured ) , the origin of which are unknown anne marie weighed 150lbs in 2006 , just before her disorder started to develop
a ' crash diet ' sent her down a ' dark ' path , however , and by 2007 , she weighed just 70lbs - having lost more than half of her body weight
' my dad died , and other c * * p snowballed my weight loss into some monster of a thing , ' she wrote on reddit , explaining her worsening mental health
' it started out innocently enough , but became a five - hour - a - day workout and 500 calories a day
' anne marie then shared photos of her recovery , as well as several relapses , and reveals that she was finally sent to a treatment center after a suicide attempt in 2013
her progress since then has been up and down , and her treatment currently means she ca n't work , and is in $ 50,000 of medical debt
road to recovery : anne marie , pictured ( left ) during a relapse and ( right ) at a healthier weight , says her disorder almost killed her , and left her $ 50,000 in debt over medical expenses anne marie finds it extremely frustrating that she ca n't work , so this year , she started shoveling snow from sidewalks and driveways in her neighborhood - an act which earned her a spot on a fox news segment
' i feel really bad taking taxpayers ' money , ' she says
' i know i really need it to keep a roof over my head , but it does n't make me feel any better about taking it
' doing things like shoveling my town makes me feel like i earned the money i have taken from my neighbors
' anne marie has launched a gofundme campaign to help raise funds to pay off her medical bills , which has so far gained $ 865 in donations .
