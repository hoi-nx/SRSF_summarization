snowden may finally be coming home
a russian lawyer for snowden said on tuesday the fugitive former united states spy agency contractor who leaked details of the government 's mass surveillance programs was working with united states and german lawyers to return home
his biggest demand it seems is that he be given a fair trial when charged for his offenses
and we are doing everything possible now to solve this issue , ' said his lawyer anatoly kucherena while speaking at a news conference about a book he had written on snowden
' there is a group of united states lawyers , there is also a group of german lawyers and i 'm dealing with it on the russian side
' moscow granted snowden asylum in 2013 , and he has been given a three - year residence permit in russian
this at a time when relations between the two countries are already strained
the united states wants snowden to stand trial for leaking extensive secrets of electronic surveillance programs by the national security agency , but russian has repeatedly refused to extradite him
he has been charged with theft of government property and two counts of violating the 1917 espionage act
and while the government is eager to have snowden see his day in court , public support for the 31 - year - old may be at an all time high
the documentary about snowden , citizenfour , won the academy awards last week , with director laura poitras ( left ) , journalist greenwald ( center ) , and snowden 's girlfriend lindsay mills ( right ) accepting the award just last week the documentary citzenfour , which examined the leaking of these classified documents by snowden to journalist greenwald , and his quest for asylum in the aftermath , took home the oscar for best documentary at the academy awards
snowden 's girlfriend , lindsay mills , was there to accept the award alongside greenwald and the film 's director , laura poitras
he was also interviewed by new york times media columnist david carr in the esteemed journalist 's last ever public appearance
in a recent reddit ama , snowden said that through this all his biggest regret is that he did not come forward with these leaks sooner , believing that if he had he might have limited some of the government 's abuse of their powers .
