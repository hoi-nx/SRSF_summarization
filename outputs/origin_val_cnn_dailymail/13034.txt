actress henson is apologizing for claiming her son was racially profiled during a traffic stop in southern california last year
the glendale police department released dash cam video of the encounter friday , which contradicted her son 's claims
police released the footage after henson commented about the alleged profiling in an uptown magazine interview published last month
in her interview , the star of the hit television show " empire " said her son , johnson , 20 , was racially profiled in glendale and at the university of southern california , where she accused campus police of stopping him for " having his hands in his pockets
" after her son 's claim , she vowed to send him to howard university in washington instead
" i 'm not paying $ 50k so i ca n't sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus , " she said
even the university of southern california stepped in , with its public safety director , thomas , saying he was disturbed by the report of the profiling , and was investigating it further
" we encourage reporting of allegations of bias and i hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother , " thomas said
but henson retracted her accusations friday , and publicly apologized to the glendale police department
" a mother 's job is not easy and neither is a police officer 's , " she said in a post on instagram
" sometimes as humans we overreact without gathering all of the facts
as a mother in this case i overreacted and for that i apologize
thank you to that officer for being kind to my son
" police chief castro said his agency researched the traffic stop after her comments to the magazine
the incident started when a glendale officer pulled over johnson in october for failing to yield to a pedestrian at a cross walk
during the traffic stop , johnson admitted to having marijuana , an infraction and ritalin without a prescription , a felony , according to castro
he consented to a search of the vehicle , and officers found marijuana , honey oil ( concentrated marijuana ) , a marijuana grinder and a knife , castro said
johnson was not driving while impaired and was only cited for possession of marijuana , he said
" misinformation that was reported in the story in uptown magazine with henson impairs and weakens the relationships between law enforcement and the communities , " castro said
the glendale police department said friday it appreciated henson 's apology and is sharing it with its officers .
