simon was diagnosed in february 2013 with terminal colon cancer
yet through it all , he tried to remain upbeat and keep his sense of humor
" the museum of broadcasting called and said , ' we were thinking about doing an archive interview with you
do you mind if we did it now ? ' " simon said with a laugh on maron 's wtf podcast that first ran in may 2013
during his brief career , the influential simon also served as the showrunner on the sitcom " taxi " at the age of 23 ; wrote for and produced the comedies " cheers " and " the drew carey show " ; and created a fox series for the legendary stand - up comic carlin in the mid- 1990s
simon also wrote the 1991 film " the super , " a fox comedy starring joe pesci as a new york slumlord
most recently , simon was a consultant on the charlie sheen series " anger management " and hosted a show on radioio.com
he showed up frequently on howard stern 's siriusxm show and in march 2013 thanked the acerbic host for being " the perfect friend
" story : terminally ill ' the simpsons ' co-creator vows to give away fortune a cartoonist and stanford graduate , simon developed " the simpsons " with matt groening ( who came up with the characters based on his family ) and producer brooks

" the simpsons , " centering on tv 's " first fully self - aware dysfunctional family , " as simon put it , debuted on fox on december 17 , 1989 , and is now the longest - running primetime series in american history
levine , an emmy winner who has written for " the simpsons " and other sitcoms , described simon 's contribution to the show during a 2009 interview published in stanford magazine
" simon brought a level of honesty to the characters , " levine said
" is it too bizarre to say he made cartoon characters three - dimensional ? his comedy is all about character , not just a string of gags
in ' the simpsons , ' the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles
' what are they thinking ? ' -- that is simon 's contribution
the stories come from the characters
" simon also is credited with assembling the show 's elite writing team that included al jean , george meyer , john swartzwelder , mike reiss , jon vitti and o'brien
story : brooks on ' the simpsons ' journey " i remember simon coming into the room , and me pitching to him and initially being really intimidated , " o'brien told vanity fair in 2007
it was fun to try and make him laugh
i remember that about simon
if i could make simon laugh , i was excited
" tired of the grind , simon exited the show in 1993 after four seasons but worked out a deal tied to home video sales that he said paid him " tens of millions " every year
the agreement also guaranteed him executive producer credit long after he departed , and his name appears in the credits of every episode
a couple of years after he left , simon knew he would have enough money to retire from show business
he was in his mid- 30s
as detailed in the hollywood reporter 's 2013 philantrophy issue , simon 's charitable contributions include founding the malibu - based sam simon foundation ( worth nearly $ 23 million as of 2011 ) that rescues the hungry and feeds stray dogs
his other pet charities include peta , which in february thanked him for his support by naming its norfolk , virginia , headquarters the sam simon center ; international nonprofit save the children ; and the sea shepherd conservation society , a global marine conservation organization
his generosity led the latter in 2012 to name one of the four ships in its fleet of vessels -- used to hinder whaling and illegal fishing -- the m / y simon
simon also turned a malibu spread into a canine haven that rescues dogs from kill shelters and trains them as companions for the deaf
" the sort of lifetime achievement stuff that i 'm getting now is kind of like tom sawyer 's funeral because they all know i 'm sick , " simon told thr 's gary baum
" i am getting buildings named after me and awards and stuff
the truth is , i have more money than i 'm interested in spending
everyone in my family is taken care of

simon , who won eight of his emmys for writing / producing " the simpsons " ( many after he left ) and one for producing " the tracey ullman show , " was married to and divorced from actress tilly ( 1984 to 1991 ) and playboy playmate jami ferrell ( for mere weeks in 2000 )
neither marriage produced any children
born june 6 , 1955 , simon grew up in beverly hills in an era when the neighborhood was " quaint , " as he put it
groucho marx lived across the street , and he recalled walking into his parents ' room as a youngster and finding the legendary comic and his mom sitting on the bed
( he stressed they were n't about to have sex
) another time , elvis presley returned the dog that simon had lost
while at stanford , simon drew cartoons for the local newspapers in san francisco and the school paper and landed a job at filmation studios doing storyboards for " the new adventures of mickey mouse " and " heckle & jeckle
" simon scored his first tv writing gig on the animated " fat albert and the cosby kids " in 1979
he mailed in a script to " taxi " ( co-created by brooks ) that was accepted , and that led to a staff writing position and then the job as showrunner
simon also went on to direct episodes of the carlin show , " the drew carey show , " " friends , " " norm " and " anger management
" an avid poker player , simon re-created his home game in a penthouse at the palms hotel in las vegas for a playboy tv show in 2009
the show also featured tilly -- a very good player -- as well as comedians dave attell , norm macdonald , jeffrey ross and artie lange
another one of simon 's more eclectic pursuits was working the corner at amateur fights and serving as president of sweet science inc. , which managed boxer lamon brewster
his fighter stunningly knocked out wladimir klitschko to win a share of the heavyweight championship in 2004
during his chat with maron , simon noted that the way to know when to put down your ailing dog is to " list the three things he loves to do
when he ca n't do those any longer , it 's time
" one of my three things is laying in bed and watching tv
so by that criteria , i will never be euthanized
" later , talking about all the millions he 's given to charity , he added : " i kinda like it when people talk about me as a special person
but i know i would be a nut if i did n't have a lot of money
