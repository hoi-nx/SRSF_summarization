' the video was supplied to both the irish australian chamber of commerce and the lansdowne club to be played during st patrick 's day celebrations , but reportedly neither party will show it

irish australian chamber of commerce chief executive barry corr said the video was ' a generic st patrick 's day message ' and ' on that basis it is not part of the event '
