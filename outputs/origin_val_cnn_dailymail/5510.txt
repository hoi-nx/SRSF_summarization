internet retail giant amazon is testing its drone delivery system at a secret site in british columbia after becoming frustrated with us regulations
the world 's largest online store had wanted to test its prime air drones , which fly between 200 and 500 feet in the air , in washington but has now moved its research across the border , the guardian reported
last week the faa ( faa ) gave amazon permission to begin testing one particular type of drone that the company now says is obsolete because the technology is moving so quickly
however , the company has already been testing in secret for the last several month at its own restricted airspace in canada , about 2,000 from the border
faa 's regulations proposed earlier this year also state that the person controlling the drone must have constant sight of the robot
the body has only approved 48 out of more than 750 exemption requests for exemptions that would allow outdoor drone testing before new guidelines are in place
amazon 's applied last july but still does not have an exemption , as it has only received a ' experimental airworthiness certificate ' for its previous prototype
oil giant bp was the first company to get approved for commercial drones over us land last year and drone pilots for the exemptions have been required to get pilot 's licenses
the approval process includes nearly 100 pages of paperwork , a four hour presentation at faa headquarters and a site visit
canada has fewer restrictions , essentially allowing amazon do whatever testing they needed within their airspace , and only took three weeks to give the go ahead to the seattle - based retailer 's application
the faa has only approved several dozen applications for drone testing licenses , though canada has approved more than 1,600
above , boxes that can be carried by drones amazon plans on creating a system that can deliver goods ordered online in less than 30 minutes
the faa 's proposed rules mandate that drones would have to be in the line of sight of their pilots at all times transport canada , which has been giving out the licenses for almost a decade while the us just started last year , said that is aims to complete applications in 20 working days
' in canada , it 's mostly about safety , ' university of toronto drone researcher angela schoellig said
' if you show that you know what you are doing , it 's very likely that you 'll get a licence
' amazon is developing small aerial vehicles as part of amazon prime air
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds
about 86 percent of amazon 's deliveries are 5 pounds or less , the company said
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making prime air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' the company has said previously
. it expects to eventually be able to deliver goods to customers within 30 minutes of online orders
the us 's northern neighbor has granted 1,672 drone testing applications
' different laws and regulatory structures in other nations may allow them to act more quickly to approve certain uas [ drone ] operations , ' an faa spokesman said of the guardian 's report
the agency 's representative said the authority is ' safety - oriented ' and approval is based on ' assessment of the risks to other aircraft and to people and property on the ground '
the faa is expected to vote on its proposed drone rules by the end of the year
amazon hopes that it 's canada testing will help build a system that allows customers to have goods delivered to their homes within 30 minutes of ordering them online
it is working on high autonomous robots less than 55lbs that can carry objects less than 5lbs , the vast majority of the items amazon ships
the company also has research outposts in cambridge , uk , and israel
faa proposed rules also state that drones can not operate over people not involved with them and can not fly at night
pilot 's licenses and airworthiness certificates will not be required .
