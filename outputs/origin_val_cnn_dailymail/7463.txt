sharing a platform : clegg and sir richard branson yesterday clegg ignited a huge controversy last night by claiming that all drug users should be treated as â victims â
the liberal democrat leader said they should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances â even if they they are caught with â harder â drugs such as heroin or crack cocaine
meanwhile , sir richard branson made the astonishing claim that smoking powerful skunk cannabis does not cause â any harm â â despite evidence that a quarter of new cases of psychosis are linked to it
announcing his party âs new drugs policy yesterday , mr clegg said : â we should nât be treating the criminal â mr bigs â the same as the users
the latter are the victims of the former
â but his comments were dismissed by the head of the chatham house think tank robin niblett , who said : â are all users victims or is there a large proportion of people who enjoy drugs and take them recreationally ? it is a question of demand , rather than people who need to be treated for an addiction
â other experts have also questioned whether it is right to label all drug users as victims
stuart waiton , senior lecturer in sociology at abertay university , said : â the problem we have today is that society finds it difficult to hold people to account for their actions
â the idea of moral responsibility is very weak because we assume that everyone âs a victim
people do nât need medical support â unless their bodies are falling to bits â they need to take responsibility for their own actions
â the liberal democrat â new policy would end prosecutions for people caught with small amounts of drugs for â personal use â
it would cover all drugs
mr clegg said the policy would be included in the liberal democrat manifesto
it is widely seen as a pitch to win back young voters disillusioned by the party âs betrayal over university tuition fees
the liberal democrat leader said drug users should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances â even if they they are caught with â harder â drugs such as heroin or crack cocaine mr clegg ( bottom left ) is facing opposition to his plan from david cameron ( pictured at pm 's questions this afternoon ) , who claims decriminalising drugs would increase their use with neither labour nor the tories backing decriminalisation , it is unlikely to become government policy even if the liberal democrat remain in power after the election
yesterday 's announcement follows a controversial â research â project ordered by lib dem home office ministers , which used taxpayers â money to study drugs policy around the world
jeremy browne and norman baker jetted off to examine how other countries tackle drugs
they travelled to ten countries , including the us , portugal and sweden , at a cost of almost Â£ 40,000
the liberal democrat seized on parts of the report suggesting decriminalisation in countries like portugal cut the health damage caused by drugs
but critics said they ignored evidence that the number of children using drugs had risen
mr clegg received a public endorsement yesterday from sir richard branson , who suggested that smoking skunk is safe
the virgin tycoon shared a platform with the liberal democrat leader to promote the party âs pledge
he said : â of people taking hash [ cannabis ] , something like 99 per cent do not have a problem ... take people taking skunk
â it âs slightly worse than alcohol
but there are a lot of people doing it for recreational purposes and they enjoy doing it and it âs not doing them any harm
â a study last month by kings college london found that 24 per cent of new cases of psychosis are linked to the use of skunk
the report concluded that smoking skunk trebles the risk of someone having a psychotic episode
last night , mr clegg also insisted that the so - called â war on drugs â was â not working â , although he was later forced to concede that official figures show drug use has been falling in britain for years
downing street rejected mr clegg âs analysis and said it was not supported by david cameron
sir richard branson ( pictured at an event in knightsbridge with martin sheen , left , and princess beatrice and holly branson , right ) made the claim that smoking powerful skunk cannabis does not cause â any harm â andy cook , chief executive of charity twenty twenty , which works with disadvantaged young people , said : â cannabis is ruining the life opportunities of those we work with , so the idea that society would be better off if this stuff was decriminalised is crazy
â making it more easily available and more culturally acceptable will mean that more of our young people would take it
the result will be that more of our young people would fail to make the most of their potential
â cannabis could be available on the nhs under liberal democrat plans
under the proposals , doctors would be able to prescribe the drug for medicinal reasons .
