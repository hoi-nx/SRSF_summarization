he said : ' they told me that xiao li was lying behind a bush where he had been hiding from them during a game
' when i got there he was hardly breathing and i knew something terrible had happened
' xiao li was rushed to the nearby jining affiliated medical school hospital , where medics quickly realised the condition was critical
heartbreak : xiao li 's father found his son in a critical condition , bleeding from his eyes , ears , nostrils and mouth the lolly that xiao li put in his mouth was covered in tets , or tetramethylenedisulfotetramine
it 's an odorless and tasteless poison that 's fatal for humans in quantities of just 7 to 10mg and above
it is 100 times more toxic than cyanide and there is no known antidote
it was banned around the world in 1984 but still finds its way into china in rat poison , as it 's very easy to produce
a hospital spokesman said : ' his internal organs had been destroyed by the poison and his blood had turned black
' doctors fought to save him for two days before little xiao li succumbed to the poison and died
tests carried out on the lollipop which the boy still had on him showed that it had been coated in tets , a highly lethal neurotoxin found in rat poison
its use worldwide has been banned since 1984 but is still readily available in china , although illegally
now police suspect someone close to the family may have been responsible for his death
a police spokesman said : ' we have checked the location of where the lollipop was in the family 's yard and we found a couple more
' the only way they could have got there is if someone walked in and put them there as it is impossible to reach from the road
' and if they had been thrown over the wall , they would have broken
we are looking into who would have a motive to do this
