the new kit kats was created after japan customers were asked for their favourite flavour combinations in special versions of the chocolate there will be limited editions , featuring a bunny and easter message the treats went on sale from today and are priced at 540 yen ( Â£ 3 ) for a pack of 12
for the first time in the company 's 42 - year history in japan they will use a bunny a spokesman for nestle said : " we will have 13 different designs , so anybody who wants to collect all the labels may have to buy more than one packet
" he said in addition every 30th chocolate bar would have a limited special edition design for collectors
