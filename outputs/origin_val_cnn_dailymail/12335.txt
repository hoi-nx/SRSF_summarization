a russian property developer , a china outfit operating shell companies and venezuela officials ripping off the state - owned oil companies -- all of them are accused of coming to a bank in the european principality of andorra to " wash " their money
now the treasury is casting a spotlight on the alleged misdeeds of senior managers at the banca privada d'andorra ( banca privada d'andorra ) , several of whom have been arrested in the past few days
the treasury has alleged that " high - level managers [ at banca privada d'andorra ] accepted payments and other benefits from their criminal clients
" the andorran authorities took over the running of the bank after the treasury revelations , and the director general of the banca privada d'andorra , prats , was arrested late friday
two more bank officials were arrested sunday
andorra , nestled in the rugged pyrenees mountains , has two big neighbors
and the scandal has spread to its other neighbor , spanish , where corruption among public officials is a hot - button political issue
prats had driven banca privada d'andorra 's expansion into spanish , through its acquisition of banco madrid , in 2011
banco madrid caters to wealthy private clients and came under investigation by spanish financial authorities last year
since the bpa scandal broke , the commission that investigates illicit financial activity , sepblac , has raised questions about accounts held by influential spanish political and business figures at the banco madrid
they have not been named
the central bank has taken control of banco madrid and sent in two inspectors to examine accounts there
the bank 's board , which included prats and a former high - ranking official of the central bank , resigned on thursday
spanish officials say some 20 suspect operations at the bank are being examined
spanish authorities are separately investigating substantial assets held at the banca privada d'andorra by members of the pujol family , who have long been prominent in the politics of catalonia , a region of spanish that includes barcelona
the director of the treasury 's financial crimes enforcement network , jennifer shasky calvery , said that " banca privada d'andorra 's corrupt high - level managers and weak antimoney laundering controls have made banca privada d'andorra an easy vehicle for third - party money launderers to funnel proceeds of organized crime , corruption and human trafficking through the us financial system
" banca privada d'andorra has correspondent accounts with four banks -- hsbc , citigroup , bank of america and deutsche bank -- through which hundreds of millions of dollars passed
senior managers at banca privada d'andorra tailored services to their clients to disguise the origin of funds , the treasury said
one manager provided " substantial assistance " to a russian client , petrov , described by the treasury as a " third - party money launderer working for russian criminal organizations
" petrov had also received a line of credit from banco madrid and is alleged to have bribed local officials in the resort where he set up a property development company
he was arrested in spanish two years ago and is accused of helping launder some 56 million euros ( $ 59 million ) in proceeds from russian criminal organizations
petrov is yet to go on trial
according to the treasury , petrov has links with one of the fbi 's most wanted fugitives , simeon mogilevich
banca privada d'andorra is also alleged to have helped venezuela money launderers siphon funds from the state - owned oil company , petroleos de venezuela
" this money - laundering network worked closely with high - ranking government officials in venezuela , resident agents in panamanian , and an andorran lawyer to establish panamanian shell companies , " the treasury said
banca privada d'andorra processed about $ 2 billion in transactions by shell companies related to the scheme
treasury said another senior official at banca privada d'andorra accepted bribes in return for processing bulk cash transfers for a china money launderer , ping , who was arrested in spanish in september 2012
" through his associate , ping bribed andorran bank officials to accept cash deposits into less scrutinized accounts and transfer the funds to suspected shell companies in china , " it said in a statement
credit rating agency standard & poor 's has reacted to the growing scandal by downgrading andorra 's rating
andorra is highly dependent on its banking sector , which makes up some 20 % of its gdp
spanish has long battled the presence of russian organized crime on its soil
after the collapse of the soviet union , wealthy russian came to spanish for its climate and what were then lax financial controls
among them were more than a few " vory v zakone , " the top echelon of russian organized crime , according to spanish officials
spanish prosecutor jose grinda gonzalez told us officials five years ago that these individuals had no known jobs and unknown sources of income , yet they lived in large mansions
grinda 's remarks were reported in a diplomatic cable later published by wikileaks
grinda had prosecuted kalashov , a georgian - born , russian citizen widely regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the russian mafia
last year , before he completed his nine - year sentence , a spanish appeals court deported kalashov to russian , where he is now a free man
another spanish prosecutor , fernando bermejo , told us officials in 2009 that there was large scale money - laundering going on in catalonia and " many , many " members of the russian mafia were active there
because of growing international cooperation , spanish prosecutors have stepped up their pursuit of alleged gang leaders , money launderers and embezzlers from eastern europe
among the latest to be detained is a former finance minister from ukraine , kolobov
he was detained at a luxury development in alicante earlier this month , after prosecutors in kiev charged him with embezzlement and is awaiting extradition
kolobov was a minister in the government of president viktor yanukovych , who fled ukraine during street protests a year ago
