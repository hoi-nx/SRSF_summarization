he said : ' morale has always been high
confidence has always been there too
' we were obviously disappointed after the arsenal game
i said afterwards that it will show how our team spirit and character is with how we bounce back
the manchester united players celebrate as they beat tottenham at old trafford ' i think if you look at the first 45 minutes ( against tottenham ) then that was exactly the right way to bounce back
' young praised van gaal 's methods , insisting some players had improved under the dutchman 's stewardship
he is undoubtedly one of them
the 29 - year - old was expected to leave old trafford last summer , but he has been one of the best outfield players in the squad this season

fellaini was heavily criticised during david moyes ' reign , but the big belgian has earned plaudits for his performances in the no.10 role of late
' he has been very important for us
he has been in the team and when he is in the box , i 'm not sure many teams can handle him , ' young said of the Â£ 27.5million midfielder
belgian midfielder fellaini celebrates with wayne rooney after scoring the opening goal against tottenham ' you saw ( against tottenham ) that he was fantastic at getting in the box and looking like a striker at times
' i think he likes playing in that position
we just have to utilise his strengths and i think we did that really well on sunday
' i think last season was difficult for a lot of people and this season is totally different
