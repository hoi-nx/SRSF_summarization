bale is being linked with a move away from champions league winners real madrid as the former tottenham forward continues to face criticism from the club 's supporters
united and chelsea have both been credited with having an interest in bringing the world 's most expensive player back to the premier league
sportsmail asked united fan dave ford of 90min.com to give his thoughts about a possible switch to old trafford
bale reacts with disappointment as barcelona players celebrate after the clasico on march 22 bale scored twice to help wales beat israel 3 - 0 in a euro 2016 qualifier on saturday given the opportunity , there 's not a club in the world who would n't want to sign bale and united are no different
the welshman is the future of football
united are showing signs of life again
we 've picked up our form under louis van gaal , sit in the premier league 's top four and beat liverpool at anfield prior to the international break
big money was spent last summer and it will be this year too
it 's all systems go in terms of firing us back to the top of english and european football
however , while the attack is starting to click into gear , something is still missing
most of us have confidence that angel di maria will come good , but we still want more
bale is what we want
having two former real madrid stars in tandem at old trafford is the stuff of dreams
sure , we 'd love to have cristiano ronaldo back too , but our former no 7 has just turned 30 and dare we say it - his best days may be behind him
a 25 - year - old bale is the man to pin the hopes on
bale 's celebration was cut short as he had a goal disallowed for offside against barcelona bale argues with barcelona forward neymar jnr as real madrid lost 2 - 1 to the la liga leaders it 's not all plain sailing for the boy from cardiff in spain
he has been criticised in the real madrid press for not pulling his weight , he went missing in last weekend 's clasico and his car even got a boot up the backside from a supporter in the fallout
real madrid fans are historically fickle and bale is their latest scapegoat
rest assured that it 'll be his head on the chopping block next time real madrid lose a game
he does n't deserve to be treated like some children 's toy - picked up when loved and thrown down to the ground when not
bale should seek a club where his talents are appreciated
united are prepared to offer an escape route and the subsequent affection he needs
unfortunately , bale is still a big part of florentino perez 's plans and the player himself feels like he still has so much to prove
united are not an option that bale wants to take just now , but the offer will always remain on the table
bale has been criticised by fans this season and even had his car attacked by angry supporters the former tottenham forward leads the celebrations after scoring his second and wales ' third of the match his potential signing is not a case of need
after all , no club is going to spend Â£ 86m on a player if he is n't considered some kind of luxury
bale is a player that can lead us to our former glory
you 'd only have to look at the effect he had on tottenham before leaving for spain for proof of his influence
however much he 'd cost , bale would be a worthwhile investment
his ability to play on either flank or through the middle make him a great option , given he can fit around the likes of angel di maria , juan mata and wayne rooney in whatever system suits
heck , he could even play alongside marouane fellaini
any move might unfairly consign the excellent ashley young back to bench - warmer , but football has a habit of not being fair
nevertheless , do n't expect the move to happen this summer
bale has a lot left to prove in spain and he 's too proud a person to walk away from his dream club just yet
but if there 's ever a return to the premier league on the cards for bale , we will be waiting with open arms
