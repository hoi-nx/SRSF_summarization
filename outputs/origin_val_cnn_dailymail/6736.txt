a vitriolic letter written by the future king in which he branded the french canada ' rotten ' and ' the completest passengers ' during a tour of the country has emerged 96 years later
the king - the eldest son of george and queen mary - could not hide his resentment towards the french canadians in the private letter he penned on a visit to quebec
in the letter written a few months after ww1 to his mistress freda dudley ward , the 25 - year - old king expresses his disgust at their reluctance to support the british empire
resentment : the king , pictured in november 1919 during his tour of canada , criticised the french canada in a private letter calling them ' shirkers in everything particularly in war ' contempt : the future king scoffed at the french canadians during his royal tour ( pictured here ) stinging : in the letters , king describes the french canada as ' mostly a rotten priest - ridden community ' in the recently unearthed letter , he says : '' these bloody french canada
' the whole thing is a very delicate , imperial and political question which i do n't attempt to understand though i do know they are mostly a rotten priest - ridden community , who are the completest passengers and who wo n't do their bit in anything and of course the war ! ! ' after catching a train for toronto he wrote of how he was relieved to be leaving the french canadians
he added : ' they really are n't worth all the trouble i 've taken to be out of the way polite to them , as they are shirkers in everything particularly in war as they all voted against conscription
' the ww1 divided canada , with the french - speaking population accused of not doing enough to fight against the germans
later on in the letter to the married socialite , the king derided the attractiveness of the local women
he described one of his hostesses as ' pompous and interfering '
detailing a formal dinner he had attended , he quipped : ' few of the women are worth dancing with and far less are in any way attractive
' at another party at a yacht club , he complained how there were ' 100 very plain women ' there
disgust : king said the french canadians ' really are n't worth all the trouble ' as they are ' shirkers , particularly war as they all voted against conscription ' - he is pictured here in nova scotia , canada , in 1919 french canada are a major american ethnic group and canada citizens derived from the descendants of colonists from france who arrived in france ( canada ) in the 17th and 18th centuries
when war was declared in 1914 , canada automatically entered as it was part of the british empire
but by 1917 french canada only made up 21,000 out of 432,000 men , despite making up one third of the canada population
the french canada opposed conscription as they felt that they had no real loyalty to either britain or france
the six - page letter was written by the future king to married mother - of - two mrs freda dudley ward , years before he gave up the throne in order to marry american divorcee wallis simpson
then 23 , the socialite was married to william dudley ward mp william dudley ward , who apparently turned a blind eye to the affair
the letter is due to be sold tomorrow by iaa ( iaa ) at nottingham racecourse
it is expected to fetch Â£ 1,200 when it goes under the hammer
richard davie , of iaa , said : ' the king was a very patriotic gentleman and was known for wearing his heart on his sleeve
' he obviously would have attended lots of dinners and events in canada and gave very polite and diplomatic speeches but this letter to someone he trusted very much reveals his real innermost thoughts
' he still clearly felt troubled by the role played by the french canadians in the ww1 , feeling they shirked their responsibilities
' i am quite sure he intended these thoughts to remain private and never expected them to become public at any time
' king abdicated in 1936 ( pictured addressing the nation ) so he could marry american wallis simpson king was an army officer during the ww1
although as heir to the throne he was prevented from fighting , he made a number of moral - boosting trips to the western front and was very popular with the troops
king was the king from 1911 until 1936 when he became king , a reign that only lasted 11 months when he abdicated so he could marry american wallis simpson
the prime minster and many others opposed the union because wallis simpson had already been divorced once and was in the process of divorcing her second husband , so the king chose to abdicate instead of giving up his lover
his younger brother george , who served in the royal navy during the war , succeeded king as king in 1936 , the details of which are popularised in the film ' the king 's speech ' starring colin firth .
