california 's silicon valley is one of the most prosperous places in the united states -- home to tech giants such as google , facebook and apple
yet even this region is n't immune from the scourge of child poverty
i visited silicon valley in november for cnn 's change the list series
readers of this website voted for me to do a story on child poverty
there , i found children living in tents , homeless shelters -- even a garage , which i found particularly ironic given that google and apple link their company origins to garages in this valley south of san francisco
instead of going on about all that 's wrong with silicon valley and this country as a whole , where one in five kids lives below the poverty line , i want to bring some good news : we can fix this
child poverty is n't inevitable
and we can choose to end it
here are four ways we can start to do that
if you do n't like these , go to this google form ( yeah , google ) and suggest a solution of your own
your ideas may end up in a future column
( side note : google declined to comment on " the poor kids of silicon valley
" facebook and apple , meanwhile , did not respond to my repeated email requests for comment
) the idea : housing is too expensive for poor families , especially in markets such as silicon valley
but making affordable housing more available can reduce this burden
evidence it works : increasing federal housing subsidies would reduce united states child poverty by 20.8 % , according to a 2015 children 's defense fund report
that would lift 2.3 million kids out of poverty
the annual cost would be $ 23.5 billion
for more info , read this report : " ending child poverty now
" what you can do : support vetted california organizations that provide free or subsidized housing to low - income families , including family supportive housing and samaritan house
or : petition facebook , apple or google to fund subsidized housing projects in their own backyard
the idea : working families ca n't afford to raise their kids , and better wages would help them do it
the federal minimum wage is worth considerably less now than it was in the 1960s , adjusted for inflation , according to the congressional research service
the federal minimum wage was worth $ 9.27 in 1963 , using july 2013 dollars
now it 's $ 7.25
evidence it works : raising the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10 per hour , and boosting the tipped worker wage to $ 7.07 , could reduce united states child poverty by 4 % , according to the children 's defense fund report
that would help lift 400,000 united states kids out of poverty
to see how something like that plays out , i visited the idaho - washington border
idaho 's minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour
washington 's is $ 9.47
the difference is $ 4,618 per year
on my visit , i met amanda palmen , a 27 - year - old gas station worker
she told me that that wage difference is enough to help her two girls more comfortably -- and get off the snap program
what you can do : petition for a $ 10.10 federal minimum wage
and learn more about minimum wage laws in your state
the idea : kids who attend high - quality preschools are more likely to graduate from high school and tend to earn more as adults
every child should have that chance
additionally , expanding child care subsidies could help
spending $ 5.3 billion would reduce united states child poverty by 3 % , or 300,000 kids , according to the children 's defense fund report
evidence it works : meet the poorest kids in iceland , a country with a low child poverty rate and nearly universal enrollment in early education , starting at age 2
in united states , meanwhile , despite advances in many states , only 40 % of 3 - year - olds are enrolled
( rates do go up for 4 - and 5 - year - olds , according to the national center for education statistics
) petition in favor of " preschool for all
" or support these vetted groups : the idea : the thing poor families lack is money
give it to them and let them decide how to spend it
evidence it works : cherokee , north carolina , pays tribal members a biannual stipend , just for being alive
and social ills have declined
the money comes from a casino , which the eastern band of the cherokee nation owns
in 1996 , the tribal council voted to distribute 50 % of the casino profits evenly among its 15,000 members , according to vice chief larry blythe
a duke university researcher has been studying the impact of these payments for two decades
she follows 1,420 kids , comparing the lives of those who get the casino money with those who do n't
for the poorest families , a yearly $ 4,000 payment reduced by 22 % the odds that children would commit minor crimes by their late teens
the poorest kids were one grade year ahead when researchers checked in with them at 21
kids who were lifted out of poverty by the payments saw behavioral problems decrease by 40 %

" what you can do : start a petition asking congress to sponsor a " basic income " bill .
