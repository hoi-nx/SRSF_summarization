australia captain clarke warned his side were yet to play their perfect game in the cricket world cup , despite booking their spot in sunday 's final with a 95 - run victory over defending champions india
steve smith clocked his first cricket world cup century on thursday , his 105 off just 93 balls propelling australia to 328 for seven , with opener aaron finch kicking on to 81 after a slow start
it meant india 's run - chase was under pressure from the start , and , barring skipper mahendra singh dhoni 's run - a - ball 65 , australia had a relatively easy route to the finish line and now have the chance for a fifth cricket world cup title when they face co-hosts new zealand

' losing to new zealand gave us that kick up the backside
i still do n't think we 've played the perfect game yet
i think we 've improved every game and now we 're excited to be in the final
' i think the boys have played some outstanding cricket
smithy was exceptional once again
he 's hitting the ball so sweetly , and i 'm really proud of the execution under pressure there from our bowlers
' steve smith 's century comes in a tournament that has already seen him make scores of 95 , 72 and 65 , and the stand - in test captain hopes there is plenty left in the bag for sunday
' another big hundred would be nice , ' he said
' it 's nice to contribute to a few wins
it was a pretty big stage , the semi-final of a cricket world cup
i 'm just happy that we got over the line in the end
' steve smith plays a fine shot on his way to a 100 against india in the cricket world cup semi-final the all - rounder raises his bat to a bumper crowd after reaching his century on thursday mahendra singh dhoni , meanwhile , feels his side can walk away with their heads held high after a cricket world cup that belied many pre-tournament expectations
india came into the showpiece on the back of a disappointing tour of australia , with no competitive wins to their name , but marched to the knockout phase by topping their pool and then easily beat bangladesh
' overall , i 'm quite happy , ' mahendra singh dhoni said
' where we were at the start of the tournament , a lot of people did n't think we 'd get this far
' at the same time , when you come to the knockout stages you have to lift your game
' there were too many ( runs ) to chase
if you lose quite a few wickets and you 're supposed to chase over six runs an over ... our lower order , i do n't think they can contribute as much in these conditions
' overall , it 's good exposure for them
maybe next time , in other conditions , they 'll know how to bat and do better
' mahendra singh dhoni was undecided when asked after the match whether this would be his last cricket world cup
' i 'm not sure about that , ' he said
' i 'm 33 , i 'm still running , i 'm still fit
' but i 'll have a ( think in a ) year 's time
maybe next year during the t20 world cup i would like to decide if i can continue until the 2019 world cup or not
