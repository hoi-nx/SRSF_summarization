the taxman enjoys a â cosy â relationship with the accountants who help multinationals avoid billions in tax , a damning report will claim today
a powerful committee of mps claims weak law enforcement means tax avoidance â and evasion â remains â a risk worth taking â
the public accounts committee said hmrc is failing to sufficiently tackle â widespread â tax avoidance by us giants , including starbucks , google and amazon
margaret hodge , chair of the public accounts committee , said hmrc needs to come down hard on companies who use artificial overseas offices to avoid tax , and the firms that advise them they must also do more to challenge the accountancy firms which help these multinationals to dodge their liabilities , the group will say
major corporations have been accused of funnelling billions of pounds through tax havens such as luxembourg and ireland to reduce their bill
they are accused of exploiting a loophole which enables them to pay tax in the country where they are based , rather than where they sell their goods
by setting up â artificial â offices in low - tax countries , they are able to pay a much lower annual levy on their profits
today , the public accounts committee will say that the taxman must do more to â challenge â these tactics , saying : â hmrc needs to show that it comes down hard on tax cheats and change the perception that it is far too tolerant of those who break the law by hiding their income
â the current system still causes the odds to be stacked in favour of tax evaders using offshore accounts when the worst that will happen if they are caught is that they will pay the tax they owe and a fine
â amazon , starbucks and vodaphone have all previously been found to funnel profits through tax havens , despite earning that money in the uk it added : â hmrc has not been sufficiently challenging of the manifestly artificial tax arrangements of multinationals
â the report was critical of large uk accountancy firms , such as pricewaterhouse coopers , which it claimed advised many multinationals on how to pay less tax in the uk through the use of complex schemes
they accused hmrc of not doing enough to â challenge â this tax advice and instead focusing on the multinationals themselves
margaret hodge , chair of the public accounts committee and a labour mp , said : â we remain concerned that hmrc âs relationship with these large accountancy firms is too cosy , and it needs to get much tougher in challenging the advice they give to their clients
â it is disappointing that hmrc has rejected our recommendation for a tougher code of conduct for tax advisers - a response which is out of kilter with its wider policy to clamp down on aggressive tax avoidance
â furthermore , we do not believe there are enough prosecutions for tax evasion to act as an effective deterrent to those who break the law
as it stands , tax avoidance â and even evasion â can be a risk worth taking
â we are not persuaded that hmrc and the crown prosecution service are doing enough to prosecute serious tax evasion cases
â the report also found that part of the problem was uk âs hopelessly complex tax system
they said the number of different tax breaks open to businesses and individuals had grown under the coalition by almost 100 to 1,140
these many tax reliefs were open to abuse and difficult to keep track of
the report said : â for as long as the uk has such a complex tax code , opportunities for aggressive tax avoidance and evasion will continue to be exploited
â the report named management firms , such as pricewaterhouse coopers , as being among those who advised their clients on how to reduce their tax bill it added that â hmrc must urgently transform its currently unacceptable levels of customer service â
they claimed the taxman âs target to answer 80 per cent of calls within five minutes was â unambitious and inadequate â and noted that hmrc expected its performance in 2014 - 15 to be â worse â than the previous year
it comes as the treasury revealed it was joining forces with five other tax authorities to examine how digital multinational companies shift their profits to tax havens
gauke told mps the co-operation was part of the diverted profits tax project - or so - called â google tax â - announced in the budget last week and aimed at clamping down on tax avoidance
from the start of next month , companies who artificially funnel profits offshore to avoid paying uk tax will face a 25 per cent levy on that money
yesterday , mr gauke told mps : â as part of this project i can confirm we are working with five other tax authorities to investigate and challenge how digital multinationals shift their profits to tax havens
â for the first time we are gathering a full global picture of the tax risks these companies pose
that is invaluable in helping us to take decisive action
â a spokesman for hmrc said : â we are pleased that the committee recognises the progress that hmrc has made in clamping down on tax evasion and avoidance , by relentlessly pursuing those who seek to cheat the system
â we have shut down marketed avoidance schemes , closed loopholes , secured tough new enforcement powers , and opened up international information exchanges so rich evaders will have no safe havens where they can hide their money
â as a result of our compliance efforts and the Â£ 1billion extra investment over this parliament , we have secured more than Â£ 100 billion in additional revenues in the past five years to pay for essential public services , raised penalties for tax evasion to 200 per cent of tax owed and increased prosecutions five-fold
