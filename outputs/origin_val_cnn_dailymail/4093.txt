when sir ferguson described mackay as â the bravest man in the world â it was enough to make the eyes water
not just with tears but also from the wincing recollections which that sentence invoked among the wonderful old footballers gathered in edinburgh to pay their last respects to a legend of the british game when it was at its most heroic
ferguson âs was among the more thunderous of the personal reminiscences at mackay âs funeral

' i was playing for queen âs park reserves at tynecastle and the great mackay was playing for hearts reserves because he was coming back from a broken toe , ' said ferguson , himself hardly a wilting flower of scotland in the physical challenges
' he tackled me and i thought " christ "
but in those days you had to get up
so i got up and had a look at that big barrel chest of his
he just said " are you alright , son ? " ' the only time i played against mackay
i âll never forget it
â no - one at hearts , who mackay captained to all three major domestic honours , will ever forget him either
hundreds of hearts loyalists lined the route of his final journey from the old ground , in company with the players and staff who have just restored the club to the scottish premier league
at mansfield traquiar , the former catholic church converted into an ornate , stained glass venue for grand occasions like this , sir ferguson described mackay as not only brave but â humble '

he added : â humility is embraced by great people and mackay did that thoroughly
â this was not an entirely scottish homage
mackay won not only his homeland âs footballer of the year award but also its english equivalent
the latter recognised his captaining of a quite wondrous tottenham team to the first post-war league and cup double
the bravest man in the world ? unquestionably one of the bravest in the world of football
he came back from breaking the same leg twice â both horrific fractures â to inspire fa cup â glory , glory â for tottenham
the humblest ? perhaps his modesty worked against him attracting the attention of those who selected the scotland team back in the hey - day
â only 22 caps for a player as good as that ? â ferguson lamented
â scotland was picked by a committee with its head in the sand
â a mackay scarf displayed in the back of a car in respect of the former scotland international denis law , frank mclintock , ian st john , bertie auld and john robertson were among other scottish icons nodding in accord
from way south of the border came these tottenham celebrants of 80 years lived with uncompromising gallantry on the pitch and uncommon courtesy off it â pat jennings , cliff jones , terry medwin , alan mullery , alan gilzean , steve perryman , mike england , clive allen
pick a team from those two glittering histories
but when so doing reflect on something else spoken by ferguson : â they talk about his great courage but he was a fantastic , skilful footballer whose intensity and desire to win would make any team
â and keep a place for mackay .
