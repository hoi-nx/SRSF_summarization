it is a far cry from last summer when yaya toure threatened to leave after being angered that the club did not acknowledge his birthday sufficiently
but while it seems yaya toure could end his career in manchester , defender bacary sagna is growing agitated at his bit - part role and may consider his future at the end of the season
roma coach rudi garcia is understood to be monitoring the 32 - year - old âs situation with a view to a summer switch
bacary sagna signed a three - year deal upon arriving from arsenal on a free transfer last summer
bacary sagna has failed to hold down a first - team place and is growing frustrated at his bit - part role the france defender has started just 12 games for manchester city so far this season roma boss rudi garcia is understood to have taken an interest in bacary sagna 's position at manchester city but he has made only 12 starts while failing to dislodge pablo zabaleta as the club âs first - choice right back
that lack of action is frustrating the france defender , who was a regular at the emirates
sources close to the player say he is keen to help manchester city challenge for the premier league and champions league

manchester city , however , are in a position of strength as bacary sagna will have two years left on his contract this summer

he said : â this means some other guys are going to get meaningful opportunities in his position
we âre going to have a player who âs at the top of his game to give us a boost in the middle of the season
