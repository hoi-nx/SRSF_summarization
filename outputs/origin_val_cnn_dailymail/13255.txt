" " although i do n't deserve it , i want to ask for your forgiveness , " levi pettit said as he read from a prepared statement at a news conference on wednesday

" flanked at the podium by african american leaders who he 'd been meeting with at the fairview baptist church in oklahoma city , levi pettit , who is white , said he planned to spend the rest of his life trying to undo the damage he 'd done
levi pettit 's parents released a statement apologizing for his behavior earlier this month
but it was n't until wednesday that he spoke out himself
" some have wondered why i have n't spoken out publicly
the truth is , i 've had a mix of pain , shame , sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions , " he said
" i did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country first , until i came here to apologize to the community most directly impacted
" levi pettit read from a letter he 'd written the university 's president apologizing for his actions and said he 's committed to taking steps to prevent racism in the future
" over the past week or so , i 've met with a number of pastors and leaders in the community to seek understanding of the meaning behind the words that i spoke on that bus , " levi pettit said
" meeting with a few people does not change what i did , but it has begun to change me , and my understanding of those hateful words
" his comments come more than two weeks after a nine - second clip surfaced showing party - bound fraternity members on a bus making racial slurs against blacks
in it , students at the now - disbanded sigma alpha epsilon fraternity at the university of oklahoma clap , pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching
school officials expelled levi pettit and another student , rice , because of their alleged " leadership role " in the racist chant
rice has also apologized , saying he 'd made a " horrible mistake " and that the chant was " wrong and reckless
" levi pettit declined to answer reporters ' questions wednesday about how he learned the chant , but said he now knows that the words he used never should be repeated
" i 'm also upset and embarrassed that i failed to stand up as a leader and stop this chant
i now have a clear understanding of what lives behind the words , " he said
" from this point forward , i will be the leader that i should have been on that bus and stand up against racism in any form
