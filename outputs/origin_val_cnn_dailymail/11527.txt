japanese scientists have successfully transmitted energy wirelessly in a breakthrough that could pave the way for space - based solar power systems
mitsubishi researchers used microwaves to deliver 1.8 kilowatts of power - enough to run an electric kettle - through the air with pinpoint accuracy to a receiver 170ft ( 55 metres ) away
while the distance was relatively small , the technology could someday pave the way for mankind to tap the vast amount of solar energy available in space and use it here on earth
japanese scientists say they have successfully transmitted energy wirelessly in a breakthrough for future solar space power systems
while the distance was relatively small , the technology could someday pave the way for mankind to tap the vast amount of solar energy available in space and use it here on earth ' this was the first time anyone has managed to send a high output of nearly two kilowatts of electric power via microwaves to a small target , using a delicate directivity control device , ' said a spokesman for the jaxa ( jaxa ) said
the test , which took place at kobe shipyard & machinery works in nagoya , japanese , will help jaxa devise its long - awaited space solar power system
solar power generation in space has many advantages over its earth - based cousin , notably the permanent availability of energy , regardless of weather or time of day
while man - made satellites , such as the international space station , have long since been able to use the solar energy that washes over them from the sun , getting that power down to earth where people can use it has been the thing of science fiction

mitsubishi used microwaves to deliver 1.8 kilowatts of power - enough to run an electric kettle - through the air with pinpoint accuracy to a receiver ( right ) 170ft ( 55 metres ) away in a separate project , a japanese firm last year revealed plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on earth but the japanese research offers the possibility that humans will one day be able to farm an inexhaustible source of energy in space
the idea , said the jaxa spokesman , would be for microwave - transmitting solar satellites - which would have sunlight - gathering panels and antennae - to be set up about 22,300 miles ( 36,000km ) from the earth
' but it could take decades before we see practical application of the technology - maybe in the 2040s or later , ' he said
' there are a number of challenges to overcome , such as how to send huge structures into space , how to construct them and how to maintain them
' the idea of space - based solar power generation emerged among us researchers in the 1960s and japanese 's ssps programme , chiefly financed by the industry ministry , started in 2009 , he said
space - based solar power â once the stuff of science - fiction â could be available sooner than expected if japanese has its way solar power has had a difficult start on earth thanks to inefficient panels and high costs
but in space , scientists believe it could transform the way we generate energy
now , the space - based solar power â once the stuff of science - fiction â could be available sooner than expected if japanese has its way
within 25 years , the country plans to make space - based solar power a reality , according to a proposal from the jaxa ( jaxa )
in a recent ieee article by susumu sasaki , a professor emeritus at jaxa , outlined the agency 's plans create a 1.8 mile long ( 3 km ) man - made island in the harbour of tokyo bay
the island would be studded with 5 billion antennas working together to convert microwave energy into electricity
the microwaves would be beamed down from a number of giant solar collectors in orbit 22,400 miles ( 36,000 km ) above the earth
resource - poor japanese has to import huge amounts of fossil fuel
it has become substantially more dependent on these imports as its nuclear power industry shut down in the aftermath of the disaster at fukushima in 2011
in a separate project , a japanese firm last year revealed plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on earth
luna ring 's luna ring project would stretch almost 6,790 miles ( 11,000km ) around the moon 's equator and a field of solar panels would form a belt
energy captured by these panels would then be sent to earth using microwaves and laser lights could be beamed directly to countries where it is needed
according to the plans , the project would produce around 13,000 terrawatts of continuous solar energy
at present , the world 's population consumes about 15 terawatts of power each year
the company claims the plans would not only provide an ' almost inexhaustible ' energy supply , it would stop the rise of global warming caused by carbon dioxide from current energy sources
