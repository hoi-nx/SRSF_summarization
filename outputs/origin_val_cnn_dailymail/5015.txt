it 's not hard to pick the chick out in this huge colony of king penguins
the solitary young bird stands out from the crowd as it wanders among the large group - made up of around 200,000 penguins - at the salisbury plain in south georgia , usa
while the fluffy chick is distinguishable for the rest because of its warm coat of feathers , the other penguins surrounding him are older and have the typical , black and white ' tuxedo ' tone
the 49 - year - old said : ' there are certain rules when visiting this part of the island
' for example , it is forbidden to approach penguins closer than five metres , otherwise you will frighten the birds
' one shaggy , brown bird in the photograph is a king penguin chick
' he waits on the banks for his parents who go to the sea to get food
returning , the parents seek out their young among the thousands of the same brown lumps
' perhaps the penguin was hungry and went looking for his parents and has obviously ended up in the middle of the other older penguins
' i love the contrast between the single brown chick and the beautiful adult birds , who look like they are dressed in their ' tuxedos '
' baby penguins , known as woollies , keep their brown downy feathers for a year , while they develop a thick layer of blubber that keeps them warm through the winter
king penguin chicks are cared for by their parents for around 40 days before they join a ' creche ' for warmth and protection from predators
their parents return occasionally during the winter to feed them
males incubate the eggs much like emperor penguins , but king penguins do this during the warmer summer season
the female goes to the open sea to feed and return in about 21 days so the male only goes a month without food
change : the king penguin chick on the right has patchy brown feathers
young penguins tend to have their feathers for a year snapped : a photographer bends down to take a picture of the young penguins , who have begun to shed their brown feathers
