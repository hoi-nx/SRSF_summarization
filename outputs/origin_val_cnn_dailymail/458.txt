a passionate tree surgeon created a video to show what his unique , dangerous and perhaps misunderstood job entails
capturing footage of himself on a gopro camera , cezary documented his experiences over a period of several months
the video begins with cezary , a tree surgeon from poland , sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw and filling it up with fuel while in a snowy woodland
suitably prepared , cezary ties himself to a tree and makes his way up it using spikes â also known as gaffs or spurs â attached to his chainsaw boots
what follows is a fast - paced montage sequence showing cezary dispatching trees of all shapes and sizes
sawing through a particularly large trunk , the tree surgeon appears to balance in the air before taking one hand off his chainsaw â while its teeth continue to rotate â and reaching for a wedge
cezary is filmed sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw before filling it with fuel in a snowy wooded area cezary prepares by attaching himself to the tree before climbing up the trunk and cutting it from the top jamming it in the gap , cezary makes his way around the tree , systematically tapping the wedge in further as he goes , until the crane is able to lift the top of the trunk away
another clip of the tree surgeon shows him drawing a smiley face onto a piece of trunk
while the following one presents the three stages in which he safely chops down a rather large tree positioned in the middle of a residential area
the tree surgeon uses spikes â also known as gaffs or spurs â attached to his chainsaw boots to help him climb cezary demonstrates how sharp his axe is by running its blade along a piece of paper and shredding it cezary also shows off how sharp his axe is by running its blade along a piece of paper , after cutting down a tree and throwing his chainsaw behind his back to let it hang by its cord
the video concludes with the tree surgeon chopping off the many branches of a tree , after winching himself into position
before looking into the camera , turning away and demonstrating the trust he has for his tools by resting his chainsaw on his neck
quite a height ! cezary skillfully chops a tree down in three piece ( left ) and enjoys the view after chopping the top off another tree ( right ) like a knife through butter ! the tree surgeon cuts through a huge trunk with ease while using a wedge to help him tree surgeons , or arborists as they are formally known , cultivate , manage and study individual trees , shrubs and vines
their job therefore differs to that of a logger or a forester , who focus on large areas of woodland
often dangerous , tree surgeons are sometimes required to work near power wires but may also plan , consult , write reports and give legal testimony
in the uk , arborists can gain qualifications up to and including a master 's degree
cezary shows off how much he trusts his tools as he walks away from the camera balancing the chainsaw on his neck
