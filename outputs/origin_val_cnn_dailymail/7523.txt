greer delivered an awkward moment on q&a on monday night when she asked foreign affairs minister bishop if she would ' free the nipple ' to save the lives of bali nine duo andrew chan and myuran sukuraman
the social media campaign , which gets its name from the ' free the nipple ' hashtag it is associated with , aims to address the taboo surrounding women 's nipples being exposed in film , television and photographs
it was raised by an audience member who was interested in learning the panel 's view of how they felt about young women posing topless online
' please do n't got there , greer , ' the minister finally answered
this is greer 's second gaffe on the program
in 2012 , the feminist icon said former prime minister julia gillard had a ' big arse '
ms bishop went on to say she was concerned about the concept of young women posting topless photos of themselves on the internet
andrew chan ( left ) and myuran sukuraman ( right ) were sentenced to death after they were caught trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin in 2005 from indonesia into australia ms bishop looked shocked when greer quizzed her on the possibility and was speechless for a few moments ' i just worry that the liberation of young women showing their nipple to the world leads to some perverted behaviour coming even more to the fore , ' she said
bali nine duo andrew chan and myuran sukuraman were arrested in 2005 for attempting to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin from indonesia into australia
q&a viewers were as stunned as bishop when ms greer asked the question and took to twitter to express their surprise
some viewers joked that ms bishop should join the ' free the nipple ' movement on the spot
the pair were sentenced to death and have spent the last 10 years in bali 's kerobokan prison
andrew chan and myuran sukuraman are days away from being executed after they were moved to indonesia 's ' death island ' , nusakambangan , on wednesday
ms bishop has repeatedly asked the indonesia government to spare the duo 's lives
it was revealed last week that ms bishop tried to organise a prisoners swap in exchange for clemency
annabel crabb ( left ) hosted monday 's show in the place of tony jones , with writer roxane gay on the panel ms bishop , along with greer , was appearing on q&a 's first all - female panel to mark sunday 's international women 's day
other guests were writer roxane gay , best & less chief executive holly kramer and borders founder yassmin abdel-magied
the show 's regular host tony jones was replaced by the abc 's chief online political writer annabel crabb
youth without borders founder yassmin abdel-magied ( left ) and best & less chief executive holly kramer ( right ) were also very active on the panel ms bishop also discussed the role of being foreign affairs minister and the challenges she would have faced if she had children while in the position
the minister said she spent a number of days over in the ukraine following the downing of malaysia airlines flight mh17 , which would have been difficult to maneuver if she had been children
' i 'm not suggesting for a moment that every person who 's foreign minister should have no children , ' she said
' but the way i 'm doing it , the way i fulfill the role as foreign minister , i do spend a lot of time away and i do focus 110 per cent on it
