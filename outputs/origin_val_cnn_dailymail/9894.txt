thousands of infertile couples could realise their dreams of becoming parents thanks to a new test that allows ivf treatment to be tailored to a woman 's individual fertility cycle
for the first time , scientists believe they are able to identify the point in a woman 's cycle when there is the greatest chance an embryo will successfully implant in the womb
repeated rounds of fertility treatment can prove emotionally and financially draining for couples desperate to become parents
there are more than 60,000 ivf cycles performed in the uk each year
yet , just 24 per cent lead to live births
meanwhile in the us , 175,000 ivf cycles were performed in 2013 , according to the cdc
there , success rates ranged from 16 to 47 per cent , depending on a woman 's age
experts at the ivi fertility clinic in madrid believe a new test , which identifies the point in a woman 's cycle when there is the greatest chance an embryo will successfully implant , will help thousands of infertile couples realise their dream of becoming parents while the nhs offers the treatment , strict guidelines mean many couples are forced to use private clinics , incurring bills that runs into thousands of pounds
the current treatment involves doctors performing an ultrasound to check the appearance of the lining of the womb , to assess its general health
it is known that for most women , there is a two to four day time period when the lining gives out the key chemical signals that allow the embryo to attach , leading to a pregnancy
but a team of scientists , led by professor garcia velasco at the ivi fertility clinic in madrid , said they believe failed attempts often happen because an embryo is implanted at the wrong time , missing a woman 's crucial window of fertility
they hope their new study will improve success rates for couples undergoing ivf , after they identified a test which can predict each woman 's individual fertility window
professor garcia-velasco , told mailonline : ' the trial we are currently undertaking is trying to answer if the era test may help all couples from the first day they attend a fertility clinic , to detect endometrial defects
' or , if it will benefit only those with repeated implantation failure as the test does now
' my hope is that this test will explain why some women do not get pregnant when good quality embryos are transferred , and thus , avoid repeated ivf failure
' if we are able to select a good embryo and place in the uterus at the right time , success rates should be significantly higher
' these tests are helping us doctors understand why ivf can be unsuccessful and ultimately reduce patients ' frustration of unanswered questions
' he estimates around 15 per cent of cases of implantation failure ' are simply due to bad timing '
he added : ' i think it will make a significant difference in the expectations of couples and how we can explain failures
' until now , the endometrium was kind of a black box
now we can say this was the problem and this is what we can do about it
' the test involves taking a biopsy of a woman 's womb lining
experts then analyse 238 genes , allowing them to determine when the woman 's endometrium - the womb lining - will be most receptive to an implanted embryo
the test involves taking a biopsy of the womb lining , pictured under a microscope
scientists are then able to analyse 238 genes to identify when the lining is at its most receptive and able to accept the embryo
a pilot study of 17 women , who had endured failed ivf attempts , saw nine become pregnant after the test a case report detailing one woman 's experience , followed by a pilot study involving 17 women , showed success rates were significantly improved after using the test
in the pilot study , none of the 17 women had become pregnant despite repeated ( between one and six ) rounds of ivf , when traditional techniques were used
but after the test was used to determine each woman 's window of implantation , nine of the 17 became pregnant and went on to have a baby
it has previously been assumed that the window of implantation was ' constant in all women , ' the researchers note
during ivf , an egg is surgically removed from a woman 's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory
the fertilised egg , or embryo , is then returned and implanted back into the woman 's womb to grow and develop
embryo transfer is the final part of the treatment process , and as a result women will still have to go through a rigorous treatment programme to reach the point where they may benefit from the new test being trialled by professor garcia velasco
step one a woman is given a drug to suppress her natural menstrual cycle , often in the form of a daily injection or nasal spray , for around two weeks
step two a fertility hormone is given , again in the form of a daily injection for between 10 and 12 days
it increases the number of eggs a woman produces , to allow experts to collect and fertilise more eggs , to try and improve the success rate
step three doctors then monitor the woman and around 34 to 38 hours before her eggs are due to be collected she will be given a final hormone injection that helps your eggs to mature
step four for the egg collection a woman is sedated and her eggs are collected using ultrasound as a guide
a needle is inserted through the vagina and into each ovary
the eggs are then collected through the needle
step five the collected eggs are mixed with the woman 's partner 's sperm and after 16 to 20 hours they are checked to see if any have been fertilised
if the sperm are few or weak , each egg may need to be injected with individual sperm
the fertilised eggs , embryos then continue to grow in the laboratory for one to five days before they are transferred back into the womb
once the woman 's eggs have been collected she is given medication , including progesterone , to help prepare the lining of the womb to receive an embryo
step six the embryos are transferred back into the woman 's womb
it is at this point that the test being trialled by professor garcia velasco could be used to determine a woman 's opportune fertility window
but their study has instead found that each woman has her own , individual window of implantation , when she can expect the best results from ivf
' understanding the " molecular clock " at play , regardless of the presence or absence of an embryo during the window of implantation could help to identify biomarkers of endometrial receptivity useful to create an objective personalised diagnostic test for this function , ' the researchers said
their case report details how a 39 - year - old woman attended the clinic , reporting she had endured two failed attempts at ivf
each round of ivf involved the transfer of two good quality embryos that failed to implant and a routine infertility assessment was normal
after counselling , the couple decided to pursue further rounds of ivf
but two subsequent rounds proved unsuccessful
the next step saw experts giving the woman hormone replacement therapy ( hrt ) as well as progesterone replacement
three days after ovulation , triggered by the hormone therapy , another attempt failed
another attempt five days after hormone therapy also proved unsuccessful
despite the repeated failure , the couple remained determined to become pregnant
the researchers then attempted to diagnose the woman 's window of implantation , using the endometrial receptivity array test ( era )
the test is based on the expression of 238 genes that are related to how receptive the womb lining is , established after a biopsy
' the test identifies " personalised " window of implantation in women with recurrent implantation failure , ' the report said
the team took a biopsy of the woman 's womb lining five days after hormone therapy - the point at which the previous attempt had failed
it revealed her ' endometrium was pre-receptive ' , leading them to conclude they had been implanting the embryo too early
the report notes : ' a two - day displacement of her window of implantation was diagnosed , and this determined the need to repeat the era test in a further hrt cycle after seven days of progesterone replacement
' as a result , two embyros were implanted at the key seven - day point , after progesterone replacement , and the woman became pregnant with twins
the pregnancy was uneventful and twins boys were delivered by caesarean section at 36 weeks
a pilot study followed with 17 patients taking part
each had suffered between one and six implantation failures
the researchers diagnosed each woman 's window of implantation and instead of routine embryo transfer , each woman underwent implantation according to her cycle
of the women taking part nine became pregnant and gave birth
for one of the 17 women , six rounds of ivf had previously failed
yet after performing the test , the researchers discovered all previous implantation attempts had been two days premature
after two further rounds of ivf , based on her individual cycle , the woman became pregnant and gave birth to her baby
professor garcia-velasco is now leading a clinical trial of the test , with around 2,500 women who have suffered two or more failed attempts , in more than 10 countries taking part .
