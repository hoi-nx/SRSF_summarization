rodgers believes liverpool will need another 23 points to reach the champions league as he insisted sentiment will have no bearing on when he recalls gerrard
liverpool âs influential captain is fit again after recovering from a hamstring problem he sustained on february 10 but there is no guarantee that rodgers will put him straight back into the starting line - up , as would have been the case during the majority of his career at anfield
during gerrard âs absence , liverpool won three consecutive barclays premier league games against southampton , manchester city and burnley but rodgers feels that sequence is going to have to continue in what will be a pivotal week for the club , with tonight âs trip to swansea followed by next sunday âs showdown with manchester united

â we have 30 points to play for , so i am guessing it will be another 23 points , â said rodgers
â that is how competitive it has been this year
' we have won nine out of 11 in january and february , it has been a great run but now we have to be focused on these last 10 matches
' we have to be aggressive in our game and now we have to nail it in the last 10
i know the players are focused on that
â everyone is waiting to see if stevie comes into the team or not , but it was the same with daniel
does he or does he not ? what you have seen over my time here is that i rely on the team
' the team , of course , has to have good players in it , but ultimately it is about the team and what is going to benefit and how we can get results as a team
' i will repeat again the most important thing is gerrard is back fit and we have lucas leiva coming back too
â that will add to the competition for places and with one game a week , barring the cup game , then everyone is going to be fighting and being competitive about playing
â the beauty of this season is that everyone has had an opportunity in the first three or four months of the season and then we have found a way to win
it is something everyone has to respect
it is about the team and the spirit of the team and i will always pick the best team i feel to win a game

what i do know is that stevie always puts the team first
â raheem sterling âs future , meanwhile , continues to create background noise but rodgers maintains the decision to put contract talks on hold until the end of the campaign has nothing to do with finance
â i still think he has a lot of development to go and this is the best place for him , â said rodgers
â it is pretty obvious that this is a great place for him to be and he has said that himself
