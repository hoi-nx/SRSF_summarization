a revitalised fellaini owes his eventful premier league career to a stand - out performance at anfield â the ground he returns to on sunday carrying the champions league hopes of united on his broad shoulders
fellaini was a 20 - year - old with standard liege when his outstanding display against steven gerrard in a 2008 champions league qualifier persuaded toffees to buy him 19 days later for a club record Â£ 15million
he became a cult hero at goodison park for the next five years before signing for united in 2013
now in his second season at old trafford and used mainly as a striker by louis van gaal , he is in the best form of his united career and scored and made an assist in last weekend 's 3 - 0 victory against tottenham
fellaini fired united into the lead against tottenham with a smart finish the belgian trains ahead of united 's crucial clash with liverpool on sunday , where he is sure to be involved fellaini has grown from a bit - part player last season to become a vital member of louis van gaal 's squad round , assistant - manager to david moyes at toffees and united and who worked with fellaini at both clubs , recounts how it all began
' fellaini had been on toffees 's radar for a while
his ability to play in different positions was attractive because the club did n't have the money to pay big fees on several players , ' explains round
' david moyes asked me to go and watch him play liverpool at anfield and he was very impressive
a lot of players would have been dominated in midfield by someone like steven gerrard in his own stadium but fellaini competed and gave as good as he got
he was n't overawed and you could see he had ability
' when david moyes asked my opinion , it was positive and the club signed him in what was a big deal for them given their finances at the time
' former toffees assistant round watched fellaini play against liverpool for former club standard liege round gave the midfielder a glowing reference to david moyes who sanctioned a Â£ 15m deal to sign him fellaini became one of the most instantly - recognisable figures in the english game with his huge hair making him appear even bigger than his 6ft4ins frame
he became a fearsome threat in the air though opponents often felt he was too aggressive with his elbows and it has to be pointed out the belgian has received 56 yellow cards and two reds since he moved to england
having worked closely with fellaini , round says there is far more to his game than the 27 - year - old is given credit for
' he is technically very good , he may not have the same range of passing as steven gerrard but he rarely gives the ball away
and his chest control is as good as anyone i 've seen in the game
he can play three positions well ; holding midfield , number 10 or up top , where we used him with tim cahill in the season we reached the fa cup final
i think he is best in a more advanced position where he has more freedom and not as much defensive responsibilities
round ( left ) was assistant to david moyes at toffees and then united fellaini became a cult hero at goodison park , where he spent five seasons ' fellaini can hold the ball up and bring others into play and i can see why wayne rooney enjoyed playing with him , in a similar way that michael owen benefitted from emile heskey 's physical presence for england
' a protracted transfer from toffees to united was finally completed in the summer of 2013 for Â£ 27million after david moyes and round had been appointed at old trafford to begin the post-sir alex ferguson era
' i remember ryan warning us that united can take some getting used to for new signings
he sited the example of patrice evra who turned out to be a great player for the club
ryan said he was taken off after 45 minutes of his debut against manchester city because it was such a culture shock
' fellaini is a humorous guy , always able to take fun out of himself
but i guess being the only signing of that transfer window brought its own pressure and looking back maybe he was a bit quieter at the beginning than he was at toffees
but that 's also natural when you are joining a new club with players who have been successful
' fellaini followed david moyes to united , but was considered a figure of fun after the disappointing season under the former toffees boss fellaini starred in the 3 - 0 win over liverpool at old trafford in december , and offers van gaal an alternative after a nightmare first season in which united finisehd seventh , david moyes was sacked and round left too
fellaini stayed but was regarded at that time as a figure of fun
round is not surprised he has been able to turn his fortunes around
' i always thought he would show people what he could do at united
it 's like ryan said , it can take a few months for a new signing to be comfortable
he has always worked hard in training , he does n't hide when things are n't going well
' it 's hard to say what will happen at united next
the pressure is always on to win matches and you do n't know what the manager will do in the summer
but fellaini has shown this season he is an asset to united
' and at lunchtime on sunday , he will hope to show that at anfield , the ground where it all started for him
the only thing he 'd like to change is the result â seven years ago , liverpool edged standard liege 1 - 0 with an injury - time winner from dirk kuyt .
