amazingly clint malarchuk was back playing within 10 days , resumed his career as a player and then became a coach
but three years later , in 1992 , trying to obliterate his demons , he drank a bottle of whisky and took pills that led to his heart stopping
his ocd and depression were finally diagnosed
â it was the first time the chaos in my head was given a label , â he says
at another low , in 2008 , drunk and sitting in his barn , he put a gun to his chin , pointed upwards and pulled the trigger
the bullet richocheted off his molars , took out some teeth and a piece of his tongue , went through his top palate and sinus
his wife joanie then insisted he undertake the longest and most intense rehab of his life , six months
â she is an incredible woman , she saved my life , â said clint malarchuk from their home in nevada , where he has written a searingly honest auto - biography
â i thought at first it might be a kinda hockey book
but the reaction we âve had has touched people
it âs a book about life
â it transcends sport , detailing the brutality of depression
â it âs everywhere , not exclusive to any occupation , any economic status , â said clint malarchuk
â but there is still a stigma around it in sport , where there is constant expectation upon you
i was mentally ill. but i thought i was mentally weak
â clint malarchuk âs story is far from all doom and gloom
he recalls being drafted to the nhl at 20 in 1981 , on a salary equivalent to Â£ 150,000 a year
the quebec nordiques clubhouse had a smoking room and beer fridge
he describes a catalogue of japes , including the time that he and a team - mate , both rodeo men , hired horses and charged them up and down a golf course as colleagues tried to play
clint malarchuk was required to give two press conferences the day after the accident he recounts the occasion at the capitals when he met the us president , reagan
â i was nât interested in politics , i talked to him about movies , â said clint malarchuk
he asked reagan about barbara stanwyck , one of the great pin - ups of reagan âs acting era
â between you and me , mr president , you ever take a run at that ? â clint malarchuk asked
reagan replied : â no , but i sure would have liked to
â then he shook clint malarchuk âs hand and moved on
in early march 1989 , clint malarchuk moved on , traded from the capitals to the buffalo sabres at short notice
he packed his stuff in his truck , made a seven - hour drive to his new team , kept a clean sheet in his first game and helped his side to three wins and a draw in his first five
he was an instant hit
then came the game that has defined his life
the hospital where his life was saved was mobbed by media , some of whom pretended to be staff or relatives to get to clint malarchuk , who was required to give two press conferences the day after the accident
he broke down during the second
the hospital could not cope with the â circus â and he was discharged on day two
astonishingly , he was played as a substitute within 10 days
clint malarchuk 's remarkable story is far from all doom and gloom â if i had to go through it again , i think i âd want to come back as quickly as did first time , â he said
â but i should nât
weakness through the blood loss was an issue
today you âd also have a counsellor explaining the psychological impact of the trauma who âd be telling you there âs no need to get back quickly
and i would follow their instructions
â instead it was 19 years later in the rehab that followed the gun incident , that clint malarchuk came to terms with what he now knows was the post-traumatic stress disorder that exacerbated his problems
back then , he got on with his job , which included taunts from rival fans , including throat - slashing gestures from boston bruins supporters â reminding me to die â
one particularly powerful part of his book takes you deep inside his mind at that time
it might also be the mind of any elite sportsmen , tackling pressure and dark hidden thoughts , obsessed with not failing
â i knew i was struggling , but i was too stubborn , maybe too afraid , to ask for help , â he writes
â i was trained to cowboy up
if you get bucked off the horse , you get back on
â now , he says , he can acknowledge his problems and ask for help
â what âs different is i know what tools i can use to try to handle the issue , â he said
his book concludes : â i nearly bled out in front of thousands
this is about sharing the rest of me , because i know there âs a reason i âm still breathing
â i have ptsd and ocd , depression and alcoholism
i still have meds to take and wounds to heal
i still have a long , tough ride , but i âm tightening my grip and holding on â because this life is a crazy game and i âm determined to win it
