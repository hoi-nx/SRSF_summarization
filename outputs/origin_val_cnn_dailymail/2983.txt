a supermarket price war has saved shoppers across the high street Â£ 400milllion in the last 12 weeks
prices are down by an average of 1.6per cent on a year ago , fuelling evidence that the government âs official measures of inflation will show a period of â good deflation â
the figures , from retail analysts kantar , have delivered some positive news to tesco , where sales were up 1.1per cent , which is its best performance for 18 months
uk âs biggest supermarket , along with asda , sainsbury âs and morrisons , have been forced to slash prices to combat the rise of budget chains , aldi and lidl
essentials such as milk , bread , eggs , vegetables and roasting chickens have seen big price cuts since the turn of the year , delivering a real reduction in the cost of putting food on the table
the kantar figures show aldi continues to thrive with sales up 19.3per cent on a year ago , giving in a market share of 5per cent , which means it is almost on a par with waitrose
sales at lidl are up by 13.6per cent in a year , giving it a market share of 3.5per cent
both aldi and lidl are thriving by deliberately target middle and higher income shoppers by peppering their aisles with high profile luxury or award winning food and drink
just last week , aldi launched packs of two gourmet beef wagyu burgers at Â£ 2.99 , which compares to Â£ 29 for the price of a similar burger at fashionable restaurants such as the london âs dorchester hotel
kantar âs fraser mckevitt , the head of retail and consumer insight , said : â a combination of lower general inflation and the grocery price war has saved shoppers Â£ 400 million in the past 12 weeks , with deflation driven to a record low of -1.6per cent
supermarkets have been cutting the cost of bread , milk , eggs and other staples to compete with rivals supermarkets have been competing with aldi ( pictured ) and lidl , which increased its sales by targeting middle class shoppers â all of the major supermarkets are cutting prices to win shoppers , especially within everyday staples such as eggs , vegetables and milk
retailers are focusing their efforts on simple price cuts rather than complicated â multi-buy â deals
â he added : â among the big four supermarkets tesco has been the standout retailer
it has posted its strongest performance in 18 months with sales up 1.1per cent compared with a difficult 2014
â despite this , the firm âs grocery market share continued to fall , going down by 0.1per cent to 28.7per cent
kantar said tesco âs return to sales growth came largely at the expense of asda , where sales over the 12 weeks were down by 2.1per cent - Â£ 95m â compared to the same period last year
sales at sainsbury âs were down by 0.5per cent , while the figure at morrisons was 0.4per cent lower
by contrast , waitrose continues to do well with sales up 4.9per cent on a year ago , giving it a market share of 5.2per cent
however , much of this sales growth has been built on the back of deep price cuts to match the figures charges by the supermarkets , which is hitting its profit margins
for example , waitrose ran a promotion where it cut the price of its small â essentials â whole chicken from Â£ 4.23 to Â£ 2.11 â a saving of 50per cent â making it even cheaper than aldi and lidl
the current cpi measure of inflation is running at 0.3per cent
the bank of england and economists believe it could show a minus figure for march and april , which should feed through to an increase in spending power and living standards
tesco has recorded its most positive performance in 18 months as it follows the price cuts of aldi negative inflation , or deflation , has not been seen in uk since march 1960 , which was one year before construction started on the berlin wall and two years before the beatles released their first single
john f kennedy did not become president of the usa until one year later , while the uk prime minister at the time harold mcmillan was revealing plans to dismantle the empire by agreeing independence for many former colonies
the centre for economics and business research said : â unlike in the eurozone , where there is a risk of a negative spiral of falling prices and weakening economic performance , the uk âs bout of deflation is expected to be short - lived and virtuous , as the declining prices of essentials increase household spending power
