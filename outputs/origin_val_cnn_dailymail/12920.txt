serena williams had a big decision to make earlier this year , and she wanted to run it by her parents
she wanted to see whether they would support her going back to indian wells , california , to play in a tournament she had skipped 13 times since winning in 2001
the last time she was there , she had been booed loudly and lustfully
the fans were upset and sensed some sort of conspiracy that she did n't have to face her talented older sister in the semifinals
venus williams had withdrawn 10 minutes before their match with a knee injury
many fans did n't buy it and thought it was orchestrated to give the younger serena williams a chance for extra rest
two days later , during the championship match , serena williams , 19 at the time , was jeered when she did well and cheered when she fared poorly
then days after the tournament , which she won , her father , richard , told usa today that as he and venus williams walked down the stairs to their seats , people kept calling him the n - word and one man said : " i wish it was ' 75 ; we 'd skin you alive
" neither serena williams nor venus williams has played in the tennis tournament since
that will end friday when serena williams , the world no. 1 , faces monica niculescu , the 68th - ranked player in a second - round match
the end of the boycott took a lot of conversations with a lot of people , serena williams told reporters thursday
two of the most important were with her parents
" it was a really emotional time for me , " she said , saying the prospect of the talks made her a little nervous
she told them she would n't go back if they did n't want her to go
but they both said to play
her dad said it would be a big mistake not to come back , she said
serena williams said her mother said , " i will be there for you
" venus williams , the no. 11 singles player , is n't playing in the tournament , but serena williams said her older sister was 100 % behind her
she is " very happy that i am here
and even encouraged me to come , " serena williams said
serena williams announced her return to the event in a time magazine first - person piece in february , writing she would ended her boycott in the spirit of forgiveness
she said thursday that she did n't just have to forgive the fans at indian wells
" in order to forgive , you have to be able to really let go of everything
i kind of let go a long time ago , and i kind of forgave , but i was n't at point where i was ready to come back , " she said
the timing seemed right this year , she said
she added that she will be a little nervous in her first match at the bnp paribas open
still she was " looking forward actually to kind of stepping out on center court and letting the whole world know that it does n't matter what you face -- whether it 's something that was n't right , something that hurt you , hurt your family
you can just come out and be strong
