they took the shopper to hospital as a precaution
mr albert carter also struck a customer service desk with his scooter as he panicked following the collision with the female shopper
he received the letter outlining his ban less than a week later
the former truck driver said he has been made to feel like a ' shoplifter ' following the mishap and added that it was the first accident he has been involved in on his scooter
he said : ' i understand that they might be concerned about me coming into the shop after what happened but i have never had an accident on it before so why would they ban me forever ? ' it was my fault
i take the blame completely
after i paid at the front kiosk i turned to leave and then do n't know how it happened
' i did n't do it on purpose but it was that quick i 'm not sure how i hit the women
i was really upset that i hurt someone
' the staff and paramedics were nice at the time so i do n't understand why i have been sent this letter
i have never been a shoplifter so why are they treating me like one ? a letter sent by the store manager to the 80 - year - old a week after the incident said that if he did enter a sainsbury 's he would be treated as a ' trespasser ' ' i want to apologise to the lady
i am really upset to have hurt her
' even if i was let into sainsbury 's i 'm not sure i would want to go in again after the way they treated me
i have barely left home since the incident
' the letter stated : ' the invitation to enter and shop at all sainsbury 's stores is permanently withdrawn due to the incident you were involved in
' should you enter any of our premises , you will be treated as a trespasser and the police will be called as necessary
' the father - of - three 's daughter jayne taylor , from chesterton , staffordshire , has hit out at the supermarket for the ban , which she claims is normally reserved for shoplifters
the 50 - year - old , who works as a security guard , said : ' dad was so upset and distraught at what happened
mr albert carter said : ' even if i was let into sainsbury 's i 'm not sure i would want to go in again after the way they treated me
i have barely left home since the incident ' ' we are not denying that he was in the wrong but it was a complete accident , he did n't go into sainsbury 's to plough customers down
' i 'm just flabbergasted he has been treated like a criminal
how will they enforce it ? ' it 's just out of order
he has now lost his confidence and wo n't go out on the scooter
' a sainsbury 's spokesman said : ' our teams in store have a duty to consider the safety of all of our customers and this decision was reached after reviewing cctv footage and other reports
