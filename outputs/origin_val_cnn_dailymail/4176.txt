the head of the us army has admitted that he is â very concerned â about cuts to british âs defence spending
general raymond odierno warned that the cuts could diminish british âs ability to fight future campaigns
he also called on the government to maintain defence spending at the nato target of two per cent of national income
i would be lying to you if i did not say that i am very concerned about the gdp investment in the british , â he told the daily telegraph
â we have a bilateral agreement between our two countries to work together
it is about having a partner that has very close values and the same goals as we do
â what has changed , though , is the level of capability
in the past we would have a army division working alongside an us army division
now it might be a british brigade inside an us division
â his warning came after the former head of the army said yesterday that fresh cuts to british âs armed forces would be â unwise â with the west facing twin dangers of a new cold war with russia and the rise of islamist extremism
sir peter wall ( left ) and former defence secretary ( right ) are among those to have spoken out against the chancellor 's plan to reduce military spending to below the nato benchmark of 2 per cent of gdp in his first interview since retiring last september , general sir peter wall admitted that he doubted british politicians had the will to â tackle the really wicked issues â facing the world
and the ex-chief of the general staff urged all the major political parties to promise to protect defence spending at 2 per cent of national income after the general election
he said a fall in funding would lead to cuts in budgets for training , equipment and even military missions â further undermining the british âs global standing
the prime minister has faced criticism over the cuts which , say experts , would ' comfort enemies ' speaking to bbc 's the world this weekend , sir peter wall urged : ' we military folk would like to see manifesto commitments to levels of defence expenditure and it 's of concern to us that all parties would probably be content to have this conversation not happening at the moment
' implicit in what the current government was saying around the time of the nato summit in wales last year where we were suggesting that it was everybody 's responsibility around european to meet the 2 % of gdp for defence expenditure , implicit in that is the fact that that 's what we ought to be doing ourselves
' his views were echoed by former defence secretary fox who suggested foreign aid be redirected in order to increase funds
' to say that we were willing to guarantee a proportion of gdp for international aid but not willing to implement our commitments in terms of defence , i think a lot of conservatives would find that very difficult to swallow especially at a time when you can see the international security environment is deteriorating , ' he told the bbc 's andrew neil
' what is happening at the moment with , for example , putin 's russia , is really only one miscalculation away from creating an article 5 crisis that brings conflict to the european continent
' he was referring to the nato article which considers an attack on one of its members an attack on all 28
dr fox added the relationship between british and us had been compromised following parliament 's voting against intervening in syrian following the regime 's reported use of chemical weapons
' i think there was damage done to british 's relationship with the us at least to an extent when parliament voted not to take action over the syrian use of chemical weapons
during a recent visit to washington mr david cameron was told by president obama that reducing british 's defence budget to below 2 per cent would undermine the treaty ' i think there 's a real danger here which is ( that ) you should n't make threats which you 're not willing to follow through on
' if you draw red lines , as president obama did , and do n't follow them through , that only gives comfort to your enemies
' david cameron was among world leaders who pressed other member countries into meeting the 2 per cent target of military spending at the summit in wales last year
however recent reports revealed the government planned to lower spending to 1.8 per cent
president obama last month insisted british live up to the agreed amount or it would face weakening nato
during a visit to washington he told david cameron that anything less than 2 per cent would seek to undermine the treaty
only four countries are thought to have met the quota in the past
they are the us , british , estonia and greece .
