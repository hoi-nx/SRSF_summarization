o'sullivan has again voiced his disaffection with snooker , claiming he is just ' using ' the game and has not yet committed to entering next month 's world championship
the 39 - year - old , who has won the uk championship , the 2014 masters and the crucible title five times each , has struggled for much of his career with the mental aspect of the game and the demands of the tour circuit
his achievements in recent years are outstanding , winning the 2013 world championship having barely played all season and the 2014 uk championship despite suffering with a fractured ankle
o'sullivan claims that snooker does not offer the financial reward and security that it once did o'sullivan also said that he has contemplated not entering the snooker world championship next month o sullivan celebrates winning the 2014 uk championship but hit out at the prize money on offer to players video o'sullivan into last 16 but as this year 's crucible build - up begins , his commitment is once more in question
' snooker is no longer what it once was for me
i just use snooker , rather than letting it use me , ' he told the guardian
' i know it sounds crazy but i was n't even sure if i was going to enter the worlds
i probably will but it 's got to the point where i want to give snooker only 20 per cent of my time
' it 's not something i 'm that bothered about
it 's probably one of my least favourite tournaments
seventeen days is too long
' but as a kid , i dreamed of being world champion
( then ) i thought if i can win three or four , that would be great
three ? you 're getting to be a great player
four ? you 're on a level with john higgins , who is a master of the game
so i 'm really happy to have won it five times
' it is a familiar refrain from o'sullivan
he threatened not to take up his place in the 2014 masters , polling his twitter followers for advice only to announce his entry around an hour later
the switch in the world rankings format , from points to a money list , played into o'sullivan 's hands by allowing him to ' play the system ' - as he put it in 2013 - by focusing on the more lucrative tournaments
o'sullivan claimed the world championship tournament is one of his least favourite events due to its length o'sullivan has won the world championship five times already in a highly decorated career but he remains unhappy and even said he can not achieve financial security through snooker 's 's * * * ' prize money - an extraordinary claim even for o'sullivan , especially as he has already noted : ' i could get by the rest of my life if i never worked again
' he said : ' if you go back five or 10 years i used to get good sponsorship for my logos
i was on Â£ 350,000 even before i hit a ball
now there is no money in snooker
the top players are suffering now
' i do n't want it to come across as if i 'm doing this for money
i just want what 's fair
they can say ' you 're getting this amount of prize money '
but if you 're a top player it 's f * * * * * * s * * *
i want my security , and snooker is n't going to give me that security
