changes : officials at a central georgia air force base have backed down from banning guards from telling visitors to ' have a blessed day ' ( file photo ) ' i have been entering through what is known as the " russell gate " since the 23rd of february
' on no less than 15 occasions over the last two weeks , i have been greeted by the military personnel at the gate with the phrase " have a blessed day
" ' this greeting has been expressed by at least 10 different airmen ranging in rank from a1c to ssgt
' i found the greeting to be a notion that i , as a non-religious member of the military community should believe a higher power has an influence on how my day should go
' the organization 's president , mikey weinstein , said on the group 's website that he spoke with base officials and was told that staff would no longer use the greeting

after initially banning the greeting , base officials said thursday evening that further review showed it does n't violate air force standards
