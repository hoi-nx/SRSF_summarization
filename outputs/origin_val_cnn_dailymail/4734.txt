the iaaf said in a statement : ' while the iaaf agrees with rusada that there is , in each case , sufficient evidence of an anti-doping rule violation and that there are aggravating circumstances justifying an increased sanction of more than two years , the iaaf disagrees with the selective disqualification of results applied by rusada as a consequence of the previous rulings
' sergey kirdyapkin was one of six russian athletes to be banned after abnormalities with biological passports the iaaf said the case of tatyana chernova , who beat jessica ennis-hill to heptathlon gold at the world championships but was later banned , was still under review
