former wales and british lions flanker martyn williams has called on the six nations organisers to change the way they draw up the player of the championship shortlist after warburton was left out of 12 - man nominations
warburton , 26 , was one of his country 's best players throughout the competition but the wales skipper is not up for the top gong , which is based upon performance statistics rather than balanced expert opinions
dan biggar and alun-wyn jones are the only welsh nominations while scotland , who lost every game , also have two players in the running in jonny gray and stuart hogg
wales skipper warburton races away for a try during his side 's 60 - 21 trouncing of italy in rome ' warburton is the standout name not on that list , ' martyn williams told sportsmail
' it was a big surprise
it 's always very contentious , but it 's picked using statistics and i do n't think that 's the way to do it
i prefer the way they do it for world player of the year where they use a panel of experts to get a general consensus
warburton can feel very hard done by for not making it
you could make a case for leigh halfpenny and liam williams as well
' sam 's stats are always very high but penalties can count against you if you play on the edge
his influence on the team ca n't be measured through stats because they do n't capture those big moments in a game where the big players stand up
' warburton will be the player to win a big turnover to win a big game ; but that just counts as one turnover on a stat sheet
he 's a fantastic role model and a leader by actions
' wales fly half dan biggar has made the six nations shortlist for player of the championship wales lock alun-wyn jones is the only other welsh player to make the 12 - man shortlist after losing their opening test against england , wales went on to win all of their remaining fixtures and eventually finished third on points difference
warren gatland expects his side to be serious challengers at the world cup and , if they can continue to build on their momentum , martyn williams believes they have the talent to make the final at twickenham
' this squad has more or less been together for four years , so they 're in a really good place , ' said martyn williams
' they will obviously be disappointed not to win the tournament but , in terms of the bigger picture , they 're looking good for the world cup
can they be challengers ? yes , why not ? the group stages are just as difficult as the quarter and semi finals
that 's how finely balanced it is
if they win the group , then they could go all the way
then again , they might not get out of their group at all
