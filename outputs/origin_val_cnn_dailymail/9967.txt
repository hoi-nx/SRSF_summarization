the christian couple behind a mobile phone app which censors swear words from ebooks have removed all titles from their online catalogue following backlash from authors
clean reader replaces certain words that might be deemed r - rated with more friendly alternatives , but authors accused it of ' suppression ' and selling ' vandalised ' books
a statement from the firm this week said it was removing the titles after finding that ' many authors do not want their books being sold in connection with clean reader '
after downloading the app , users are able to browse a variety of books , and when opened , can switch between â clean â , â cleaner â or â squeaky clean â settings
the lowest setting only blocks â major swear words , â according to clean reader , which includes â the f - word â
lady chatterley 's lover by d. h. lawrence before : â i do nât want to f * * * you at all
my heart âs as cold as cold potatoes just now
â after : â i do nât want to [ freak ] you at all
my heart âs as cold as cold potatoes just now
â before : â it was not woman âs fault , nor even love âs fault , nor the fault of sex
â after : â it was not woman âs fault , nor even love âs fault , nor the fault of [ love ]
â before : â she threaded two pink campions in the bush of red - gold hair above his penis
â after : â she threaded two pink campions in the bush of red - gold hair above his [ groin ]
â gone girl by gillian flynn before : â the girl is one step ahead of me in everything , even sh * * * * luck
â after : â the girl is one step ahead of me in everything , even [ crappy ] luck
â the â cleaner â setting blocks slightly more words , while the highest setting â is the most restrictive setting and will block the most profanity from a book including some hurtful racial terms
â in the books , deleted words are covered up with a grey box , removing them from view
if users click a green dot in the middle of the box , the app will suggest alternative words that the can be used instead
a statement from the society of authors , published yesterday , reads : ' authors have expressed confusion on social media as they have not been consulted on their works ' inclusion in clean reader 's library , and there appears to be no easy way to opt - out
' we have also been notified that the algorithm used is imperfect , and that words chosen as replacements can often be unsuitable or even nonsensical
' chocolat author , joanne harris led the opposition to clean reader , writing a blog post entitled : ' why i âm saying â f * * * you â to clean reader '
writing in a subsequent post after it was announced the titles were being removed from the app , she added : ' though i âm delighted that clean reader are no longer selling vandalized books , they are still distributing the app , and although this is certainly a victory for books , i would nât start cheering just yet
' in the books , deleted words are covered up with a grey box , removing them from view.if users click a green dot in the middle of the box , the app will suggest alternative words that the can be used instead users can pick between ' clean ' , ' cleaner ' and ' squeaky clean '
the lowest setting blocks ' major ' swear words , and the highest blocks all profanity
alternatives for the deleted words are suggested when reading she added : ' if a reader chooses to avoid reading my books , that âs fine
' if she hates it , that âs also fine
if she has opinions on how it could have been done better , that âs also fine , because she âs entitled to her opinion , whether i agree or not
' but - her opinion does not extend to changing my work in any way
my book , my rules , and that includes my words
' novelist chuck wendig tweeted : ' personally i think # cleanreader is a bunch of hot jeepers mcgee and a bucket of monkey flopping cupcake batter oh gosh they got to twitter
' the clear reader statement read : ' over the last several days we have been asking for and receiving significant feedback from authors
' a common theme in all of it is that many authors do not want their books being sold in connection with clean reader
' we have therefore taken immediate action to remove all books from our catalogue
' any books that have already been purchased will remain in users ' library and an app update will be released in the near future
the app works by scanning through a book and blocking out offensive words ( examples shown in these images ) shown left is an excerpt from lady chatterley 's lover , where the word ' sex ' has been replaced by love

the creators of clean reader said : â one day our oldest child came home from school and she was a little sad
â we asked her what was wrong and she said she had been reading a book during library time and it had a few swear words in it
â eventually we decided we would do all we could to bring clean reader to the world
