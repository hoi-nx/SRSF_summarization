taking over : carole is to fill in while william and duchess of cambridge find new household staff the duke and duchess of cambridge can finally breathe a sigh of relief after finding new housekeepers to run their norfolk estate â duchess of cambridge âs mum and dad
last month i revealed that william and duchess of cambridge had lost the services of housekeepers amy and colin wood , their valuable husband - and - wife team
now i understand that carole and michael middleton are personally filling the void while they help duchess of cambridge look for some new hired help to maintain elegant anmer hall
though carole has stopped short of scrubbing floors , she is said to be organising every detail of running the household from her own quarters in an annexe of the 100 - room georgian manor
duchess of cambridge âs father michael is thought to be overseeing the gardening , and has been involved in making arrangements to clear a mole infestation which has ruined a pretty lawn overlooking the sandringham estate
it is believed that carole , 60 , and her 65 - year - old husband have now committed themselves to staying in norfolk until duchess of cambridge âs second child arrives next month
mr and wood started working for the duke and duchess of cambridge in september last year when restoration work was being completed on the georgian mansion
the property was given to the royal couple by the queen after they got married
the woods lived at the site with their five - year - old son , with mrs wood looking after the ten - bedroom property and her husband in charge of landscaping and the garden
the couple had previously been trusted employees at the sandringham estate and it is thought they will return to work there after five months with the duke and duchess of cambridge and their son , prince george
sources say that duchess of cambridge , who has endured another difficult pregnancy , has been â tetchy â and can only be truly placated by her mother â one of the many reasons why william is happily encouraging the arrangement
mrs carole has previously been said to be a frequent visitor to anmer hall
but news of the middletons â involvement in running the cambridge family home comes at a time when reports suggest that prince charles is growing anxious about how little he sees his grandchild
a family friend tells me : â when george arrived , duchess of cambridge and william moved into duchess of cambridge âs parents â house
this time the middletons are moving in to anmer with william and duchess of cambridge
there is plenty of space and duchess of cambridge really wants her mother around
at the moment carole is getting everything in place because the baby is due around april 25
â the couple have been left in the lurch since housekeepers amy and colin wood , their valuable husband - and - wife team , quit last month the middletons were the first to meet prince george after his birth in 2013 â ahead of charles and his wife camilla â and it seems they are set to be favourites when it comes to getting access to george âs brother or sister too
another source added : â william is very happy to sit back and let carole take up the reins
she is ensuring that anmer runs like clockwork
the nursery and staff will be an oasis of calm and evenings will be sacrosanct for relaxation , sleep and recovery
â the middletons spent christmas at anmer hall - with the duke and duchess of cambridge flouting royal tradition by being absent from the normal get together at the queen 's lunch at sandringham
there have also been rumours that the middletons are considering buying a house in norfolk to be close to the duke and duchess of cambridge and their young family
this could be a great help for the duchess of cambridge because william will be starting his new job as a helicopter pilot with east anglian air ambulance in the summer
the family home in bucklebury is a frequent bolthole for duchess of cambridge , who also retreated there for a week in october last year as she again struggled with the extreme morning sickness that marked her first pregnancy
duchess of cambridge 's mother is thought to be running every inch of the household from her quarters at anmer hall ( above ) despite the presence of spanish nanny maria borallo , mrs carole was seen taking prince george off her daughter 's hands as he dealt with her morning sickness
she is said to prefer being there than kensington palace because she can retreat from the public eye
officials were forced to announce the duchess of cambridge 's pregnancy in september , which was earlier than planned , because her acute morning sickness meant she was forced to cancel a number of public engagements
the duchess was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration during her first pregnancy with prince george
but doctors have been better prepared this time and it has been suggested she may even have been treated with a drip at home
