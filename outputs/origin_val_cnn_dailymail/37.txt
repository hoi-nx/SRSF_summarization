a pair of car thieves who stole Â£ 110,000 worth of range rovers in a sophisticated scam targeting sellers on autotrader have been jailed
bates , 27 , and ali , 29 , were part of a cunning gang who would turn up at addresses of people advertising their vehicles on the classified motoring website and secretly clone their car keys , a court heard
they would then return later on to steal the luxury cars
the duo and accomplice michael griffiths , 31 , targeted their first victim on november 3 , 2013 when a range rover sport worth Â£ 36,500 was stolen from an address in redditch , worcestershire

it has never been recovered
just four days later , the gang stole a range rover evoque , worth Â£ 30,000 , from surrey
but the crooks ended up dumping the car in a layby on the m40 near wheatley , oxfordshire - when michael griffiths disappeared
griffiths ' body was later discovered in the river thame on december 24 after a police appeal for his whereabouts
despite their missing friend , ali and bates targeted another address in wolverhampton , west midlands , on december 1 and tried to steal another range rover evoque
but they were foiled when the owner realised the pair had tampered with the diagnostics of the car , which was worth Â£ 28,500 , and that his key fob no longer worked
the pair were arrested that month and linked to the thefts and attempted theft of the four vehicles - worth a total of Â£ 140,000
the pair who would turn up at addresses of sellers on autotrader and secretly clone their car keys before returning to steal the vehicles and yesterday bates and ali were jailed at birmingham crown court and received lengthy driving bans
ali , from hall green , birmingham , was jailed for three and a half years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to steal , theft of a motor vehicle and failing to surrender to custody
he was banned from driving for four years
bates , from shard end , birmingham , was jailed for 15 months after admitting conspiracy to steal and was banned from the road for 18 months
sentencing them , judge patrick thomas qc said : ' this was significant professional crime
it involved calculated and technically astute pre-planning and professionally carried out thefts or attempted thefts of high value motor vehicles
' they were offences of pure and unadulterated greed
ali you were centrally involved in this
i accept there were other people but you were the man on the ground , organising and carrying out this sophisticated and carefully planned theft
' the duo stole Â£ 110,000 worth of range rovers , including a range rover sport ( file picture , right ) worth Â£ 36,500 from redditch , and a range rover evoque ( file picture , left ) worth Â£ 30,000 , from surrey - when michael griffiths disappeared joseph keating , defending for bates , said : ' the loss of mr michael griffiths is something that he has really been affected by
' he understands that had it not been for his involvement in this enterprise it is very likely mr michael griffiths would still be here with us today
. that is a burden he has on his shoulders
' ali pleaded guilty to all four thefts , but bates admitted the redditch , leicester and surrey offences
ali and bates used classified website autotrader to track down their potential victims
the men would pose as interested buyers and tell the householder they needed to check the car for faults
they then inserted an electronic device into the vehicle âs on - board diagnostic slot to supposedly check the vehicle 's history or mileage
in fact , it was a tool - used by locksmiths to re-programme car keys
the thieves would then clone the keys and return later while the owner was asleep or at work and steal the car
police had issued an appeal for the ' missing man ' in december 2013 and , after appealing for sightings in the oxford area , michael griffiths ' body was pulled out of the river
after the sentencing , detective constable rob clarke from west midlands police said : ' ali never wanted to be caught with the stolen vehicles and would pay bates to take the risk of driving them away once they had been stolen from the victim 's home address
' ali thought that he was above the law but a combination of information from the public and thorough checks by our intelligence analysts led to his downfall
' unfortunately , this is not a new method used by criminals and there were around 1,234 ' keyless ' car thefts between april and december last year
' we are working hard to reduce these thefts by regularly stopping high value cars to check they are not stolen and advising legitimate owners of the steps they can take to protect their vehicle
' however , i would like to take this opportunity to remind car sellers that if anyone comes to see your vehicle and asks to plug something into it then do n't let them
there is no need for them to do this and any checks they want to do should be carried out at a garage
