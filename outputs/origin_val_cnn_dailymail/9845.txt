a new itv programme that appears to show members of the public being hypnotised has been branded a fraud by experts
contestants in you âre back in the room compete for cash prizes after being put in a trance by a hypnotist who claims to have â hacked â into their minds
barry is said to have implanted ideas into volunteers â brains â convincing them , for example , that their pants will feel tight whenever they hear a bell , or that they should push their face into a cake every time they hear certain words
â it is not true to say anyone can have their brain hacked , â said qualified therapist powlett
â you absolutely ca nât make people do things they do nât want to do
â people who are under hypnosis are put in a very relaxed state which makes them open to positive suggestion
but the last thing a show like this wants is people who are relaxed â as they would nât be able to perform as required
â mr powlett said contestants on the show , hosted by phillip schofield , were not under barry âs â control â , but playing along willingly
â the people on stage want to entertain , they what to be in front of people and they want to win money , â he said
in a trance : experts have questioned whether contestants on new show you 're back in the room , pictured above , are really hypnotised liz mcelligott , chief executive of the national hypnotherapy society said : â the programme sounds sensationalist to me
it âs completely wrong to say you can make people do something they do nât want to do
â it would worry me if vulnerable people are playing along because they want to be on television
â itv selected contestants via auditions , and one who failed to get a place tweeted : â my conclusion is that they are looking for people who purposely carry on for the camera because it will make great tv
â barry , who is certified by the national guild of hypnotists , said : â there is obviously a huge difference between using hypnosis as a therapy and as entertainment
â all contestants were genuinely hypnotised
on many occasions they were throwing away their prize money â something they would never ordinarily do , unless of course they were hypnotised
â itv , which will air the four - part series from next saturday , said ; â duty of care to the contestants was always of paramount importance
â producers also abided by the 1952 hypnotism act and ofcom rules on showing the full hypnotism routine that may cause â adverse reactions â .
