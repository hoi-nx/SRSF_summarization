the 2014 gold cup winner lord windermere has been confirmed as a definite grand national starter jim culloty will also be represented by spring heeled , who also won at last season â s cheltenham festival , as his launches a twin assault on the Â£ 1million prize
a spokeswoman for culloty âs co cork stable said : â both horses are definite runners
there are no concrete jockey plans at the moment
