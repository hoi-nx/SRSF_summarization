a chelsea fan on twitter - @ talkofthebridge â tweeted recently : ' i dread the day terry retires more than i dread my own death
' at first it makes shocking reading , but when you factor in the extreme passion of football fans , the love they have for their club , and the astonishingly high regard chelsea fans have for their captain , it all makes sense
it should be interpreted in the same way as bill shankly âs famous quote : ' football is not a matter of life and death , it âs more important that that
' here âs another way of saying it
chelsea will not be able to replace terry when he finally retires
england have had to move on already
but the question remains , how on earth will chelsea cope when the inevitable happens ? life and chelsea will go on of course , but reflecting on yet another incredible man - of - the - match performance from terry at wembley , it occurred to me that he is unique
terry and jose mourinho celebrate on the wembley pitch after chelsea 's win on sunday not so long ago some were declaring terry was finished
he could nât train properly , we were told
he could nât play two games in a week apparently
the truth is very different
andre villas-boas ' ridiculous high line ensured this over-hyped manager got the worst from terry and made the player look vulnerable
and then rafa benitez arrived to seemingly finish off the destruction of arguably chelsea âs greatest ever player
jose mourinho has resurrected the king of stamford bridge
it is now a major cause for concern among chelsea fans if terry is nât in the starting line - up
so in playing terms , he is still the first name on the team sheet , even with the likes of cesc fabregas , diego costa , nemanja matic and eden hazard at the club
but the love for terry among chelsea fans is about so much more than him being a very good centre half
and that âs why he is seemingly irreplaceable
terry beat hugo lloris to score chelsea 's crucial first goal in the capital one cup final the blues captain ran off to celebrate after breaking the deadlock at wembley ... and he led the celebrations at the end as the chelsea players partied after winning the capital one cup he came through the youth ranks , and is now a revered chelsea captain
his team - mates respect him , and they listen to him
the fans still idolise him
the football world laughed when he lifted the champions league trophy with his full kit on despite being suspended for that final
but most if not all chelsea fans understood it
terry was a huge part of that journey , and in their minds he belonged on that podium , he deserved the champagne , and he deserved to be wearing the shirt that night as the celebrations began
the cynics and critics will go on and on about terry âs indiscretions â some alleged , some not
he âs far from perfect of course , a bit like the rest of us
and i would nât say chelsea fans do nât care about any of that stuff
but it does nât hide the fact that when he does decide to retire , there will be a massive grand canyon to fill
the chelsea captain celebrates after they beat bayern munich to win the champions league in 2012 i âm not a chelsea fan , so i asked three friends of mine who are to sum it up
a work colleague , emma , said this : ' he is our rock , our leader , without him we do nât win all those titles and we love him for how much he gives his all to the shirt
you can imagine cutting him and his blood would spill out blue
every other fan hates him but knows deep down they would love him in their team
' another friend , laura used the cliche â ' mr chelsea ' to describe him , and then went on : ' you can see what the team and the club mean to him
his reactions after every game , he always comes over to the matthew harding lower and gets the rest of the team over as well to applaud the fans
a few games ago he signed my shirt , got on the team coach , then got off again and offered a family tickets as he thought he âd heard them say they had travelled but could nât get in to the game
it âs a side of him that shows what the fans mean to him and a side that not enough people and media see
' another colleague , the ex-chelsea defender jason cundy , told me this : ' terry is the best ever chelsea youth product , best ever chelsea centre back , and most successful captain ever
he âs still so important to the club on and off the field â captain , leader , legend
with so many foreign players at chelsea , and so few homegrown players to come through over the last 15 years , he represents the fans on the pitch and plays with the same passion , pride and love for chelsea that we fans have in the stands for the club
it will be impossible to replace him
