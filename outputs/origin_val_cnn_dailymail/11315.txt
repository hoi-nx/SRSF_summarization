he has acted opposite mae west , tripped the light fantastic on the great white way and even partied with rita hayworth - and now ryan is sharing his stories about life during the golden age of hollywood
the only problem is that ryan is a 10 - year - old boy from muskogee , oklahoma who was born to baptist parents
the amazing life he describes belongs to actor and hollywood agent martin
ryan says it was his past life
his vast knowledge , vivid recollections and stunningly accurate descriptions of the era have convinced even experts that the young man may have in fact been reincarnated
she says he began having nightmares that neither she or her husband , a local police officer , could find a way to stop
he would talk about his heart exploding and , more than anything , hollywood , a place that was thousands of miles away from oklahoma
what 's more , the reserved youngster would always speak in a matter - of - fact manner during these times
then , after a year of this , he finally sat down his mom
' he said " mom , i have something i need to tell you , " ' said cyndi
' i used to be somebody else
' having been raised baptist , cyndi did not believe in reincarnation or past lives , and decided to hide her son 's admission from his father
but she slowly became curious and then somewhat convinced the more her son spoke of hollywood , his five marriages , lavish trips to europe , his old homes and how all his acting clients kept changing their last names , so she decided to start doing some research on hollywood during the studio era and shared some of the books she found at the local library with her son
then , one day , ryan had a breakthrough when he saw a still from the from the 1932 movie night after night starring mae west
' that 's me , ' ryan told his mother
ryan began seeing dr. tucker ( above ) soon after he revealed his past life , a highly respected child psychiatrist who works with children who remember past lives , and does not think ryan is lying ryan also recalls parting with rita hayworth ( above ) when he was martin ryan 's father ( center ) is a local police officer and neither her nor his wife knew anything about old hollywood ryan was pointing to an extra in the film , a man with no lines that they later learned was bit - actor - turned - agent martin
that is when cyndi decided ryan should talk to someone , and the family found dr. tucker , a highly respected child psychiatrist from the university of virginia who has spent time talking with and studying children who claim to remember past lives
and even he noted there was something very special , and different , about ryan
most remarkable to dr. tucker , besides ryan 's incredible detail , was how accurate his claims matched up with the life of martin , a virtual unknown who neither ryan 's family nor dr. tucker knew anything about , even his name , until they reached out to a film archivist
the film archivist gave them the name , and they then contacted one of martin 's daughters to ask about his life
that is when they discovered that 55 of ryan 's statements matched up perfectly with martin 's life - including the street he lived on , how many children he had , how many siblings he had and those aforementioned five marriages
the most shocking claim however came when ryan told dr. tucker during a session one day that he wondered why god had him die at 61 - years - old only to be reincarnated as a baby
this seemed to clash with martin 's death report , that stated he was 59 at the time he died
that is until dr. tucker looked through old census reports and discovered that the certificate , and not ryan , was incorrect
the certificate claimed martin was born in 1905 when in fact he had been born in 1903 according to the census
and so , martin was likely 61 years old at the time of his death
ryan now says his memories of martin are starting to fade , and as for dr. tucker , he has compiled ryan 's story and other like it in his book return to life .
