' it 's not great being out injured for any player , i 'm especially bad when i 'm out injured and it 's even harder when things are n't going well on the pitch for the team
' but we 're in it as a team
we 're in it together whether you 're injured , or if you 're playing every week
we 've got 10 tough games now before the end of the season , but 10 games we 're very confident of getting results from
