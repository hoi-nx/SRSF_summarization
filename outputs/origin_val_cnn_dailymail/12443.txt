irbil , iraq iraq forces are doubling down efforts to retake the city of tikrit from isis , even uniting sunni and shiite fighters in the mission
the iraq army , along with sunni and shiite militiamen , attacked isis strongholds in the area monday , the state - run iraqiya tv reported
iraq warplanes and helicopters are also striking targets in and around tikrit
it 's part of a wide - scale offensive ordered by iraq prime minister haider al-abadi on sunday
tikrit fell to isis in june of 2014 , after the group 's capture of iraq 's second - largest city , mosul
tikrit is best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraq dictator saddam hussein
isis , the radical sunni militant group , has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of iraq and syria
iraq forces approached tikrit from several fronts , iraqiya tv reported , engaging with isis north of the city at al-alam and south of the city at al-dour
the element of surprise probably was not a factor , as reports of iraq troops amassing near tikrit were widely shared
what awaits the iraq army is most likely a long , hard slog and not a quick rout
tikrit is a big city , and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from isis
there have been several failed attempts to recapture tikrit since the second half of 2014
while iraq forces have gained some territory in the area , it has generally been under isis control for the last eight months or so
the joint iraq forces fighting to retake tikrit include iraq troops , members of the shia al-hashed al-shaabi militia , members of the sunni sons of salahuddin brigades , and other sunni tribal fighters
the offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all
al-abadi , who is also commander in chief of the armed forces , said on twitter that he will " oversee the operation to liberate tikrit " from isis
in short , this is the biggest test for an army trying to claw back territory that fell to isis last summer after a string of dramatic defeats
last june , tikrit was the scene of the bloodiest massacre ever perpetrated by isis militants
they captured more than a thousand iraq soldiers , who laid down their arms and donned civilian clothing in an attempt to flee a base once used by u.s. forces
isis subsequently executed as many as 1,700 soldiers , and posted the video of the killing online
there is concern that iraq forces , eager for revenge , may kill combatants and civilians alike
the u.n. 's envoy to iraq , nickolay mladenov , urged all armed forces in tikrit to do their utmost to spare civilians
u.s. and other coalition troops have been conducting a crash course to retrain and upgrade the iraq army , and several thousand iraq troops have passed through the course
this offensive will tell whether that training has made a difference
the offensive also highlights the role played by neighboring iran in the fight against isis
the semiofficial iran fars news agency reports that qassim sulaimani , the commander of the elite iran al-quds brigade , is helping oversee the operation to retake tikrit
iran has provided advisers , weapons and ammunition to the iraq government
if the offensive succeeds , it means that retaking mosul , a city 10 times bigger , is possible
but tikrit is almost 200 kilometers ( 124 miles ) south of mosul , and much of the territory in between is under isis control
al-abadi has said the immediate goal is to liberate salah ad - din province , of which tikrit is the capital , and then focus on adjacent al-anbar province , a similarly sunni - dominated province
after that , retaking mosul is an option
if , however , the tikrit offensive fails , it could spell disaster for baghdad
there will be political recriminations , the already fragile morale of the iraq army could collapse , the kurdish autonomous region could decide to break from iraq , and it would provide isis with a victory it has n't seen since last summer
