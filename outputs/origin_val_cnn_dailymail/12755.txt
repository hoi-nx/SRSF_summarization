charleston , south carolina thirty years or so ago , the synagogue in washington dc where i was attending yom kippur services received a bomb threat
as we evacuated the building , i was concerned that people did n't seem to be taking it seriously
i was visiting from europe , where terrorism was a fact of life , and i was scared
throughout the 1970s and 1980s in europe , and even beyond , far - left and far - right extremists , the ira , radical palestinian , and a variety of other groups carried out thousands of terror attacks , big and small , that left thousands dead or injured
jews , israel -- and united states -- sites were targets of some of the most notorious attacks : from the massacre of israel athletes at the 1972 munich olympics , to plane and cruise ship hijackings , to attacks on airports , synagogues , and simply places where jews congregated , such as the jo goldenberg kosher deli in paris , where six died and 22 were wounded in a bloody attack in august 1982
in rome , where i lived for parts of the 1970s and ' 80s , we tended to avoid certain streets where el al and united states airlines had their offices
the first big story i helped cover as a young reporter was a bloody attack at the city 's fiumicino airport in december 1973
a dozen years later , the daughter of friends was killed in another palestinian attack there
the main synagogue in rome has been under tight guard since palestinian attackers threw hand grenades and sprayed machinegun fire at worshippers after services in october 1982 , killing a toddler and wounding dozens
i do n't want to discount the gravity and horror of recent terror attacks against jews targets in europe , such as in copenhagen and paris
i just want to add some perspective
many things have changed over the decades
post-cold war power vacuums and middle east upheavals have given rise to radical islamist and globalized jihadist terror networks whose message , fanned out via the internet and social media , strikes a chord in disaffected youth
to be sure , jews are being targeted
but it is important to recognize that jews are being targeted as part of a violent campaign against western democracies and western values in general
today 's victims of islamist terror include christians and muslims as well as jews
in the middle east and africa , women , children , students , and cultural heritage -- history -- are also directly targeted
in some ways , today 's jihadist terrorists can be seen as harnessing various types of terrorism we saw in earlier decades : the anti-jewish / anti-israel terrorism of radical palestinian groups and the anti-establishment , even anarchistic terrorism of homegrown groups whose aim was to sow fear and destabilize society as a means to bring down the system
criticism of israel is legitimate ( and sometimes necessary ) , but it can , and sometimes does , cross the line
this is n't new either , however
jews in europe have been regarded -- and scapegoated -- as surrogates for israel for decades
in 1967 - 68 , after israel defeated arab states in the six-day war , poland 's communist regime staged an " anti-zionist " campaign that forced most of the remaining jews out of the country
at least 13,000 jews emigrated , according to dariusz stola , who is now the director of the museum of the history of polish jews
other experts put the figure as high as 20,000
this was -- and remains -- by far the most widespread episode of anti-semitism in europe
twenty years later , in 1988 , a report by the adl warned that a significant number of anti-semitic incidents in the united states now reflected " a politically - related anti-israel component
" a jta news report at the time quoted adl national director abraham foxman as noting that the phenomenon was new in the united states , but " it 's been a common occurrence in european countries
" particularly worrisome , the report said , were israel - related anti-semitic incidents on college campuses
sound familiar ? after the holocaust , it was common to view jews in europe as sitting with their suitcases packed , just in case
but -- unlike poland 's " anti-zionist " campaign -- terrorism did not prove an existential threat to jews and did not prompt a mass exodus
nor should -- or will -- it now
the nazis , followed by communist rule in half of the continent , almost succeeded in making europe judenrein
following the most recent terror attacks , jews and european national leaders have made clear that this is not an option
moreover , despite the terrorist threat , european governments have refused to budge in their defense of democratic values
it is wise to be on guard , of course , and there is indeed ample cause for alarm -- even fear
but we should also be on guard against something else -- against a facile temptation to cry wolf that can all too easily distort alarm into alarmism -- and fear into fear - mongering .
