' naismith understands the sentiment
he said : ' our times at rangers are probably the best in our careers
we were a successful team and had some great memories and being a rangers fan he would have enjoyed it and want to relive them

since i 've been there it 's been a great adventure , from being a substitute and not having an impact to playing in most of the big games and having an impact
' i love it at the moment but you never know things can change so quickly in football
i 'd never rule anything out to be honest
' there has been no end to the turmoil at rangers since naismith left and following a recent boardroom coup , former gers midfielder stuart mccall was put in charge of the team for the rest of the season which meant he had to step down from his post as scotland coach
speaking of that , ex-kilmarnock player naismith said : ' it was one of the best decisions the new board could have made

he 's great around the squad , he 's straight forward even in this environment when he 's not the manager
he 'll still tell you ' it 's not good enough
' ' i think it 's a great decision and hopefully from now until the end of the season he can reap the rewards of going in there and getting rangers back to the premier league
' naismith believes the northern ireland match will be a more than a typical friendly as scotland look to then add to seven euro qualifying points from four games against group d 's bottom side at the weekend
the everton forward said : ' the norther ireland game is a great game because it will be more than just a friendly , with it being against a country so close to home and with a lot of the players knowing each other and playing against each other
scotland manager gordon strachan oversees a training session at mar hall near glasgow the former scotland midfielder gave some advice to up and coming scottish managers ' so there will be more of an edge to it
' it also gets us familiar with the way that we play
it has been a long time away from scotland and the boys have missed it
' it is very good to be around the squad at the moment
we have two good games that hopefully we can push on again
' i never like to put a number on what points you should have where and when , especially in this group
' but winning the home games in the qualifiers and taking points in the away games will put you in a right good position
