three delaware teenagers involved in videotaped assaults of a mentally disabled man have been sentenced to probation and house arrest , followed by placement in a secure juvenile facility
the teens were sentenced monday after each pleaded guilty to a single felony count of crime against a vulnerable adult
the boys , two 15 - year - olds and a 14 - year - old , were sentenced to probation and house arrest for the rest of the school year , followed by summer placement at a juvenile facility
videos posted online showed the 27 - year - old victim being body - slammed to the ground , stomped on and kicked , and repeatedly punched in the head
others can be heard laughing hurt : the man , who can be heard groaning , was reportedly treated at the hospital afterwards for injuries the defendants were charged with offensive touching , assault of a vulnerable adult , and conspiracy
prosecutors later added hate - crime charges , which were dropped along with other charges following the guilty pleas
a video that was posted to youtube shows a group of teenagers pursuing the victim as he shouts : ' leave me alone ! ' one boy swings at the man , repeatedly punching him , before picking him up and throwing him to the ground on at least two occasions
the boys then crowd around the man - while one teenager who is filming the attack on his cellphone nears the man to get a closer shot as he writhes on the floor
a separate video reveals them attacking the man in a wooded area , fox29 reported
in that attack , the victim can be heard crying , while a female voice says : ' you guys are so mean to him
' in september , the victim 's mother yana told wpvi that while initially seeing the video she felt ' rage , anger - because of the situation , with him being mentally disabled , he does n't do anything to anyone but be kind
' yana told the television station her son karon has williams
those with williams often have an intellectual disability , heart defects , a slight stature and distinctive facial features , including a flat nasal bridge
sufferers are often extremely friendly
' he 's not doing too good , ' his godmother debra jackson told cbs in september
' one , he 's ashamed about it happening , he âs embarrassed
' she added that her godson thought the teenagers were his friends
that same month , one teenager who appeared in footage told cbs 3 that he assisted in reporting what happened
he said the assaults were filmed in newark
he told the television station at the time ' the right thing to do was call the cops
if you beat up a mentally disabled person , you should be locked away for good
' cruel : as the group surround him , one of the teenagers ( with the backpack ) is more concerned about getting a close - up snap of the victim than helping him concern : the victim 's godmother and sister ( seen in september ) said that he is ashamed and thought the teens were his friends see video below
