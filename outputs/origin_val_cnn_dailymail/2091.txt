with its riverbank setting in the upmarket buckinghamshire village of bourne end , this victorian house could hardly have a more peaceful location
but its history tells a different story â of revolutionary social change and financial despair
platts dell , whose garden the meandering thames sleepily caresses , is where the formative years of frontline suffragette kate parry frye were spent
it was here that her father , frederick frye , a businessman and liberal politician , saw his firm collapse , resulting in his family having to auction the house that they had lived in for 22 years , as well as its contents
the four - bedroom victorian house where suffragette kate parry frye lived is on the market for Â£ 945,000 the details of her family 's travails â and kate parry frye 's conversion into a leading light of the suffragette movement â are documented in her diaries , which she kept from the age of eight until three months before her death at 81 in 1959
the diaries were discovered in 2013 and edited into a book , campaigning for the vote by historian elizabeth crawford
they tell of how she joined the suffragettes in 1906 , how she criss - crossed southern england and set up camp in the east end of london on her mission to win for ' votes for women ' , and how she helped see through the suffragettes ' partial victory in 1918 â when women were allowed to vote from the age of 30 â and the full victory in 1928 , when the age limit was lowered to 21 , the same as for men
