' hundreds of thousands of muslim families will no longer have to choose between honoring the most sacred days on their calendar or attending school , ' mayor bill de blasio said in his announcement
muslim leaders welcomed the announcement
' after years of advocating by new york city 's muslim community , muslim public school students will finally and thankfully no longer be penalized for observing their religious holidays , ' said zead ramadan , a board member of the council on american-islamic relations
