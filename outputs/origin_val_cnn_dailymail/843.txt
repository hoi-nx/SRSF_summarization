pardew believes english football is not doing enough to include black coaches â and wants to see more ethnic minorities in top jobs in the premier league
pardew âs crystal palace side face qpr at selhurst park in saturday âs lunchtime kick - off , and the visitors have the top flight âs only black manager in chris ramsey
qpr appointed chris ramsey last month unexpectedly after harry redknapp left the club , and pardew believes the appointment was a great boost for the premier league
palace manager pardew believes that english football is n't doing enough to include black coaches chris ramsey , qpr boss , is the only black coach in the top flight - and one of just six in the football league â he âs black , which i think is great for the premier league , â pardew said
' we âve got a black manager , and it âs something that i want to promote here in terms of our coaches , because the percentage of players we have to percentage of coaches in terms of origin is nât right
â so i âm pleased ( he got the role ) , i hope he does well , he âs done a terrific job so far because that qpr team has improved under his tutorage , though hopefully not improved too much tomorrow otherwise we âre going to be in trouble
â and pardew said he feels the entire english game needs to work on being more inclusive in the people it hires
chris ramsey takes a coaching session at the qpr training ground this week ahead of his side 's trip to crystal palace former chelsea striker jimmy floyd hasselbaink is currently managing league two outfit burton albion chris ramsey is one of just six black or ethnic minorities bosses in the football league , along with huddersfield town boss chris powell , brighton âs chris hughton , carlisle manager keith curle , leyton orient boss fabio liverani and jimmy floyd hasselbaink with burton albion
â i think it âs just important to promote coaches
the proportion of african , afro - caribbean players to coaches is not right , â pardew said
â i think it âs something that needs to be spoken about and something that we need to work on as an fa and the chairmen up and down the country need to give more chances
â â i actually do feel that a lot of black players or afro-caribbean players do nât go into the coaching courses
perhaps they feel it âs not going to help them , but it will
â we need a greater influx of indians , afro-caribbeans , entering our coaching system and getting jobs , so the proportion makes sense
