on reflection , it would be wrong to describe inter-squad relations back then as frosty
cordial might be more appropriate
yet the warmth was distinctly a few degrees south of what naismith is currently enjoying each time the scotland squad gathers on the banks of loch lomond
the reasons for the dawning of an age of bonhomie are not too hard to fathom
in little over two years , gordon strachan has transformed the national team from a laughing stock into a source of genuine pride and hope
one that people naturally want to be part of
awkward conversations between players who would much rather be elsewhere are conspicuous by their absence
a sense of togetherness - which can only truly be fostered by a string of positive results and performances - is palpable
the scotland squad are in high spirits in the lead - up to their clash with northern ireland on wednesday naismith says : ' from when i joined the national team to now , it âs a totally different dynamic ' the old clichÃ© about a club - like atmosphere surrounding scotland â for so long just empty rhetoric â now has a solid basis in reality
â from when i joined the national team to now , it âs a totally different dynamic in that every single player is chatting away to anybody , â said naismith
â it âs just normal
we âre a bunch of guys who are at similar points in life â starting families , getting married but all driven
seeing what we have here and what we can do is what âs driving everyone
it âs great that we âre all of similar mind - sets and it works
â ( previously ) i would nât say it was as tight as it is now
everyone was nât as open as they are now
â i would nât say there were cliques and people not talking to each other
but the rangers boys and the celtic boys did tend to stay together
it âs just who you are familiar with
â now everybody is just a bit more open
so many more of us get on and will be texting each other outwith football
it just brings people closer
â for much of naismith âs scotland career , a call - up to the national side brought mixed emotions for many
gordon strachan 's reign has brought back a sense of pride to the scotland shirt at times , the pride of being selected to pull on a dark blue jersey was diminished by a realisation that the team was going nowhere fast
frequent numerous call - offs just became the way of things
many of those who did assemble for duty wore the look of men who wish they had nât bothered
naismith says there are no cliques in the side â most folk will hang about in the communal areas and chill and enjoy banter , â he added
â in the past , people maybe went to their own room or someone else âs room in twos or threes
â now you could walk through the hotel and see eight or nine guys mixing â and it âs always a different mix. â the manager has not directly encouraged it but the way he operates being so open and honest rubs off on the way we behave and work together
â it says much that only ross mccormack has withdrawn from gordon strachan âs original party to face northern ireland on wednesday and gibraltar on sunday
hardly fixtures that necessitate a dose of tranquillisers to calm the pulse of the tartan army , but tellingly viewed by the entire squad as matters of the utmost importance
â it âs a very good game as we âve both started our campaigns very well , â naismith said of wednesday 's hampden park friendly
â it âs a game with a little more to it , like northern ireland and england , because they are close to home and the players are all familiar with each other
it âll be a very good test
it âs an opportunity to try a few things and refresh the minds of what we âve been doing because we âve not been together for a period or four or five months
â for naismith , this match is also a case of friends reunited
both steven davis and kyle lafferty shared a dressing room with him at rangers for four years with three scottish titles gleaned in that period
norwich striker kyle lafferty did nât have his troubles to seek at ibrox initially but his latter contributions â together with his current displays for club and country â have long since convinced naismith of his value to any side
naismith will be reunited with friends kyle lafferty , who who played with during a successful run at rangers he will also compete with steven davis , another former rangers star now on the southampton books â ever since he was at rangers he was been a big player for northern ireland , â he said
â he has scored a few goals for them and he has been their main striker since david healy
he has always been a threat and has matured more as he has grown older
â he probably lacked a bit of maturity back then , definitely
around the changing room he was a great laugh and when times were tough he was always there to keep the boys up , even if he was the brunt of the jokes
when he was younger , he probably did nât know when to stop
he has matured more now and speaking to the boys at norwich they say he is different now to how he was back then
â the way he finished seasons ( at rangers ) was remarkable
at specific times in a season you need players who are going to drag you through games and laff would always pop up at the end of a season
â what everton would currently give for such a lucky charm
currently sitting 13th in the premiership , last season âs remarkable run to fifth under roberto martinez seems distant , while their europa league aspirations were ripped to shreds by dynamo kiev
everton 's naismith and chicago - based shaun maloney , formerly of rangers and celtic respectively , share a laugh as they warm up with the scotland squad on tuesday typifying how many fans now have the collective memories of goldfish , graffiti denigrating the spaniard has been seen around goodison park
â i âve seen that , â naismith admitted
â to be honest , it âs very unlike everton fans
i think it âs a very small minority
â at times this season it âs been so frustrating for them after the success of last season
the way we played then was great and everything was going for us
â it âs not nice to see but we definitely believe in what we are doing
â the irony of scotland now providing a lift for ailing club players is lost on no one
if defeat to england last time out was a natural disappointment , there was no shortage of understanding given the toil in putting ireland to the sword four days previously
â the last trip was quite tricky , â naismith recalled
â there was so much build up on the ireland game , the main event , and to get such a good result took such a lot out of the boys
â in hindsight , everyone was desperate to play against england â¦ the manager was speaking to a few players to see if they would sit it out , but everyone was dying to play and that probably went against us
â england caught us off guard , were on the front foot and pressed us well and took their chances
it was difficult for us to take but we are a much more solid unit now with so much confidence for places
â even matt ritchie has come in , who is such a great talent
he âs exactly the type of player who will add something to the squad
