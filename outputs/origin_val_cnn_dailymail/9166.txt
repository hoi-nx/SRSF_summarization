hoag was breastfeeding her eight - week - old baby in an oklahoma city in the women 's locker room when a staff member came in and told she could n't feed baby ezra there she was escorted through the gym to a ' family ' locker room and was left ' embarrassed and upset ' by the whole situation the first - time mother said that the whole experience was ' disheartening ' , according to koco
' you do n't think it 's going to happen to you , ' she said
' i really am humiliated and just embarrassed
i was escorted out of the locker room and through the gym
' hoag said that to make matters worse , ezra cried as they walked through the gym , attracting more attention
' i was really embarrassed and upset because people were looking , and he was crying because he was still hungry , ' she told kfor , adding that she did n't want to return to that ymca
the fitness and community center has since released a statement , claiming that the whole situation was a misunderstanding
' the y is a place for families , and we support breastfeeding moms in our facilities

' we are very sorry that this new mom had a negative experience and will continue to train our staff to understand that moms can breastfeed anywhere they would like to do so in our facilities
' hoag said that she , too , hopes this does n't happen to other mothers
' if it had to happen to me to make it not happen to ten other mothers , then it 's worth it , ' she told koco
' and if it ends with me , then i 'm happy and i 'm good with that
' hoag said that she is raising awareness of her situation because she hopes no other mothers have to go through what she did
