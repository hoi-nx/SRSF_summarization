dinner with arnold palmer on thursday night clearly agreed with world no 1 mcilroy
all those indifferent rounds in florida so far this year were swept aside on friday as the northern irishman notched up five birdies in a row at one point on his way to a superb 66 at the arnold palmer invitational
it was the first time in eight rounds in the florida this year that he had broken 70 and what a way to do it
from out of the pack , the 25 year old is now bang in contention for a morale - boosting victory in his last scheduled start before his attempt to complete the career grand slam at the masters next month
mcilroy hit a second round of 66 at the arnold palmer invitational on friday it was the first time in eight rounds in florida this year that the world no 1 had broken 70 mcilroy looks to have played himself back into form ahead of the masters next month â i âm just feeling more comfortable day by day , and it was great to see a few putts finally drop , â said mcilroy , whose performance drew a glowing tribute from his good friend and playing partner , rickie fowler
â after what i saw today and the fact he âs clearly the best player in the world , he has to be the favourite for the masters , â said the american , who was pipped at the post to both the open and uspga championships last year by mcilroy
â that course suits his game
he did nât start out hot today but when he gets it going as he did on the back nine , it âs hard to hang with him
if he continues to play like that , he will be ready for augusta , for sure
â rickie fowler was right when he said nothing appeared to be happening for mcilroy over his front nine , the inward half on the course
in fact , he âd played much better on the first day , when he opened with a 70
but after finally getting a putt to drop at the second , and enjoying a small stroke of fortune at the third , where his pulled drive carried a water hazard by just a couple of yards , it all started to click
a good wedge to the third green set up a birdie and then came his third in a row at the par five fourth
at the fifth his wedge shot finished 18 inches away and then came another birdie at the long sixth , where he got up and down from a greenside bunker
â it âs a lovely feeling when you get on runs like that and the game suddenly feels very easy , â he said
fowler 's good friend and playing partner rickie fowler admitted mcilroy is now favourite for the masters mcilroy had five birdies in a row in dubai earlier this year but this was the first time he had enjoyed such a run in an event on the pga tour , and it electrified the huge galleries at bay hill
by this stage he had gone from being nowhere near the leader board into a tie for second place
not even a bogey at his penultimate hole could dampen his enthusiasm
â it was obviously not the finish i was looking for but i âm still exactly where i wanted to be , with a real chance to win the tournament going into the weekend , â he said
mcilroy will actually begin the third round on saturday five shots behind american pacesetter , hoffman , who has played brilliantly so far to post blistering rounds of 66 and 65
but can the little - known hoffman keep it going ? the new jersey native is the same age as 25 year old mcilroy but there the comparison ends
a solitary top three finish in 67 starts on the pga tour suggests he could struggle over the weekend
three shots off the pace are world no 3 henrik stenson and defending champion matt every , while mcilroy is not the only big name from the uk in position to have a crack at winning this prestigious title
matt every is also in the mix , three shots behind surprise leader hoffman ian poulter is in contention at halfway after rounds of 67 and 70 put him one shot behind mcilroy for the third week out of four in florida , ian poulter is in contention at halfway , standing just a shot behind mcilroy following rounds of 67 and 70
he also gave a positive bulletin on his three year old son , joshua , who is making a good recovery from pneumonia
â it was great to see him looking a lot perkier than when i left for the course this morning , â he said
padraig harrington , who began this florida swing with an amazing comeback victory at the honda classic , is also in the top 20 at halfway after rounds of 68 and 71
but there âs no getting away from the man who will attract nearly all the attention this weekend
as for that dinner with arnold palmer , mcilroy was still buzzing
â it was fantastic , it really was , â he said
â we spoke for two and a half hours and he was telling stories of the old days and some of the things he â s done from a commercial standpoint
he was very close to his father just like i am and he shared a few stories about that
it was just great to be in his presence and enjoy his company
