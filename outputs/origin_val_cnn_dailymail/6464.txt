the retired chief superintendent from south yorkshire police spoke out as he gave evidence for a seventh day at the hearing in warrington
he admitted that as the man in charge on april 15 1989 ' the buck stops with me ' , but said he was inexperienced and had inherited a safety plan from the previous year
defence barrister john beggs qc asked him : ' it has been suggested by some of the barristers sitting in front of me there was some conspiracy to interfere with a fair collection of evidence
did you have any part in that ? ' david duckenfield said : ' none at all , sir
' mr beggs said : ' did you know anything about it ? ' david duckenfield replied : ' i did not '
mr beggs asked : ' did you at any stage even encourage any other police officer or police civilians to change his or her statement ? ' he said : ' no , sir
' mr beggs went on : ' did you change the content of the statement that the jury know was made by you on or before may 3 1989 ? ' he said : ' no , sir
' mr beggs said : ' did anyone ever ask you to change your statement ? ' he said : ' no , sir
' he confirmed he had no role in the subsequent investigation by west midlands police into the tragedy and had no part either in the direction of the force 's case at lord justice taylor 's inquiry
mr beggs said it had been suggested by a number of barristers at the inquests that mr david duckenfield alone should bear responsibility for the tragedy
mr david duckenfield agreed he had nothing to do with previous turnstile ' failures ' at sheffield wednesday and no one had advised him about them
he had no say on liverpool being awarded the smaller end of the ground for the match with just 23 turnstiles
in reality , he had ' inherited ' the police operation for the match
he also had nothing to do with signage at the ground or previous decisions to install perimeter fences and radial fences , its architectural features or any breaches of stadium safety guidance on crush barrier heights
mr beggs asked : ' if supporters turned up later in 1989 than in 1988 , for whatever reason , was that something with which you had any control ? ' ' no sir , ' said mr david duckenfield

during questioning by paul greaney qc , for the police federation , he admitted he had caused the deaths of the fans
mr david duckenfield , who retired in 1991 , accepted he ' froze ' before ordering the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion outside the leppings lane turnstile
but 2,000 fans then entered gate c , with many heading straight for the tunnel in front of them which mr david duckenfield had not ordered to be closed

mr greaney then asked if he had failed to recognise he needed to close the tunnel and mr david duckenfield again agreed
