no parent wants to hear that their child is a bully - and thanks to the stiff punishment he dreamed up , this father is unlikely to hear it twice
timothy robenhorst , from green bay , wisconsin , was shocked to find out his son kayden had been mistreating a classmate , and in response gave him a tough workout , gardening duty and instructions to apologize
for the physically grueling stages of his 5 - part punishment , kayden was dragged out of bed at 4:30am and made to do 50 push - ups on his fists
spelling it out : timothy robenhorst was shocked to heard his son , kayden , had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him next , the boy was tasked with performing ten tougher , incline push - ups , then running a mile
early - morning wisconsin temperatures are still routinely below freezing
but kayden 's labors were not over after his hellish morning workout - and the boy is stuck doing landscaping work at two houses his father apparently owns for an unspecified length of time
punished : kayden , pictured , was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs but the punishment also has an emotional and social aspect - with kayden also being instructed to apologize to his victim in front of his entire class the day after , which was set to happen wednesday
timothy robenhorst then posed for a photograph with his son and a poster spelling out his punishment , and encouraged people to share it
as of friday night it had been shared more than 1,000 times
he also seemingly insisted that it be posted on kayden 's profile too , where it was set as his profile picture and cover photo
under the post , timothy robenhorst wrote : ' i teach my kids they do not start fights but if someone puts their hands on them they finish it
' this is what happens when you become a bully ! i do n't put up with it and at 4:30am today my son found out what happens when you pray on people for no reason and bully ! ' please share this to end this behavior everywhere ! nothing changes until you take a stance and it only takes one person to start a revolution ! ' apology : kayden was made to say sorry to his victim in front of his whole class at pulaski middle school , pictured
