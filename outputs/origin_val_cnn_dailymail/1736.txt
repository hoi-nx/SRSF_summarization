the victorian hospital , which is located in fairfield , provides advanced clinical treatment and programs for patients from the criminal justice or mental health systems
before price , 31 , was charged with stabbing 17 - year - old schoolgirl to death , he revealed to the age that he was the patient who punched mr abbott nine years ago
' then he dropped his hands and smiled , and said ' i 've been hit harder than that on the football field '
' a spokeswoman for mr abbott at the time of the incident said one of the patients ' had a go at tony ' when he was visiting several mental health service providers in melbourne
' it was over in about three seconds
it was so not a big deal , ' the spokeswoman told aap
' ( the patient ) did take a swing
he did connect , but to say he punched him is overstating it
' the quote from tony is : ' it is a matter of complete inconsequence '
