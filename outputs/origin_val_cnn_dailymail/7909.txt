prosecutor dobson told the court how the woman 's mobility was badly affected by the attack
because she now struggles to move her right arm , the pensioner has become reliant on her family and struggles to pay for carers to help with cooking , dressing and bathing

in a witness impact statement , the elderly woman said she had forgiven rimmer for the shocking attack
' i feel comfortable in the home i have had for 55 years and i will not let anyone force me out of my own home , ' she said
' unfortunately i do n't think i will ever be able to forget this incident , due to the physical problems i have and the upset it has caused not only me , but my family
' i really struggle to understand why he has done this to me , however i have no ill feelings towards him and forgive him for what he has done
' i 'm a strong catholic and feel sorry for him and his family
i hope he will turn his life around
' rimmer forced his hand into the frail woman 's mouth to silence her screams as he continued his horrifying sex attack , manchester crown court ( pictured ) heard hunter gray , defending , argued that with no previous convictions , rimmer should not be classed as a ' dangerous ' offender
but judge hilary manley disagreed , saying that rimmer attacked the victim with ' extreme force and viciousness '
she added : ' she tried to resist and fight you
you were a young man of 19 , making yourself as fit as possible for entry into the army
she was an 84 - year - old who had to use sticks when she walked
' she is clearly resilient and brave but these offences have had a profound impact on her life ... she 's not spent a night at home alone since this incident
this was a vicious and humiliating attack on a vulnerable and defenceless elderly woman , it must have been a terrifying experience for her
' had she not managed to disarm you it could have ended even more badly
' ' you can not present a reason why you committed this offence - the lengthy and unnecessary violence causes the gravest concern
' rimmer admitted attempted rape and sexual assault and was jailed for 12 years
he must spend an extra five years on licence and will not be released until the authorities are satisfied he is no longer dangerous .
