a dramatic surge by the snp looks set to claim gordon brown 's scotland seat and rob ed miliband of a commons majority , according to a new poll last night
the study of marginal constituencies suggests labour and the conservatives are heading for electoral deadlock in may , with neither party able to govern alone
the poll , commissioned by former tories treasurer lord ashcroft , suggests the snp is on course for a landslide at the general election , winning as many as 56 of scotland 's 59 seats - up from just six at present
the poll , commissioned by former tories treasurer lord ashcroft , suggests the snp is on course for a landslide at the general election , winning as many as 56 of scotland 's 59 seats - up from just six at present
the snp surge would claim seats held by a string of household names , including those of departing gordon brown and alistair darling , and former lib dem leader kennedy
the tories are also in danger of losing their one scotland seat , held by mundell
at westminster the poll suggests labour and the conservatives will be tied on 272 seats each - well short of the 326 needed to command a commons majority
lord lord ashcroft said the astonishing surge by the snp in the wake of last year 's independence referendum had thrown a ' giant spanner in labour 's works ' , although the party is forecast to win tories seats south of the border
of the eight scotland seats polled , the snp would gain six - including four from labour - and tie with mr mundell , in dumfriesshire , clydesdale and tweeddale
' it is hard to see things getting any worse for labour in scotland , while things are on a knife - edge elsewhere , ' lord lord ashcroft said
' but as things stand , labour losses in scotland could offset their gains from the tories , leading to something close to a dead heat
' this , then , is the battle : can the conservatives fight back against labour faster than labour can fight back against the snp ? ' labour 's leader in scotland murphy ( right ) is facing an uphill battle to hang on to labour 's 40 seats north of the border the snp surge is on course to claim seats held by a string of household names , including those of departing gordon brown and alistair darling the poll throws up the prospect of a weak ed miliband government propped up by nicola sturgeon 's snp - she has ruled out supporting a tories government
the two pardicts ties would have a combined total of 328 seats - producing a commons majority of just three
former first minister alex salmond , who is planning a return to westminster , has refused to rule out becoming a government minister in the country he tried to break up as part of any deal
and the snp has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from labour , including billions more in spending and borrowing , home rule for scotland and the scrapping of uk 's trident nuclear deterrent
tories peer lord ashcroft has carried out a series of polls in marginal scotland constituencies the new polling suggests that the snp will make deep inroads into labour 's scotland heartlands , and all but eradicate the lib dems
gordon brown 's kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath seat , where the former prime minister is stepping down , currently has one of the biggest labour majorities in the country
but the new poll forecasts an incredible 28.5 per cent swing to the snp , giving the nationalists a comfortable six - point lead
in edinburgh south west , where former chancellor alistair darling is also stepping down , the poll pre-another snp win , on the back of a 22 per cent swing
in ross , skye and lochaber , which mr kennedy has held since 1983 , a 21.5 per cent swing to the nationalists looks set to hand the seat to former snp treasurer ian blackford
scotland secretary alistair carmichael , in orkney and shetland , could be left as the only lib dem mp in scotland
new scotland labour leader murphy is forecast to cling on in east renfrewshire , despite a 20.5 per cent swing to the snp
but , in this scenario , he could be one of only two labour mps remaining
mr murphy last night said david cameron would be ' rubbing his hands with glee ' at the findings as they suggested the nationalist surge could prevent a labour victory
he added : ' we ca n't let david cameron back into downing street by the back door
that would be a disaster for scotland , but it looks like that is what might happen if these polls in scotland are repeated on election day
' snp election chief angus robertson described the findings as ' very encouraging ' and showed the party was picking up seats across scotland , including in areas that rejected independence , such as the borders , where mr mundell is facing a knife - edge battle to cling on
a scotland tories spokesman said : ' this poll shows that the scotland conservatives are now in a real fight across scotland
' with the lib dem vote having collapsed completely , we offer scotland the opportunity to unite around a plan to finish the job of economic recovery and to secure scotland 's place in the uk - any other vote will let ed miliband into downing street , with alex salmond calling the shots
' a scotland lib dem spokesman added : ' these polls show that lib dems are best placed to stop the snp in the highlands and the north
the snp have centralised services away from the highlands and the north - east to the central belt
