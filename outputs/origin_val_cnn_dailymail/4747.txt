gordon , the troubled fiancÃ© of bobby kristina , has defended himself against allegations that whitney âs daughter was the victim of foul play , daily mail online can reveal
speaking to dr phil mcgraw , 25 , said : â i lost the most legendary singer ever and i âm scared to lose bobbi kristina
i want to let all you guys know i did everything possible in the world to protect them
â gordon âs impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by phil last week and due to air today
weeping and wailing and at times incoherent , gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by dr phil gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story
he has felt â vilified â and â depicted as a monster â since january 31 when bobby kristina , 22 , was found face down and unresponsive in the bath - tub at the roswell , georgia home he and bobby kristina shared
swinging from crying to flying into a rage , the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by phil but on learning of gordon âs emotional , mental and physical state dr phil could not â in good conscience â go on with the interview
according to gordon âs mother , michelle , who was by her son âs side during the highly emotional intervention , â nicholas is at a breaking point
he can not bear not being without bobbi kristina , by her side
he âs dealing with it by drinking
i âve begged him to stop
â dr phil told gordon , who admitted to having taken xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting : â gordon , you âre out of control
you deserved to get some help because if you do nât , you know you âre going to wind up dead
â he added : â you âve got to get yourself cleaned up
you got to man up and straighten up
â yesterday dailymail.com revealed that , barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with dr phil , gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk
the disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by dr phil as â exponential
â in the show , due to broadcast wednesday , a weeping and wailing gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed : â i âm so sorry for everything
â asked if he still intended to kill himself he said : â if anything happens to krissi i will
â he said : â my pain is horrible
â in recent weeks gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of xanax , alcohol and prescription sleeping pills
gordon had agreed to meet with dr phil believing that he was there to be interviewed
according to dr phil : ' he felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster
' instead , on learning of gordon 's rapidly deteriorating mental , emotional and physical state , the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab
dr phil stated : ' i do n't think he has any chance of turning this round
left to his own devices he will be dead within the week
' gordon 's mother , michelle , was by her son 's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive â at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed
she described her son as ' at breaking point
' she said : ' he can not take too much more of not being able to see kriss
he 's torn up and carrying guilt
' he 's dealing with it by drinking
i 've begged him to stop
i 've tried to help him but he ca n't let go of the guilt
' leaning towards gordon 's mother , dr phil said : ' you and i have one mission with one possible outcome and that 's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression , his guilt â¦ and to get clean and sober
' he added : ' his life absolutely hangs in the balance
' questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of january 31st that led to bobbi kristina , 22 , ending up face down in her tub
just two days ago bobbi kristina 's aunt , leolah , made a series of explosive facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had ' strong evidene of foul play ' relating to gordon 's role in events
she posted : ' gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate ! especially to my family
moreover , he has done things to my niece that i never thought he had in him to do ! ' leolah made her claims in response to being invited onto dr phil 's show
tough to watch : the young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer in her message she wrote : ' with all due respect , gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece â¦
we have strong evidence of foul play
' marks were found on her face and arms , marks that gordon has explained as the result of cpr which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived
and speaking to dr phil , gordon insisted : ' i did everything possible in the world to protect them [ whitney and bobbi kristina ]
' railing against the decision by bobbi kristina 's father , bobby brown , to ban him from his fiancÃ©e 's bedside at atlanta 's emory hospital , gordon said : ' my name will be the first she calls
' according to his mother , michelle , gordon can not forgive himself for his ' failure ' to revive bobbi kristina
his guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier
' i hate bobby brown ! ' his tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend 's father bobby brown , who has blocked him from seeing the 22 - year - old in the hospital ' are you drinking ? ' the emotional man 's anger only increases as dr. phil asks about gordon 's sobriety refuses to go : the 25 - year - old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help resigned : ultimately , gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility then , on 11 february 2012 , it was gordon who tried to resuscitate whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath - tub just hours before she was due to attend a grammy awards party
speaking to dr phil , michelle said : ' nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed whitney
' he administered cpr [ to whitney ] and he called me when he was standing over her body
he could n't understand why he could n't revive her
he said , " mommy why ? i could n't get the air into her lungs
" gordon has now entered a rehab facility in atlanta
meanwhile his fiancÃ©e continues to fight for her life in a medically - induced coma
it is now six weeks since bobbi kristina â krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath - tub of the home she shared with gordon in roswell , georgia
unlike whitney 's death that was ruled accidental , police are treating bobbi kristina 's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22 - year - old as a criminal investigation
while bobbi kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with gordon , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged
in an interview with the sun a friend of the couple , steven stepho , claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute roxicodone
sounding eerily similar to bobbi kristina 's mother and father 's drug - dependent relationship , the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on
' bobbi kristina and gordon would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had
it was n't unusual for them to spend $ 1,000 a day on drugs
' there were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours , just lying there on the bed
there were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice
she was always covered in cigarette burns
' their relationship was also very volatile
' when whitney died gordon was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control krissi to get access to the money
she 'd do whatever he told her
' he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her
they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around
' according to steven stepho : ' but krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother
she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her
gordon knew this and took advantage of it
' troubled relationship : a friend of the couple , steven stepho , claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute roxicodone
