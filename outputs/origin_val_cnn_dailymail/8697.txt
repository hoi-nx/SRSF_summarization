sp : the performance against tottenham came at just the right time to instil some confidence in fans and the players
it was n't the win , it was the tempo but that being said , it is anfield
when was the last time united played well there ? raheem sterling and rooney come head - to - head in a premier league clash that is vital for both teams what would it mean to the fans of your team to win this game ? dt : considering how united have fallen in recent years , it means a lot more in the grand scheme of finishing in the top four
united âs scalp for us is still a big one but the three points are just as â if not more important
sp : it is and always will be the biggest game of the season and sunday is the biggest game between the clubs in years
both have a lot on the line and so much to lose , so it is going to be an intense atmosphere , more so than usual
united fans have always viewed liverpool as their biggest game of the season , this year it 's even bigger is this the biggest rivalry in english football ? dt : without a doubt , regardless of what city or everton fans like to think â it âs still the first one i look for when the fixture list comes out
sp : without question it is the biggest rivalry
city might be challengers now but united fans spent decades laughing at them trying to hold on to our coat tails and as for chelsea , that rivalry has been forced on to everybody thanks to roman abramovich
i miss the old days of arsenal being a bitter rival but although that feeling has dampened in recent years , the rivalry with liverpool has never lost its potency
sportsmail 's jamie carragher argues with neville during a united - liverpool clash back in 2010 matches between the two sides are always potent - it is the biggest rivalry in english football , say the fans patrice evra encourages the united support ahead of liverpool rival luis suarez after a united win in 2012 what was your take on united 's 3 - 0 win over liverpool in december ? dt : it was particularly miserable , as it felt as if our previous season was just a one - off
obviously , we âre back to something like last season âs form now but that was hard to take , as i felt we deserved something
sp : what a cracking game that was but the 3 - 0 over tottenham last weekend was much more convincing
we were vibrant in attack against liverpool yet defensively we were weak and it was all about david de gea 's heroics
if not for an outstanding performance from him , it could have been very different
rooney scored united 's opener in an impressive 3 - 0 win at old trafford when liverpool were struggling juan mata added a second goal for the home side to compound liverpool 's misery under rodgers robin van persie scored the third goal but liverpool and rodgers have not lost in the league since that day what 's changed for both teams since that result ? dt : i do nât think much has changed for united , they âre still winning games , often without being the better side , but they were good against tottenham , which could be a concern
liverpool have improved so drastically though , and it would nât be an overstatement to say that a bit of better early - season form would âve seen another title challenge
sp : liverpool have n't lost in the premier league since then which says it all
they 've had a post-january renaissance akin to what united did annually under sir alex and come into the game on sunday as the league 's in - form side
on the other hand , united have been a mixed bag all season but have been able to grind out a lot of results as well , so we 've become quite hard to beat which is certainly progress
jordan henderson scored liverpool 's winner at swansea in the latest impressive result of a good run of form rooney starred in united 's 3 - 0 win over tottenham which kept up hope of finishing in the top four angel is free from suspension to return to the united team
is that a good or a bad thing ? dt : sadly , it makes little difference
he âs one of the world âs best but louis van gaal just does nât know what to do with him
here âs hoping he starts him up front again ! sp : you ca n't underestimate any world - class player regardless of what form they are in
before his red card against arsenal , angel actually had his best 45 minutes in a long time and his pin - point cross set up rooney 's equaliser
i expect him to come straight back into the starting xi because of his pace as united will more than likely set - up on the counter-attack as we did away to arsenal
with ashley young and rooney bang in form , united should have some great pace up front
angel returns after being sent off in the fa cup against arsenal , and could start for united do you expect gerrard to start for liverpool ? dt : no , and nor should he
he was solid and calmed us down when he came on on monday but if the game has any of the usual frantic pace about it he âll be our major weak link
sp : i really hope liverpool get caught up in the sentimental wave of gerrard 's last derby and start him but i ca n't see it happening
they 're a better side without him as jordan henderson has stepped it up this year
rodgers may elect to leave his captain gerrard on the bench as he continues to recover from injury what are your plans for the day of the game ? dt : i usually find the games against united too nerve - wracking so i tend to not be around other people
there âs usually a lot of work to do on the day of the match too so , i âll most likely watch with family or by myself and hope i do nât have to drown my sorrows later on ! sp : it 's an early kick - off so wo n't be much time to do anything before 1.30 comes around
as there 's so much riding on this game , i 'll probably just be a bag of nerves right up until the first whistle
daniel sturridge is n't quite back to his best after returning from injury but could have a key role to play what would a win for your team do to their champions league qualification prospects ? dt : i would nât say a win for either side would seal the other âs fate but i do believe if liverpool win then the confidence the three points would bring would be incredible in terms of momentum , it may even lead to a push for third or ( whisper it ) second
sp : a win for either side would be absolutely massive
it would give united a very nice cushion over liverpool and consolidate our spot in fourth and for liverpool , it would see them leapfrog united
it 's all to play for
liverpool supporters are eyeing up city 's second spot in the premier league if they beat united united manager louis van gaal has already stated his belief that his team can catch their local rivals city the last six meetings have all had a winner and the bookies expect liverpool to be victorious here
what 's your prediction ? dt : i âm going to say a less comfortable win than we âd hope but still , i âm going for a 2 - 0 to liverpool
sp : i 'm going to disagree with the bookies here and go for a draw
it 's a derby so anything can happen and form usually does n't count for much
both sides are going to have chances as there are defensive weaknesses in united and liverpool
hopefully united can be as clinical as they were against tottenham but away at anfield is a different kettle of fish
my prediction ? a score draw : 1 - 1
the bookmakers think liverpool and midfielder joe allen will come out on top in sunday 's showdown
