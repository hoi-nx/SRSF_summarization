a care worker accidentally killed herself by overdosing on sickness tablets after drinking fruit liqueurs and jagerbombs on a date , an inquest heard
dowsett had been drinking for hours when she returned to her parents ' home in stockport last october
having downed ten shots of sourz and rum and cokes , the 20 - year - old care worker took anti-nausea pills at around 3am , causing her to collapse and suffer a seizure
she was found dead the following afternoon at 4pm having rowed with her parents after being accused of taking drugs , an inquest into her death heard
dowsett died after consuming a cocktail of alcohol and anti-sickness pills
the 20 - year - old had ' no intention of taking her own life , ' an inquest heard on the night in question , miss dowsett had been in several pubs and bars with joshua beaumont on a date
the pair drank jagerbombs , beer , rum and coke and shots before mr joshua beaumont walked her home
giving evidence , the 22 - year - old said miss dowsett had been acting normally when he bid her goodnight
' jo seemed to be fine , she was n't slurring her words or falling , ' he said
' she asked me to walk her home and said she would phone me a cab from her house
we stood on the drive chatting together and we were discussing about going out again ' she did nât seem to be particularly drunk
' after being collected from her parents ' house in a taxi , mr beamont said the pair continued to talk over text
shortly before 3am , miss dowsett told him she was going to bed before phoning another friend , higginbotham
the 20 - year - old care worker returned to her parents ' house in stockport where they rowed over her ' erratic behaviour ' , it was claimed joshua beaumont said miss dowsett did not seem unwell when he left her at her parents ' house to get a taxi during their conversation she told him she had just rowed with her parents
john and ann dowsett were worried their daughter had been taking drugs after seeing her behave ' erratically ' , it was claimed
' she was at home and could n't sleep and knew i would be up
i asked about the date and she did n't go in to great detail , ' mr higginbotham said
' she said her mum and dad came in after the date and she told them to leave
there was nothing else in the phone call that rang alarm bells or made me feel the need to ring her back
' in text messages to others miss dowsett had given mixed accounts of the date , telling some she was eager to see mr joshua beaumont again and others that she was n't interested
' she said to some the date had been great and to others saying it had been less than great , ' said det insp cheryl hughes of greater manchester police
' within texts to a friend by the name of ben she explains the altercation with her parents where she had been accused of taking drugs but she said she had n't had any drugs
' clearly dowsett had mixed emotions about the date where she is not telling the truth to each person she had contact with
' her behaviour in the early hours was erratic and gave rise to concern by her parents
' we found no evidence she wanted to take her own life , in fact texts indicated she was going out for drinks on the saturday night and she gave mr joshua beaumont the impression they were going on another date
' the 20 - year - old had fatal traces of the drug in her system
police said there was no indication that she intended to take her own life in text messages sent the night before she died , miss dowsett arranged to meet friends for drinks and a second date with mr joshua beaumont at 4pm the following day she was found face down in her bedroom
a toxicology report indicated she was just over the drink drive limit and had fatal amounts of cyclizine in her system
the drug is often prescribed to treat nausea and travel sickness
after searching her bedroom investigators discovered she had taken a substantial number of the pills
' whether it was deliberate or an accumulation is more difficult to assess
fatality is very rare , ' said toxicologist julie evans
while miss dowsett had been drinking , a pathologist concluded she died as a result of the cocktail of drugs and alcohol
recording a conclusion of misadventure , coroner john pollard said : ' she had taken alcohol for the buzz effect and one does hear of youngsters taking fairly prodigious amounts these days but i do nât think she did anything unusual in the amount she took while she was out
' then you link that with the cyclizine
she has taken them to stop her feeling sick and an unintended outcome was they connected with the alcohol and have been more than her body can cope with
