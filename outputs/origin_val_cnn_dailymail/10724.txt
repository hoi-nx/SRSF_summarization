' erika hall , 20 , was also arrested for hindering the police search for wallace police went to the house
while they were searching with permission of the resident , they were tipped off that wallace had posted a new snapchat message saying police were in the house looking for him and he was hiding in a cabinet
police wrote : ' a search of the kitchen cabinets turned up some food , some pots and pans , and also a pair of feet

the sheriff 's office wrote on facebook : ' let 's put it this way , when the police ask you multiple times if someone is in the house , and you answer repeatedly that they are not in the house , and that you have not seen said person in '' weeks '' , you 're just going to get arrested
that 's how it happens
