a while ago , i visited a hampshire nursery which raises more than four million orchids a year
it was like a slow - motion factory ; tissue - cultured plantlets came in at one end , flowering specimens trundled out of the other , each in a posh ceramic pot. orchids , particularly phalaenopsis ( moth orchids ) , have become britain 's favourite houseplant but most die within weeks
moth orchids are easier to nurture than indoor cyclamen or poinsettias and , with care , they can flourish for years
but it helps to know a little about this weird plant group and to understand its special needs
hardy beauty : moth orchids ( pictured ) need gentle treatment to produce glorious blossoms more than 22,000 species of orchids make up orchidaceae , the world 's largest flowering plant family
about 50 are native to britain , and the common spotted orchid grows in my own tiny flower meadow
with such a huge range of habitats , orchids ' needs differ widely
but once you learn the likes and dislikes of popular houseplant orchids , it 's not hard to keep them happy
know their needs phalaenopsis , like many cultivated orchids are epiphytes , meaning that they grow in bark crevices in forest trees
they subsist on rain or mist , and nourishment comes from debris lodging in the tree bark , so their sparse roots are as important for clinging on as for absorbing nutrients
in a pot in your house , the orchid needs to think it is in a tropical forest
that means a minimum 16 degrees celsius ambience , humidity and good light
to boost humidity in spring and summer spray rainwater on to the leaves from an atomiser ( if possible always use rainwater warmed to room temperature )
in winter , move your orchid closer to an east or west - facing window and the extra light will encourage flowering
the commonest cause of death is overwatering
to avoid that , imagine the orchid perched up a tree , soaked by rain from time to time but drying out in between
cram the roots into wet compost and it will die
that is why it is best to grow epiphytes in slatted containers or transparent , perforated orchid pots and to allow the prehensile roots to poke into the air
during the growing season , feed monthly with special orchid feed
but in winter , reduce watering and do not feed
hands - on management phalaenopsis should last for about three months but , when they fade , you can persuade the old stem to sprout again
feel it carefully for swellings ( nodes ) near the base
if you cut the stem just above the second node from the base , a new flower spike should develop
repot your orchid only if it has become pot - bound or has been in the same compost for more than two years
do that when the pale roots develop green tips ; a sign the plant is ready to repot
use special epiphytic orchid compost â it will appear coarse and lumpy and is available at good garden centres
remove any dead or shrivelled roots , shorten the remaining healthy ones to about 12cm and replant the orchid in the same size pot. pack the compost in firmly for stability and allow any upward - facing roots to grow out over the container 's sides
water thoroughly , making sure all the compost is moist and that the water drains away easily
next year , when the repotting has worked and you are flush with success , start looking for different orchids
the number of new varieties introduced each year beggars belief
