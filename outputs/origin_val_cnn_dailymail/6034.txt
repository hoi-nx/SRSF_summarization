he would loved this moment
mr bailey , 44 , began bringing the dentures to matches after he believed they helped his club to victory at the league two play - off final in 2001
christopher bailey , pictured with his son in 1999 , had taken bailey to his first ever walsall fc game when he was just six - years - old mr bailey , pictured with christopher snr ( centre ) and brother christopher jnr in walsall fc in 1978 , said bringing the dentures was a way to keep a part of his father with him the superstitious fan even kisses the teeth , wrapped his in his father 's favourite handkerchief for good luck
' it first came about at the play - off final in 2001 at the millennium stadium in cardiff , ' he added
' we went 2 - 1 down in extra time so i got them out in the handkerchief he used to keep them in and gave them a rub and a bit of a kiss
we then went on and won the game 3 - 2 and i 've never looked back
' i 've taken to them to every round of the cup this year - it 's the first time i 've done that and we 're at wembley for the first time in our history
' i wish i 'd done it sooner
it seems to bring them luck in big games ' previously i took them major games , such as the play - off final and other cup games against teams in other leagues
more often then not , we win when i 've got them
' i 'll definitely give them a little rub and a kiss to help bring us good luck next week - i believe they will do the job and see us to victory
' mr bailey takes the false teeth wrapped his in his dad 's favourite handkerchief to every game and even kisses them for good luck when they are not accompanying mr bailey to a football game , his late father 's false teeth are kept inside his wife 's jewellery box mr bailey 's father christopher passed away on march 13 , 1999 at the age of 49 after he fell into a coma during a triple bypass operation in hospital
bus driver mr bailey decided to keep his false teeth as a memento because he used to love playing jokes on people in the pub with them
his father would either drop them in people 's pints or put them in bags of pork scratchings as a way of playing pranks on his friends
' i kept his teeth because they brought back happy memories for me
they were a big part of him , ' added mr bailey , a father - of - two
' he used to drop them in people 's pints and we used to drink bank 's mild - it was thick so people would n't find them until they got to the end of their pints
' he would also put them in his pork scratchings and take them back to the bar and complain somebody had left their false teeth inside them
' he was a bit of a joker to say the least
' mr bailey , pictured outside banks stadium , home of his beloved team walsall fc , in the west midlands credits his the lucky dentures for the club 's success this season bailey lives in walsall fc , west midlands , with his wife lisa , 40 , and they have two children jake , 15 , and keenan , 13
jake 's middle name is saddler after walsall fc 's nickname walsall fc and keenan 's is ray graydon , the manager who got them promoted in 2001
he added : ' the wife were n't too happy with the middle names - but it had to be done
' she suggested i keep the teeth in her jewellery box as she knows how important they are to me
' everyone laughs and think it 's a bit strange - but it 's my way of saying thank you to him
' mrs bailey , a housewife , added : ' i suggested he keep them in my jewellery box as they are the safest place for them
i know how important the teeth are to him
' he has banned me from going to wembley though as , unlike the false teeth , i 'm bad luck
whenever i have gone to watch walsall fc , they have lost
' at first he wanted to name our first born after the whole team
i said no to that
