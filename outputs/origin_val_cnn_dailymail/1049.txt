the burden of green taxes on businesses has doubled under the coalition , according to official figures
the treasury imposed Â£ 2.5billion of levies in 2010 - 11 â but the takings are predicted to reach Â£ 4.6billion in 2015 - 16 , it emerged yesterday
business groups have warned the taxes could lead to job losses
there are also fears that more of the costs will be passed on to customers
a written statement from treasury minister priti patel stated that the government is ' committed to increasing the proportion of tax revenue accounted for by environmental taxes ' to ' encourage positive behaviour change ' and make firms cut carbon emissions

pictured is the treasury building in london environment campaigners say such taxes on firms ' energy use set an example to other countries and will help tackle climate change â but critics point out that many of them are specific to the uk , which could encourage businesses that use a lot of energy to move abroad
one cost that has risen substantially over the past five years is the climate change levy , a charge on every kilowatt hour of electricity and gas firms use to generate energy
two years ago , another tax â the carbon price floor â was introduced on every ton of carbon that firms emit
these two levies now cost businesses a combined Â£ 2billion
larger firms have also been hit by the energy efficiency scheme to further reduce carbon emissions
the charge , introduced in 2010 , will bring in Â£ 800million this year
another three green taxes â on landfill and mining , and a european levy on carbon â have remained steady since 2010 , costing firms Â£ 1.8billion a year
gareth stace , of the manufacturers ' group eef , said : ' these figures prove the point that we have been making for some time , namely that uk industry â especially energy - intensive companies â are paying a very heavy price
' we urgently need to see competitiveness at the heart of energy and climate change policy to place us on a level playing field with even our european competitors who are not facing these bills , let alone the rest of the world
failure to do this by the next government , if it continues to use carbon taxes as a revenue - raising tool , could only result in lost jobs and investment
' a treasury spokesman said : ' this government is committed to creating a tax system that is simple , fair and creates the right conditions ... we have backed businesses with lower taxes overall , cutting corporation tax , giving employers up to Â£ 2,000 off their national insurance bill and giving small high street businesses Â£ 1,000 off their business rates
