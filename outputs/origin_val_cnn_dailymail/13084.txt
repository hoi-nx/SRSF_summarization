he 's a rolls royce footballer who honed his game in his parents ' garage
and even at the age of 40 , former juventus star del piero is still purring along , showing no signs of running out of gas
the record - breaking striker is currently enjoying an indian summer to his football career , completing stints at sydney fc in australia and more recently at the delhi dynamos in the inaugural indian super league
inevitably , the time will come when he finally decides to hang up his boots but that does n't look like happening anytime soon -- not when he 's still enjoying himself so much
" about football , i love every single moment -- the life with teammates , the atmosphere before a game , the free kicks , the goals
i love every moment like the first one , " del piero told cnn 's human to hero series
the man dubbed " il pinturicchio " ( " the little artist " ) has enjoyed a glittering career for both country and club in italy
during 19 seasons at juventus he won 15 trophies including six serie a crowns and a european champions league title , as well as setting club records for appearances and goals
in all , del piero made 705 appearances for the juventus -- including a record 478 in serie a -- and scored 289 goals along the way
" i 'm very proud about the records because i do everything for the club
i 've had some great moments with the club , with the fans ( and ) with my teammates , " he says
raised in the town of conegliano in northern italy , del piero 's love for football was fostered by his late father , gino
" my childhood was fantastic
i trained and played every moment and in every space of my home , " he recalls
" you know northern italy is very cold -- you can not play outside , so my father would move the car out of the garage to give me more space
i would play alone , with my schoolmates and try to imagine in my mind what it means to be a footballer
" del piero turned professional at the age of 17 , joining serie b side padova in 1991 before being snapped up by juventus for â¬ 2.6 million two years later
his longstanding relationship with the " juventus , " as juventus is affectionately known , got off on the right foot almost from the start
del piero scored five times in 11 appearances in his debut season before making his breakthrough the following year , becoming a first - team regular standing in for injured star striker baggio
the two men would go on to share a dressing room at international level , with both netting 27 times for their country , but their defining moments for the italy could not have been more contrasting
while baggio will forever be remembered for missing a penalty kick that handed brazil victory in the 1994 world cup final , del piero has cause to reflect on happier times on football 's biggest stage
after being part of two unsuccessful campaigns in 1998 and 2002 , del piero and italy hit the jackpot in 2006 in germany , beating france on penalties in a final remembered primarily for zinedine zidane 's headbutt on italy defender marco materazzi
victory in the final was a " beautiful " moment but del piero 's most cherished memory of that tournament happened a few days earlier
" the most special moment in my head , and probably the heads of my teammates , was the semifinal , " he says
" definitely the final , when you take the cup and lift it to the sky , it 's beautiful
but the semifinal was the most exciting
we played the home team for 120 minutes
there is a big connection between our two countries
" an epic battle looked to be heading for penalties after a goalless 90 minutes , with extra time going the same way , before fabio grosso netted in the 119th minute followed by a del piero effort moments later
" i ca n't hide that my greatest victory is the world cup
since you 're a kid you think you want to win that
it was massive , " he says
italy 's third world cup triumph came against a backdrop of turmoil in italy 's domestic league as juventus and other serie a teams were implicated in the " calciopoli " match - fixing scandal
the repercussions would see former juventus managing director luciano moggi banned for life by the italian football authorities while the club was stripped of two serie a titles won in 2005 and 2006 , relegated to serie b and docked nine points
the demotion to italy 's second tier saw some top players leave the club , including italy captain fabio cannavaro , france defender lilian thuram and sweden striker zlatan ibrahimovic
but the ever - faithful del piero stayed put , helping juventus secure the serie b title and an immediate return to the top flight
" i think that staying with juventus in serie b , even before i knew how large the points penalty was going to be , was the best decision i could 've made , " del piero said last year
" i had an extraordinary season that gave extra meaning to everything that came afterwards , including the ( serie a ) trophy i lifted on the last game at the juventus stadium
" del piero also scored in that final league match against atalanta in may 2012 and was afforded a hero 's send - off with a 20 - minute standing ovation after his substitution in the second half
" there were many people crying that day
i tried to hide my tears by bowing down to pick up some scarfs and cleaning my eyes
it was a very special and touching moment ... it will stay with me forever , " he recalls
a open letter to juventus ' fans confirmed his exit the following july before signing a two - year deal to play for sydney fc in australia 's a-league in a deal worth aus $ 4 million ( $ 3 million )
he was soon helping repay that fee , netting a trademark free kick on his home debut -- one of 24 goals scored during his time down under
del piero has since gone on to help promote the new indian super league , appearing in the inaugural competition late last year
so what plans does the veteran have for 2015 ? " my future plan is to find a good restaurant tonight and have a rest and then tomorrow is another day , " he says cheekily before suggesting that his playing days may not be over just yet
" i have two or three situations to analyze
i want to take some time to make a good decision like i did in the past , " he adds
" i would love to play again , i want to play with good people around me
i 'm still training now -- i want to keep myself ready for a big decision
" watch this space .
