amelia rose jones was allegedly murdered by her grandfather jones - she was only 41 days old a grandfather allegedly murdered his five - week - old granddaughter as he babysat her because he strongly disliked her father , a court has heard
jones , 45 , is accused of attacking newborn amelia rose jones three times , fracturing her skull and ribs , and causing swelling to her brain
the infant was taken to hospital in 2012 after her grandfather jones rang 999 , saying she had simply stopped breathing in the lounge of his daughter 's three - bed terrace house in pontnewydd , south east wales
lewis , prosecuting , told newport crown court that jones strongly disliked amelia rose jones 's father - ian skillern - who had finished his relationship with his daughter sarah jones , 25 , before amelia rose jones was born
he went on to say the jury would have to decide whether that had been the motivation for the violence against his granddaughter
the court heard the 41 - day - old baby had been subjected to violence on at least three occasions - with the fatal blows coming from her grandfather while she was in his sole care
recalling the incident , mr lewis explained that jones had sole care of amelia rose jones on november 17 , 2012 while her mother sarah went out to the cinema with friends
before she returned , jones made a 999 call saying he had gone to make a cup of coffee but came back to find the baby ' panicking for breath '
he said she had been feeding and appeared fine earlier that evening
ambulance and police rushed to the house while the operator told jones how to give cpr to his granddaughter
the ambulance crew found jones in the lounge standing over the lifeless body of amelia rose jones lying on the floor
she was rushed to royal gwent hospital in newport crown court where medics managed to restore her pulse
but after failing to get her breathing she was quickly transferred for specialist treatment at university hospital wales in cardiff
however doctors could not bring her back to consciousness and said she had suffered catastrophic brain injury
she died on the afternoon of november 19
mr lewis said : ' the injuries inflicted upon amelia rose jones included a fracture to the back of her skull , swelling to her brain and multiple fractures to her ribs
amelia rose jones was rushed to the royal gwent hospital in newport crown court ( pictured ) and later taken to university hospital wales in cardiff , where she later died ' these injuries were all of different ages ... and they demonstrate she had been subjected to violence on at least three occasions
but it was the most recent of these injuries to her had brought upon her cause of death
' the prosecution case is that in the short tragic life of amelia rose jones the injuries which she came by could not have been accidental
' these injuries were all deliberately inflicted upon her by her grandfather
' amelia rose jones 's mother sarah was initially arrested along with her father but the court heard it soon became apparent to police she had nothing to do with her daughter 's injuries
after his arrest , the court was told how jones changed his story four times during police interviews conducted between november 2012 and july 2014
at first , he claimed amelia rose jones had simply stopped breathing when he left her on the sofa to make a cup of tea on the saturday night
mr lewis said jones then changed his story to claim he dropped her on the floor on the friday night after tripping up on a toy penguin - because he learned from his daughter that doctors had discovered amelia rose jones had suffered a fractured skull before her death
but when doctors said the injuries must have taken place on saturday night he changed his story again , the court heard
he then claimed a teenage boy visiting the house had accidentally dropped amelia rose jones while trying to use his phone
but when the boy told police it was a lie , jones said he had ' blacked out or fainted ' while holding amelia rose jones and had fallen to the ground on saturday night
mr lewis told the jury : ' he has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice by telling the police the teenage boy had dropped amelia rose jones
jones , 45 , is being tried before a jury at newport crown court ( pictured ) after pleading not guilty to the murder of his granddaughter amelia rose jones , who died in november 2012 ' we submit his detailed and calculated lies show the lengths he is prepared to go to conceal the truth about amelia rose jones 's fatal injuries
' we say consider the repeated , frequent and detailed lies he had chosen to tell about his state of health ' we say the catastrophic injuries amelia rose jones suffered were deliberately inflicted and jones is guilty of her murder
' the court heard jones , of cwmbran in south east wales , had been largely absent from his daughter sarah 's life - and only made proper contact with her when she was about 16
in the days leading up to amelia rose jones 's death , sarah said her father had said something ' odd ' to her , the court was told
he had said : ' even though i do n't like her dad ( ian ) , i do not hold grudges against a baby
' the jury was also told jones had lied at great length to try to ingratiate himself with sarah - even telling her he had cancer when he did not
' he told her that he needed surgery and turned up at her home on crutches , ' mr lewis said
' he asked his daughter to help him in and out of the bath and supervise him while he appeared to inject himself with medication
' the jury heard that sarah then began receiving phone calls via a withheld number from a ' dr hughes ' - who , unbeknown to her , was actually her father putting on a different accent
mr lewis said : ' dr hughes told sarah that her father indeed had cancer and was gravely ill and had a limited future
' this was a cruel deception
there was not even an ounce of truth in what jones told his daughter
he added : ' the news sarah was receiving [ about his supposed cancer ] must have been very distressing for her
' she felt sorry for her father and allowed him to play an ever - increasing role in her life and the lives of her children which would prove to be a tragic mistake on her part
' jones has pleaded not guilty to murder
high court judge wyn williams said he expects the trial to go on until the end of april
