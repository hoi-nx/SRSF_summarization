it will be the most spectacular celestial show of its kind for 16 years and wo nât happen again for a decade
but those hoping to witness friday âs solar eclipse could be disappointed â as clouds may block their view
the dramatic partial eclipse begins at 8.30am and will reach its maximum point around an hour later
the phenomenon â in which the moon moves in front of the sun â will be most visible in more remote parts of the country , which are said to offer the perfect viewing environment
and the proportion of the sun covered will increase towards the north of the country , ranging from 84 per cent in london to 89 per cent in manchester and 93 per cent in edinburgh
scotland is expected to have the best view , with the isle of lewis seeing around 98 per cent of the sun hidden and shetland around 97 per cent
however , forecasters warn early predictions show there may be cloudier skies in the north of the uk â which could ruin the view for astronomy enthusiasts
glenn spencer , forecaster at meteogroup , said : â the south will get the best of the breaks between clouds and it will get cloudier the further north you go
it âs not the greatest situation
the south will see about 60 to 70 per cent cloud cover â which is enough to be able to see the sun. â in the north the sky will be almost completely covered by cloud
however , it is still early and the situation could quite easily change by friday
it âs luck of the draw at the moment
â get out your glasses : special shades like this are a good bet for watching uk 's first great eclipse this century , with the next partial eclipse of this magnitude not set to take place until 2026 the timeline for the eclipse in manchester
first sight will come at 8.20am and maximum eclipse at 9.32am cloudy skies also meant spectators struggled to see the uk âs last eclipse on august 11 , 1999 , but the effect was still dramatic as the country was pitched into darkness
the next eclipse of similar magnitude will take place on august 12 , 2026 , with 95 per cent of the sun obscured
uk will not see a total solar eclipse until september 23 , 2090
anticipating friday âs event , robin scagell from the society for popular astronomy said : â we wo nât experience totality [ of darkness ] in the uk but it will still be memorable
â depending on where you are , up to 90 per cent of the sun will be covered over
â you âd think everything would go virtually black , but it does nât , it âs about equal to a fair bit of high cloud in front of the sun. but it has this eerie quality , especially on a clear day
you think , hang on , it âs getting darker , but there are no clouds
â experts have issued a reminder that people must be aware of possible damage to their vision if they fail to take the necessary precautions while watching the phenomenon
as with normal daylight , people should avoid looking directly at the sun â even if it is partly hidden or they are wearing sunglasses .
