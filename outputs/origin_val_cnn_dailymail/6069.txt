chief inspector matt lawler said : ' clearly this is an absolute tragedy for the entire family
' no - one in the force knew the connection until lisa crocker arrived at the scene and recognised samuel
' there has been a great deal of support locally for lisa crocker and many local people have been asking if she was personally connected to the incident
' in order to allow her to focus on supporting her family , lisa crocker has asked us to confirm her involvement and thereby end the speculation
mrs lisa crocker , 39 , ( pictured ) was unaware her young nephew was involved in the collision until she arrived at the scene
the youngster later died in hospital ' while she has been inundated with messages , lisa crocker would like everyone to focus on samuel , not on her connection to the events of last saturday
' emergency services were called to the scene of the crash at about 1.30pm on saturday after samuel was struck by the white vauxhall combo van
following his death , his family led an outpouring of tributes to him
in a statement , they said : ' on saturday afternoon our life was turned upside down when our darling samuel was knocked down while on his way to visit his friend
' later that night the bright light that was samuel was extinguished
' we all miss our little ' mole ' so much and ca n't begin to imagine how we move on from the devastating situation we are in now
' someone so small has left a massive hole that can never be filled , but he will always be remembered for his cheeky , fun - loving nature and we are grateful to have had him in our lives , albeit for such a short time
' a book of condolence has since been opened at landscore primary school where samuel was a pupil
gary read , the school 's headteacher , said : ' samuel was a truly decent young boy - honest , attentive , generous , loyal and kind
' to be taken from his family and friends in this way feels incomprehensible
' hundreds of people also attended a candle lit vigil at holy cross church on monday in memory of the youngster
reverend nigel guthrie , rector of crediton , said : ' we wanted to give people a chance to express their feelings about what happened to samuel

' the bishop of crediton , rt. reverend nick mckinnel , added : ' this is terribly sad news and my heart goes out to the family of this young boy and to his friends at school
' terry keen , who lives next - door to the samuel crocker family , also paid tribute
