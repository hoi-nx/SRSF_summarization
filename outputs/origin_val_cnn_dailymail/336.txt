the u.s. military dropped 60,000 copies of a graphic leaflet near the northern syria city of raqqa that depict potential islamic state recruits being fed into a meat grinder
the leaflets , part of an information campaign to discourage people from joining the extremist group , were dropped in a canister by an f - 15 fighter jet last week
' the message of this leaflet is , if you allow yourself to be recruited by daesh , you will find yourself in a meat grinder
and it 's not beneficial to your health , ' said army col warren , a pentagon spokesman who released a copy of the leaflet thursday in response to media requests
the gruesome drawing shows seven young men standing in a line under a sign that says daesh recruiting office
a man with a monster face is beckoning the first man in line , who has a frightened look on his face
a second man is turning the grinder while appearing to push someone into the feeder tube
two legs are protruding from the feeder , and blood is spurting out the grinder 's other end
the meat grinder is labeled as daesh , and a sign in the corner says ' now serving 6001
' the scared young man appears to be dropping a ticket that says ' 6001
' is it working ? the u.s. military commander for the middle east says isis is ' losing momentum ' in syria warren said this is the only leaflet he knows about
u.s. military officials have expressed concerns that is was winning the propaganda war , with its use of social media to attract supporters and recruits
a central theme that u.s. officials have tried to convey is the militants ' brutality and violence , including to women and children
is has taken over large parts of iraq and syria
but the top u.s. military commander for the middle east said thursday that the group is ' in a defensive crouch ' in iraq , and losing some momentum in syria
the u.s. and other coalition members have conducted airstrikes on the group in iraq and syria .
