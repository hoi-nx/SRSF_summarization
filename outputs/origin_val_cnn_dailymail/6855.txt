this family of wedding crashers risked the wrath of the bride to capture these photos
brandi and randy , and their two children , take to the beach in tropical hawaii to snap photobombing shots with unsuspecting wedding parties who have forked out thousands on the dream ceremonies
the family - of - four , originally from lenexa in kansas , lived on the idyllic island for five years and decided to take their quirky photos at the ko olina beach lagoon
brandi and randy pose with their arms in a heart shape as a couple marries in hawaii smitten couples loved the beauty spot so much that they flocked there almost hourly , giving the family the idea that they could make their way into wedding albums back in 2004
pediatric occupational therapist brandi , 36 , said : ' it was so frequent it was comical
' i remember a specific conversation one day , when my husband and i wondered , " how many random people 's wedding photos are we in the background in our bathing suits ? "
' from there , it was a dare to go get in that wedding photo
' in this picture brandi is seen pulling a funny face , however , she says they stopped directly photobombing wedding parties after some people complained brandi and randy pose on the beach as a happy couple have their wedding snaps taken behind them brandi and randy , 38 , as well as kids kyler , eight and elle , six , have since turned the hobby into a family tradition
but they have been met with some resistance from happy couples and guests
brandi said : ' we quickly realised actually photobombing was n't cool
' the wedding co-ordinators would shoo us away or we would get scowls from the bridal party
' it 's not our style to be rude
so , we started taking pics of ourselves with the wedding in the background
it was way less invasive and still fun
' in this picture a friend has taken a picture of brandi and randy larking about in the background of this happy couple 's wedding day brandi says she and the family try to think up funny poses for their pictures , here they are hiding behind a tree the family ditched their desperate clambering to get in the background of the pictures to take centre stage
they have since posed behind trees , made love hearts out of hands and even danced while in full view of wedding parties
brandi said : ' it was a game we played only on vacation but now we include our kids in the fun and whoever else wants to play
' this year , we are vacationing in hawaii with my parents and we have enlisted my mum and dad as official beach wedding photo bomb paparazzi
' we all start cheering and hi - fiving when we see a white gown and an entourage of bridesmaids on the beach
it is fun to figure out the silliest pose or best angle for our picture
