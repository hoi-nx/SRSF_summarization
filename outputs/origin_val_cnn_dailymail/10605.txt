but few of those children go from dodging their homework and playing hopscotch in lunch break to ruling the country

' help create a message no government , politician or leader can ignore and demand that every child can go to school safely
' we are standing up to bring an end to the barriers preventing girls and boys from going to school , including forced work and early marriage , conflict and attacks on schools , exploitation and discrimination
' all children deserve the opportunity to learn and achieve their potential
' education of girls not only further their independence , it also cuts the rate of child deaths , teen pregnancy and helps to provide more stable families
illiteracy among women contributes to greater numbers of preventable child deaths
a child born to literate mother is 50 per cent more likely to survive past the age of five than a child born to an illiterate mother

in many countries in sub-saharan africa , for example , the birth rate among girls with no education is over 4x higher than those with secondary education
providing education for girls also helps to fuel economic growth of a country
an educated female population increases a country 's productivity , yet some countries lose more than Â£ 650 million a year by failing to educate girls to the same level as boys
for example , if all girls in kenyan completed primary education , their additional output would equal 20 per cent of kenyan âs gdp
if all adolescent girls completed secondary education and delayed pregnancy until their twenties , this would add Â£ 2 billion to the kenyan economy every year
