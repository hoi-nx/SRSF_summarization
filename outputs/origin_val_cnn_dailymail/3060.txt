pietersen 's former england test captain strauss remains convinced it is ' very unlikely ' the record - breaking batsman will ever play for england again
pietersen , sacked by the ecb after the 2013 - 14 ashes defeat , has set his heart on pushing for a return in time for this summer 's rematch
the 34 - year - old signed for surrey on wednesday , to that end - and after indications from new ecb chairman colin graves that he may yet be considered again for selection , he is hoping a welter of county championship runs over the next two months could press his claims
strauss ( right ) believes pietersen 's efforts to play himself back into the england for thei summer 's series with australia will be in vain pietersen has rejoined surrey and will attempt to find his form in the county championship pietersen in action for surrey during a t20 blast fixture at the kia oval last summer strauss , however , predicts pietersen 's efforts will be in vain
the dual ashes - winning captain believes pietersen 's age and history of confrontation are against him , and suggests his only realistic chance of resuming his international career is if an ' extraordinary ' sequence of events first cost either or both of coach peter moores and england test captain alastair cook their jobs
strauss had his own difficult times with his fellow south africa - born batsman , including the 2012 saga in which pietersen admitted sending ' provocative ' texts about his captain to opposition players
the contents of pietersen 's autobiography , published five months ago and including much criticism of several ex-colleagues and management staff , may be another barrier to his recall
strauss told sky sports news : ' if you just look at everything that has gone on in the past ... his book ... that 's a significant hurdle he 'll have to get over
' then also , from a cricketing point of view , in one - day cricket we 've got to build towards the next world cup
strauss and pietersen together during happier times - the victorious 2011 england test series against india the pair celebrate with the trophy after england 's victory in that 2011 series with india ' pietersen ( will be ) 36 years of age , ( so ) i ca n't see how he would necessarily play in that
' also , in the test match arena , our top five or six have all been in excellent form
' so it 's not as if there is an obvious place in the side for him either
' england will head to the west indies next week , for three tests , and colin graves has already made it clear he will not tolerate defeat there against ' mediocre ' opposition
graves ' hint that pietersen 's england career might not be finished after all is at odds , meanwhile , with all other public remarks from within the ecb
strauss appears impressed by pietersen 's willingness to play county cricket again , after agreeing his release from the majority of his indian premier league contract with sunrisers hyderabad
but he will still be shocked if it leads to an england return
' i think you ca n't fault his ambition , ' strauss added
pietersen and strauss at the crease together during england 's england test series with pakistan in abu dhabi in 2012 pietersen was axed by england following unrest during last winter 's turbulent ashes tour to australia ' he 's doing everything right , putting himself in position
he felt that colin graves offered him an olive branch , and he 's taking it with both hands ... obviously he 's going to have to go out there and score runs
' but i have to say i still think it 's very unlikely that he 'll play for england again
' it 's going to take something extraordinary , england to lose a lot of games and for pietersen to score a lot of runs - and probably for a captain or a coach , or both , to lose their jobs in the process
' strauss senses too that it will be this summer or never for pietersen , who will be 35 by the time the ashes begin in july
' i 'd be surprised if he plays in this ashes series - and if he does n't , then it 's counter-intuitive that he would then come back in the side when they 'd be building again towards the next ashes series in two - and - a - half years ' time
' there would have to be a lot of things that go wrong with the england cricket team between now and the start of the ashes for him to come back
