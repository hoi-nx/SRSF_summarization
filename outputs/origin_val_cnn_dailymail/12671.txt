on october 24 , 1944 , u.s. warplanes swarmed at the leviathan of battleships , japan 's musashi , splashing down torpedoes or dive bombing it
it took them four hours and more than 25 direct hits to put one of the two largest war ships in world war ii to the bottom of the philippines ' sibuyan sea
this month , microsoft co-founder paul allen and a team of researchers found a sprawling undersea wreck after an eight - year search for the musashi
japan maritime expert todaka is 90 % sure they found the right ship after the first images were published earlier in march
and that 's a breakthrough
" i have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered , but they all turned out not to be true , " todaka said
unfortunately , japan war ships did not bear their names on their sides , so a full identification takes a while
but the wreckage matched the ship 's description , and it had a mount for the imperial japanese navy seal , a chrysanthemum which was made out of teak and rotted away in the ship 's 70 years in the sea
on thursday , paul allen 's team treated the world to a live tour from the wreck at nearly 4,000 feet under the waves
an unmanned vehicle 's spotlights lit up the pitch darkness , revealing crisp high definition images of massive rusted iron in crystal clear turquoise water
the live tour began with one of the musashi 's many death blows -- a warped bow
" what we see here is torpedo damage , " said kraft , the expedition 's leader
torpedoes usually punctured the hull and exploded inside the ship , belling the metal outward
the remote operated vehicle puttered past more fatal damage , as kraft and his team described it
a big dent pushing inward , he explained , was likely from a torpedo that barely missed the ship , exploding outside the hull , pushing it in
" it 's the concussive force next to the ship , " he said
the submersible showed multiple hits right under the musashi 's main gun , perhaps the most powerful naval cannon at that time
it weighed 270 tons , and gunners had to duck into a blast shelter before firing it to keep from getting killed
while in the musashi 's death throes , the gun discharged one time before everyone took cover and blew sailors off the ship 's deck , paul allen 's researchers said
it was one of three such guns followed by rows of other guns
the musashi was the most heavily armed ship of its time , the researchers said
but the giant had an achilles heel
it was very vulnerable to torpedoes
the ship caught fire ; it lost most of its propeller power and began to flail
u.s. warplanes went in for the kill
" no defenses would have saved her , " an expedition member commented , as the submersible drifted past one gun turret or gun mount after the next
as the musashi sank , parts of it , where air was trapped imploded
the wreck landed in pieces on the sea floor with some 1,000 crew members
about 1,300 more were rescued by other japan ships , including the executive officer
the camera appeared to spare viewers any skeletal remains , but among unfired shells and bent iron , small objects peered at the lens
could the small chain have been a necklace ? pocket watch chain ? those wanting to answer those questions themselves will find the recording of the tour archived on paul allen 's website
launched in 1940 , the musashi was , at the time , in the largest class of warship ever constructed , displacing more than 69,000 tons
it had a twin , the yamato
the u.s. navy sank the musashi during the battle of the sibuyan sea , part of the battle of leyte gulf in the central philippines
microsoft billionaire paul allen has said his long fascination with world war ii history was inspired by his father 's service in the u.s. army
to finally arrive at the wreck , kraft 's team scoured historical records from four countries and undersea topographical data before sending down detection devices , such as the bluefins that have searched for missing airliner malaysia airlines flight 370
nearly a decade passed before they had the wreck in their sites
" that moment of discovery was exhilarating , " kraft said
