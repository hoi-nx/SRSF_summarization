south africa skipper ab de villiers ' accomplished showing with bat and ball helped the proteas to a 146 - run world cup victory over the uae in wellington
de villiers underpinned south africa 's innings with a sparkling 82 - ball 99 as they reached 341 for six , before taking two for 15 from three overs as the uae were bowled out for 195 in response with 15 balls remaining
de villiers surprisingly fell one run short of his century , but will take consolation from having smashed four sixes to take his total to 20 at this showpiece - the most at the tournament - and a record 36 in 21 world cup matches overall
south africa captain ab de villiers ( right ) inspired his country to a comfortable win against the uae the explosive batsman hit 99 for the proteas as they continued they impressive form in the world cup de villers also took two wickets with the ball at the westpac stadium on thursday the victory was as comfortable as the margin suggests for south africa as the uae slumped to a fifth defeat in as many world cup games
the proteas , already through to the knockout phase , set the formidable target after being asked to bat first at westpac stadium
de villiers shared a 108 - run fourth - wicket stand with miller , after hashim amla ( 12 ) , quinton de kock ( 26 ) and rilee rossouw ( 43 ) had departed , and added a further 53 in partnership with duminy
miller was dismissed one run short of his half - century at the start of the 37th over , bowled by naveed , who claimed figures of three for 63
de villiers had been let off the hook on 63 when he offered a caught - and - bowled chance trying to go down the ground to javed , and looked set to notch his hundred only to slice a wide length ball from shazad straight to javed at short third man
his departure signalled the arrival of behardien , though , and his quick - fire 64 not out from just 31 deliveries kept the south african score racing along
farhaan bahardien also shone for south africa with the bat in wellington uae have lost all five of their world cup games so far this year and were 45 - 3 after 12.3 overs duminy ( 23 ) became naveed 's third victim when he was trapped lbw , but behardien and philander ( 10 not out ) took the total past 300 in an unbroken 49 - run seventh - wicket stand
the uae 's long - shot chances of chasing down that total were dealt a heavy blow as they slumped to 45 for three after just 12.3 overs
morne morkel led the early charge for the proteas , dismissing andri berenger ( five ) and khurram khan ( 12 ) as he took two for four from his first four overs , while duminy claimed amjad ali 's ( 21 ) wicket in between
anwar and swapnil patil put on 63 in a fourth - wicket stand that provided a brief respite , but when anwar ( 39 ) sent imran tahir 's delivery straight to mid-wicket they began to tumble again
saqlain haider ( seven ) replaced anwar at the crease , but he only lasted three overs to become de villiers ' first victim of the day , before javed ( five ) followed suit soon after to leave the uae on 125 for six with 15.4 overs left
de villiers rounded off his display with a simple catch as naveed ( 17 ) top - edged philander tamely to mid-wicket and the subsequent departures of mohammad tauqir ( three ) and shazad ( nought ) meant the uae fell short of completing their 50 overs
swapnil patil wsa the only plus point in the batting display as he passed 50
