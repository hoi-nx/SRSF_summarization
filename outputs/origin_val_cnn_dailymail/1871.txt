oj is marked for death
the 67 - year - old disgraced gridiron great was recently threatened by a fellow inmate who is a member of the aryan nation , a white supremacist group in the nevada prison , and vowed that oj will never leave the prison alive
oj , 67 , and the tattooed - racist thug , who is 6 feet tall and over 250 pounds , got into a heated argument last week while waiting in line to get their medications
oj , who is housed in the minimum security tier - or section - of the prison has to stand in line with all of the other inmates for medications and meals from minimum to maximum security
the inmate , waugh , 51 , known as ' blu ' in the yard , is housed in the maximum security tier of the prison because of his violent history.he was convicted in 2005 for attempted sexual assault with substantial bodily harm
waugh was sentenced to a maximum of 240 months and is currently in maximum security tier at the lovelock correctional center
he was turned down for parole in 2013
' this guy was standing in line waiting for his medications when oj comes along and cuts in line â like he always does , ' an eyewitness tells daily mail online
' but this dude was not having it and told oj to take his ugly black a * * to back of the line and wait like everybody else
the gloves are off : oj 's altercation with white supremacist prisoner waugh began after simpson cut into the line to get his medicines first
blu was n't having it and pushed oj against the wall ' oj jumped in his face and yelled , " f * * * you man
i 'm gon na stay right here and your a * * ai n't gon na do nothing about it
" ' the guy pushed oj and yelled back : " get in line a * * hole and wait your turn
i 'm not gon na tell ya again
" ' oj fell against the wall and was able to catch himself before he fell to the floor but he was in a lot of pain because of his bad knee
' as reported exclusively on daily mai online on march 3 , oj who is serving nine to 33 years for armed robbery and kidnapping , is struggling to walk and uses a cane because of his 11 - year history of injuries while in the nfl
he desperately needs surgery on his left knee
oj says he is afraid he will end up in a wheelchair without a specialized surgery but the prison officials refuse to let him leave
' if it 's not life - threatening no one is allowed to leave to get any medical treatment outside of the facility , ' an insider revealed
after oj fell , the eyewitness continued , ' he struggled to his feet and went right back to get into this guy 's face and spit on him
' the guy flipped out and went after oj
oj put up his fists to fight back and was yelling that he was going to teach this guy a lesson
but the other inmates jumped and tried to hold both of them back but they were both so furious it was almost a riot
entitled : oj is causing so much trouble at the prison that they either want him to get parole or be transferred somewhere else , says the insider
' oj is still the same guy he was when he came here â feels like the world owes him something â and they are tired of it ' just one of the boys : oj , who is housed in the minimum security tier - or section - of the prison has to stand in line with all of the other inmates for medications and meals from minimum to maximum security ' everybody was yelling and pushing and then the guards , the sharp shooters , cocked their rifles , it sounded like a huge door metal slammed , and everyone dropped to the floor all at once
the guards were pointing their rifles at oj and the other guy and they froze where they were
' the guards came down on the tier and cuffed the prisoner who was later identified as waugh and ordered oj to just go back to his cell immediately
says the eyewitness : ' while the guy was dragged away he looked back and screamed ; ' i am going to make it my mission to kill you n * * * * r a * *
you will not leave here alive - do you hear me ! ' and then he made a symbol with his hands of shooting a gun at oj
' of course , being arrogant oj just laughed at him in his face but later asked his friendlier fellow inmates if they knew that guy and if he really had the juice to make something happen
' they told him yeah , he 's the real deal and if they were him they would be very afraid
they told oj that guy had a reputation of being a very brutal , violent guy , who has a lot of connections inside and outside of the prison
that 's why he was housed in the maximum security tier
they told oj he should watch his back
' oj tried to pretend he was n't worried but he kept quiet the rest of the night in his cell , which is unusual , so everyone knew he was rattled by the murder threats
' now there are grumblings among the inmates that oj gets special treatment and always has
they were angry because how can oj spit in someone 's face and not be put in isolation like the other dude
painful : oj 's knee injuries are a result from his 11 - year career as a running back in the nfl
he does n't walk around the prison a lot like he used to but when he has to walk to get his meals in the commissary he walks with a new silver cane while grimacing in pain on display : oj 's knee injuries had such an impact on his health , attorney cochran , used his disability in his trial for the murder of wife simpson and her friend ron goldman , to convince the jury that he was not physically capable of the killings
at one point cochran instructed oj to stand and raise his suit pant leg to show the jury his multiple scars on his left knee to prove he was severely handicapped spitting in someone 's face is basically an assault and they were also saying he also should have been charged with inciting a riot ' oj has caused a lot of trouble for everybody , ' the eyewitness added , ' that 's why the inmates were trying to stop them from fighting
because when this happens all of the inmates are put on lockdown or stripped of their privileges
' and the weather is just now starting to get nice and they were sent back to their cells and could n't go outside
oj has more than the racist guy to worry about these days
' insiders say oj was sent to the lovelock correctional center because it was a low - level security facility and they were trying to send him somewhere he could serve his time quietly and to prevent publicity
but oj has been more trouble than they anticipated because he is so arrogant â and a bully , says the prison insider
oj is scheduled to be up for parole in 2017 and inside sources say the prison authorities are hoping oj will be released because they are tired of his entitled attitude and want him gone
' no one gives a crap about oj but he 's just causing so much trouble at the prison that they either want him to get parole or transferred someone else
oj is still the same guy he was when he came here â feels like the world owes him something â and they are tired of it , ' say the insider
' and no one has seen waugh since the incident so they think he got a couple of weeks in isolation but when he gets out he 's going to be so pissed off , ' the eyewitness concluded
calls to lovelock correctional center were not returned to daily mail online .
