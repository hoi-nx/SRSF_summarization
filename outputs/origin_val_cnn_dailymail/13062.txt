los angeles former rap mogul knight collapsed in court friday shortly after a judge set his bail at $ 25 million in a murder case , an amount knight 's attorney said was excessively high
the attorney earlier indicated such a bail was probably higher than his client could post
knight bent over in his chair at the defense table , with his attorney beside him , and two deputies rushed to him as he was facedown
moments earlier , the judge ruled that knight " has a great potential to flee and apparently has so in the past
" " in this court 's opinion , $ 25 million is reasonable , and it is so set , " said los angeles superior court judge ronald s. coen
attorney fletcher told cnn affiliate kabc that knight hit his head on a chair and knocked himself out
fletcher later saw knight in the holding cell , and " he was dripping sweat ... like somebody threw a bucket of water on him , " fletcher told the station
" and he wiped the sweat off his head and said , ' i have n't had my medication , ' and i said since when , and he said since yesterday
that 's when i went back in and told the judge ' you need to make an order that he gets his medicine and he has n't been fed ' and the judge said , ' well , they offered him food at some point today , ' and i said well that 's not what i 've heard , " fletcher told the affiliate
knight , who suffers from diabetes and blood clots , was taken to the hospital , the attorney said
knight 's condition was not immediately available
he has collapsed before while in custody
knight has been held in solitary confinement , fletcher added
when asked about the $ 25 million bail , fletcher said , " it 's just laughable
" the bail in other prominent murder cases " at most is $ 5 million , " fletcher told the affiliate
" the heads of the mafia , $ 5 million ( bail ) , " fletcher said
prosecutors sought the $ 25 million bail , he added
a preliminary hearing was scheduled for april 13
knight , 49 , has pleaded not guilty to several charges that accuse him of running over two men -- killing one of them -- in january after an argument
knight is charged with one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and two counts of hit - and - run , with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail , prosecutors said
the man who died was terry carter , 55 , a former rap record label owner
the second man is cle " bone " sloan , 51
the deadly incident happened on january 29 , after a flare - up on the set of the biopic " straight outta compton , " a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group n.w.a. the argument spilled over to the parking lot of tam 's burgers in compton
the incident is the latest run - in with the law for knight , who founded the wildly successful death row records in 1991 and signed artists such as snoop and shakur
knight was driving the car in which shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in las vegas in 1996
shortly afterward , knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions
that prison time -- along with shakur 's death , feuds between knight and a number of rappers , and desertions by dr. dre , snoop and others -- contributed to the label 's bankruptcy in 2006
in august , knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity - filled sunset strip party hosted by singer chris brown on the eve of the mtv video music awards
at the time of his most recent arrest , knight was free on bail in a robbery case
