at last , greaves has made it into tottenham âs hall of fame
it only took 11 years and 41 others - including steffen freund and paul allen - to come before the club âs greatest ever goalscorer , with 266 goals in 379 appearances , was rewarded
depending who you speak to , the long wait is down to greaves declining the offers , or the club not forthcoming with them
greaves ( left ) is the highest ever scorer for tottenham with 266 goals in 379 appearances greaves ( centre ) joined tottenham in 1961 and won the fa cup twice and the european cup winners cup greaves ( second right ) holds the european cup winners cup aloft after tottenham 's 1963 triumph greaves was signed for tottenham from ac milan by nicholson for Â£ 99,999 the truth lies somewhere in between , with greaves understood to have turned down informal invitations in the past but accepting , according to sources close to the former striker , their first formal request last week
ultimately , it does nât matter how he got there
he is there now ; number 42
despite claims to the contrary , greaves has been back to white hart lane on many occasions since he left the club in 1970
he went back for the funerals of nicholson and bobby smith and launched his autobiography â greavsie â at a dinner there
he just has nât been back for football matches
but he âs only been to one football match - a chelsea game with his chelsea - mad grandson - since he quit playing 35 years ago
wherever he goes , he is constantly asked by tottenham fans why he is not recognised as one of their greatest by the club
â for all the fans who have asked me when i will be in the tottenham hotspur hall of fame , i am delighted that we now have a date , â greaves said upon the announcement on monday
â i am looking forward to returning to white hart lane for this very special occasion
â greaves , now 75 , joined tottenham in 1961 , signed by nicholson for Â£ 99,999 from ac milan to alleviate the burden of being the first Â£ 100,000 english player
in the preceding nine years , he would go on to win the fa cup twice , fa charity shield twice , the european cup winners cup and finish runner - up in the old first division , scoring 220 goals in 321 league matches
he was gutted and angry when he was eventually sold to west ham , but that âs not why he does nât go back to white hart lane for matches
greaves just likes watching games on the telly
in response to accusations that he turned down an invite to the league cup final when his two former clubs chelsea and tottenham met on march 1 , he replied : â at no point did tottenham invite me to the game
i would n't have gone if they did , but i was not invited
â i 've got a lovely giant screen hd tv , a lovely dog and a warm fire
that 's where i watch sport including football and it 's very nice
i 'm not interested in driving in heavy traffic and enduring big crowds and being freezing cold
i love it on tv
â greaves ( right ) played for tottenham for nine years and is to be inducted into the hall of fame on may 13 greaves is also england 's fourth - highest scorer , netting 44 goals in 57 games for his country now 75 , greaves chooses not to attend football matches , preferring instead to enjoy them at home greaves also loved playing , and is still england âs fourth - highest scorer with 44 in 57 appearances , but he has not shunned tottenham matches , or those of any other club , with any malicious intent
â i do n't go to games , i never ever have , â he added
â when i was young i played all the time
i 've never supported one team over another and i do n't apologise for that
i enjoy watching at home on tv
â regardless of the rows or the disagreements or how he got there , when greaves is inducted on may 13 , he will finally be in tottenham âs hall of fame
