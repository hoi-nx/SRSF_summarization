vladimir putin is not a self - effacing man
that 's why when the russian president suddenly disappeared from view people took notice
when russian officials tried to trick the public by passing off old photos as new appearances , speculation about vladimir putin 's whereabouts went viral
hashtags such as # whereisputin and # ðññð¸ð½ð£ð¼ðµñ -- russian for # putinisdead -- became the tip of a giant social media iceberg , much of it streaked with dark humor
in ukraine , the neighboring state besieged by vladimir putin 's forces , someone reportedly left a large funeral wreath at the gate of the russian embassy
a handwritten message addressed vladimir putin with an expletive , telling him , " thank you for croaking
" the fast - moving iceberg of speculation may melt as fast as it emerged
the kremlin has now started pushing harder against the rumors , trying to prove that russian 's foremost -- nay , only -- major political leader , is alive and well
early on friday , officials released what they said was a picture of vladimir putin taken the day of
but on social media , onlookers accused officials of dusting off old images
those keeping track insist vladimir putin has not been seen since march 5
regardless of how or when this speculation ends , it tells us much about the political realities of russian
this whole thing started after vladimir putin 's trip to kazakh was canceled on wednesday and a kazakh official told a reporter that the russian president had fallen ill. then the kremlin released a picture of vladimir putin speaking with the leader of the republic of karelia
but it turns out that happened on march 4
on thursday , vladimir putin 's spokesman , peskov , said the president would miss his regular meeting with the fsb ( fsb )
when asked about his boss 's health , peskov said he is " absolutely healthy , " his handshake so strong he could " break your hand
" to illustrate the point , the kremlin 's russia today posted a picture of the mighty president slamming a judo opponent hard against the ground
peskov says russian is in the grips of a " spring fever " that is causing people to dream up harebrained scenarios
amateur sleuths and creative minds have speculated wildly about vladimir putin 's health problems
the swiss magazine blick said vladimir putin is in lugano , where his girlfriend just gave birth to their baby
some have said he has cancer ; others report a heart attack or a stroke
there are even suggestions that he went off to join isis , or is playing hide - and - seek a la where 's waldo
does vladimir putin ever catch a cold ? does he ever get sick ? the kremlin does n't want to allow vladimir putin 's image of virility and strength to become tarnished by the weaknesses of mere humans
vladimir putin is not your average president
on paper , russian is a democracy
but no objective observer believes that
every important decision is made by him
vladimir putin rules in the old - fashioned style of a personality cult
his approval ratings are stratospheric , even if his brazen policies would warrant more significant levels of disagreement
approval ratings nearing 90 % are the product of suppression of dissent and media maneuvers demonizing , ridiculing , and ultimately silencing critics
the system requires propaganda and image control
it needs vladimir putin to be larger than life
the recent murder of boris nemtsov , vladimir putin 's foremost critic , has spawned fears that there is a hit list , a roster of vladimir putin critics whose days are numbered
there are rampant rumors of intrigue inside the kremlin
the level of fear is said to be higher than it has been in years
the term " kremlinology " became the study of intrigue and power machinations in inscrutably dark systems
russian has a long history of concealing the illnesses of its leaders
in the soviet era , some mysterious disappearances were followed by funerals
in those days , there was usually a succession plan
and in the post-stalin days , the passing of one leader meant that the party chose the next strongman
in 1991 , the last soviet leader , gorbachev , went to his summer home in crimea
he was visited by a group of high - ranking soviet officials
the next day , the russian people were told that gorbachev was ill , and could not perform his duties
gorbachev was held against his will
there was a coup in progress
vladimir putin 's mentor , president boris yeltsin , also had a history of " disappearing " from view
he was really ill and / or drunk
even if vladimir putin is in perfect health and the social media whirlwind turns out to have just been an outlet for creativity , talk of vladimir putin 's disappearance raises important questions
what would russian become if he suddenly left power ? is there a successor in place ? is there anyone who would continue vladimir putin 's policies ? if there is a power vacuum , a conceivable scenario given just how thoroughly vladimir putin dominates , what would the consequences be ? whatever vladimir putin is doing at this exact moment -- whether he is hunting tigers , visiting with friends , or convalescing from an illness -- and no matter what he does in the days ahead , the internet tempest of the past few days is a reminder that the man who embodies today 's russian state , who dismantled the country 's once - fledgling democracy , wo n't be around forever
which raises the question , what then ?
