a wealthy couple falsely claimed Â£ 42,000 in benefits despite sending their children to a Â£ 32,000 private school and having nearly Â£ 50,000 in their bank account , a court was told today
grant , also received a Â£ 40,000 payment from her parents and was drawing income as a director of three companies during the time she and husband leslie , 67 , were claiming benefits , gloucester crown court has heard
the couple sent their children to a Â£ 32,000 - a - year school while also funding Â£ 2,000 - a - month in rent on their home
but the pair are alleged to have falsely claimed a total of Â£ 42,500 , consisting of Â£ 19,000 of pension benefit , Â£ 19,000 of housing benefit and Â£ 4,500 of council tax benefit to fund their lifestyle
on trial : grant and grant are accused of claiming Â£ 42,000 of benefits while getting an income from several businesses and Â£ 50,000 in the bank , a court has heard mr and mrs grant say they were penniless as a number of businesses went bust and needed state support
this was received while mrs grant got money from her mum , there was income from the pair 's businesses and business account were being used for personal expenditure , it was said
prosecutors also say they had around Â£ 50,000 in the bank , but today a second forensic accountant told the court she felt that the grants had no income entering their bank accounts
mr grant , 67 , had been receiving pension credit since november 2007 , despite running his wife 's companies , hadleigh partnership , hadleigh development and sarafino ltd , prosecutors claim
funds were used to sent their children to dean close school in cheltenham , glos. , and to pay for expensive child care and high rent
tara wolfe , told the opening of the trial : ' we say mr and mrs grant knew they were under an obligation to inform the dept of work and pensions and the council of money coming into their accounts which affected their entitlement to benefits
' the prosecution say they had income coming in from three sources
between september 2010 and oct 2011 mrs grant received Â£ 40,000 from her parents
' there was also income from her position as a director of three limited companies that were trading during the material time and which mr grant was running
' and they were using their business accounts for personal expenditure
' investigations into their affairs began when questions were raised about how they were able to pay Â£ 1,950 a month rent with just Â£ 775 a month housing allowance
mrs grant was questioned by benefit officials in may 2010 and said that her parents had paid the rent shortfalls and school fees
top private school : the grants ' children attended Â£ 32,000 - a - year dean close school in cheltenham while the couple was claiming benefits , the court heard the couple , from cheltenham , claim that the firms they were involved in at the time were in liquidation
on wednesday a forensic accountant told the court that after analysing the pair 's bank accounts it was clear they had more than Â£ 48,000 available to them
he explained that between them the pair had four bank accounts and his job was to analyse the accounts to decide what was ' personal ' income and what related to the business
he told the jury that he assessed each payment made and even went through nine ring binders full of receipts to try and ascertain where cash had been spent
in his report he also asked : ' what is income ? luxury items such as school fees , extravagant holidays , expensive purchases , nice clothes , could all mean an income
' if you 're spending on these things there must be a source to do it
' but they could also be the result of credit cards debts , or gifts
school fees for example , which were on their bank statements , imply an income , or it could just be the result of a gift
' the accountant , neil ward , concluded that the pair had a total of Â£ 48,206.59 , which was assessable for pension credit
he told that Â£ 40,000 of that had come from mrs grant 's mother
on trial : speaking at gloucester crown court ( above ) , prosecutor tara wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of about Â£ 42,500 to which they were not entitled the defence argued that it therefore counted as a gift , but when prosecutor , tara wolfe , asked the witness : ' would a gift of Â£ 40,000 be eligible for pension credit ? ' he responded : ' i believe so '
mr and mrs grant both deny falsely claiming pension credits and housing and council tax benefit without declaring they had other income
but defence witness gregory - a forensic accountant - said the couple were clearly struggling with money as a number of their businesses went under
she explained how sarafinos ltd , a coffee shop opened in folkestone and birmingham , was hoped to become a chain but it collapsed shortly after opening
instead the pair opened a restaurant called the courtyard in cheltenham
the couple also opened d'altos , a company aimed at running fast food outlets which ran for just two months
the couple 's building companies , hadleigh partnership and hadleigh development also went into liquidation
mrs gregory also argued that the Â£ 40,000 given to grant by her mother was clearly a loan and did not count as income
she said : ' they were struggling
they were doing their best to make things work
they had a number of businesses and they had become accustomed to a certain lifestyle
' their businesses went under but they were trying to maintain that level of living
' it took them about a year to try and get back on their feet financially
' i do n't believe they were receiving any income
i understood the money to be a short term loan from mrs grant 's mother to get her back on her feet
