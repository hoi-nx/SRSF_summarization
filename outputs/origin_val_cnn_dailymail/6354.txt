norwegian air travellers today lampooned ryanair 's plans to offer Â£ 10 transatlantic flights by suggesting they may have to stand , pay to use the toilet or even parachute into us because it is so cheap
the budget airline has announced it plans to fly to new york , boston , chicago and miami from london stansted , dublin and berlin from 2020
the Â£ 10 - a - ticket proposal is part of a wider plan to change its image and ' stop p * * * * * * people off ' because boss o'leary 's schemes to squeeze more money out of passengers left many irate
breaking new ground : ryanair 's directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline offering flights from as little as Â£ 10 but there has also been considerable fun at their expense but despite a largely positive reaction online to the proposed transatlantic expansion , others have also used it to crack a joke at the frugal airline 's expense
some said that ryanair 's new york hub could be in nova scotia , canada , or passengers may have to ' sky dive in and hope you do n't land in the hudson ' so the thrifty company can avoid landing costs
others pondered how much people would be charged for not printing their own tickets , and if the Â£ 10 deal would include any food , leg room , entertainment or any luggage
jason bournemouth tweeted : ' it 's ryanair so new york means , at best , landing in new jersey
mail columnist andrew pierce wrote : ' ryanair to launch Â£ 10 flight to us
plus Â£ 200 for luggage , Â£ 200 for seat , Â£ 1 to use loo '
sandie blicken replied : ' they do n't actually land anywhere you just do a sky dive and hope you do n't land in the hudson '
the budget airline âs directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline as part of an ambitious growth strategy at european âs largest low - cost carrier over the next five years
the airline has set out proposals for one - way tickets costing from under Â£ 10 , although some fares would be much higher
ryanair says it is studying plans to fly between about a dozen european and us cities on a transatlantic service that could start â in four to five years â
ryanair âs chief executive michael oâleary has talked over many years about his dream of setting up a transatlantic airline offering cheap â ten buck â transatlantic fares â with $ 10 currently equivalent to Â£ 6.75
but the announcement that his board has now approved initial plans suggests the company is now more serious about going ahead with the ambitious strategy
michael oâleary is particularly keen to win a slice of the lucrative long - haul transatlantic trade which is one of the most profitable routes in the world
the company said yesterday : ' european consumers want lower cost travel to the us and the same for us coming to european
we see it as a logical development '
outspoken : mr o'leary , who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth , has been the face of ryanair for almost 20 years
he has seen it through two decades of extraordinary growth but it is dominated by long - established european and us airlines including british airways , american airlines and , on a smaller level , virgin atlantic , which is in partnership with us âs delta
pay - per - pee in 2009 , mr michael oâleary announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight
' we âre thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to spend a pound to spend a penny
' when asked if he would charge more than a pound , he replied : ' if someone wanted to pay Â£ 5 to go to the toilet i would carry them myself
i would wipe their bums for a fiver
' vertical seats a year later , the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would think of vertical seats , akin to bar stools with seatbelts
his theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 rows of vertical seats , flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers and slash costs by 20 per cent
who needs co-pilots ? mr o'leary once remarked that co-pilots were only there to ' make sure the first fella does nât fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls '
he said aviation authorities should axe the ' unnecessary ' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as ' back - up ' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight
ryanair âs plan has echoes of 1970s cut - price pioneer sir freddie laker whose cheap skytrain flights to the us transformed transatlantic travel for the masses , until it was effectively killed off by the established airlines , though it inspired sir richard branson to launch virgin atlantic
norwegian air started its transatlantic service in 2013 two years ago with a one - way ticket from the uk to new york starting at Â£ 149
ryanair has said it would fulfil its long - expressed promise of offering some bargain - basement transatlantic fares at Â£ 10 , but other one - way tickets would be priced from Â£ 99 or more
in november ryanair 's profits soared by 32 per cent and its loud - mouth boss o'leary admitted : ' being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy '
these have included demanding up to Â£ 5 to use the toilet and vertical seats to get more people on board
but last year , after two profits warnings , mr o'leary 's promised that the company would ' stop unnecessarily p * * * * * * people off ' and treating customers ' like the enemy '
o'leary agreed to partially end the scramble to get on his planes by offering allocated seating for almost Â£ 5 , relax the airline 's draconian baggage allowance rules and a ' sophisticated ' business service
he admitted that to turn them around he would end the airline 's ' over-abrupt ' , ' go to hell ' culture
in 2012 he launched an extraordinary rant against his own customers â branding those who object to paying a penalty for failing to print their own boarding cards as â idiots â who should â b * * * * * off â
her said passengers who arrive for flights without a pass are â stupid â and it is right they are charged Â£ 60 a time to have one printed at the check - in desk because it is their â f * * * up â
budget : ryanair âs chief executive michael oâleary has talked over many years about his dream of setting up a transatlantic airline mr o'leary , who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth , has been the face of ryanair for almost 20 years
but in the past 18 month , under pressure over customer service , he has said he wants to change his ways
in autumn 2013 a charm offensive backfired when the outspoken tycoon was bombarded on twitter after agreeing to host a question - and - answer session from customers
he posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets
many customers told mr o'leary what an ' a * * * hole ' they thought he was - with user andrew riddell asking him : ' have you by any chance just hired british gas 's former head of publicity you plum '
the ryanair boss replied : ' hey , do n't call me plum
pudding would be more accurate ! ' , before later admitting : ' i 'm an a * * * hole
but they still love me
