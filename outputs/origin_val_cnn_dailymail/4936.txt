ashley says her mum 's favourite mother âs day present was a gadget she said she did n't want i can vividly remember the mother âs day when i bought my mum the one gift she had expressly forbidden me to buy
it was tivo : a way to record favourite tv shows , which at the time was novel and new to the market and something i was sure she could use
she was adamant about not wanting it and not watching enough tv for it to be useful
even so , i persevered knowing that many of her favourite cooking shows , home design programmes and poirots recording all by themselves would be something she would quickly learn to love
i also suspected that her reticence had to do with her own unspoken fear that she would nât be able to master a complicated remote control
despite her protestations , i bought it anyway , and almost immediately it became one of her favourite gifts of all time
so whether it âs something she âs intimidated by , technology she is nât familiar with , a beauty treatment she finds too extravagant or does nât think she needs â or if you âre just tired of giving her the same emma bridgewater mug with flowers every year , here are the top 15 gifts you should buy for your mum this mother âs day , that she does nât know she wants ( yet )
