alastair cook fell cheaply for the second time in the match for mcc against county champions yorkshire alastair cook , who made just three in the first innings , mustered five at his second attempt on tuesday morning but he will do so on the back of two failures in his only two first - class innings since last season
alastair cook caused a stir last week when he described england 's decision to replace him as their world cup captain as ' probably wrong ' , in hindsight
the opener continued his poor form in a one - day international series in sri lanka late last year , and england responded by dropping him in favour of eoin morgan
