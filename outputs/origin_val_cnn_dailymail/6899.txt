one of my favourite lines in sport is : â winners perform at their best when the pressure is at its greatest
â lancaster and england are under real pressure now
they may be annoyed at the criticism they received after dublin but it was not the result , it was the manner of their defeat
england were inferior in every area of the game , and that should hurt a lot
after a great start against wales , england had the wind taken out of their sails by ireland
suddenly the nightmare scenario of england not making it out of a world cup group which contains wales and australia becomes a real threat
danny cipriani is among england 's fringe players who must get a start in the remaining six nations games lancaster 's focus must shift to the world cup with two competitive matches left before it starts steffon armitage may be left out due to his choice to play for toulon but he 's really too good to ignore lancaster âs men have just five games before their campaign begins against fiji on september 18 ... six nations saturday , march 14 v scotland ( h ) saturday , march 21 v france ( h ) world cup warm - ups saturday august 15 v france ( h ) saturday august 22 v france ( a ) saturday september 5 v ireland ( h ) if wales defeat ireland at home this weekend , their year is back on track and they go into world cup camp in great shape
australia will be battle - hardened and energised by a new coaching team
they know if they can put a scrum together to compete with england then twickenham holds no fears
with two games to go in the six nations , england âs momentum going into the world cup camp depends on their performances against scotland and france
they should win those games regardless of the team they select
but lancaster faces some crucial decisions : either continue along the same path or make changes , and send the message to everyone that there is yet more to come from his side
since the end of last year âs six nations , england have lost six out of eight matches against top - tier teams
my concern is that teams will look at england and like what they see
nobody doubts the front five is as good as any in the world
the england pack is fearsome , and behind the scrum they have the players - but a response is needed
now is the time to show that â pressure â sits comfortably on their shoulders
here âs my seven - point guide that england should follow ... england 's squad are put through their paces ahead of saturday 's six nations clash with scotland 1 pool practice 2015 is all about the world cup , nothing else
england can win the six nations title on points difference , but in a world cup year , once the grand slam is gone , the tournament is gone
england only have five games before their world cup opener in september , and three of those are friendlies , which are not games to judge anybody on
that leaves just two meaningful matches - scotland and france at home
these are must - win games , but use them as rehearsals for the pool matches against wales and australia
england have to do everything they can to replicate the atmosphere they will encounter when they play those world cup games
2 three and easy there are three men lancaster still needs to see start - danny cipriani , steffon armitage and henry slade
lancaster can make it clear he âs not dropping george ford , but he needs to find out about danny cipriani in a significant game once and for all
steffon armitage is arguably the best player in europe and must be in the squad
we can deal with the politics of overseas players after the world cup , but let âs just get the best players on the field
lancaster needs to find out about danny cipriani in a significant game once and for all , so he should start henry slade - alongside joseph - is perhaps the most in - form centre in england and his left foot , at inside centre , would offer more kicking variations
england âs kicking game was poor against ireland and they have got to find players who can dictate a game
kicking is now so important and they are off the pace
perhaps only one of the three will really seize their opportunity , but at least you will know once and for all
lancaster must be bold and those selections would change the whole atmosphere at twickenham
exeter 's henry slade is probably the most in - form centre in england at the moment so should be tested 3 rest robshaw i âm a big chris robshaw fan but he is in a very competitive position and must be in the team on merit , so we need to see his biggest rival play
also , if he gets injured in the first minute at the world cup , nobody knows who will replace him as captain
it âs time to see who else has the capacity to lead this team and i would give haskell a chance to see how he handles the task , which allows you to bring in steffon armitage at no 7
haskell is one of the few players who captains his club , so give the role to him on saturday
captain chris robshaw , here attempting a drop goal at training , should be rested to try out alternatives haskell captains wasps so would be an interesting replacement for chris robshaw should one be needed 4 need for speed the current back row of chris robshaw , haskell and vunipola is not quick enough at the very top level
it is such a shame tom croft is injured - he is one of the quickest forwards in world rugby at no 6 - while steffon armitage is no slouch
in a world cup you are playing against the fittest and fastest players , and you need to be able to match that
we have a big powerful front five but we do not need the same in the back row , we need speed
the current back row of vunipola ( pictured ) , haskell and chris robshaw do n't have the speed required 5 get your kicks dave alred is one of the best coaches i âve ever worked with
that âs why i âd bring him back into the england set - up
it was nât just jonny wilkinson âs kicking that he helped - dave alred improved the whole team
england âs kicking and catching was so poor against ireland and the whole world will have seen that
dave alred ( right ) not only helped jonny wilkinson 's prodigious kicking but the all - round england game it would be a challenge persuading him to join because he is very much his own man , but he is the best person for the job by a long way
many of his methods , based on aussie rules football , could be introduced over the coming months
then , by the time england go into camp , the team will understand how he operates and will have one of the game âs great specialist coaches at their disposal
6 focus on fitness when i managed england , i made it clear i would only pick players who can play 80 minutes
if you ca nât last a full game at full pace , you are not going to survive in a world cup
lancaster has faith in his strength and conditioning team , but an independent opinion , from someone who has prepared world cup teams , could be a shot in the arm
i would bring in someone like dave reddin , who was in my set - up , was with team gb at london 2012 and is now head of performance at the fa
he will pull no punches and get everyone âs mind back on track
every player picked should be fit enough to play for 80 minutes if they 're worthy of the world cup 7 smarter subs assuming all your players can last 80 minutes , the first purpose of your bench should be for injury replacements , but england started against ireland with no specialist second - row substitute
if dave attwood had gone off in the first minute , could nick easter really play the whole game in the second row ? secondly , the bench is there to make tactical changes
lancaster âs substitutions against ireland were his most important because england were chasing the game
but his changes surprised me
mike brown anthony watson joseph henry slade jack nowell danny cipriani ben youngs alex corbisiero dylan hartley dan cole courtney lawes dave attwood tom wood haskell steffon armitage with 15 minutes to go he needed to bring on danny cipriani , not twelvetrees
keeping ford in the game was the right call but he needed help creatively and with the boot
for lancaster to say danny cipriani coming off the bench at 12 is not an option because he has nât seen him play there before does nât add up
between danny cipriani and twelvetrees you need to cover six positions so you can not be inflexible and say danny cipriani is only a fly - half
england need to find ways to unsettle the opposition and do the unexpected
if we have nât seen danny cipriani at 12 , you can guarantee ireland have nât either
it may not have changed the outcome , but i âd love to have seen ford , danny cipriani and joseph finish that game together .
