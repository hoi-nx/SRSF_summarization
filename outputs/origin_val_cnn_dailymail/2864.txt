two teenage brothers who tried to join the islamic state , but who were instead detained at sydney by counter-terrorism authorities , are ' kids , not killers ' , immigration minister peter dutton says
the two australians , aged 16 and 17 , from south west sydney were trying to leave australians to fight in a conflict zone in the middle east and were reportedly brought home by their mother after being detained
authorities â suspicions were aroused after the two had booked flights to an unidentified country in the middle east and their luggage was searched
in a press conference on sunday mr peter dutton said that matters remained under investigation and he praised the customs officers for their vigilence
' these two young men ... are kids , not killers , and they should n't be allowed to go to a foreign land to fight and to come back to our shores eventually more radicalised , ' he said
' they ( customs officers ) have potentially saved the lives of these australians
is is a cancer and young people are the most susceptible
' is is abhorent and should not be tolerated in our society
' elomar left sydney and has reportedy joined is in iraq the two teenagers were detained at sydney airport when they tried to board a flight for the middle east mr peter dutton said that traditionally , parents of teenage children had to worry about alcohol , drugs , and driving , but this was a new worry
' now there is an added threat of the information being delivered to them over the internet , particularly if they 're inclined to go and fight in a foreign land , ' he said
' [ and ] most importantly for our country , when they return , they return more radicalised , and [ are ] a greater threat to the australians public
' we have to be absolutely determined to stare down this ever increasing threat
' their parents were unaware of their plans to travel to the middle east
the brothers were later issued court attendance notices
under the new foreign fighters act , customs officers are allowed to detain people where the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is intending to commit a commonwealth offence or is a threat to national security or the security of a foreign country
the sunday telegraph reported that mr peter dutton said that the two boys had aroused the suspicion of â two alert customs and border protection officers â who referred them to the terrorism unit
' what we have here are two teenagers who have been intercepted on their way to a potentially very dangerous situation , ' mr peter dutton said
sharrouf has already served three years and 11 months in prison ' as a result of this interception , a sydney family remains together
' this highlights afresh the need to work within communities and with parents to disrupt attempts to brainwash our young people
' it is yet another reminder of the need for parents to remain vigilant against this type of threat
' sydney jihadists elomar , sharrouf , and teenager elmir - dubbed the ginger jihadist - are so far the most high profile australians to have travelled to the middle east to fight with islamic state
elmir , a former condell park high student , was filmed on the banks of the river tigris in iraq last october
while elomar and sharrouf have appeared regularly in islamic state videos
one of which included a beheading of a prisoner
elomar ( right ) has been seen in a number of is videos and photographs convicted terrorist sharrouf served three years and 11 months in prison over his role in the 2005 pendennis terror plot
he left australians illegally last year and is believed to be fighting with isis in iraq
in a now famous rant aimed at prime minister tony abbott , elmir said that the islamic state would not stop until ' until we put the black flag on top of buckingham palace , until we put the black flag on top of the white house
' elmir ( front centre ) wants to see a ' black flag on top of the white house ' a 22 - year - old gold coast woman , amira karroum , was murdered within days of arriving in syria last year
up to 40 australians women were also known to have travelled to syria and iraq to become ' jihadi brides ' or work with terrorists
more than 100 australians are thought to have travelled overseas to fight in iraq and syria .
