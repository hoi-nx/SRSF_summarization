' people try to give me coffee for breakfast
well i 'd rather have a dr pepper , ' she said
' i started drinking them about 40 years ago
every doctor that sees me says they 'll kill you , but they die and i do n't , so there must be a mistake somewhere
she drinks about three cans a day larry young , the ceo of dr pepper snapple group , gave sullivan a big surprise for her birthday on wednesday : a cake designed to look like the carbonated drink 's can , a gift basket and plenty of bottles of the pop to drink , according to cbs dallas fort worth

' well at 103 i did n't think i 'd make it , but i 'm still perking along , ' she told cbs

i 'm glad i 'm still here
i 'm glad i 'm not in a rest home
glad i can still read books and watch tv and have people come by and say hello , ' she said
