each neighbourhood of the city is required to produce a ' falla ' - a wooden sculpture that is eventually burnt
there are different speculations regarding the origin of the falles festival
one suggests that the falles started in the middle ages , when artisans disposed of the broken artifacts and pieces of wood they saved during the winter by burning them to celebrate the spring equinox
valencian carpenters used planks of wood called parots to hang their candles on during the winter , as these were needed to provide light to work by
with the coming of the spring , they were no longer necessary , so they were burned
over time , and with the intervention of the church , the date of the burning of these parots was made to coincide with the celebration of the festival of saint joseph , the patron saint of carpenters
