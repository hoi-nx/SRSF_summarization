furious mps are in revolt over a decision to sell off the commons silver â to save a â paltry â Â£ 200 a week
some of the silver - plated cutlery used in commons dining rooms could be sold to tourists as souvenirs and replaced by stainless steel knives and forks made in vietnam
a leaked report obtained by the mail on sunday reveals a plan to strip the new cutlery of the traditional commons portcullis logo to deter visitors from stealing them
faded : the silver cutlery used in the dining rooms at the commons a report accepted by the commons administration committee says the move will save nearly Â£ 50,000 over the next five years â Â£ 10,000 a year or just under Â£ 200 a week
but tory mp jacob rees-mogg , who is leading a battle to get the decision overturned , said : â selling off westminster âs family silver to save a paltry Â£ 10,000 a year is taking cheeseparing to ridiculous lengths
â there is a fundamental triviality about trying to save this sort of money when we are told we need to find Â£ 3 billion to restore the palace
â dignitaries who come here rightly expect to use silver - plated cutlery â not something one stop short of plastic forks and polystyrene cups
â commons catering chiefs claim it costs too much to maintain silver cutlery and insist a new Â£ 17,000 stainless steel set â made in vietnam or taiwan â will not â compromise on class or elegance â
in a report they told mps : â our silver cutlery must be sent back to the manufacturer for refurbishment annually and burnished weekly ( rubbed and cleaned ) to maintain its finish
this process is costly , labour intensive and it is becoming more difficult to maintain the cutlery to an acceptable standard
â the officials say it would cost Â£ 72,400 over five years to keep the silver cutlery , including : fighting cause : tory mp jacob rees-mogg is leading a battle to get the cutlery decision overturned by contrast , a new stainless steel set will cost Â£ 17,000 to buy and Â£ 6,800 to replace items that go missing
when the Â£ 880 profit from selling off a few worn pieces of silver cutlery for scrap is accounted for , it produces a saving of about Â£ 47,000
but that does not include the potential profit from selling some of the silver cutlery through commons gifts shops , which officials are looking at
the report says â the best â of the silver cutlery will be kept for â mp dining clubs , a member âs wedding breakfast etc â
mps on the committee voted to keep the portcullis logo and have asked catering chiefs to look at buying cutlery made in the uk .
