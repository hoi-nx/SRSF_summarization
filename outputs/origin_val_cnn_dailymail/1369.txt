clarkson visited his producer 's home to apologise for their top gear altercation but was given the cold shoulder , it was claimed last night
the bbc investigation into the row has been told tymon refused to even open the door to the presenter after he turned up at his house , according to a report
sources said the incident happened four days after 54 - year - old clarkson allegedly punched mr tymon during an argument after filming over a hot meal at a yorkshire hotel
the top - rating show was pulled off air and clarkson was suspended while an inquiry was launched
it has also been claimed that clarkson has sent at least one apologetic email to mr tymon
ken macquarrie , the bbc executive in charge of the inquiry , has reportedly been shown the contents of the emails
a source told the daily mirror : â in the hours before he reported the matter to the bbc , clarkson seemed increasingly desperate to apologise to oisin and persuade him to let the matter blow over
â when he arrived on the doorstep that sunday , oisin was not feeling ready to face him so did nât answer
he just did nât want to speak to him after what happened
hosts : although top gear has been taken off air , clarkson and his co-presenters richard hammond ( left ) and james may ( right ) are still scheduled to host a top gear arena show in norway next week â clarkson could be heard saying that he just wanted to talk
he was asking for the door to be opened but it did nât work
he tried for up to five minutes but in the end had to walk away
â far from patching things up with the corporation , the presenter appears to be creating further tension after launching a foul - mouthed rant at bbc bosses during a charity gala last night
speaking in north london to raise money to help disadvantaged youths , said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show âs track â before the â f * * * * * * b * * * * * * * sack me â
in footage obtained by the daily mirror , he spoke to the roundhouse audience about a charity auction for his â last ever lap â on the top gear track - which later went for Â£ 100,000
clarkson said : â i did n't foresee my sacking , but i would like to do one last lap. so i 'll go down to surrey and i 'll do one last lap of that track before the f * * * * * * b * * * * * * * sack me
â i 'll be a bit tearful when i do it , but f * * * it , let 's do it
and i 'll drive somebody around in whatever i can get hold of
i 'm sacked so it 's probably an austin maestro
' rant : clarkson speaks on stage , next to pink floyd 's nick mason , during the roundhouse gala last night he added : ' there was an 18 - year waiting list to be in the audience of top gear , but the bbc has f * * * * * themselves
â although top gear has been taken off air , tickets are still on sale for the four performances of the live show in norway , which will take place next friday and saturday
up to 5,000 people are expected to attend each one
meanwhile , it was also revealed last night that clarkson 's future on the bbc is likely to be decided next week when the corporation 's internal investigation into his behaviour is handed over to the director - general
a bbc worldwide source told the daily telegraph : â at the moment we are taking things on a day by day basis and as things stand the [ norway ] shows are scheduled to run as billed
â it is not happening tomorrow , it is happening in eight days ' time , so we are waiting to see what the investigation delivers
bids : clarkson ( centre ) , sitting next to journalist christa d'souza ( left ) and nettie mason ( right ) - wife of pink floyd 's nick mason - during the live auction at the gala , to raise money to help disadvantaged youths â no - one is really sure about the timing of the investigation 's decision , so before we disappoint 20,000 fans in norway , at the moment we are going ahead with the show
â the top gear host has been suspended since it emerged he was involved in what the bbc called â a fracas â with one of the show 's producers
it was reported this week that clarkson 's top gear co-hosts declined an offer to continue the rest of the series without him
the last episodes of the series have been postponed , causing the bbc to lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints .
