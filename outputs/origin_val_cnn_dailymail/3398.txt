death by drugs : goodman , 23 , died in colorado over the weekend after he took too many marijuana edibles and shot himself in the head a popular college graduate died this past weekend in colorado , after his family say he took too many marijuana candies and killed himself
goodman , 23 , of tulsa , oklahoma ate four times the prescribed amount of a peach tart marijuana edible candy in addition to a thc - laced red velvet cookie and proceeded to shoot himself in the head with a gun he brought on the trip for protection
goodman 's family say he was a charismatic and outgoing young man who never showed signs of depression or suicidal thoughts before
they blame his death solely on the edibles
' it was 100 per cent the drugs
it was completely because of the drugs - he had consumed so much of it , ' his mother goodman told cbs denver
goodman was on a two - week ski trip with his family and friends when his parents dropped him off at the bus stop saturday to go snowboarding with his cousin , fowler
goodman 's parents were on their way back to tulsa , and their son was going to spend the rest of the trip with his cousin
during their day out , goodman and fowler went to silverthorne where the two purchased $ 78 worth of pot and edibles
they then went back to their lodgings and proceeded to get high
fowler says his cousin started off by eating two peach tart candies at the same time - despite the fact that the suggested dosage is just one candy
each candy contains 10mg of thc - the active ingredient in marijuana
when goodman did n't immediately feel the effects of the drug , he took two more and also ate red velvet cookie baked with marijuana ( his cousin had three cookies )
goodman 's mother fears her son did n't read the warning label on the candies , which say the effects can take hours to kick in

it 's unclear the specific brand goodman ingested several hours later , goodman 's behavior changed drastically and he became jittery , incoherent and started talking nonsensically
' he would make eye contact with us but did nât see us , did nât recognize our presence almost
he had never got close to this point , i had never seen him like this , ' fowler said
apparently unaware of his serious condition , fowler left goodman in the condo to hop in the hot tub with other members of their vacation party
only his cousin 's mother was in the apartment , when goodman grabbed his handgun , which he traveled with for protection , and shot himself
the single shot was fired just five minutes after fowler left goodman to use the hot tub
the summit county coroner says toxicology reports due back in a few weeks will shed more light on the edibles impact on goodman 's death
however , his family are certain that it was the edibles and edibles alone are what caused their son to take his own life
out of character : goodman 's parents say she was a happy young man who never showed signs of depression of suicidal thoughts before the tragic incident on saturday ' it was completely out of character for goodman ... there was no depression or anything that would leave us being concerned , nothing like that , ' mrs goodman said
' i was very , very close to him , ' mrs goodman added to daily mail online
' he would share heart and soul with me
' mrs goodman says her son had just graduated from oral roberts university in december with a degree in marketing and had his whole life ahead of him
she says he had been going to the gym five or six days a week , working out for the snowboarding trip with his cousins who were some of his best friends
' he was such a well - adjusted young man , ' mrs goodman told us
' he lit up people 's world
' goodman was certainly well loved , since his facebook page was flooded with heartbroken notes from friends and family on his passing
' goodman , your light shined so bright to everyone you came in contact with
i know your legacy will shine even brighter
you were hated by no one and loved by all
that smile and the joy you carried with you was contagious , ' one friend wrote .
