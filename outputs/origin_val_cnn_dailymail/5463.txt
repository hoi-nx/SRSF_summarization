the commission that has investigated doping in cycling will not be recommending that armstrong âs lifetime ban from competitive sport is reduced
the american stripped of his seven tour de france titles for using performance - enhancing drugs was hoping the cycling independent reform commission would be more sympathetic after he twice gave evidence to the three - man panel
but cycling independent reform commission , who submitted their report to the uci last friday and are due to hold a media briefing in switzerland next week , are not planning to recommend to the united states anti-doping agency that they reduce their ban
armstrong was stripped of his seven tour de france titles for using performance - enhancing drugs armstrong waves from the podium after winning the 16th stage of the 2005 tour de france some reports suggested on sunday that lawyers representing armstrong placed certain limitations on what cycling independent reform commission could ask , which in turn was being given as a reason for the stance cycling independent reform commission have now adopted
but armstrong âs legal team vehemently deny that , insisting that no restrictions were placed on cycling independent reform commission in their two interviews with the texan
only recently armstrong suggested to the bbc that he had answered all cycling independent reform commission âs questions candidly
â at this point in my life i âm not out to protect anybody , â he said
â i âm out to protect seven people and they all have the last name armstrong
â armstrong told the bbc that he is out to protect seven people - ' and they all have the last name armstrong ' the american leads ahead of bradley wiggins during stage 17 of the 2009 tour de france armstrong is sure to be angered by the fact that a number of his contemporaries â who have also been guilty of doping offences â did not even cooperate with cycling independent reform commission and yet remain senior figures in the sport
brian cookson , the uci president , had warned that such a lack of cooperation would be frowned upon and it will be interesting to see if he sticks to his promise of introducing a fit - and - proper - person test for cycling team officials in the wake of the cycling independent reform commission report
brian cookson has said the report will make â uncomfortable â reading for his sport
â when you open a can of worms you find a lot of worms , â brian cookson said last month at the world track cycling championships in paris
â i think it âs going to be very interesting - there will be a lot of uncomfortable things there
â brian cookson , the uci president , has said that the report will make for ' uncomfortable reading ' chris froome revealed to sportsmail that he has spoken to the cycling independent reform commission about the problem of doping but he also took a swipe at armstrong , accusing him of having an â agenda â for revealing he had spoken to cycling independent reform commission in the first place
armstrong obviously does have an agenda ; he wants his ban reduced when other dopers from his era have not been hit with the same severe sanctions
but criticising anyone for revealing they have spoken to cycling independent reform commission seems a curious position to adopt when the promise of anonymity might yet protect those who have nât come forward
only last week chris froome revealed to sportsmail that he too has spoken to cycling independent reform commission , having wanted to give a senior rider âs perspective on the problems that continue to undermine the uci âs efforts to clean up the sport
particularly at a time when the uci are pushing for the racing licence of the astana team â that boasts current tour de france champion vicenzo nibali â to be revoked .
