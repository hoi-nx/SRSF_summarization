there are two players in the woods era who have left mcdowell feeling utterly helpless and wondering how on earth he can compete
mcilroy , of course , is his old friend mcilroy
and the other is dustin johnson
as it turned out , mcdowell , like everyone else , did nât have to worry about beating the american because he was too busy beating himself
dustin johnson vehemently denies a failed test for recreational drugs use prompted him to take a six - month leave of absence that caused him to miss the ryder cup last year
whether that is true or not , there were plenty of other party - style vices he did own up to that needed addressing and were enough by themselves to turn an obvious world top - three player into one struggling to stay in the top 20
american dustin johnson ( left ) won the wgc cadillac championship on sunday mcdowell hits onto the 18th green after his ball landed near a tree at the wgc cadillac championship mcdowell holds dustin johnson in the same regard as fellow northern irishman mcilroy dustin johnson shows off his awesome power off the tee with another brutal drive at doral dustin johnson stands 6ft 4in and is such a naturally talented athlete he had every sporting coach at his college clamouring for him to specialise in their particular pursuit
when he started making millions from golf , it was hardly surprising that temptation lay at every turn
only scott attracted more swooning women than dustin johnson , but only scott was wise enough to pick his way through the pitfalls
and now dustin johnson âs back
will this turn out like another john daly fable , where he returns but only to fall back into his old ways as quick as a lead can disappear on a pressure - filled sunday ? happily , all the signs point the other way
during the break , his fiancee gretzky â whose ice hockey - playing father wayne holds the same revered status in canada that kenny dalglish holds in liverpool â gave birth to their first child
when dustin johnson starting practising ahead of his return , his coach butch harmon could nât believe the difference mentally
dustin johnson 's happy family life with gretzky ( left ) could spell trouble for mcilroy ( right ) on the course dustin johnson 's form has been stunning since he became a father
gretzky gave birth to son , tatum , in january gretzky and dustin johnson share a kiss , while tatum watches , after his victory in miami on sunday it âs showing on the golf course
heck , he âs only played five events following that long break and he âs already had two second - place finishes and , on sunday , a classy win in the wgc cadillac championship at doral
how âs that for talent ? it was all on show on the 18th hole on sunday
the water hazard that juts out at 300 yards to the edge of the fairway and caught even mcilroy âs drive ? dustin johnson cleared it comfortably
mcilroy hit a three - iron for his third shot ; dustin johnson had an eight - iron
it was the eighth consecutive season in which dustin johnson has managed at least one victory
the next best sequence on the pga tour is justin rose âs five
dustin johnson was handed the gene sarazen cup by donald trump after his victory at the weekend dustin johnson pictured putting on the sixth hole during his final round in florida on sunday dustin johnson insists that his six - month absence from golf was not down to a failed drugs test just like the northern irishman , his game is built on devastating power and accuracy from the tee
now 30 , he has given mcilroy an enormous head start
imagine the pair coming down the stretch at a major with one man having four grand slam wins to draw upon while the other is still awaiting his first ? but if you âre looking for the player who ought to run mcilroy the closest over the next few years , dustin johnson has the game
and now â finally â it looks like he might also have the brain
â i can hardly believe i âve played a tournament without a single bogey
i did nât think it was possible on this course
â it was a good job it was possible for the impressive korean inbee park , for it âs about the only way any of the women can beat 17 - year - old lydia ko these days
inbee park ( left ) won the women 's championship trophy in singapore by two shots over lydia ko park ( second right ) won the tournament by not firing a single bogey across the four rounds ko , wh became golf 's youngest - ever world no 1 last month , finished the event in second place even so , 26 - year - old park still only won the hsbc women âs champions tournament in singapore by two shots from the new zealander , who has two wins and now this second place to her name since becoming golf âs youngest - ever world no 1 last month
sections of the american press are wondering why mcilroy was given a largely free pass for tossing his three - iron into the water last week while the criticism that would have followed tiger , if he âd done it , â would have blown up the internet â
so let âs see if we can explain the difference
at the age of 25 woods never engaged with spectators , rarely signed autographs , was frequently seen spitting on the side of greens and treated the press with barely concealed contempt
mcilroy acknowledges the crowds , devotes hours of his time to signing autographs and spends way longer than he needs trying to give an insight to the media
reap what you sow , it âs called
american media has queried if tiger would have got more stick than mcilroy for throwing a club away mcilroy threw his three - iron into the lake in florida but a scuba diver later discovered it it is not known whether woods ( right ) will compete at the masters at augusta next month as for whether tiger will be back for the masters next month there is , of course , no word
no update on his progress , nothing
to turn the question around : could you ever imagine mcilroy acting like that ? the only thing we can say with a degree of certainty is that friday is surely a big day if woods is to turn up at augusta
that âs the deadline for entering the arnold palmer invitational next week â and if he does nât play in that event , one he âs won a remarkable eight times , it âs hard to envisage him playing the masters .
