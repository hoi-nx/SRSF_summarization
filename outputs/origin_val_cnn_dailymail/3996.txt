they will certainly be treated to stunning scenes of cornish , but viewers may not hear a cornish accent when they tune in to watch poldark
yesterday it emerged that the stars of the show , which is set in the windswept cornish landscape , were so terrified of being accused of mumbling that many made a conscious decision to enunciate their lines
pictured , aiden turner and eleanor tomlinson as poldark and demelza it appears that the barrage of criticism received over the bbc âs adaptation of daphne du maurier âs gothic novel jamaica inn is to blame for creating the fear factor
more than 2,000 viewers complained about poor sound quality and inaudible dialogue when jamaica inn was screened last april and the star of poldark , aidan turner , has now confessed that he and the cast were alarmed by the backlash
aidan turner , 31 , told the radio times : â i did nât see jamaica inn but the fuss about it spooked us all a lot
â we started shooting a few weeks later and i can tell you all the actors were aiming for ten out of ten on enunciation
' i âm doing posh rp [ received pronunciation ] anyway , so it did nât affect me directly but i was scared , yes
â aidan turner takes the role of british soldier poldark , who returns from fighting in the american war of independence to find his fiancÃ©e elizabeth chenoweth , believing him to be dead , is set to marry his cousin
bbc bosses are hoping for a return of poldark mania
