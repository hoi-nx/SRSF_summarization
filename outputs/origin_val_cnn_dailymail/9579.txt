more than a dozen dangerous offenders committed terrorism offences while on bail , including jihadist ellekhlifi who fled to syria while on bail for a spate of violent muggings in london more than a dozen dangerous offenders committed terrorism offences while on bail , damning figures have revealed
in the last three years , 13 suspects allowed to walk free for other offences were arrested for breaching anti-terror laws
the figures , obtained by mailonline , also show the shocking scale of offences committed by suspects on bail , with one crime every five minutes
it is likely that the 13 terrorists were allowed to walk free after committing minor crimes before then being caught endangering national security , legal experts say
the staggering figures , released by the moj under freedom of information laws , show that nearly 350,000 offences were committed on bail in the last three years
this equates to one offence every five minutes - sparking yet more fears about the state of britain 's justice system
the statistics raise further questions over the monitoring of terror suspects , such as jihadist ellekhlifi , who fled to syria in 2012 while he was on bail for a spate of violent muggings in london
ellekhlifi , 22 , threatened victims with a taser - style high - voltage stun gun and forced them to hand over valuables including designer watches and mobile phones , but fled the country before he could face trial
he is believed to have been two years below emwazi - revealed last week to be jihadi john - at quintin kynaston school in north west london and was killed in 2013 near the city of aleppo
emwazi was himself on a terror watch list when he travelled to syria and the government has admitted that hundreds of isis extremists ' slipped through the net ' and were not properly monitored by the security services
the figures also make for a chilling comparison to sydney siege gunman man haron monis , who was on bail in australia when he took 17 hostages captive in a cafe before killing two
tory mp nick de bois , a member of the commons justice committee , said : ' any hint that someone may be involved in terrorism and who is facing criminal charges must be remanded in prison - no ifs no buts
' we have to accept that bail conditions are not tough enough , leaving those with criminal intent to wander our streets
' if courts are not going to remand defendants in jail then we should at least place them under 24 - hour house arrest using electronic tagging to keep them at home rather than free to commit crime
' ellekhlifi ( right ) was killed near aleppo in 2013 alongside mohammed el-araj , from west london ( left ) magistrates have been under mounting pressure in recent years to remand fewer suspects into custody to ease the burden on over-stretched prisons
joseph kotrie-monson , criminal defence lawyer at mary monson solicitors , said : ' people who have gone on to commit terror offences while on bail would not have been on bail for terror offences or anything in the same category of seriousness
' if there was any clue to the court granting bail that there was a risk of something of this nature , bail would not have been granted
' there 's a presumption that bail must be sought in all cases except the most serious
the idea of someone having their liberty taken away on suspicion of a minor offence is seen as unconstitutional
' david green , director of the think - tank civitas , said : ' the impression the government is giving is that they are trying to save money by reducing the prison population by giving bail
' there are many reasons for not giving bail , but often they are very simply ignored by the courts
' magistrates , who are possibly under pressure to keep the prison population down , are endangering public safety for the sake of a few pounds
' a moj spokesman said : ' we have already changed the law to allow prosecutors to challenge a crown court bail decision where they feel a potentially dangerous prisoner could be bailed
' the overwhelming majority of people bailed do not re-offend and they are often given strict conditions such as tags and curfews
' jane was murdered by her ex-boyfriend jonathan vass while he was on bail for raping her the shock terror figures come just weeks after it was revealed that one in nine victims of murder or manslaughter were killed by someone on bail
clough , the father of 26 - year - old jane who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend jonathan vass while he was on bail for raping her , said the sheer scale of offences showed change was needed
mr clough , who runs the justice for jane campaign , said : ' victims ' rights of safety should come ahead of suspects ' liberties
' i do n't think the courts take bail seriously enough
judges should be held accountable and there should be consequences for poor decisions
' in just one year , there were 57 unlawful killings â more than one a week â by suspects allowed to walk free while awaiting trial for other crimes
offenders on bail also committed an average of two rapes a week and a sex assault on a child almost every two days
in one case a girl of 16 was raped by a pervert who was on bail following an attack on another teenager
critics said the figures proved that too many dangerous criminals were being released until their trial date â despite the risk to the community
tory mp mp , a member of the home affairs select committee , said : â these shocking figures indicate how important it is that our judges remember that before granting a suspect bail they consider the risk posed to the general public , including children
this is a truly terrible toll
â there were 125 rapes by those on bail from june 2011 to june 2012 , with this figure falling to 101 and 81 in the two following years
the number of sex offences against children by those on bail stands at 134 in the last year the moj could provide figures for , falling from 182 three years ago
meanwhile more than 22,000 violent crimes were committed on bail in the last three years
the figures include the appalling case of patrick sallabank , a jobless misfit , who was out on bail for the alleged rape of a girl of 16 when he raped a second teenager in october 2013
he was handed an 18 - year jail sentence at hull crown court last february .
