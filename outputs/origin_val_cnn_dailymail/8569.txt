just for a moment , when he gained a thin edge to an attempted pull off pakistan ' s sohail khan in auckland , it was possible to believe that ab de villiers was human after all
all other evidence suggests the south african known as ab de villiers is some kind of super power , a man so talented in so many sports that cricket was blessed when he decided to make taking one - day batting to another , exalted level his destiny
nothing sums up england 's out - dated methods at this otherwise expansive cricket world cup than to watch the extraordinary de villiers going about his work

we are lucky he is a cricketer at all
de villiers grew up in pretoria playing hockey , football , rugby , tennis and badminton to international standard at age - group level while also being an accomplished sprinter and swimmer
these days , in his spare time , he plays golf off scratch on top of being an all - round cricketer who keeps wicket , bowls and fields to a high level for his country as well as indisputably the best limited - overs batsman in the world
give him the throne of albania and he would surpass even the legendary cb fry
mitch marsh celebrates after taking the wicket of morgan during the 2015 cricket world cup match de villiers looks on after the dismissal of teammate rilee rossouw during the match at eden park and those who have suggested the current england team may be a bit too nice to succeed in this tournament might like to note that it is hard to find anyone with a bad word to say about de villiers
perhaps the suggestion of a receding hair - line , at the age of 31 , is his only nod towards mortality
de villiers has been around for 10 years now at the highest level but it is with two particular innings in the last two months that he has breathed life into the 50 - over format and re-written the rules on what can be possible
first , against the west indies in johannesburg in january , de villiers reached three figures in just 31 balls , going from nought to a hundred in 40 minutes and smashing 16 sixes , the same number as india 's rohit sharma during his record - breaking 264 against sri lanka

de villiers now holds the records for the fastest 50 , 100 and 150 in one - day international history
south africa , at one stage looking set for a total of around 270 , instead made the small matter of 408 for five
de villiers does not look particularly powerful , as chris gayle does , nor stocky and pugnacious like david warner and aaron finch
there is plenty that is orthodox about his methods but also an incredible ability to hit full - length balls outside of off - stump to the leg - side for six
when he is in full flow he is a joy to behold and for a while , against pakistan on saturday , he looked capable of winning the match on his own until that thin edge saw his side consigned to defeat
south africa are a notoriously fragile tournament team but in their captain they have a man capable of taking them all the way to the final
joe root leaves the field after being dismissed during the cricket world cup match between england and sri lanka a younis khan talks to ab de villiers during the cricket world cup match between south africa and pakistan the lesson for england to absorb is that the pioneers of this new impossible is nothing brand of one - day cricket are basically playing twenty20 over 50 overs
even now , while all evidence points to a different approach , they still prefer to treat a one - day international as a shortened test innings
they do have the players capable of doing it the modern way , that 's the frustration of england 's cricket world cup so far
none more so than buttler , whose eyes positively lit up when asked if the cricket world cup had been exciting him
' definitely , ' said buttler
' ab de villiers is i someone i look at who has played some amazing knocks
the introduction of the ipl and twenty20 , people are coming up with things and the hitting at the end is nothing short of spectacular
england coach peter moores looks on during the cricket world cup match between england and sri lanka steyn celebrates with de villiers and the team after taking a catch to dismiss ahmad shahzad of pakistan ' as a fan of cricket you watch these guys perform at the top of their profession and you take a step back and enjoy it
de villiers has been fantastic to watch
brendon mccullum faced two guys who were bowling at 90 miles per hour ( against australia ) and was swinging even harder
there 's been some great moments as a fan to sit and watch and enjoy
' sadly not many of them have involved england but what comes next is clear , whether they scrape into the knockout stages or not
england simply have to rip it up and start again in one - day cricket and build a new side around the likes of buttler , joe root , moeen ali and those coming through like jason roy and sam billings
de villiers has shown what is possible
now england have to play catch up
