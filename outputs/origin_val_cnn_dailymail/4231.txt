a row of curvaceous figures sit stiffly on a bench , each one with a perfectly made up face and dressed in a clinging fishnet bodystocking
but these eerily pneumatic ' women ' are in fact realistic dolls , designed , moulded and painted to fulfill the every desire of customers around europe
and making the 5,500 euro ( Â£ 4,000 ) dolls , which weigh just 40kg , is just all in a day 's work for three people at the dreamdoll workshop , in duppigheim , northern france
the dreamdolls website describes their products as ' a range of realistic dolls of a quality and an exceptional beauty '
but it declares that although ' planned for sexual use ' the ' lovedolls ' are ' also used as realistic mannequins for photo studios for the catalogues of lingerie '
the company also insists that many of their customers are collectors who see the plastic models as works of art. each custom - made doll which makes up the more expensive us edition range takes them a week to make , from pouring the stain - proof and non-stick silicone into moulds to painting on layers of make - up
eric checks a silicone doll for imperfections after it 's been released from its mould fresh out of its mould , a mannequin is tested for flexibility and flaws before going to the next stage with their ears glued to their heads , employee raphaela does her bit to make the dolls look more human once the figure is released from the mould , eric checks the mannequin for imperfections and flexibility before the human details are added
raphaela pops the glass eyes into the sockets , and glues the separately moulded silicone ears to the side of the mannequin 's head
she also has the job of hand - painting the dolls ' faces , adding glossy red or plum - coloured lipstick , creating come - hither smoky eyes and adding polish to its nails
the us edition consists of four models : angela ( long blonde hair and blue eyes ) , dã©sirã©e ( long black hair and blue eyes ) , ginger ( short red hair and green eyes ) and scarlet ( long brown hair and green eyes )
each one is just over five feet tall , and breast size and skin colour can be changed to suit the customer
all the moulded silicone ears are placed in a box , to be glued to the mannequins ' heads raphaela draws on smoky eye make - up on to one mannequin , made of silicone over an aluminium frame this large - breasted dummy is given an extra layer of blusher by raphaela before being sent out these mannequins are ready to have their synthetic hair applied to add another element of realism the dolls also come with an internal heating system - which the company points out must be turned off before washing
other models can be varied , with a range of skin , eye colour and cup sizes ranging from a c to an ee breast size
the company 's owner thierry will even add the finishing touches , brushing the synthetic hair , or adjusting the dream dolls ' outfits
then dressed , wrapped in clear plastic and bubble wrap , they 're arranged sitting upright on a stool inside a specially - built case and shipped out to customers
