who will remember that score now ? â we sneaked in under the radar , but i âll be more excited about an fa cup semi-final nearer the time , â revealed a dead - pan steve clarke
it was hardly champagne popping stuff , but that is steve clarke âs nature after a coaching career that has also taken him to newcastle , chelsea and west brom
he left the celebrations to the fans
by the end this place was raucous , with jubilant reading supporters spilling on to the pitch at the final whistle
a spine - tingling opening ten minutes had seen a goal from former arsenal trainee hal robson-kanu and another from winger garath mccleary put reading in command
jamie mackie âs strike in the 68th minute was reward for his endeavour , a fabulous finish after locking on to nathaniel chalobah âs delayed pass
by then bradford city were down to ten men , chasing shadows after filipe morais was sent off for raking his studs down the body of chalobah
the sharpest minds were in reading âs team , with the soothing voice of captain alex pearce at the back containing and nullifying the threat of stead and hanson
on a night like this you have to feel for bradford city âs fans , delayed in traffic for hours on the way to the madejski stadium
in the end parkinson âs team never got out of first gear
â are you chelsea in disguise ? â sang bradford city âs fans , hoping beyond hope for a comeback similar to the one they experienced at stamford bridge last month
it was there that they beat premier league leaders chelsea 4 - 2 , recording one of the greatest fa cup shocks of all time
they needed one more super-human effort , calling on gary liddle , billy knott , stead and hanson to provide the resistance against this rampant reading team
reading went in front after six minutes and it is here that the romance begins for hal robson-kanu as he prepares to play his former club on the game âs biggest stage
the winger was released from arsenal in 2004 , the year the invincibles went an entire season unbeaten on the way to clinching the premier league title

here nobody could touch hal robson-kanu and he beat bradford city captain stephen darby at the near post to put reading in front with a terrific header from eight yards
the place erupted as reading took control
three minutes later they scored again
garath mccleary darted in from the right and when his shot took a deflection off the leg of andy halliday , the ball looped beyond the hands of bradford city keeper ben williams
it shattered parkinson âs dreams , his formation splintered by the class of danny williams and chalobah in the centre of reading âs midfield
