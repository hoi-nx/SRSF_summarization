a frenchman court has ruled that that it has jurisdiction to judge a case against facebook , after the united states - based social network blocked a man 's account for posting a painting of a woman 's genitals
the frenchman , a teacher and a father - of - three , posted an explicit 19th - century oil painting depicting the lower half of a naked woman in 2011 , and was subsequently blocked
the man sued facebook that year , but lawyers representing the social network has argued that it does not fall under frenchman jurisdiction
blocked account : the frenchman , a teacher and father - of - three , was blocked after posting an image of gustave coubet 's painting the origin of the world on his facebook account the unnamed man had posted an image of gustave coubet 's painting the origin of the world on the social networking site four years ago
he claims he missed messages and ' social contact ' from his 800 facebook friends when the page was taken down on the eve of his birthday on february 27 , 2011
at the time , the unnamed man 's lawyer cottineau said repeated emails to the california based company demanding the page be reinstated had also gone unanswered
he added : ' this blind censorship and refusal to reply to emails suggests he is not worthy of their attention and is someone who has acted immorally or illegally
' deleting his account is a breach of his human rights , which guarantees my client 's freedom of expression
frenchman rules : the paris court has ruled that that it does have jurisdiction to judge a case against facebook , despite the united states - based social network arguing it has to be done in california ' it is also in breach of his rights as a consumer under frenchman law
' earlier this year , facebook 's lawyer caroline lyannaz argued that the site did not fall under frenchman jurisdiction as users have to sign a clause agreeing that only a california court can rule in disputes relating to the firm
facebook 's rules state users ' will not post content that is hateful , threatening , or pornographic , or that incites violence , or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence
' however , a paris court ruled yesterday that facebook 's clause forcing all users to agree that any litigation must be based in the united states state , where the site is based , was ' abusive '
mr cottineau hailed the court ruling as a ' first victory won by david against goliath '
' this decision will create jurisprudence for other social media and other internet giants who use their being headquartered abroad , mainly in the united states , to attempt to evade frenchman law
' the lawyer said this was an ' abusive clause ' as none of the 22 million facebook users in frenchman ' can ever take recourse to frenchman legal jurisdiction in the event of a dispute
' facebook said it noted the judgement and was considering its response
the court will hear the case on may 21 .
