paying a player northwards of Â£ 100,000 a week to be an occasional impact sub off the bench is an expensive business , even for a side who have premier league title aspirations
and , judging by arsene wenger âs decision to leave him sat in his tracksuit throughout the entirety of the 2 - 1 victory over newcastle , walcott seems to have become just that at arsenal
indeed there was , for portions of this match , a sense that oliver giroud , alexis sanchez and danny welbeck could form a clinical strike force in the premier league for years to come â while walcott warmed up on the touchline
yet , even in the second half when things were not going right for arsenal and they needed a spark to reignite them , arsene wenger instead turned to tomas rosicky ahead of walcott to give some added impetus
and , as much as walcott will have enjoyed seeing his side keep the pressure up on second - placed manchester city , you ca nât help but feel the england forward must be contemplating lowering his reported wage demands if he wants to stay at the emirates
walcott has stalled on talks over a new deal with the winger wanting wages of over Â£ 100,000 a week the england international was left on the bench for the game against newcastle and did n't feature wojciech szczesny and walcott have both found their chances limited this for arsenal this season because , put simply , where do you fit him into this gunners side ? oliver giroud is on fire and is leading the line superbly â he has scored 11 goals in 12 premier league starts this season after his two at st james â â danny welbeck caused problems all afternoon , contributing an assist for the first and he also should have netted at least twice , while alexis sanchez , although visibly tired , was still able to produce that little bit of magic to keep the gunners on the front foot
walcott is not an automatic selection anymore , and therefore he can not be too ambitious with his wage demands
arsenal âs form is superb â they have won 14 of 16 games since new year âs day â and they have achieved that largely without walcott âs presence
the 26 - year - old â yes , he is really still that young â has started just three top - flight games all season after returning from injury , and the gunners have nât exactly missed him
2014/15 - all competitions 11 appearances ( 5 starts ) , 3 goals overall - all competitions 294 appearances ( 190 starts ) , 72 goals right now the gunners are playing with pace and panache â displayed perfectly when danny welbeck , alexis sanchez and aaron ramsey combined to take arsenal from one side of the field to the other , only for williamson to make a timely interception
this was just one example of when arsenal âs front men wreaked havoc in an awesome first - half display
yet , despite that , their goals at st james ' park came from a direct source
oliver giroud loves scoring against newcastle anyway , and now has eight in seven against them , but the way he calmly kneed in his first after danny welbeck âs flick - on highlights a player with confidence
his second was also a decent header , although he did nât even have to jump off the ground so feeble was the challenge offered up by williamson
unfortunately for walcott , height and an aerial presence will make oliver giroud first - choice centre forward every time
alexis sanchez ( left ) has been a revelation since signing for the club from barcelona in the summer oliver giroud ( 12 ) scored an impressive double at st james ' park to continue his excellent form despite returning from a serious injury , walcott has struggled to earn a place in arsene wenger 's starting 11 danny welbeck offers an abundance of pace and energy and can play anywhere across the front three , while alexis sanchez on his day is simply world class
they may not have been at their absolute best against newcastle , but they got the job done
but on saying all of that , if arsene wenger does not offer walcott a new deal then he risks losing a player with more than 200 games â worth of premier league experience and 47 strikes in england âs top flight to one of his rivals
is he really willing to risk that ? perhaps though , given walcott âs shocking injury record , arsene wenger thinks he has replaced one â w â for another â with the Â£ 16million acquisition of danny welbeck increasingly looking like a piece of shrewd business by the frenchman
will walcott or arsene wenger blink first in this latest of many contract disputes the england winger seems to have had with the club ? on the basis of saturday âs match , you get the impression the england striker may be knocking on the manager âs door with his tail between his legs sometime soon
danny welbeck ( right ) terrorised the newcastle defence with his pace and looks to be settling in well
