gerrard has been absent from liverpool 's last six matches with a hamstring injury but he could return in this weekend 's fa cup clash with blackburn having resumed training this week
but his manager says that with liverpool in a good run of form , gerrard will have to fight for a place in a side that has enjoyed success recently gerrard is back in training with liverpool , but he wo n't walk straight back into the team brendan rodgers says gerrard does not have a god - given right to return to the team straight away gerrard returned to training with liverpool at melwood after recovering from injury this week ' there is no - one in the squad who has a god - given right to walk straight into the team , ' brendan rodgers said
' it probably would be ( an issue ) for other people but certainly not for me and it would n't be for gerrard
' he is very much a team player and if he was on the bench because the team was in good form and playing well i think everyone respects that
' ' it would n't be significant for me or for him
if the team is in good form , there would n't be an issue
the most important thing is having gerrard available

let 's see how the season pans out
gerrard is one of the best players of all time in the premier league
' he has still got a couple of days to go and we will assess it
he is still with the rehabilitation team
the team is playing very well
to have him back available for selection is the most important thing
' brendan rodgers brushed off comparisons between gerrard and his vice-captain henderson after the former sunderland midfielder scored against manchester city and burnley
' jordan is a wonderful player , a different player , ' he said
' because he shoots from outside the box does n't mean he is the new gerrard
' his stature as a footballer is growing all the time
he is already a first class footballer but he is going to go on and become even better
henderson has stood in as liverpool captain during gerrard 's absence and has scored twice in a week brendan rodgers did not want to label henderson as the ' next gerrard ' but talked up his development ' he is vice-captain and has a wonderful role model in gerrard but i would ask every young player to follow gerrard by example because he is an incredible professional and football player
' his stature as a footballer is certainly growing all the time and that is because of his performance level
' he assists goals , he scores goals , and for me he is just improving every single day
his tactical understanding of systems is developing and he will go on over the next few years
' he really is a first - class footballer but i think at a big club he will go on and show what a top player he is
