netty edwards , 46 , was left distraught after being told she had to drop out of the spen 20 road race in spenborough , yorkshire , because the race ' was n't for people like her ' and that marshals would n't wait for her to finish
the race organisers , spenborough & district athletics club , had not specified a cut - off time for the race in its terms and conditions , but the mother was apparently told to stop despite running at a pace of 12 minutes per mile
if she had been able to complete the race , she would 've finished in four hours if she had remained at the same pace
mrs netty edwards , from wakefield , yorkshire , who runs to work every day and has a host of medals from previous races she has completed - including the great north west half marathon - was left in tears at the decision
she immediately took to social media to vent her frustration , writing : ' well this a first â¦ 1 and a half miles in and pulled off the course for being too slow lead marshal says his team r not to stay out as long as it 's going to take me ! ! ! ! ! ( sic )
' he cycled up to me and says u r way behind u r far too slow
it 's not for ppl like u ( sic )
' she later posted a photograph of all the medals she has previously received from completing races alongside the message : ' well they might not be fast times but all well and truly earned â¦ did n't soddin want ye medal anyway # spen20 ( sic )
' she claims a marshal cycled up to her as she approached the 1.5 mile stage of the race on sunday and told her to stop
the race , which had up to 400 entrants , costs Â£ 11 to enter
hundreds of people have now taken to social media to condemn the race organisers and support mrs netty edwards â who is a keen charity runner
paula wilson said : ' she was told to stop running as she was too slow 12min mile pace
i would n't say was slow
' sarah hamilton said : ' i 'm so mad on # nettyedwards behalf
# thisgirlcan & this girl should 've been left alone to get on with her run
shame on you # spenboroughac
' and sarah browne added : ' # spen20 horrible treatment of the awesome # nettyedwards today & so discouraging to anyone ' slow '
' the mother took to facebook to vent her frustration after allegedly being told by a race organiser that she was ' too slow ' at 12 minutes per mile and that race marshals would n't wait for her to complete the race the keen runner posted a photograph on facebook of all the medals she has received by completing races over the years ( pictured ) , including several for charity races and the great north west half marathon mrs netty edwards said the pace should n't matter and that it is the taking part that counts
she said she runs to and from work every day in wakefield , yorkshire , and has previously raised money for charity by running however , despite the support , one racegoer and organiser responded by claiming it is standard practice to pull people from the race if they are too slow
ian ogden replied to mrs edward 's post online and said : ' i believe you were aware that you could start earlier but decided not to it is standard practice for race organisers to withdraw marhsalls at a cut - off point 12/13 min miling as a runner that has done many distance races you must be aware of this
' he followed it up with another post which said : ' thanks for all the publicity you have created for our fantastic event
' netty edwards i 'm sure it will ensure our race goes from strength to strength and you will be welcome back next year now that you are aware that starting early is the best option by the way we are a really friendly club that caters for all abilities ( sic )
reddington , of spenborough & district athletics club which organised the spen 20 race , said : ' i am sorry that the day was spoiled for annette
' the race is a well established mainly club runners event and while we are accommodating a level of slower runners who enter , we do not have the resources to facilitate people who do not have a reasonable level of fitness to take part in this race
' mr reddington confirmed that mrs netty edwards had her entry fee refunded .
