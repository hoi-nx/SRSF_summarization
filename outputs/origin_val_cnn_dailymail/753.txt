members of the new york police department have been caught editing the wikipedia pages of police brutality victims
computers being used inside police headquarters at 1 police plaza changed the entries of bell , an unarmed man shot dead in 2006 ; amadou diallo , who was shot dead when police mistook his wallet for a gun in 1999 ; and garner , the staten island man killed last july in a police chokehold
an individual also changed the entry for the british alternative chumbawamba , swapping out three of the band 's members with members of the police department
the garner entry seems to have been edited the most , with numerous changes made on the page
' garner raised both his arms in the air ' was edited to say ' garner flailed his arms about as he spoke ' and ' use of the chokehold has been prohibited ' became ' use of the chokehold is legal , but has been prohibited
' a sentence was also added to say that garner was bigger than the officers on the scene
as for bell , who was shot dead on november 25 , 2006 by undercover officers at his bachelor party the night before his wedding despite being unarmed , his entry was not only edited but there was also an attempt to have it removed completely
on the articles for deletion page , someone from the department wrote , ' he [ bell ] was in the news for about two months , and now no one except al sharpton cares anymore
the police shoot people every day , and times with a lot more than 50 bullets
this incident is more news than notable
' the entry was not removed
an individual also changed the entry for the british alternative chumbawamba , swapping out three of the band 's members with members of the police department information about new york police department officer kenneth boss was changed on the page of diallo , saying that the cop shot an ' armed ' and not an ' unarmed ' man in a previous incident
none of the cops involved in any of these three incidents were found guilty of any charges
' the matter is under internal review , ' new york police department spokeswoman det
cheryl crispin said about the edits .
