an extra 500 free schools will be opened by 2020 under a conservative party government , cameron announced today
the prime minister promised a major expansion of the policy which allows schools to be set up by community groups including parents , charities or teachers
but education secretary nicky morgan revealed she had blocked plans to allow profit - making in schools , which predecessor michael gove had advocated
cameron talks with school children during a visit to the green school for girls in west london today free schools were introduced in 2010 to allow parents and community groups to set up their own schools
they are independent from local authorities but must still undergo ofsted inspections
supporters say they help to drive up standards by creating competition with existing schools , but labour has opposed their creation in areas with a surplus of places where they are not needed
the new plan to open at least 500 of the schools by 2020 mean an extra 270,000 places
in a speech in london , mr cameron said : ' if you vote conservative party , you will see the continuation of the free schools programme at the rate you 've seen in the last three years
' that means , over the next parliament , we hope to open at least 500 new free schools resulting in 270,000 new school places
' remember - we 're the only party that is committed to this
the only party that 's opening up the education system so we can get more good places for your children
' and is n't that what every parent wants - a great education for their child ? you deserve the security of knowing your child is getting just that
and with the conservative party you should expect nothing less
' he also backed the idea of existing grammar schools
taking questions from the audience , mr cameron was asked about comments he made in 2007 that a ' pledge to build more grammar schools would be an electoral albatross '
he insisted : ' i have never said that grammar schools are an albatross , grammar schools are good schools and i like good schools
i want there to be good schools for people to send their children to
' what i 've said about grammar schools is , like other schools that are good , if they want to expand they should be able to expand
i have been very consistent about that
' the prime minister was joined by the education secretary nicky morgan ( left ) during a visit to the green school for girls in west london mr cameron said his party would pledge five hundred new free schools if the conservative party win the general election in may it comes as the government announces that 49 more schools have been given the go - ahead , taking the total created under the coalition to more than 400
mrs morgan , the nicky morgan , said : ' free schools give pupils the chance to attend an excellent local school
' they are providing more choice than ever before to parents and ensuring that children have access to a high - quality school place and the best possible education that prepares them for life in modern britain
' ms morgan said she wanted each school to ' make the right choice for them ' about whether to become a free school or academy
asked if she could rule out a tories government allowing free schools to make a profit , she told bbc radio 4 's today programme : ' yes i can rule it out , i think having for profit education is something that would make me feel very uncomfortable and it is not something that is needed
' we have excellent sponsors like charities and others or parent groups wanting to run schools and they are doing an excellent job up and down the country
' free schools were introduced in 2010 to allow parents and community groups to set up their own schools
they are independent from local authorities but must still undergo ofsted inspections mrs morgan 's insistence that there would be no profit - making schools for the whole of the next parliament suggests a shift in policy from her predecessor
mr michael gove , who lost his job as nicky morgan in july , had advocated allowing profit - making to encourage companies to set up successful free schools
in may 2012 he said : ' it 's my belief that we could move to that situation but at the moment it 's important to recognise that the free schools movement is succeeding without that element and i think we should cross that bridge when we come to it
' labour has criticised the free schools policy , claiming it can lead to money being channelled to areas where there is a surplus of school places instead of being targeted at areas where classes are overcrowded
mr cameron 's plans for an expansion of free schools came as a report by the centre - right think tank policy exchange claimed they are raising standards for all pupils in areas where they open , even for children who do not attend them
the report suggested that the competitive effect created by a free school leads to improved academic standards in nearby under - performing schools
a liberal democrat spokesman said : ' this proposal simply masks the deep cuts the tories are planning for education
their scorched - earth policy for public services would mean that funding for nurseries , schools and colleges could be slashed by a quarter by 2020
' chris keates , general secretary of the nasuwt union , said : ' it is clear that if elected the conservative party will continue its obsessive ideological focus on structural change
' it is scandalous that in the context where the conservative party is proposing even deeper cuts to funding post the general election , it still plans to pour millions of pounds into free schools
' there is no evidence that structural change raises educational standards
