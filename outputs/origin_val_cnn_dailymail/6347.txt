cameron was heckled and mocked by an audience of elderly voters he was hoping to convince to vote for the conservatives
pensioners shouted â rubbish â , â lies â , and â answer the question â - and one waved his walking stick at the prime minister - as he was challenged about spending on social care and agency workers employed by the nhs
mr cameron had given a speech outlining his commitment to annual rises in the state pension , protecting the health budget and entitlements to free tv licences and bus passes
but in a combative question and answer session , many of the pensioners were deeply unimpressed by his answers
clemo , 86 , was angry at not getting a â straight answer â after he asked mr cameron what he would do about the number of nhs doctors and nurses leaving to work for agencies for higher salaries
mr cameron said it was a â difficult issue â as hospitals hired agency staff to deal with extra pressure , particularly on a&e departments
â the truth of it , sir , is that well - run hospitals are less reliant on agency staff â the prime minister said
â we need to make sure all hospitals copy the best hospitals that are less reliant on agency staff
â he tried to move on , but mr clemo , a retired garage owner from warrington who is a governor of his local hospital , replied : â excuse me , you have nât answered my question â and repeated it
mr cameron said that he could not stop health service staff looking for a â better deal â , to jeers and cries of â rubbish â and â answer the question â from the audience
the prime minister pleaded : â i am answering the question , i do nât want to ban agency nurses as then hospitals that were struggling would nât be able to get hold of them
â it was revealed earlier this week that hospitals are paying locum doctors up to Â£ 3,200 a shift â of which a substantial cut goes to the agency
nhs trusts spent Â£ 1.2bn on agency staff in 2013 - 14 â with agency nurses being paid up to Â£ 160 an hour to make up for staff shortages in a&e
pensioners shouted â rubbish â , â lies â , and â answer the question â - and one waved his walking stick at the prime minister - as he was challenged about spending on social care and agency workers employed by the nhs cameron had given a speech outlining his commitment to annual rises in the state pension , protecting the health budget and entitlements to free tv licences and bus passes before meeting with audience members mr clemo , said afterwards that without action to stop agency staff being paid double the rate of normal staff his local hospital â will be bankrupt in two years â
he said : â the agencies are getting mega-rich out of fleecing the hospital
it is ruining the nhs
â he said he had voted tory and labour in the past , and added â he would have won me back if he had answered my question â
andrews , 91 , was called on after waving his walking stick at the prime minister
he said older people had to deal with too many departments and agencies and were often â given the run - around â
â i would like a minister at cabinet level to coordinate all these agencies that make these decisions in isolation â , he said
â we deserve the same recognition you give to children â , to shouts of â hear , hear â
mr cameron said older people should be a priority for â all ministers â , to loud groans from the audience
the prime minister added : â if you are not satisfied with how elderly people are being looked after and valued by this government , do nât blame other ministers , blame me â , he said
several people shouted back at him , â we do â
his appearance at the meeting in central london yesterday was mocked on social media â coming a day after mr cameron announced his retirement , by saying he would not seek a third term in office
commenters on twitter said he had bruised by â leaving the westminster bubble â and that he had â aged five years â in the process
earlier this week , cameron announced he would not bid for a third term if he is successful in may 's general election
he has since insisted he is taking ' nothing for granted ' and his focus is on beating ' ed miliband ' mr andrews , a retired manager at a distilling firm , runs the nottingham elders â forum , a small charity which helps older people drive improvements to local services
he said afterwards that he was â non-political â , but that mr cameron âs government had â not really â done a lot for pensioners
he said : â i contributed for 40 years for my old age pension , and they talk about it as a benefit â , he said
â it âs not a benefit , i âve paid in for it
they say it âs gone up by 5 per cent , well 5 per cent increase on nothing is nothing
it âs still only Â£ 113 a week
â another audience member , who did not give his name , asked mr cameron for a â cast iron guarantee â that spending on health and social care were â safe at the present level â if he was elected
mr cameron said â yes â , but shouts of â lies â and â it âs not true â were heard from the audience
mr cameron said : â we âve put an extra Â£ 12.7billion into the nhs in this parliament
we have promised not to cut it , we will put more money into the nhs every year that i am prime minister
â maureen childs , of the green party âs pensioners group accused mr cameron of wanting to introduce health insurance and â we want the nhs as it used to be â free at the point of use â
mr cameron insisted : â it is free at the point of use â
the rally was addressed by politicians from all the major parties
the prime minister â who said he was the only party leader to come to the conference - tried to put a brave face on the event saying it had been â fun â and thanked the pensioners for their â lively interactions â .
