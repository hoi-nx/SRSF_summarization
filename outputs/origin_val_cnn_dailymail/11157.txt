' we 're not saying liberals are happier , they behave happier , ' said study co-author ditto , a professor of psychology at the university of california irvine
' but conservatives report being happier

he looked at other indicators of happiness : words and facial expressions
the researchers examined 18 years and 432 million words of speeches in the congressional record , concentrating on 2013

for a laughing rep. gerry connolly , d-va. , this rings true : ' a lot of what seems to fuel republicans energy is anger - based
they 're angry about iran
they 're angry about obama
... and you hear that on the floor constantly
' that 's not the feeling at the office of rep. dana rohrabacher , r-calif. , where a sign above the congressman 's door reads ' fighting for freedom and having fun
' his spokesman ken grubbs said , ' a day at the office here ... is never without lots of laughs
' political scientist jack pitney said the wojcik study was so off kilter that it seemed to be a parody , adding ' i do n't think too many people will take this seriously
' a professor at claremont mckenna college , he had many questions about the way the study was conducted and said conservatives in general want less government so this would be reflected in the language they use when talking about government
one study team member , who initially was n't told what the project was about , examined congressional portraits to rate their facial emotions , an accepted technique in psychology
democrats and republicans had similar smiles around the mouth , but the more telling features for happiness are the muscles around the eyes and there democrats looked cheerier , wojcik said
he also found more positive language â and emoticon use â in tweets from people who followed only democrats twitter accounts versus only republicans account followers

for a laughing rep. gerry connolly , d-virginia , the study rings true
several outside psychology experts told the associated press that while it was interesting , they did n't find the study convincing
they faulted some techniques , did not see a significant difference between the two ideologies ' scores and they criticized the researchers for mixing long - term happiness in self - reporting with momentary good moods in pictures and language
' the observed differences are quite small , ' said robert emmons of the university of california at davis
' happiness is the norm for both ' democrats and republicans
