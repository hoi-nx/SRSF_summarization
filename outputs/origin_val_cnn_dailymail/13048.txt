brisbane bras hang from the antlers of a pair of moose heads above the bar inside an old music hall
dim red light shines on classic leather booths
you push through a crowd dancing to a live rockabilly band and head to the toilet , tipsy
then something weird happens -- you exit the washroom and find yourself in a different bar
the early 1900s dance hall with chandeliers has vanished
suddenly , you 're in a whimsical bar with a pirate serving drinks
no , you have n't had too much to drink and the washroom is n't a passageway through a time - space continuum
you 've simply stepped into the maritime - themed mermaid bar
inside lefty 's old time music hall , the mermaid bar is an example of the latest nightlife trend in brisbane -- hidden bars
sultry old days " we actually did n't mean to turn the mermaid into a secret bar , " says dwyer , general manager of lefty 's
" we were just lazy and did n't publicize it
" the story behind the hidden bar takes in a bit of sultry local history
before lefty 's moved in , the building was occupied by the velvet cigar , a longtime strip club
webb , owner of local restaurant peasant and cabiria , took over the place and renovated it , preserving some of the old establishment 's bawdy touches
" we loved the mirror too much to take it down , " says webb , referring to the long mirror that still runs the length of one wall
" it used to be in front of the dance floor for the girls , but we turned the dance floor into booths
" " if you look at the floor , you can still see some of the holes where dancing poles used to be , " says dwyer
a list of prices for services rendered by different girls still hangs inside the toilet
the bar counter upstairs is where customers once paid for extra services from dancers before entering a small room ( now the mermaid bar , which sells beer in cans )
mermaid bar : secret escape " there are actually three entrances to the mermaid bar , " says webb of the hidden bar
" it 's my favorite place
it 's a lot of loud fun out there at lefty 's sometimes , and the mermaid is like my escape
" the small mermaid is bright , with light shining through the windows
sharks hang from the ceiling and paintings of mermaids adorn the walls
people love the mermaid for different reasons
" some like the bartender dressed up as a pirate , " says dwyer
" some say it 's the cannon on the pirate ship model behind the bar
" that pirate bartender , dean moready , says the apple rum made from fresh - pressed apple juice is the real crowd - pleaser
about those bras on the moose antlers while the mermaid is a rum bar , lefty 's is a whiskey bar -- each has about 100 varieties of rum or whiskey , and a food menu
three bands usually perform each night at lefty 's and the bar always gets busy after 9 p.m. so what 's up with the bras on the moose heads ? " i once dared a customer on a hen night to sling a bra to the horn to win a free shot , " says webb
" she did and it has become a tradition ever since
" " we have a strict bra - only policy
