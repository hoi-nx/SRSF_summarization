on the walls inside are t - shirts emblazoned with obscene gestures and signs that say ' i hate being sober
' additionally , amnesia was staying open until 5am thanks to its church status , which is not under the city ordinance that clubs and bars close at 2am
this led sowell to change the tax exempt status
' a bottle club , charging $ 20 at the door and selling obscene t - shirts is not being used as a church , ' sowell said
' a god - fearing , god - honoring church in january does not sponsor this type of debauchery in march
' bishop , the former pastor at faith christian family church , is the owner of the building

the rulings were mostly in favor of bishop , but he has allagedly changed the tax status of the property
the issue for authorities is n't so much the parties themselves , but the fact that the church continues to not pay property taxes as a religious buildings despite holding several club - like events
