england 's woeful showing at the cricket world cup in australian might make you feel sick , but it 's the performance of an ex-england star that is turning stomach 's down under
flintoff was always known as a brave sportsman , whether with the bat or ball , or even in his short - lived career as a boxer , but flintoff is showing a new type of bravery as he takes part in the australian version of i 'm a celebrity ... get me out of here
the former england all - rounder took part in a ' tuker trial ' on tuesday , and completed it by eating a cockroach with such nonchalance that the show 's presenter ended up vomiting
the cheeky ex-cricketer was given the task of devouring seven courses of critters , and as chris brown watched on he could n't hide his unease
putting his good table etiquette on show , the 37 - year - old picked up the at least two inch long insect on chopsticks and tried to psych himself up about eating it
' i 'm going to do it and i 'm going to crunch it and enjoy it , ' he said to himself before he chomped down hard
flintoff happily chewed the live cockroach , before expressing his disgust at the taste of the insect flintoff 's meal caused the show 's host dr chris brown to lose his lunch the crunch was heard echoing throughout the jungle , while flintoff sat back on his chair like he 'd just bit down on a t - bone steak at a michelin star restaurant
but it was n't long before he acknowledged the true extent of the disgusting encounter
' oh the back end ! jesus ... it 's horrible ! ' flintoff roared
showing of his veterinary skills , chris brown , 36 , knew exactly why flintoff was having such an issue with ' the back end '
' that 's a female ... the white stuff inside your mouth is the egg sack of the cockroach ... it 's her eggs , ' dr chris brown told him as he held one hand over his mouth and clutched his stomach
unable to handle watching flintoff crunch down on the critters , chris brown keeled over and started dry retching
he then had to walk away from the challenge to vomit in the bushes
' oh the back end ! jesus ... it 's horrible ! ' flintoff roared as he showed his competitive streak the show 's host dr chris brown had to walk away from the challenge to vomit in the bushes
