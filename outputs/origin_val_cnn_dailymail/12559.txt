london best - selling british fantasy author terry has died at the age of 66 , his website said thursday
terry , who wrote more than 70 books , including those in his " discworld " series , had been diagnosed with a rare form of alzheimer 's disease in 2007
a statement on the website announced the news of his death at home thursday with " immeasurable sadness
" " i was deeply saddened to learn that sir terry has died
the world has lost one of its brightest , sharpest minds , " said larry finlay , managing director at transworld publishers
" in over 70 books , terry enriched the planet like few before him
as all who read him know , ' discworld ' was his vehicle to satirize this world : he did so brilliantly , with great skill , enormous humor and constant invention
" terry continued to write following his diagnosis , completing his last book , a new discworld novel , in the summer of 2014
revealing his illness in 2007 , the author -- who had a strong following among fans of fantasy fiction -- said he had been diagnosed with " a very rare form of early onset alzheimer , " which he described as " an embuggerance
" he said then , " frankly , i would prefer it if people kept things cheerful , because i think there 's time for at least a few more books yet
" according to thursday 's statement , he had posterior cortical atrophy , a progressive degenerative condition involving the loss and dysfunction of brain cells , particularly at the back of the brain
the last posts on his verified twitter account , run by terry with close friend rob wilkins , give a poignant farewell -- and have already been retweeted thousands of times
" at last , terry , we must walk together , " the first tweet in the series reads -- an apparent reference to death , a recurring and generally sympathetic character in the discworld books , who always speaks in all caps
" terry took death 's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night
" jeremy hughes , chief executive of the alzheimer 's society , a charitable organization , said terry -- who spoke out publicly about his condition and called for greater funding for alzheimer 's research -- had " fundamentally changed the way dementia is seen and understood
" " his vehement determination to reduce the stigma of dementia meant he helped drag it out of the shadows -- kicking and screaming at times , " he said
" shouting from the rooftops about the absurdity of how little funding dementia research receives , and fighting for good quality dementia care , he was and will remain the truest of champions for people with the condition
" terry was also a patron of the british humanist association , which paid tribute thursday to the humor and dedication with which the author " turned his suffering into a positive campaign
" terry , who began writing while a provincial newspaper journalist in the 1960s , became a full time writer in 1987 and received the order of the british empire " for services to literature " from prince charles in 1998
