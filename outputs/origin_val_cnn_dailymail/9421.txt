a dog walker who spent two years thinking he owned a Â£ 100,000 piece of rare whale vomit has discovered the pungent rock is actually worthless
wilman thought he had found ' floating gold ' when he stumbled across what he believed was a 3kg lump of the highly sought - after ambergris on the beach in morecambe , lancs
but his dream of netting a small fortune has now been shattered after an expert in the u.s revealed the ' stone ' is not authentic ambergris - and has absolutely no value
the substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water , where it hardens and develops into a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell
it is this aromatic quality which makes it is used in perfumes such as chanel number 5
mr wilman said : ' if i had my time over again , i would kick the rock to one side and walk away
i wish i 'd never found it
i 've got to accept what happened and get on with it
' the 52 - year - old was walking his boxer dog madge along the beach in january 2013 when he stumbled across what he believed to be the rare item
the highly sought - after ambergris , or ' grey amber ' , is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales , which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem ( file picture ) ambergris is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales , which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem
the substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water , where it hardens and develops its distinctive odour
the decades of floating and exposure to sun and salt will then turn the matter into ambergris , a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell
it is that quality which means it is highly sought - after with perfume makers , who use it to prolong the scent of perfume
although ambergris is still an ingredient in perfumes today , producers usually remove it from their product because of the legal ambiguities surrounding its use
as it comes from sperm whale , which is classed as a vulnerable species , cosmetic companies tend to shun using it because it is associated with whaling
but the sweet - smelling sick has been used in a variety of other ways throughout history
ancient egyptians reportedly found a use for it by burning ambergris as incense
the country still uses it today for scenting cigarettes
during the black death in europe , worried people also thought they could thwart the plague by carrying a ball of ambergris because the vomit masked the smell , which they thought was the root of the illness
it is rarely found on british beaches , usually being washed up in u.s and australian
a french dealer offered him 50,000 euros if it turned out to be real , while some experts said it could be worth double that quote
but the true value of the stone was discovered when documentary maker peregrine -- who produced a radio 4 show called wilman , madge and the strange rock following the find - sent a sample to an expert across the atlantic
christopher kemp , an u.s author who wrote a book about ambergris , then broke the news that it was definitely not whale vomit
to add to mr wilman 's heartbreak , his beloved dog has also passed away since he made the discovery
mr peregrine said : ' he ( christopher kemp ) emailed me back and said it 's definitely not ambergris , although he did n't know what it was
' then i had a text from wilman telling me madge had died
he was in complete shock and then i had to tell him it was n't real ambergris
' mr peregrine has since contacted a dealer in new zealand who has promised to send mr wilman a 2g piece of real ambergris
although it is virtually worthless , mr wilman is delighted at the gesture
he said : ' when peregrine told me , i nearly broke down
i cant believe there are nice people in the world , like this lady , who feels sorry for me and wants to send me a piece of ambergris
' i 've kept a level head about things and i 'm trying to find humour in the situation
' although it is rarely found on british beaches , eight - year - old charlie naysmith discovered a 600g piece after taking a stroll along hengistbury head , near bournemouth in 2012
beachcombers sean kane and , 24 , and ian foster , 39 , also discovered a 110lb of whale vomit washed up on the beach in criccieth , north wales , in 2008
in 2006 a couple walking on an australian beach found a 32 - pound chunk of ambergris , which netted them $ 295,000 ( Â£ 155,000 ) .
