' at no point can you ever see a full length view of the person ... you might see a face ... then a leg ... or a butt ... but there is no full length view , ' hochmuth said
marsh said the quality of the videos is irrelevant because they were made without consent and that they were explicit
' the videos consist of ... undressing for the shower and drying off from the shower , ' he said
the hearing was presided over by a naval officer , who listened to statements from both sides and will issue a recommendation to rear admiral richard , commander of submarine group 10
richard will decide whether to pursue court martial trials against the defendants , dismiss the charges , or use other administrative methods to deal with the cases .
