she flourished at school where she was tipped for straight a grades at gcse and competed for head girl status
but when she was 14 her sister karly got in touch through facebook and said she wanted to meet
the pair did so and as they grew closer and began having contact with their biological mother gaynor rothwell
at one stage she disappeared for three and the teenager 's behaviour deteriorated
she was later moved into foster care in november 2012
from march 2013 aleysha began running away from home for days at a time and would often be found with her 19 - year - old sister
the two even staged a ' rooftop protest ' on a care centre at one point in a bid to be housed closer together
the inquest heard that there had been numerous attempts by social workers to help the teenager , and her foster mother sharples had taken her to hospital after she took an overdose
mrs sharples added that on february 8 last year after enjoying a ' normal family night in ' with a takeaway , aleysha had gone to meet her sister
but shortly after the pair leaving she received a phone call from the police saying the pair had been caught trying to jump off a nearby bridge but were stopped before they had the chance
on april 2 last year mrs sharples received a call from st catherine 's academy in bolton saying the teenager had been self harming , and she took her to royal bolton hospital in greater manchester
mrs sharples told the inquest : ' i phoned the paramedics and they suggested we go
she was n't happy about going
she was assessed in a&e then sent to another bit of the hospital and the nurse also asked if she wanted to speak to someone while she was there
the teenager had been taken into care after she began getting into trouble with her sister ' surprisingly she said yes which is a massive step because she had refused up until then
a man from the raid team took her to a room and she was in there for one hour and ten minutes and i was n't allowed in
' he said she would n't engage
she said it was a waste of time and he said ' i was having a bad day '
' before she went to sleep she was really upset
i asked what she was crying for and she said ' i 'm sorry , you have been in the hospital with me for five - and - a - half hours , i 'm a pain in the bum
' i said yes but you 're my pain in the bum
' the medic was thought to have been unaware of aleysha 's scars at this stage
the next morning , aleysha came downstairs at 10am , but did not want any breakfast
mrs sharples asked if she wanted to go with her to horwich but instead aleysha went back to bed
aleysha 's foster mother had taken her to royal bolton hospital after she self harmed and a medic told the teenager that she was ' having a bad day
' the next day aleysha , 16 , was found hanged in her bedroom aleysha lived with her great aunt for years after being taken from her parents because of their drug addiction the foster mother said aleysha had fitted in well at their home and the two had been getting close
mrs sharples left the house and returned at around 2pm after running some errands
when she went upstairs to check on aleysha some time later she found her body
pathologist dr charles wilson told the inquest that there were scars on the teenager 's arms and thighs , and some spelled out words
he said : ' on her left thigh were the words ruin and fat
the cuts would have taken at least a couple of months to reach the stage i saw
they could have been years old
' a wound to her upper arm spelled the word hate
' ms sharples said foster children were always told to cover their bodies when in their foster homes in accordance with safeguarding rules , and so she did nât notice any signs of self - harming
flowers and tributes were left to aleysha after she was found hanged in her bedroom on april 3 bolton coroners ' court heard that the teenager had repeatedly refused to engage with social workers the teenager 's great aunt carol kerfoot had cared for her from july 2003 until she was 14
she told the hearing she first saw some surface scratches on aleysha 's arms in november 2012 after she returned to the house from a short stint in foster care
' they were surface scratches but when i talked about it she ran off upstairs and did n't want to discuss it , ' she said
' it was the only time i noticed self - harm
' i found her to be a good child
she had some issues and sadly they led to the breakdown of our placement but she was a good child
she had a lot of friends and was beautiful inside and out
' she always maintained she did n't want anything to do with her real parents but then she did
her sister got in touch over facebook and it snowballed from there
' the inquest , expected to last four days , continues
