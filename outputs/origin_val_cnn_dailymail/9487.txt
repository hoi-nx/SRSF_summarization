' i woke up at 39 weeks to a pool of water in the bed
i went back to sleep thinking it was my waters breaking
i went to the hospital that morning but they told me to go home because it was just a watery discharge , ' she said
' i really should have trusted my instincts because i went to my midwife appointment at 40 weeks and she told me i was a centimetre dilated
' ms brittany spriggs was in intensive care at gold coast university hospital for three days and was n't awake for the first few days of her daughter jasmine 's life while ms brittany spriggs had to be induced , everything was going smoothly until her baby 's heart rate dropped

ms brittany spriggs , who was in intensive care for the first few days of her daughter jasmine 's life , says she was initially sent home from the gold coast hospital despite fearing her waters had broken ' i was put under when we got to theatre because the epidural was only working on one side and they did n't have time to fix it
' doctors performed an emergency caesarean and ms brittany spriggs had just started to come around when she started haemorrhaging and had to go back to theatre
' i said to the surgeon : ' please do n't let me die '
i do n't remember anything until i woke up in intensive care three days later
' ms brittany spriggs had to have four surgeries to stop her haemorrhaging and doctors still have n't been able to tell her how it happened
she believes an artery may have been cut during her caesarean but doctors have n't confirmed that
' my husband was gowned up but i had to be put under so he could n't come in
he had no idea what was happening
he was pacing up and down the hallway for hours , ' she said
' the surgeon came out seven or eight hours later saying i was on life support and our daughter was in the nicu ( neonatal intensive care unit )
' her family took heartbreaking pictures of jasmine lying on her mother 's chest while she was still in a coma with tubes coming out of her body
' it 's actually quite a big blur ... i do n't remember the first moment i saw or held jasmine , ' she said
' for the whole nine months i was imagining her being born , but both my husband ( jacob ) and i did n't get to experience that
' ms brittany spriggs says holding her daughter jasmine for the first time was a blur because she was slowly being released out of a coma the first - time mother was brought out of her coma after three days and spent several more in the maternity ward before she discharged herself ms brittany spriggs says doctors told her the birthing horror was an isolated case and it had never happened in the years they had been practising
' i did n't search for answers at first because i thought it had just happened to us
now i 'm hearing more stories about ( complications ) there and now i 'm thinking why is this happening so much , ' she said
a gold coast health spokesperson said it was well within expectation that difficult and complicated births take place
' over a hundred difficult cases occur annually and this is one such example , ' the spokesperson said
' our dedicated maternity team delivered over 4,300 babies in the last year and the number of families choosing gold coast university hospital is increasing at a rate of over 15 per cent annually
' when a woman experiences difficulties due to childbirth it can cause concern and distress to staff involved as well as those people directly affected
' all complicated births are reviewed and discussed as part of an ongoing commitment to service
where necessary such cases are followed up with further investigation in order to determine if there are lessons to be learned in future cases
