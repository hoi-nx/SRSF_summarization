parents who publicly revealed they were traumatised when they were handed the wrong baby by maternity ward nurses after their son was born , have been slammed on social media
samantha stuhlener gave birth to baby levi at st vincent 's private hospital in the inner city melbourne suburb of fitzroy in january , but was handed another child to hold before nurses noticed the mix - up 45 minutes later
she and husband chris revealed her story to 7news on tuesday night , but social media has since been flooded with comments accusing mrs samantha stuhlener of overreacting
while some commenters have sided with the upset parents of the young boy - who have complained they have struggled to bond with their son who they say is often unsettled - others had harsh words for mrs samantha stuhlener
it was an honest accident
get over it , ' wrote one woman
' he was unsettled for 7 weeks after birth ? ! oh my ! that sounds ... like a newborn ' , another posted
others told the parents they should ' get some perspective ' and mentioned those who were not so fortunate as to have a healthy child
' while this should n't happen and is far from ideal , i do n't think it is the end of the world
the babies were n't harmed and were n't left alone
sad for the mum , yes
i would choose this over my son being still born any day , ' one posted
commenters have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the situation many posts have criticised the reaction of the parents one woman wrote that while it was a bad thing that happened , other situations could be worse ' last week all we heard about was a young couple losing their 4 week old bub to whooping cough
it happens more than you realise
perhaps the reason the child was not settling is because the mother was n't focussing on him , instead of focussing on what she did n't have - a measly 45 minutes
get a little perspective ' , another wrote
' i just think of all the poor mums who have to wait a week or more to hold their babies because they were born too early or are sick , ' one more posted
however some commenters were more sympathetic towards the stuhlener 's , agreeing that the first moments with a child are precious , and they were robbed of sharing those with levi
some have asked the parents to be grateful for the fact they have a healthy happy child quite a few posts related to the fact that the samantha stuhlener family were lucky to have a well little boy but others were much more sympathetic to the experience of the new parents ' some of the comments on here are heartless ... this is a once in a lifetime precious moment
she ca n't get that back now
that first moment you get to bond with your child is magical , nothing comes close , ' one viewer wrote
on tuesday the samantha stuhlener family told their story , revealing that the proud parents were horrified to discover that they spent 45 minutes with another couple 's baby , after a nurse mistakenly brought another child to them from the ' settling room '
' i said what 's happened , what 's going on ? ' ms samantha stuhlener told 7news
' and she said , you did n't have levi , you had somebody else 's baby
' the two babies had been together in the overnight settling room at st vincent 's private hospital the error happened despite both infants wearing the correct identification wristbands in the settling room
it 's understood that a nurse failed to cross-check the tags and mistakenly brought mr and mrs samantha stuhlener someone else 's child
the ceo of st vincent 's private hospital , ian grisold , confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff
' it is extremely regrettable and our staff and myself feel gutted by the incident
we unreservedly apologise and take full responsibility for the incident , ' he told 7news
he emphasised that throughout the stay the babies were only touched , fed and changed by their parents
' while both babies had correct identification name tags attached at all times and both babies remained in their correctly named cots at all times , the staff member did not disturb the parents and check their name bands , ' mr ian grisold said
both children were wearing the correct id wrist bands in the overnight settling room
it 's understood that a nurse failed to cross check the wristbands and mistakenly brought the stuhleners someone else 's child ' the second baby remained in the night nursery
' when it was realised by staff that there was a baby in the incorrect room , the still sleeping baby was instantly removed from that room and returned to its parents
' at no time was either baby picked up , held or fed by anyone other than their parents
' the hospital has told the distraught parents that levi remained in the settling room during the 45 minutes period that they were with another infant
however , the stuhleners are demanding the truth
' i do n't believe that , ' ms samantha stuhlener told 7news , unable to hold back tears
' i do n't know , was he ( levi ) with another mother ? ' they have become suspicious as st vincent 's hospital staff allegedly refuse to show the couple the incident report , which details where their baby was throughout the incident
the ceo of st vincent 's private hospital , ian grisold , confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff ' that 's all we 've wanted , to actually see what 's written in the incident report and what actually happened , ' said mr stuhlener
to make matters worse , the hospital 's attempt to apologise resulted in another embarrassing mix - up
mr and mrs samantha stuhlener received a letter of apology and $ 500 worth of vouchers to try and make up for the error
however , the hospital sent them the wrong letter
they received a package addressed to the other couple involved in the mishap â the parents of the infant they mistakenly had in their care for 45 minutes
' i acknowledge that we made an administration error in sending the wrong correspondence to the wrong family , ' mr griswold confirmed
the stuhleners claim to have been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have ' also been left traumatised ' the stuhleners say they 've been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have ' also been left traumatised '
the couple insists the incident has had repercussions on their family
ms samantha stuhlener says she has had more difficulty bonding with levi than she did with her firstborn
their son , now almost three months old , was ' unsettled ' for the first several weeks of his life and did not take to breastfeeding
st vincent 's private hospital have changed their procedures to try ensure the error is not repeated
two staff members are now required to cross check both the mother and baby 's name tags when moving babies to and from the settling room .
