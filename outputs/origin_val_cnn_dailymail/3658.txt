meeting the parents of your romantic interest can be a terrifying experience
but imagine how much worse it would be if they had read the sexts you had sent their son to kick off the romance ! youtuber riyadh khalaf , 24 , bravely invited his mum lorraine , 46 , to join him on his youtube channel to filter some potential dates by reading out messages he had received on gay dating app grindr
ahead of filming riyadh left the app open on his phone for an hour each night for three weeks , and in the video the pair sit sipping wine as lorraine proceeds to read out the uncensored messages to her son , who has yet to hear them himself
the experience makes for a cringeworthy but quite adorable video that sees lorraine shocked by some of the explicit messages that her son has received
' she reads from one user , ' what does that mean ? ! ' ' that they want to play monopoly together , ' a joking riyadh responds
like any good mother lorraine is quick to offer advice on who might be suitable match for riyadh
' he 's nice ' she says about one grindr member
when asked why she adds : ' nice body
lovely muscles , lovely skin
' riyadh khalaf invited his mother lorraine to read his grindr messages to him on video but lorraine is n't impressed by everyone , saying of one user : ' he is gross
his hair 's all over the place , he 's just a dog
' despite some awkward messages cropping up including a semi nude picture , lorraine makes a stoic effort to act cool before admitting that she is ' slightly traumatised ' at the end of the video
ahead of filming riyadh left the gay dating app open for an hour each night to allow the messages to pour in lorraine says she was left ' slightly traumatised ' after reading some of the more explicit messages to her son speaking to the mailonline riyadh says that he could n't think of anyone better to sift through potential dates than his own mother
' i decided to get my mom involved because i wanted her to say which ones she found appropriate
' she has this amazing filter for who would be right for me and so does my dad , they are both very protective of who would be good enough for their boy
' riyadh says he could not think of anyone better to filter through potential partners than his own mother although lorraine took a little convincing to take part riyadh says that she turned out to be the more enthusiastic of the two
' it took me about a month to persuade her
when i first asked she said " absolutely not
" ' but i promised to give her complete editorial control and when i had actually edited it she wanted to put more in ! ' there were some i had to cut though
i was n't going to put clips of my mother discussing male appendages online , those clips will never see the light of day
' although he proved popular on riyadh says that the experience had n't encouraged him to use the app again
' it 's not for me
i 'm not into one night stands , an old soul that 's what i 've been called , a real old romantic
' riyadh says that the experience had not encouraged him to continue using grindr but that he had received several date offers from around the world despite some of the nature of the video riyadh says that the majority of the feedback he has received has been positive , with lots of people commenting on his ' beautiful ' relationship with his mother despite ditching the app riyadh has seen the offers pouring in since uploading the video
' i have also received a lot of date offers from people all over the world ! i wo n't ever need to pay for a hotel again ! ' but riyadh is n't the only popular one , with many viewers leaving comments on how much they love lorraine
' most people have been commenting on how beautiful our relationship is
my mom has been very popular i 've had people saying they want to be her best friend and they want to bitch with her
' the video which has only been online for three days has already received over one million views , however the 24 - year - old admits that he had his doubts on whether the video would be a success
' i did have this fear that i would have the finger pointed at me for promoting a gay stereotype but 99 per cent of the comments have been positive
