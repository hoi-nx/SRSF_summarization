at the beginning of the interview the politician describes herself as a ' relatable woman on a couch '

' referencing her probable run for president , she also insists : ' there will be no mistakes in my rise to the top
' she then describes the nature of the content in the messages , suggesting they will either by ' fun woman talk ' or ' mature romance ' - relating to correspondences with husband bill
giving an example , she reads out a fake email from a gmail account sent by one of her friends : ' hey girl ! still up for a movie tonight ? i heard that new bradley cooper one is hot
what do you want to see ? ' fun woman talk : giving an example of a message sent to her by one of her friends , she reads out a fake email from a gmail account response : the former secretary of state then replies by saying : ' i want to see myself as president of the united states of america ' she then shows a mock reply which reads : ' i want to see myself as president of the united states of america
' then , referring to what could be a saucy conversation with her former president husband , she reads an example : ' dear sir or madam , congratulations on your continued marital success
i would like to schedule a sit - down at your earliest convenience
