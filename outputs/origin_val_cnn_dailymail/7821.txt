it is the game which , ultimately , could define the success or otherwise of martin o'neill and roy keane âs expensive republic of ireland tenure
installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago , Â£ 1million - per - year martin o'neill and his assistant roy keane , with a Â£ 600,000 salary , were given a remit of qualification for euro 2016 , a task made easier by the expansion to a 24 - team format
defeat against poland at the aviva stadium on sunday evening , however , would all but end hope of automatic progression to the finals in france , leaving ireland to do battle with scotland for the play - off berth
the mood here is not optimistic
martin o'neill , manager of the republic of ireland , needs to prove his worth with victory over poland martin o'neill and roy keane ( left ) were given big salaries and asked to reach the 2016 european championships an inquest , you feel , awaits martin o'neill and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders
one newspaper described their manager as â bookish and vaguely befuddled â , and noted the â carnage â which follows roy keane
there has been a definite effort to play down the chaos around roy keane this week and the no 2 gave an untypically subdued and low - key performance in front of the press
martin o'neill ignored the opinion pieces which have called into question his impact since he arrived and kept all talk to football
he said : â the importance of the occasion should not be missed
defeat would be a big dent in our hopes of automatic qualification
it might not decide everything , but it is very significant
we have to try to win
if the republic of ireland fail to beat poland , their hopes of automatic qualification will be all but over martin o'neill and roy keane take a training session at gannon park as the team prepare for sunday 's big match â i âve said all along that the home games will shape our destiny
this is the first of that group
we have to make them count
â we can change all of that ( negative talk ) with one result and one fantastic performance
we will not get very far with a pessimistic approach and i âm not overly concerned with what people say before the game
â we have given ourselves a chance ( of qualification ) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match
â one criticism of martin o'neill is that he does not know his preferred xi or , indeed , formation
he said this week that players could win a starting place should they impress at their coastal training base in malahide
roy keane hands out instructions to the republic of ireland players during a training session sunday 's game takes place at the aviva stadium in dublin ; the republic of ireland 's home ground one player not guaranteed to start is captain robbie keane
he was dropped for the morale - shattering 1 - 0 defeat in scotland in november
the la galaxy striker , 34 , said : â that âs up to the manager ( if i play )
â i âll be ready whether that âs from the bench or starting
i âm the captain , i have to set an example
â but i would nât be here if i did nât think i could make a difference
i still want to be the best
â roy keane , sensing the air of negativity , added : â it âs up to us to make this a turning point
victory would give this squad and country a huge confidence boost
â lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for martin o'neill before they host scotland
win , and that Â£ 1m salary would look like a shrewd investment .
