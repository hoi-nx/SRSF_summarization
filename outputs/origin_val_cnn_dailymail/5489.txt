louis van gaal believes he has identified two future managers in his manchester united squad and expects them to progress into coaching once they hang up their boots
van gaal says both wayne rooney and michael carrick â who were both named in roy hodgson âs england squad for the upcoming internationals with lithuania and italy â are both open to learning about coaching
and despite van gaal âs reputation as a hard task master he says he is extremely flexible to his approach and will change if one of his players puts up a good argument
louis van gaal says he is a very flexible manager and open to having discussions with his players van gaal says michael carrick is like a coach already in the way he talks about the game wayne rooney is very open to learning , according to van gaal ' wayne rooney is very open to learn
it 's amazing , ' he told the telegraph
' i do n't know if he speaks with his wife coleen about football , i do n't think so
' but we have the process of talking here
most of my players of my selection are open and that 's very nice
' michael carrick is more or less a trainer - coach
he is also willing to talk about shapes and systems
' not every player is very open and then you have to convince him , and then you get a struggle
' it works or it does n't work
also give me time to do it
' i am the most flexible manager you can imagine
when the players are coming with good arguments , i change my opinion
