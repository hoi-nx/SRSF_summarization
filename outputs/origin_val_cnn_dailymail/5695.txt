it âs a common sight on the streets of china âs most populous city shanghai
but the image of an incredibly overloaded delivery bike still manages to boggle the mind of anyone who sees it
captured cycling through the streets of shanghai , two men are shown carrying a ridiculously large load of seven huge boxes of paper
parked , the two bikes are dwarfed under the load of the seven boxes that they each carry straining under the weight of the cargo the three - wheeled bikes can be heard groaning as the riders go about making their delivery
despite being dwarfed by the extremely heavy load , the riders move relatively fast towards their destination
filmed parked at the side of the road after arriving , one of the bikes is shown toppled backwards under the weight of the boxes
one of the bikes moves relatively quickly considering the size and weight of its load the pair are then seen untying the rope around the boxes before offloading the paper onto the street
pulling the rope from the top , one man manages to put his bike back on all three wheels before he attempts to remove the highest stacked box
because of china âs huge population , many locals have adopted this means of transport as a way of getting around effectively
pushbikes , motorbikes , mopeds and scooters are all used in place of transit vans and hgvs as a way of avoiding the congestion
one of the bikes in unable to sustain the weight of the load when stationery and topples onto its two back wheels one of the men pulls a rope from the top of the cargo to put his bike back on all three wheels before unloading
