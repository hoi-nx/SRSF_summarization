with benfica holding a fragile 1 - 0 lead over shakhtar donetsk in the uefa youth league , it was not the time for any player from the portuguese side to try anything flamboyant in front of goal
unfortunately , that is exactly what romario balde did when he seized control of a penalty for his side
instead of lashing the ball into a corner and hoping his accuracy beat the dive of the goalkeeper , he tried to chip the ball down the middle and into the goal - a panenka penalty kick
romario balde chips a penalty at goal in benfica 's uefa youth league game against shakhtar donetsk romario balde 's contact with the ball was so light it only trickled to goal , despite the goalkeeper diving the wrong way the goalkeeper had enough time to get to his feet and save the attempt , so minimal was romario balde 's contact as the ball was stopped inches in front of the goal line , romario balde reacts to his error for benfica balde wa substituted and his benfica side drew to shakhtar donetsk 1 - 1 before losing the game on penalties the skill is named after panenka 's penalty at euro 1976 for czechoslovakia against germany but romario balde lacked all of the conviction that made panenka 's kick famous
his kick was so feeble and light that the shakhtar donetsk goalkeeper had enough time to dive the wrong way , regain his balance and claim the ball before it trickled over the line
and things did not get any better for romario balde or benfica
italy midfielder andrea pirlo famously scored a panenka penalty against england at euro 2012 he was substituted , benfica ended up drawing 1 - 1 before crashing out of the competition - on penalties
the panenka has been replicated by the likes of andrea pirlo and zinedine zidane , but romario balde is unlikely to want to try it in an important game any time soon .
