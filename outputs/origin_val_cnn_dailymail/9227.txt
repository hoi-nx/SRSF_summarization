miliband has vowed to adopt a â turing âs law â to allow the pardoning of tens of thousands of men convicted of gay sex when it was illegal
turing , the ww2 codebreaker , was convicted of homosexual activity in 1952 but given a posthumous royal pardon 15 months ago
since then his relatives have campaigned for the 49,000 men convicted under gross indecency laws to be similarly pardoned
mr miliband has said he will extend this to the families and friends of gay men who received convictions in their lifetime but died before they could apply to have the records changed
the labour leader told gay times that , if elected prime minister in may , he would make the matter a priority
the campaign to parden gay men convicted of ' gross indecency ' has been backed by celebrities including hollywood star benedict cumberbatch , who played mr turing in the oscar - winning drama the imitation game he said : â i think it âs worth saying that we do want to extend the principles being applied to turing and his family , to be able to say to others who were convicted of a criminal offence simply because of the person that they loved â whether they are alive or no longer alive â that we can get a pardon for them
â i think it âs a stain on our society , frankly
i think it âs right what âs been done in relation to turing and his family , but there are also other families that will have had relatives who were convicted , as i say , simply because of the person they love
' and i think it âs time we acted for them , too
i think we owe it to the lgbt [ lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ] community to make this move
â turing died after eating an apple laced with cyanide on 8 june 1954 , turing 's cleaner found him dead
a post-mortem examination established the cause of death was cyanide poisoning
an inquest determined that he had committed suicide , and he was cremated at woking crematorium on 12 june
several scholars , and even his family , have suggested turing 's death was not suicide - and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy
when his body was discovered , an apple laid half - eaten next to his bed
it was never tested for cyanide but it is speculated it was the source of the fatal does
some more peculiar theories suggest turing was ' obsessed ' with fairytale snow white and the seven dwarfs and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story
the theory was supported in an article in the guardian written by turing 's friend , the author alan garner , in 2011
however , later evidence suggested that turing habitually ate an apple before bed , and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half - eaten
his mother is said to have thought the ingestion was accidental , cause by her son 's storage of chemicals in his home
speaking on the 100th anniversary of turing 's birth on 23rd june 2012 , professor of philosophy copeland , university of canterbury , christchurch , new zealand , questioned the evidence given to the inquiry in 1954
he said there was no evidence of premeditation - there was no suicide note and he seemed to be in a cheerful mood in the days leading up to his death
he added that turing 's career was at an all time high and that he would not want to intentionally kill himself
he pointer out that his friend robin gandy stayed with turing a week before his death and he remarked how happy turing seemed finally , the academic remarked that the inquest was so bad that turing could even have been murdered
although it is is unclear who would have wanted to murder him mr copeland said his work at bletchley park was under strict secrecy until well after his death
last week relatives of the mathematician and codebreaker delivered a petition to downing street calling for all those convicted under anti-gay laws to be pardoned
celebrities including benedict cumberbatch , who played turing in the oscar - winning film the imitation game , have also backed the campaign
during the ww2 , turing was pivotal in cracking the german enigma codes , which gave vital information about hitler âs forces
historians credit the work of turing and his fellow codebreakers at bletchley park in buckinghamshire with shortening the war by up to two years , saving countless lives
turing is also widely seen as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence
but in 1952 he was convicted for homosexual activity , which was illegal at the time , after having an affair with a 19 - year - old man in manchester
turing underwent â chemical castration â as part of his sentence and his conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for gchq
he died two years later , aged 41 , having apparently committed suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide
in 2013 turing was granted a royal pardon after a request from justice secretary chris grayling
benedict cumberbatch said : â turing was not only prosecuted , but quite arguably persuaded to end his own life early , by a society who called him a criminal for simply seeking out the love he deserved , as all human beings do
