david cameron âs pledge to crack down on immigration is no longer taken seriously by the obr
the prime minister had promised to reduce net migration to the â tens of thousands â by the general election
however , last month that vow was shattered when figures showed it had hit a record high
david cameron âs pledge to reduce net migration to the â tens of thousands â is no longer taken seriously by the obr home secretary theresa may later insisted the tories would restate the failed target to slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they returned to government
but yesterday the obr heaped embarrassment on ministers by criticising the prediction
in a document published alongside the budget , it said its previous forecasts had been â underpinned by the assumption â that net migration â the measure of how many people have come into britain minus those who have left â would be 105,000 by 2019
theresa may said tories would slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they stayed in power it stated : â a reduction over time seems consistent with the international environment and with the government âs declared efforts to reduce it
â but in a blow to mr david cameron , it added : â in light of recent evidence , it no longer seems central to assume it will decline so steeply
â instead , it said net migration would â tend towards 165,000 in the long term â
on taking power in 2010 , mr david cameron pledged to bring the politically - sensitive net migration figure below 100,000
but last month the figure hit 300,000 â fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the eu of 190,000
downing street described the figures as a â disappointment â but also a reflection of a growing economy
the highest number previously recorded was 600,000 in september 2010
when mr david cameron entered downing street in may 2010 net migration was running at 244,000
shadow immigration minister david hanson said : â david cameron âs â no ifs , no buts â pledge on net migration is in complete tatters ; not even the obr believes the prime minister âs promise any more and are now planning for it to be broken
â if you needed any more evidence that this government simply ca nât be trusted to deliver their promises on immigration , this is it
