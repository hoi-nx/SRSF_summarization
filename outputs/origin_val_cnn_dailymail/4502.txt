but it seems that they have nothing on their mexico peers
a series of fascinating new photographs highlight a trend in the city of monterrey for throwing extravagant parties to mark the point at which young girls turn 15 and , according to latin american tradition , transition into womanhood

however , it is n't just ' bank of mum and dad ' that pays for the event , other relatives are called upon to ' sponsor ' certain elements , for example , the cake or the dj. such is the pomp and ceremony of these excessive bashes , you could be forgiven for thinking that you 're looking at a garish wedding party
even the attending boys go to town , taking care to coordinate their looks with the birthday girl
much like the latin american prom , the celebrating girl can expect a date , with her betrothed often appearing like a mini-groom , wearing an outfit that has been planned to match hers
the birthday cake is likely to be just as eye - catching with ' the bigger , the better ' the remit

for example , when disney released the hit film frozen in 2014 , it prompted a surge of elsa - inspired dresses
at the other end of the spectrum , indigenous tribes in jungle communities in the likes of gueatemala would celebrate in a much simpler fashion
it 's all a far cry from the more humble traditions of quinceaÃ±era
according to folklore , in the months before turning 15 , a daughter would be taught skills to prepare her for ensuing marriage including cooking , weaving and even tips about how to bring up her own children
it is thought that quinceaÃ±era has its roots in ancient aztec culture
15 is the number : quinceaÃ±era is celebrated differently in different countries but is essentially a coming - of - age party from the latin american communities of los angeles to the streets of mexico and even in cuba , when a girl hits the age of 15 , a huge party promptly follows
essentially a coming - of - age affair , quinceaÃ±era - literally meaning ' 15 years old ' , has taken off in much the same way that the high school prom has , with celebrations and outfits becoming increasingly extravagant in recent decades
in the past , a girl celebrating her quinceaÃ±era would be preparing for marriage and offered advice from older females on how best to equip herself for womanhood
skills considered essential for being a good wife , for example sewing , cooking , cleaning and taking care of infants would be learned
at her quinceaÃ±era , the girl is ' presented ' to her community and may be expected to make a speech
after an ' acceptance ' of the girl , the party - goers would then pray before a meal is served
although most historians agree that the celebration has its roots in aztec culture , how it is celebrated now depends very much on the country the girl grows up in
for many , religion still plays a part and parties are more conservative
