ai has been described as a threat that could be ' more dangerous than nukes '
but despite this , the race is on to create robots that can interact naturally with humans and mimic some of our unique characteristics
now , a robot modelled on a four - year - old child , has been developed with a â sense of self â
it was originally created by the italian institute of technology as part of the efaa project and over the years , it âs been refined to be able to crawl , walk and dance to music , manipulate objects in its hands , speak and express emotions
it 's latest iteration is more human - like than ever
a video posted by new scientist shows it playing a game of paddle war â a simple game where two players each hold a paddle - or in this case a cylinder - and try to score goals using a digital ball , while stopping their rival from scoring
a video shows icub playing a game of paddle war ( pictured ) â a game where two players each hold a paddle and try to score goals using a digital ball , while stopping their rival from scoring - but the robot is a sore loser ! the robot âs goals and emotions change constantly , based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately to whether it is winning or losing
when icub concedes a goal , it frowns and furrows its light - up eyebrows , sometimes swearing like an ill - tempered human
when it scores a goal , it smiles and says phrases like â got it , â although there is not much change in intonation whether a phrase is negative or positive
the robot âs goals and emotions change constantly , based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately
a stock image is shown the robot laughs , or says â ha ha â when the ball ricochets off the side of the screen , but is seemingly a bad loser
â that is nât fair , i should be stronger at video games ! â it says , after losing the game
the video also shows how the robot can respond to being touched , a little bit like a slightly creepy human
when a human strokes its arms it affects icub âs reactions and emotions and the robot says on one occasion in the video : â i like when you touch me this way '
â enjoying â the human contact , the machine smiles and says : ' please , caress me again '
tweaks to its software also mean that the robot is starting to understand language and can follow instructions that require reasoning , such as identifying two objects and moving them to a position , as instructed
scientists are so keen to develop human - like robots to advance the field of artificial intelligence , which they hope could one day be used in medicine , and even eradicate disease and poverty , for example
a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including musk and stephen hawking , have signed an open letter promising to ensure ai research benefits humanity , and does n't destroy it
the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future
the document , drafted by the future of life institute , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind
the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that ai research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society
it highlights speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research
a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including musk and stephen hawking ( pictured ) , have signed an open letter promising to ensure ai research benefits humanity , and does n't destroy it ' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools ai may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of ai had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak
for instance , in the short term , it claims ai may put millions of people out of work
in the long term , it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming
' our ai systems must do what we want them to do , ' the letter says
' many economists and computer scientists agree that there is valuable research to be done on how to maximise the economic benefits of ai while mitigating adverse effects , which could include increased inequality and unemployment
' the letter followed comments made by professor hawking , who warned that ai could someday overtake humans
speaking at event in london , the physicist told the bbc : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race
' musk has previously described ai as our ' biggest existential threat ' .
