the similarities are uncanny â from the outlandish fascinators , to the plummy voices and voluptuous curves
new drama royals , which launched in u.s. last week , is about a â spoof â british royal family â but two red - haired sisters , penelope and maribel , bear uncomfortable resemblances to princesses beatrice and eugenie
the creators of the show , which stars elizabeth hurley as a couture - clad queen , insist all the characters are â purely fictional â
hatty preston , who plays â dim - witted â maribel , told the mail on sunday : â it âs inevitable that people will compare the sisters to princesses beatrice and eugenie
â i based maribel on the made in chelsea stars , but the make - up girls and wardrobe ladies had photos of princesses beatrice and eugenie pinned up everywhere
i hope they realise we âre laughing with them , not at them
â the royals has already been panned by u.s. critics
the first episode will be screened in the uk on e ! on wednesday .
