louis the cat is so popular with folk at wells cathedral â home to the bishop of bath and wells â that he has become the feline hero of a children 's book , and even has his own merchandise stall in the cathedral shop

he has been linked to at least three fights with dogs in recent weeks and locals fear there could be more
as news of the scandal spread , however , a ' fans of louis ' group sprang to the moggy 's defence
and cathedral staff suggested he could be a victim of mistaken identity , quickly issuing a statement which claimed there were ' at least two other ginger cats in the area who also enjoy strolling through the streets of wells '
louis became a regular sight at the cathedral after it adopted him as a stray ten years ago
his principal role was to rid the 12th century building of mice
such was the esteem in which the rather solitary cat was held , the cathedral generated a regular fund - raising trade in louis fridge magnets , pencils , mugs and other louis - related trinkets , including an Â£ 8.99 paperweight and a Â£ 5.99 candle - snuffer
he would later star in a youtube video narrated affectionately by the head verger
louis is so popular in wells that he has become the subject of a children 's book , louis the cathedral cat but out there on the mean streets , it is alleged , he became a dangerous , feral beast
' he pounced like a wild lion in the jungle on to my dog millie 's head , ' said mandie stone-outten , describing his alleged attack on her springer spaniel outside the present company gift shop in the nearby market place
' we were just looking in the window of the shop and the cat was sitting outside
he was staring at the dog , the dog was staring at the cat
' then suddenly , so quickly , it was attacking my dog 's head
he turned into a cat about four times the size and he was waving his arms around
' i tried to pull the lead back , but i went flying back and fell off the pavement into the gully
it had been raining and i was covered in mud
it hurt all down my right side , it was so painful
' a couple of people told me it was louis the cathedral cat and that he was semi-feral and he did sometimes go a bit crazy
' the 48 - year - old , from shepton mallet , somerset , added : ' i went back with my son and his girlfriend a couple of days later
we went into the cathedral and i saw the cat asleep in a basket sitting behind the till
' we started stroking it and it was just like a little teddy bear
i could n't believe that it was the same cat
' that cat has serious issues
be aware â this ball of fluff is not as cute and cuddly as he looks
' louis quickly became a regular sight at the cathedral after it adopted him as a stray ten years ago the wells cathedral staff believe he is a victim of mistaken identity and is being unjustly persecuted debbie sheppard , who works in the present company shop , overheard the commotion
' the next thing i heard was this hissing , ' she said
' when i looked outside , louis was walking up the street looking very subdued
' but she added : ' he 's a very sweet cat and i certainly do n't think he 's suddenly turned nasty
' attack number two also put louis in the frame
zoe described how her brother 's dog was set upon by a big ginger cat at the cathedral 's magnificent west front , part of louis 's regular domain
' his dog nearly lost an eye , ' she said
' we all assumed it was louis
' the cathedral cat can regularly be spotted snoozing next to the radiator in wells cathedral , somerset attack number three is said to have been witnessed by town crier len sweales , although details remain inconclusive
zoe said : ' he told me that louis has a lookalike and he thinks it was the other ginger who would have launched the attack
' so does louis have a jekyll and hyde personality ? or are there truly doppelganger moggies prowling the streets ? supporters said the cat had never shown any aggressive tendencies and was ' sweet natured if somewhat aloof '
one ' fans of louis ' member , who has known the cat for five years , wrote of the attack allegations : ' for an old guy who spends most of his day sound asleep in a basket in the cathedral shop , it must have taken an event of magnitude to have caused such a reaction
be honoured â we may not see such an event again in our lifetime
' the 17 - year - old can normally be found fast asleep in a basket in the gift shop at wells cathedral
