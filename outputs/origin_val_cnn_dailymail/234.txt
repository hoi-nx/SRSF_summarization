missile technician 3rd class brandon mcgarity , 25 , is charged with failing to report the videos and making a false official statement
in addition to the sailors from the uss wyoming , an individual stationed at trident training facility in kings bay is being charged
according to an incident report written last year , the unsuspecting women were recorded bathing and changing aboard the ballistic missile submarine
a 24 - year - old second class petty officer allegedly made the videos over the past year and distributed them among his male colleagues
the clips were said to depict at least three servicewomen in the shower and in various states of undress aboard the uss wyoming - an ohio - class ballistic missile submarine
the first female sailors were introduced to american subs beginning in 2011 as part of a concerted integration effort , which has been labeled a success by the navy
the privacy violation scandal comes at an especially sensitive time as navy officials are preparing to integrate virginia - class attack submarines
come january , six female officers will join the crews of virginia and uss minnesota , according to a statement issued in october 2013 by vice admiral michael connor , commander of submarine forces
a ballistic missile sub such as the uss wyoming typically has 15 officers and 140 enlisted crew members on board
officers of both sexes use the same bathing facilities , but whenever a woman is in the shower she is expected to put up a sign indicating her presence inside , and her male comrades must wait until she comes out before entering
smooth sailing : the integration of ballistic missile submarine crews , which got under way in 2010 , had been labeled a success by the navy according to navy times , some of the women depicted in the videos are unhappy with the way navy brass has been handling the incident
the naval criminal investigative service has launched a probe into the matter , and a spokeswoman for submarine group 10 in kings bay said the navy would hold those involved accountable
the man accused of videotaping his female colleagues has not been named in the november 14 incident report , but he has been described as a petty officer assigned to trident training facility
investigators were first tipped off about the videos last month by an officer from another submarine who received the recordings
the uss wyoming was at the forefront of the integration effort , welcoming a dozen female supply and line officers in 2011
a retired supply officer who was in charge of mentoring the new arrivals recalled how on the first day of their tenure she was approached by a male sailor who asked her : ' where are the females ? ' â i looked at him and said , â all right , let 's get one thing straight : they 're not females , they 're junior officers on this boat , they 're division officers , and you will address them as ensign so - and - so , and you can tell everybody else on the boat , â " she told the paper
serious incident : the videotape scandal comes at a time when navy officials are preparing to introduce female sailors to virginia - class attack subs in an abc news story from may 2012 , female submariners talked in glowing terms about how smoothly the integration has been going , and how their biggest challenge was becoming junior officers
â outside of being female on a submarine , all of us are trying to qualify , all of us are trying to support the ward room and trying to be a team member
that is challenging , in itself , â ensign abigail holt said at the time
female officers now serve on at least seven subs
by 2020 , the navy will allow enlisted female sailors to serve on submarines as well
since the navy lifted its ban on female submariners in 2010 , at least 43 women have joined the service .
