a sensational 82nd - minute strike from smith-brown snatched victory for england 's u19s over denmark in their uefa elite qualifying opener in bayeux on thursday
england came from behind twice in the first half as marcus ingvartsen and robert skov 's goals were cancelled out first by captain izzy brown and demarai gray as they went to the break 2 - 2
they could n't be separated until manchester city defender smith-brown pulled the trigger from outside the box and his left - footed shot thundered in off the underside of the cross bar

jeppe hansen went first for denmark a minute after the final goal for an unseemly tackle on charlie colkett before tottenham 's harry winks received a second yellow card in the 87th minute
marcus ingvartsen 's opener came from a long throw just six minutes in with the move immediately after birmingham 's demarai gray almost put england ahead after a cross from charlie colkett
they levelled when ruben loftus-cheek found captain and fellow chelsea star izzy brown , who despite having plenty of work to do evaded two defenders and beat keeper daniel iversen
smith-brown picks up the ball at the top of the box as england look to create something the manchester city defender turns inside as the denmark defence give him plenty of space smith-brown fires off his bullet - like shot that cannons in off the crossbar and wins the match for england despite momentum going england 's way and a number of chances going begging , denmark were in the lead again in the 44th minute as robert skov burst into the box and beat angus gunn for 2 - 1
in the same minute though sean oâdriscoll âs side were back on terms as demarai gray flicked - on roberts free - kick from the edge of the box with the help of a possible deflection
neither side took the second half as their own with only half chances coming their way until smith-brown 's goal came from seemingly nothing more than the denmark defence underestimating his ability from range and giving him too much space
england will play azerbaijan in their second group match on saturday .
