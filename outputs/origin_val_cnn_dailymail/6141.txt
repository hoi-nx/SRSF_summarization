two men suspected of involvement in the murder of russian opposition leader boris nemtsov have been arrested by the federal security service secret service , it was announced today
the announcement came a week after the 55 - year - old foe of putin was gunned down on a bridge close to the kremlin , where he was walking with his 23 - year - old girlfriend , ukraine model anna duritskaya
federal security service head alexander bortnikov said in a televised statement : ' as a result of the work done , we have detained today two people suspected of committing this crime - those are anzor gubashev and zaur dadayev
' he stressed the lubyanka was continuing ' necessary operative and investigative work ' on the case
alexander bortnikov did not immediately give details of their suspected role in the brutal killing , but tass news agency claimed both were ' suspected of murdering boris nemtsov '
boris nemtsov was killed as he was preparing a report alleging the kremlin was deeply involved in the bloody war in eastern ukraine
fellow opposition leaders have vowed to ensure his report is published
the two men held by the federal security service are understood to be from the caucasus region in southern russian
they were evidently detained from evidence found in the getaway car , and through surveillance of telephone calls
but the investigation is still seeking those who ordered the politician 's killing
earlier this week russian president putin called for an end to the ' shame ' of political killings which have plagued the kremlin in recent years the kremlin has denied any involvement , saying that the killing was a ' provocation ' designed to discredit putin and strengthen his opponents
he was the most prominent opposition figure to be killed in russian during putin 's 15 - year rule
news of the arrest comes as president putin earlier this week demanded an end to ' shameful ' political assassinations in the wake of the shooting
but boris nemtsov 's friends say the kremlin is to blame for fomenting an atmosphere of hatred towards its opponents
in a speech with officials from the interior ministry , putin said : ' the most serious attention should be paid to high - profile crimes , including the ones with a political subtext
' russian should be devoid at last of the kind of shame and tragedies that we have recently endured and seen
