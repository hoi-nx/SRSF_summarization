german shepherds were bred specifically for their high levels of intelligence and as a result are commonly used as police and guard dogs around the world
however their desire to learn , which clearly overpowers their desire to just accept what is , can sometimes lead them to become a source of amusement , as this dog 's owner recently found out
filmed in a garden , the german shepherd named sonja stares down at its shadow being cast on the floor before giving its owner and his friends a laugh
the dog initially stares down at its shadow being cast onto the patio before making an attempt to paw at it wagging its tail , the dog initially seems to try and lose its shadow by hopping around and making a sharp turn
as it gets back to its original position it realises that the shadow is still there , and it stamps on it with its left paw
suddenly the german shepherd leaps into the air and jumps down onto the shadow , before hopping three more times in quick succession
attempting to lose the shadow , the dog jumps up into the air and lands back down onto it below the german shepherd called sonja later jumps onto the shadow three more times in quick succession the people standing around watching can be heard laughing and one of them notes : â he âs playing with the shadow
â the dog then circles its shadow once more , as if deciding on the most strategic plan of action â its tongue sticks out in concentration
before leaping into the air â leaving the ground with all four legs â and landing back down onto it several more times
the dog circles its shadow , as if deciding on the most strategic plan of action , before jumping on it the people watching can be heard laughing as the german shepherd attempts to lose its shadow the video concludes with the dog eventually losing its shadow by moving out of the sun and into the shade
