australia have no intention of shirking the verbal battle as they seek to defeat defending champions india in their cricket world cup semi-final in sydney
michael clarke 's team already know that fellow tournament co-hosts new zealand will await thursday 's winners in sunday 's final at the mcg
resurgent india , like the kiwis so far unbeaten throughout their campaign , are sure to provide a stern test as australia pursue a record fifth title
mitchell johnson ( centre ) will not shirk the verbal battle against india in the cricket world cup semi-final on thursday the left - arm fast bowler will not be put off after shane watson was fined for verbal exchanges in the last eight clarke and co will not be put off in their quest to retain the trophy , though , by the consequences of shane watson 's epic confrontation with pakistan fast bowler wahab riaz in their last - eight success in adelaide four days ago
shane watson had to withstand some ferocious short balls and gave as good as he got too in verbal exchanges which resulted in fines for both players under the international cricket council 's code of conduct
the australia all - rounder emerged the emphatic victor , however - with an unbeaten 64 , having been dropped on four off wahab riaz , as he and the big - hitting glenn maxwell took their team to a six - wicket verdict with almost 16 overs to spare
australia 's combative opener david warner has since suggested he may have to leave the chat to others but mitchell johnson and faulkner will happily take over
mitchell johnson told fox sports : ' i heard davey say he was n't going to get involved in all that stuff
someone 's got to do it , and i think i might put my hand up
' mitchell johnson , fellow seamer faulkner and coach darren lehmann all appear most definitely ready to 're - engage '
shane watson and wahab riaz were both fined for their exchanges in the quarter - final on friday australia all - rounder faulkner is another who will not be backing away from the verbal battle australia 's left - arm pace spearhead added : ' it 's part of the game - and what happened the other day with shane watson ( watson ) and wahab riaz ( wahab riaz ) i thought was exceptional , the way they played the game
' it was unfortunate with what happened afterwards
i thought it was great entertaining cricket to watch , and i think you 're going to see some more entertainment this game
' darren lehmann agreed in his column for cricket.com.au : ' i ca n't help but think it 's a bit disappointing that the exchange was deemed to have crossed the line
' i 've been interested to read that greats of the game such as brian lara and kevin pietersen were surprised that 's how it was interpreted
' but i have no doubt the passion and the thrills that wahab riaz 's spell ignited among the crowd in adelaide will be there for all to see and hear at the sydney cricket ground when we take on india in thursday 's semi-final
' faulkner is like - minded : ' there 's going to be words said , and it 's going to be a really tough contest
' i think there always is ( sledging ) in the game - if there is n't , you 've got problems
' it 's the nature of the game , it 's a semi-final - cut throat
australia coach darren lehmann said he was disappointed shane watson 's exchange with wahab riaz was deemed to have over-stepped the mark mitchell johnson and his team - mates trained at the sydney cricket ground on tuesday ' neither team will be backing down
' india have defied the expectations of many , not just by progressing so far after playing the stooges in the preceding tri-series against australia and england but by taking all 70 wickets available to them en route - often with pace , rather than spin
number three batsman virat kohli is relishing the chance to prove another point after india 's 109 - run quarter - final trouncing of bangladesh
' it 's the perfect time for us , an opportunity to do justice to the way we play , ' he told cricket.com.au
' we knew we had things to work on ( after the tri-series ) , and not much time
' the way our bowlers have reacted , and performed , with composure , confidence and aggression has been wonderful to watch
' our bowling attack has come into play in this cricket world cup - taking 70 wickets in seven games , that 's probably been the difference
' if we can continue to do that , we 'll have a great chance come game day
