spring officially started three weeks ago , but the chilly wintry weather is still very apparent - with hail and even snow expected to hit uk this week
the top uk temperature expected today is 11c ( 52f ) in york , while london should see 10c ( 50f ) - after many places basked in sunshine yesterday
yesterday 's high in uk was 14.8c ( 58.6f ) at helen 's bay in county down , northern ireland , but parts of east sussex only managed 5.9c ( 42.6f )
and the winter coats will have to come back out of the wardrobe this week , because the warm weather is expected to take a turn for the worst
however forecasters have predicted a band cloud and rain will move southwards from across natural resources wales and northern england
scattered heavy showers will turn wintry across hills , which may turn into thunder and hail
met office forecaster kate brown said : â the cold nights are set to continue with temperatures at 1c or 2c ( 33f or 35f )
' it will start to get warmer by thursday or friday night , up to 4c ( 39f )
â the cold weather means gardeners should probably keep their plants in the greenhouses for a little longer to avoid being damaged by frost
â she added that a weak band of rain will be replaced by sunshine across the uk today , followed by some heavy showers , thunder and hail
there is also a chance of snow on higher ground , with heavy showers leading to up to 0.2in ( 0.5cm ) of rain falling in some places
the environment agency and natural resources wales have 21 flood alerts and five more serious flood warnings in place today
forecast : rain is predicted in several areas across the country , but by wednesday the sun will begin to emerge again from behind the clouds on alert : the environment agency and natural resources wales have 21 flood alerts and five more serious flood warnings in place today
country - wide view : this satellite image from metdesk 's home and dry app shows how yesterday was a lovely spring morning for some parts and while there will be a brief break from the rain on wednesday , with sunshine expected , a band of rain and cloud will move eastwards that night
the met office said the first week of the easter holidays , which start on friday , will see highs of 10c and a mix of clear spells and showers or rain
on the first day of the holidays - saturday , march 28 - brighter showery conditions are expected , before a more settled day arrives on sunday
then , forecasters warn of a â period of more changeable westerlies the following week and through the easter weekend â
they say wet weather is likely to push across the uk , interspersed by brighter , but also showery , periods - with the best weather in the south east
uk âs warmest day of the year so far was march 8 , when temperatures hit 17.5c ( 63.5f ) at murlough in county down , northern ireland
meteorological spring began on march 1 , while the astronomical spring began last friday
six people had to be rescued by coastguard and lifeboat teams in three different incidents on saturday after extreme spring tides
four teenagers were rescued from chest - high water after becoming trapped by the incoming tide , while two people got stuck up to their knees in mud
some 50 coastguard volunteers , lifeboat crew , police , fire and ambulance officers were involved in the rescues in dorset between 5pm and 7pm
spring tides - when the difference between low and high tide is greatest - happen twice a month when the earth , sun and moon align
but this was even bigger than usual because of the recent supermoon - when the moon is as close to the earth as it can be - and the spring equinox
the four foreign teenagers called the emergency services because they were lost and becoming cut off by a rising tide near old harry rocks
the group had started walking at about 2.30pm and were able to walk quite far along the shore due to the extremely low tide
but when the tide came back in quickly , trapping them , they called the coastguard
they were connected to an arabic interpreter so the coastguard could establish where the group were while poole rnli teams carried out a search
by the time they were found the rapidly incoming tide was up to their chests
also , a female dog walker was also rescued after she became stuck in mud up to her knees at whitecliff in poole at 5pm
and shortly after a second team was launched to help a bait digger stuck at jerry 's point in studland
the swanage coastguard team could not get near the trapped man due to the thick mud
poole rnli had used inflatable rafts to bring him to shore
ian brown from swanage coastguard said : â in my 24 years i 've never seen the tide come back quite as quick as it did yesterday [ saturday ]
