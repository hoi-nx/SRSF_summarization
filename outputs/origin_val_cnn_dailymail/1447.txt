england âs fourth six nations runners - up finish in a row has been labelled â unacceptable â by rfu chief executive ian ritchie , with head coach stuart lancaster told performances must improve before the world cup
lancaster âs men suffered heartache as their thrilling 55 - 35 victory over france on saturday saw them fall six points short of overhauling ireland and securing a first title since 2011
but ian ritchie said : â four years as runners - up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about
we should be winning more in terms of grand slams , six nations championships , other things
england are left reeling on the pitch as their 55 - 35 victory against france failed to secure the title captain chris robshaw ( fourth right ) looks dejected after england concede a try to france at twickenham stuart lancaster ( left ) and his players ponder a second - placed finish for a fourth successive season â we had opportunities , let âs be clear â entirely in our control
the irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches
we did not do enough
there âs no point in bleating about it
â we did nât take opportunities , did nât do what we should have done , were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win
â but there was more than a little sense that ian ritchie was playing to his audience at twickenham
and not only because the rfu âs affable chief executive quoted hamlet when describing the â slings and arrows of outrageous fortune â he experienced watching the engrossing six nations denouement
his public pronouncements were designed to strike a chord with those still uncomfortable with the six - year contracts served to england âs coaches last year
they were also designed as a shot across head coach stuart lancaster âs bows

often it takes hundreds of questions to extract such strong quotes from a senior figure
it was almost as if ian ritchie had decided what he was going to say in advance
this was no slip of the tongue
more a clever piece of brinkmanship designed to keep the pressure on lancaster
the aim was also to avoid accusations that complacency has crept into an organisation which has pulled itself back from the brink in the public âs eyes since the dark days surrounding the scandal - hit 2011 world cup campaign
ian ritchie , the man at the top of an organisation now delivering everywhere but on the pitch , felt the need to crack the whip
â four years as runners - up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about , â said the former chief executive of the all england lawn tennis and croquet club
â if you go back through history , bearing in mind a lot of things , we should be , as a country , winning more in terms of grand slams , six nations championships , other things
we had opportunities , let âs be clear â entirely in our control
the irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches
â we did not do enough over the five matches
there âs no point in bleating about it
we simply did nât take opportunities , did nât do what we should have done , were not clever enough during parts of the game to deserve to win

success for the home nation on the field is critical for fans , sponsors , media and administrators alike
the rfu âs strategic vision , which ian ritchie helped draw up , decreed that england should head into the world cup with a six nations title under their belt and a world ranking no lower than second
for all the brilliance of saturday âs seven - try triumph over france , watched by 9.6million on terrestrial television , they have achieved neither
but the natural question if results are â unacceptable â is â so what are the consequences ? â surely there is no point having targets if shoulders are simply shrugged when they are not met
but , with six - year deals secured , the reality is that lancaster and his tight - knit coaching team of andy farrell , mike catt and graham rowntree are going nowhere in a hurry
â it âs quite right in any management to have targets , â insisted ian ritchie
â but they âre not the be-all and end - all
you âve got to look around at the totality of what âs going on , where we are and what we believe
frontline players such as owen farrell ( left ) and manu tuilagi were unavailable for the six nations â have we missed some targets ? well , yes
we wanted to win the six nations
we wanted to be ranked two in the world
â we remain confident and optimistic with a belief we can do well at the world cup
we remain absolutely confident , happy and committed to the team that we âve got on the coaching staff
â england were hamstrung by injuries in the build - up to the tournament
no fewer than 11 players were ruled out of their opening win over wales in cardiff and first - choice stars manu tuilagi , joe launchbury , ben morgan and owen farrell were absent for the duration

but ian ritchie , the man in charge of a union which makes more than twice as much money as any other in the world and has access to more players , added : â â we âre developing , this is a development opportunity â â i do nât take that
â we âve got the resources , the talent , the ability
we âve got to make sure we come out for the world cup and deliver
