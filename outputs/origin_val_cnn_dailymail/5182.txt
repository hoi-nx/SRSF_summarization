a jetblue pilot who had to be restrained during a 2012 flight after shouting about jesus and al-qaeda sued for more than $ 16 million friday , claiming the airline failed to recognize and address his mental condition
the suit filed by former captain osbon three years after his meltdown on a flight from new york to las vegas , comes amid increased scrutiny of how major airlines evaluate pilots ' mental health in the wake of the allegedly intentional crash of a germanwings osbon , 52 , claims in the lawsuit that officials at jetblue missed several indications that something was wrong with his mental health the day of the flight , noting he missed a pre-flight meeting for the first time in years and arrived to fly disheveled and disoriented
after a co-pilot locked osbon out of the cockpit , he ' ran down the aisles screaming and ranting concerning imagined terrorism and the need for all on board on embrace religion
' the lawsuit alleges that jetblue allowed the flight to continue for three hours and ' unnecessarily endangered the lives of captain osbon , the crew and the 135 passengers
' there were no injuries on the flight , which eventually made an emergency landing in amarillo , texas
the meltdown resulted from a complex partial brain seizure that ' severely impaired his ability to perform basic activities , caused him to hallucinate , and caused extreme feelings of paranoia and religious fervor , ' according to the suit
the lawsuit also alleges the airline routinely ignored crew members ' impairment , whether by alcohol , drugs or mental and emotional distress , in order to protect their careers
hospitalized : osbon , right , is led out by fbi agents after being released from texas hospital in amarillo following his mid-air breakdown veteran captain : osbon , left , was an experienced pilot but a ' complex partial brain seizure ' impaired his brain functions and caused him to hallucinate , according to the lawsuit nearly three dozen passengers sued jetblue in 2012 for being ' grossly negligent ' by allowing osbon to fly with unchecked mental issues
jetblue eventually settled the lawsuit in april of the following year for an undisclosed sum
after the flight was grounded in texas , osbon was indicted on charges of interfering with a flight crew and found not guilty by reason of insanity
among other conditions of his sentence , osbon was ordered not to board a commercial or private plane without permission from a probation officer
osbon remains suspended on medical leave , no longer collecting what once was a more than $ 300,000 annual salary
the lawsuit states he has not suffered a seizure since beginning a regimen of prescription medication .
