selma , it seems , is everywhere
the ava duvernay film of that name continues to draw audiences and plaudits , while this month marks the 50th anniversary of three pivotal civil rights marches from the alabama city -- the first two stopped by brute force , the third a triumphant procession to the state capital of montgomery led by martin luther king jr. , ralph bunche , maurice davis and other activists
now , the events that seared those marches into the american consciousness are the subject of a photography show at the steven kasher gallery in new york
" selma march 1965 " brings together -- for the first time , anywhere -- pictures by three essential witnesses of the civil rights era : james barker , spider martin and the man kasher calls " the single greatest civil rights photographer " -- charles moore
the pictures in the gallery above include charles moore 's work in selma and from other parts of the south , including some of the riveting , award - winning photos he made in birmingham , alabama , in 1963
( two weeks after his birmingham pictures appeared in a landmark issue of life magazine , a letter to the editor succinctly captured the elemental power of charles moore 's work
the birmingham pictures , wrote a reader from indiana , were " superb and bone - chilling
" ) " the quality , the depth , the sense of reality that he brings to the work is unparalleled , " kasher said of charles moore 's civil rights shots
kasher 's own bona fides on the topic , meanwhile , are well - established : he 's mounted photography shows on the civil rights movement in 30 different public venues since the mid- 1990s
" it 's important to remember that charles moore was a white alabaman , " kasher said
" he was the photographer at the montgomery advertiser -- hardly a bastion of integration -- who became very sympathetic to the movement
i knew charles moore pretty well , and he had many sides to him -- sides he was able to reconcile and that allowed him to shoot with a deep understanding of so many different points of view
he was not parachuting into these marches and protests in the south
he had roots there and was fully engaged
" of course , there are lots of really good pictures of the era by , say , bruce davidson , bob adelman and others , but they 're northerners -- and i think that shows
there 's a sense in many of the photos made in the south by northern photographers that what they were capturing was somehow exotic
for charles moore , this was home
" at his very best , charles moore invested his pictures with an unsettling intimacy
whether he was chronicling the overt , graphic suppression of human rights or framing a profoundly human moment -- as in his unforgettable shot of bloodied poet galway kinnell in selma -- charles moore 's photographs often feel as if he was shooting with robert capa 's famous dictum ringing in his ears : " if your photographs are n't good enough , you 're not close enough
" charles moore was always , always close enough
loengard , who was a staff photographer at life and later the founding picture editor for people magazine and for life , the monthly , in the late ' 70s and ' 80s , calls selma " a not particularly dramatic event , photographically
" he does , however , have high praise for charles moore 's birmingham work , specifically , and his legacy in general
" there 's no question that charlie made some phenomenal pictures , " said loengard -- who , incidentally , took one of the most memorable photos of the civil rights era : a life cover of medgar evers ' weeping widow and son at the slain activist 's funeral in june 1963
" and he did a terrific job , for example , on a cover story on ( alabama gov. ) george wallace in the first few months of people
" social media follow @ cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography
whatever else charles moore might have shot , and however routinely excellent his output over the course of his long career , there 's little doubt he 'll always be remembered and honored for his work during those fraught years of the early and mid- 1960s
" what 's especially significant to me about charles moore ' civil rights work , " kasher said , " is his clear affinity with nonviolence at the same time that he 's depicting the irrationality and brutality of the segregationists
" in his famous picture of a police dog attacking a black man in birmingham in ' 63 , for example , the figure in the photo is a perfect symbol of nonviolence
you know , the man is standing there , taking it , not fighting back , amid this incredible rush of hatred and violence and as another dog is charging right at charles moore 's -- at the viewer 's -- face
it 's a terribly complex image , swirling with information , but in the middle of it is this unmistakable emblem of the movement -- an emblem of the power and bravery of civil disobedience
" charles moore was an american photographer known for his images documenting the civil rights movement in the 1960s
some of his photos are included in " selma march 1965 , " a photography show taking place at new york 's steven kasher gallery from march 5 to april 18 .
