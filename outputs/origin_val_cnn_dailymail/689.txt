two - time masters champion bubba watson believes he can freewheel at augusta this year because all the pressure will be heaped on rory mcilroy as he goes for the career grand slam
bubba watson failed miserably the last time he was in the limelight as defending champion , only just making the halfway cut at augusta in 2013

reigning masters champions prepares for augusta by playing at the wgc cadillac championships in doral bubba watson insists that rory mcilroy will be under more pressure than himself at the masters the world no 1 only needs an masters crown to complete a full set of grand slams â there âs no pressure on me because i have two green jackets already , but it will be different for rory mcilroy , â he said
â to be going for the career grand slam and at such a young age as well , if that was me in his shoes i would consider myself under a lot of pressure because who would not want to complete that ? i think the key for rory mcilroy will be to try to look at it from an achievement standpoint rather than a pressure situation â that he âs there because of the amazing feat of winning three of the four majors at aged 25
' he can also think to himself that if it does nât work out this year , then at least he is going to have plenty more tries in years to come
â like rory mcilroy , bubba watson will complete his pre-masters tournament preparations at the arnold palmer invitational , which begins at bay hill in orlando on thursday

â and yet here âs rory mcilroy with all these tournaments he âs won already

â bubba watson , of course , is not exactly short of talent himself
twelve months on , people still talk about the pivotal drive he hit at the par five 13th during the final round at augusta last year , that cleared the corner to set up victory â a carry of a mere 360 yards
â i did push it a bit , â admitted the gifted leftie
â lucky for me i hit it well and so it carried all the trouble , and i had just a sand wedge for my second shot and made birdie

but i âll feel like a kid again when i get to augusta
