' my body used to be to please men , but my body is for me now and it is to please me , now i feel like i have 100 per cent control over who i am
' she continued : ' if guys do n't like my body now that 's actually a good thing , that means i 'm shedding the playboy image
' when i see guys saying oh you 're fat , i 'm like " yes ! i 'm glad i do n't turn you on any more because i do n't want to do that any more ! " ' kendra ( left ) with fellow playmates bridget marquardt ( second left ) and holly madison ( right , with hugh hefner ( second right ) at a playboy mansion party in 2005 the reality star , who last year came sixth on i 'm a celebrity ... get me out of here , is now so far removed from her old glamour girl persona that she is planning on having her breast implants removed
she said : ' i 'm going through a phase right now where i do n't fit my boobs anymore - i 'm thinking about a reduction because that was a phase and now i am out of it
' after my daughter was born , when i was breastfeeding it became hard not to look at my boobs now and see them as milk and fat
' the person i feel like today is n't a person with big boobs - i feel like i 'm trapped in this body right now
' kendra with her son hank baskett ( left ) , husband hank and daughter alijah mary but while she may be having second thoughts about her chest , the star reveals she has never been happier with her figure since becoming a mother
she said : ' before having my kids i was a free spirit
i had no filters and i could run around naked and feel free as i felt like i had no flaws
' but then again , there were only certain jeans i could fit into because i was a size zero ( uk size 4 ) , while at the playboy mansion - i had no butt and no hips
' after two kids , i have hips , a butt and curves
' i actually love my body even more now because i remember being that thin and wishing i could fit into high - waisted jeans and sophisticated dresses but they just looked frumpy on me
' while kendra was in the playboy mansion , she was a tiny size zero ( uk size 4 ) according to kendra , her husband hank baskett , who she married at the playboy mansion in june 2009 is equally impressed by his wife 's new curves
she said : ' i think he sees my confidence over everything and that 's what he loves the most
' he loves my body , i have some wear and tear right now with my stomach but he talks to me about it all of the time
' he says if we do n't have sex one day it feels like a beautiful ferrari that 's in the garage that he ca n't drive every day
' but while she is now more confident than ever with her body , kendra did n't feel this way until recently
during her first pregnancy with hank baskett , the star admits that she piled on the weight because she took the phrase ' eating for two ' literally , like many women
she said : ' because i was so skinny beforehand , i just ate and ate , then did no exercise
' i put on 65lbs in my first pregnancy and it took me so long to get rid of it
' i tried for about a year and nothing was working
' kendra and hank at the ' dead rising : watchtower ' film premiere in la last week kendra with her children last autumn what made it worse was that , like many women , kendra started to compare her progress with celebrities in magazines
she said : ' kourtney kardashian was pregnant with her first child at the same time that i was pregnant with mine - we gave birth about two days apart
' the afterwards , her weight just dropped off
' i saw a picture of her looking all tiny and i just burst into tears
' i was thinking to myself , " i 'm going to the gym twice a day , i 'm getting these special meals delivered to my house , why ca n't i look like that ? " ' we do this to ourselves as women , but we should n't - it takes some a lot longer than others to lose the weight
' before she became pregnant a second time , with her daughter alijah mary baskett , who was born last may , kendra was diagnosed with hypothyroidism
after meeting with an endocrinologist , she overhauled her lifestyle , focusing on exercise and healthy eating
kendra pregnant with her daughter while out and about with her son last april in la she said : ' in my second pregnancy , i was so much more active and ate really healthy food - my cravings the second time around were oranges and mangoes
' it made such a huge difference , because even though i put on about 55lbs , which is around 10lbs less than last time , i knew that it was good fat that was coming from a healthy place
' then straight after i gave birth , about 20lbs just melted away
i was walking around the neighbourhood just three days later and i felt great , even though i 'd just had a c - section
' i still had another 20lbs or so to lose , but i did n't rush myself and it came off a lot easier than the last time
' although when i went in the jungle for i 'm a celebrity , that was brilliant , the last bit just came straight off ! ' this point she is keen to stress - that she gave herself time to lose the weight
kendra poses at the " girls of the playboy mansion " dvd signing in la in 2006 kendra being evicted from i 'm a celebrity last december like most other women , she too looks at some of the celebrities who show off six - packs just a few weeks after giving birth and is flabbergasted
she said : ' that 's the time that your body should be recovering , when you should be spending time with your baby and letting yourself heal
' it 's such a taboo
' you can see how it happens though , because the camera adds weight , so people who are on tv think that they need to lose weight so they will look slimmer on camera
' then they end up looking to skinny in photos
' but i have to be realistic with myself
' for me , i take my own selfies and see how i look through that , because i try not to go off the scale , just by how the way i fit in clothes and the way i look in selfies
