a man who found a travel partner after raffling his ex-fiancee 's honeymoon place has returned from an ' amazing holiday ' - but claims there was no romance
john whitbread , 32 , - who became known as john - advertised on ebay after his girlfriend told him at christmas she did not want to get married
desperate to find a holiday partner for the Â£ 1,950 trip to the dominican republic , john , from donisthorpe , leicestershire , tried to find a companion for the trip on ebay
finally , after instead selling Â£ 10 raffle tickets - raising Â£ 1,410 for testicular cancer charity balls to cancer he jetted off to the caribbean with lucky winner kelly wood - who he met for the first time at the airport
john said he is constantly asked if they have become a couple
but he said this could not have been further from his mind
he said : ' everyone is hoping i 've found romance again
i only recently split up with my girlfriend
' he added : ' i have made a friend out of it and it 's brilliant
it could have easily gone the other way
' to go on holiday with a complete stranger and get on is incredible
the pair admitted they were both feeling the nerves , as miss kelly wood told good morning britain her hands were shaking and mr john whitbread said he did n't know what to do with himself ' hopefully we will stay friends
i do n't see why not
' ms kelly wood , an attractive blonde , wrote on facebook : ' we are having a fantastic time and getting on like a house on fire as they say ! ' she later added : ' such great memories to take away with me though and an amazing new friend for life ! ! john whitbread was dumped by his ex-fiancee amy just weeks before their valentine 's day wedding ' loved every second of this crazy adventure ! ! could n't have asked for more ! ! ' mr john whitbread was left heartbroken after his ex-fiancÃ©e amy told him she was n't ' ready to get married ' and left him with a spare ticket to the dominican republic
instead of cancelling the trip , mr john whitbread decided to give the opportunity to a stranger to join him by auctioning off the Â£ 1,950 ticket , with offers starting at 99p
but when the two highest bidders - who offered Â£ 8,000 and Â£ 7,900 - failed to pay up he decided to raffle off the tickets for Â£ 10 instead
he was united with raffle winner kelly wood for the first time on itv just under two hours before he was due to board the plane at manchester airport for the two - week all inclusive break
the advert said his desired companion must be an ' easy going down to earth ' woman , a british citizen with a passport and ' good looking would n't go amiss '
arriving at the airport with his parents , mr john whitbread waited anxiously to see if the woman would arrive
he said : ' i feel nervous
i do n't know what to do with myself
i know her name is kelly and what she looks like but i 'm trying to save it all for the plane
' mr john whitbread was undecided on how he would greet her and was debating whether to give her a hug , a kiss - or ' a high five ' and added ' i 'll see what comes naturally '
when they were finally introduced by a television crew they gave each other a hug
instead of cancelling the honeymoon he decided to auction off the tickets to a stranger who might like to join him
the two highest ebay bidders failed to pay up , so he decided to sell raffle tickets instead miss kelly wood , who had set up her own facebook campaign called ' take kelly wood ' said : ' i 'm nervous - my hands have just started to shake
i feel like a swan , quite calm on the front but underneath i 'm paddling away
' a television crew from good morning britain , which filmed the moment they first met , asked the pair a few ' john whitbread & mrs ' style questions before they boarded the plane
asked who would get the window seat miss wood offered it up to mr john whitbread and whether they were thrill seekers or beach babes they agreed they were a bit of both
miss kelly wood also revealed that she ' sleeps in the middle of the bed ' and the worst habit mr john whitbread could have would be snoring , which he previously revealed he did
his new companion was then introduced to mr john whitbread 's parents , who embraced her and their son
the pair flew to the caribbean region , where they stayed in the honeymoon suite in single beds , and returned on march 3
this is the moment the pair first met live on breakfast television this morning
before then all they knew were each others names and what they looked like
mr john whitbread said he wanted to save chatting for the plane explaining his decision to sell off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said : ' i was gutted when she said she did n't want to get married but i realised i could n't mope forever and i did n't want what i 'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste
' besides , i think it will be good for me to get away
i 'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun
' he claims his girlfriend of two years , amy , told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on valentine 's day this year
but when he tried to cancel their holiday the co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him
with the help of his best friend craig gibson , he set up an ebay auction to find someone to travel with him
mr john whitbread , who described himself as a slim , 5ft 9in , with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh , wrote on the advert : ' i 'm not boring , i 'm adventurous otherwise i would n't be doing something as ridiculous as this '
the pair stayed for two weeks at the honeymoon suite at the blue bay villas hotel in the dominican republic kelly wood had campaigned to win the ticket and was introduced to her holiday partner for the first time at the airport
miss kelly wood compared herself to feeling like a swan - fine on the surface but paddling underneath although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry on valentine 's day , mr john whitbread says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee
speaking after the split , he said : ' i 'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - i suppose i 've got to respect her honesty
' but i 'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by
' when i found out at the travel agent i could only get half my money back i was looking at other deals and places i could go but i thought , ' no , i wanted to go on this holiday '
' i called my best friend and he agreed so i headed straight to his house to make the ebay page
' everyone i know is taken and i 'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that i 'd never otherwise get to meet
mr john whitbread admitted he could only get half his money back from the travel agent and decided he wanted to go on this holiday but would like some female company a friend help him set up an advert where he asked for an ' easy going down to earth ' woman , a british citizen with a passport and ' good looking would n't go amiss ' ' i 'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before
' i 'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday
if the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too
' after being overwhelmed with the response , mr john whitbread pledged to donate any money over Â£ 1,050 to testicular cancer research
he added : ' people have said i 've got real balls to do this so i thought i might as well try and make some money for charity if i can to
' kelly wood set up her own facebook page to get people to buy tickets and donate to mr john whitbread 's cause and eventually won the seat herself
she posted this message this morning after keeping her win a secret his ex-girlfriend amy said : ' i just did n't feel ready to get married and john was n't my soulmate
obviously it 's difficult for john , i 'm finding it hard too
' it 's obviously not nice to finish with someone over christmas but i thought it was better that he knew now , sooner rather than later
' it was better that i called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it
' fair play to john
i 'm pleased that he 's doing something positive
