nguyen , 44 , was discovered unresponsive at tu nghiem temple in santa ana at 9.15am , according to police
nguyen 's death by hanging comes more than three weeks after police were called to the temple on west fourth street in response to an angry crowd of people demanding that he return close to $ 100,000 he had collected from them
the monk allegedly had told congregants the money would be used towards a trip to vietnam that never took place
santa ana police said nguyen raised anywhere between $ 1,100 and $ 7,700 from 34 people , allegedly pocketing a total of $ 97,000 for himself
the members of the temple community expected to fly out to vietnam march 2 and tour the country 's buddhist landmarks
but on march 1 , they found out about the scam and converged on the tu nghiem temple in the little saigon part of santa ana at around 11am , calling on nguyen to give them their money back , reported the los angeles times
the monk was discovered unresponsive at tu nghiem temple in little saigon section of santa ana when confronted with the allegations of fraud , nguyen claimed that the plane tickets and travel documents , including passports , had been destroyed in a fire that broke out at the temple february 28 ; but police later determined that that monk never booked any tickets
the 44 - year - old nguyen , who spoke no english , then changed his story , telling investigators that he did receive plane tickets , but they were fake
he claimed that his agent in vietnam was supposed to make all the necessary travel arrangements for the planned pilgrimage
he then blamed the deception on an unnamed person who delivered them to his apartment at the santa ana sanctuary just hours before the fire
the blaze inside the one - story temple , which was founded six years ago , has been ruled suspicious , according to officials
santa ana police will be reviewing bank records , emails and phone call logs to determine if other people were involved in the fraud
nguyen 's death left his small congregation divided , with some accusing him of being a swindler while others , like truc tam , praising him as a kind - hearted person who was always eager to help those in need .
