dr lindsey doe , a blogger under the name ' doe eyes ' who specializes in sexual harassment , dedicated her latest clip to the teenager who has approached her daughter at school , on the bus , and with poems - despite multiple rejections
in a post titled dear boy who likes my daughter , that has amassed more than 250,000 views , lindsey doe explains that pursuing somebody without consent is harassment
instead , she advises , he should write about his feelings in a diary
] are you confused ? you probably picked up messages from society about how when you want something , you have to " try harder , go at it , do whatever you can to get it
do nât give up ! " ' maybe it âs for this reason that you repeatedly ask my daughter out
in the halls , on the bus , and you write her poems
' for his own understanding , she explains the appropriate way to act after asking a girl out
if she says ' i do n't know ' , give her space
' maybe ' prompts a conversation about her feelings of uncertainty
only in the instance that she says ' ask me again later ' should he ask again - but much later
lindsey doe , who blogs on youtube as ' doe eyes ' , explains that he is harassing her daughter with his requests if he wants to express his feelings , she explains , he should write a diary or speak to a trusted friend but her daughter , she says , has simply responded : ' no thanks ' , ' stop asking me ' , and ' no , no go away '
' person who likes my daughter , this goes for all aspects of your life , ' lindsey doe says
' if someone tells you " no " in any way and you ask again , it 's not cool , it 's not attractive , it 's not respectful , it 's harassment
' my daughter has the right to change her mind and the ability to let you know if she does
' until then i expect that you do not ask her out , do not suggest a relationship , do not talk to her about her discomfort with you pursuing her
