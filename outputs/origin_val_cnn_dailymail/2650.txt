scientists have developed a necklace dubbed the â diet choker â that monitors everything that goes down your throat - and sends you an alert if you overeat
wearsens is a metal ring that goes around your neck and has a sensor which uses the vibrations in your throat to tell when you are eating and drinking
the researchers behind the device have linked it up to a smartphone app which buzzes if you go over your daily calorie limit
scientists have combined wearsens , a metal ring that goes around the neck ( above ) to monitor eating , with a smartphone app which counts calories it also lets you know if you eat too much of the wrong kind of food
the device was developed by engineers at the ucla , los angeles and so far the tests on 30 people show that the it does work
but the reaction elsewhere has been mixed reaction and some tech websites likened it to a choke collar , though it does not contract if you eat too much
another website , bustle.com , dubbed it the â weirdest ( tech ) wearable we have seen to date â
the ucla team said the wearsens works because each food makes a distinctive pattern of vibrations in the neck so the device is able to work out what it is you are consuming using a piezoelectric sensor , which measures changes in pressure or force
in tests with a limited menu it has guessed with 90 per cent accuracy the difference between solid and liquid foods - and even the difference between hot or cold drinks
it could also distinguish between hard and soft foods about 75 per cent of the time , the findings in the journal ieee sensors said
wearsens co-founder majid sarrafzadeh said : â many nutrition methods are based on writing down what you eat
â but this method has low compliance so we wanted to overcome these issues and wanted to do something that a pedometer does for activity â
scientists are hopeful the technology will also tell users when they are eating the wrong types of food ( file image ) in a demonstration posted on youtube , the device asks for the user âs age , height , weight and their goal such as to lose weight or stay the same
it will then tell them what they have eaten , how fast they eat their food and gives them advice such as if you miss a meal it mentions how it could leave you fatigued
the ucla researchers said that other applications they could see for the device included tracking when somebody takes a pill to ensure they take their daily medicine
it could also remotely monitor breathing patterns of transplant patients as abnormal breathing may be an early indicator that the organ is being rejected
even smokers who are trying to quit could benefit from the device as it could potentially tell when they are puffing away from the movement in their neck
the wearsens is the latest example of the growing industry of wearable tech and comes on the day that apple is due to release details of its long - awaited smart watch
major tech companies are banking on consumers taking to the wave of wristbands , watches and eyewear that augments the functions of their smartphone
last year google launched its range of android wear which includes a watch which allows you to check your email or send a text , meaning you do nât have to reach into your pocket for your phone
the latest update to apple âs operating system for its iphone includes a â health â app which monitors how many steps a person takes each day like a pedometer
not all wearable tech has been a success however and google âs controversial eyewear , google glass , was axed in the uk after less than a year of limited release
google closed it explorer programme , which gave select people the chance to buy google glass for Â£ 990 , after a privacy backlash and because consumers did not take to the futuristic design
google glass , which apple priced at Â£ 990 , was axed in the uk after less than a year of limited release
