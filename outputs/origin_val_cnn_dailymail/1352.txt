up to 30 babies and mothers died at a scandal - hit hospital because of failings by midwives and doctors , a damning report is expected to reveal
the independent inquiry into baby deaths within university hospitals of morecambe bay nhs foundation trust will show that the scale of the scandal was much worse than previously feared
it had been thought that 16 babies and two mothers had died as a result of shambolic care over nearly ten years at a maternity ward within furness general hospital in cumbria
tragedy : joshua titcombe was nine days old when he died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics at furness general hospital , cumbria but after highlighting concerns in around 50 cases , investigators are expected to conclude that neglect contributed to even more deaths
health officials have tried to cover up their failure to properly investigate poor patient care on the unit
despite multiple warnings about failings between 2001 and 2012 , the cqc gave the hospital a clean bill of health in 2010
the failure to strike off any nurse , doctor or midwife working at the hospital has enraged victims â families
concerns were first raised in september 2008 when joshua titcombe , who was nine days old , died from an infection that should have been treated with antibiotics
his father james said it was â appalling â that nobody has been disciplined for the failings that led to the deaths and described the accountability process as â ridiculously slow â
up to 30 babies and mothers died at furness general hospital because of failings by midwives and doctors , a damning report is expected to reveal mr joshua titcombe said : â it âs been six years since joshua titcombe died and we have should been finding out about [ the care failings ] at the time
it âs a sign of how closed and secretive the nhs was
â we were faced with obstacle after obstacle which is an indictment of how the nhs was run at the time
â what happened to protecting mothers and babies ? the timescale is a disgrace
â he said there was no reason why culpable nurse and doctors could not have been held to account before the report was published
a number of midwives from the hospital are due to face the nmc ( nmc ) later this year in relation to deaths at the hospital
grief : james and hoa titcombe lost their baby son joshua titcombe in 2008 mr joshua titcombe added : â for joshua titcombe to have died in 2008 and the nmc âs processes to still be ongoing is absolutely appalling
how can that be protecting mothers and babies ? â there has been a real failure in the way the professional regulators have worked
â the independent inquiry into the trust , expected to be published next month , was finally ordered by ministers due to mounting concerns over the deaths of at least eight mothers and babies
while officials continued to cover up the extent of the hospital âs problems , a police investigation was eventually launched after repeated complaints from victims â families
the report is expected to lay some of the blame on the â dysfunctional â relationship between midwives and doctors on the ward , according to the sunday times
the widespread â loss â of medical records that contained vital medical information , such as in the case of joshua titcombe , will also be highlighted
an internal review published in march 2010 highlighted concerns about the maternity unit including the relations between staff
the cqc , however , failed to read the report and passed the hospital as â safe â a year later
when a cqc official produced a dossier showing the inspection was flawed , bosses told him to destroy it to protect the commission âs reputation
the extent to which officals have tried to deflect attention from the failing hospital has been branded â rotten â by ministers and likened to the mid-staffordshire trust cover - up
the cqc and the parliamentary and health service ombudsman are also thought to be in line for criticism in dr bill kirkup âs report
it will raise more questions about how medical staff and those tasked with inspecting the quality of care provided are held to account
a string of senior staff at the trust have â stepped down â from their jobs with lucrative pay packets - but nobody has been sacked
others linked to the alleged cover - up have also left their roles , with families expected to continue with legal action against the trust following the report âs publication
former chief executive of the morecambe bay trust , tony halsall , left in march with a Â£ 225,000 pay - off and has since moved to the private sector
jill finney , former deputy chief executive of the cqc , was awarded Â£ 60,000 for distress after she was accused covering up a cqc report
she always denied the allegation
the morecombe bay trust however has refused to say whether it has taken any action against any staff members or whether the nurses are still employed .
