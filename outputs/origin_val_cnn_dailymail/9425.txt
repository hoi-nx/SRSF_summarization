mcdonald 's says it plans to start using chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health and milk from cows that are not treated with an artificial growth hormone
the company says the chicken change will take place within the next two years
it says suppliers will still be able to use a type of antibiotic called ionophores that keep chickens healthy and are n't used in humans
the milk change will take place later this year
many cattle , hog and poultry producers give their livestock antibiotics to make them grow faster and ensure they are healthy
the practice has become a public health issue , with officials saying it can lead to germs becoming resistant to drugs so that they 're no longer effective in treating a particular illness in humans
mcdonald 's says it plans to start using chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine and milk from cows that are not treated with the artificial growth hormone rbst chipotle and panera already say they serve chicken raised without antibiotics , but the announcement by mcdonald 's corp. is notable because of its size ; the company has more than 14,000 u.s. locations
chipotle has nearly 1,800 locations , while panera has almost 1,900 locations
' this really does move the ball quite a bit , ' said hansen , a senior officer with the antibiotic resistance project with the pew charitable trusts
hansen noted that ionophores , the antibiotics that will be allowed by mcdonald 's corp. , are not considered medically important for humans
the announcement comes as mcdonald 's corp. struggles to transform its image amid intensifying competition from smaller rivals positioning themselves as more wholesome alternatives
the company has long battled negative perceptions about its food , but that has become a bigger vulnerability as more people shift toward options they feel are made with ingredients that are higher quality or meet standards on social responsibility
after seeing customer visits to u.s. stores decline two years in a row , mcdonald 's had recently hinted changes could be on the way
franchisees were told of the chicken and milk changes tuesday night at a ' turnaround summit ' in las vegas
taylor , a mcdonald 's franchisee who was at the conference , said ingredients are ' becoming more and more important ' to customers
and he said the company was suggesting it needs to ' be where our consumers want and need us to be
' ' you 're going to see more stuff like that in the future , ' taylor said
in a statement , chicken supplier tyson said it looks forward to working with mcdonald 's to meet its new standards
tyson noted it has reduced the use of antibiotics effective on humans by more than 84 percent since 2011
caroline smith dewaal , food safety director at the center for science in the public interest , said mcdonald 's decision to sell milk produced without rbst was a good step because the growth hormone can cause health problems in dairy cows
as mcdonald 's fights to hold onto customers , the company has also made a number of leadership changes , admissions of shortcomings and declarations that changes are in the works
the pressures reached the top of the company in late january , when the company said ceo don thompson would be replaced by easterbrook , its chief brand officer
the ceo change officially took effect this week , and easterbrook was at the franchisee summit in las vegas
already , mcdonald 's had been pushing back at critics
last year , it launched a campaign inviting people to ask frank , sometimes squeamish questions about its food , such as whether its beef contained worms ( the answer was no )
mcdonald 's has also been hammering home the fact that it cracks fresh eggs in stores to make its mcmuffins in ad and signs in stores
