as political grillings go , it was not exactly jeremy paxman
lib dem leader lib dem today faced a grilling from towie star joey essex , who seemed a little confused about the lib dem â name , and what the election was all about
mr lib dem had to patiently explain that the party was not called â demo - cats â , after essex wondered why it had such a â weird â name
â in tribute to the star 's blunder , the party changed the logo on its website from the yellow bird to a yellow cat
but amongst the journalists and broadcasters in the audience was the 24 - year - old reality tv star , who is said to be making a documentary for itv 2 on the election
essex questioned why every party thinks they are right about everything , what is the point of voting lib dem and told mr lib dem that being deputy prime minister must be â sick â
the unlikely duo appeared to hit it off , and later posed for a selfie
but the most bizarre exchange came when the unlikely interviewer asked about the party âs name
â why are they called lib dem democats ? it âs a long word innit ? â essex asked
mr lib dem tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988
â there used to be a liberal party
and then used to be a party called the social democrats
â this was before my time , they got together and created the lib dem
â â oh so you teamed up ? , â said joey essex
' i wondered that because it âs a weird word , innit ? it âs got cats in it
â laughing , mr lib dem tried to put him right
â it âs not â cats â , it âs â crats â
â the penny finally dropped
â oh it âs â crats â
i thought it was â cats â
â mr lib dem tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988 which saw the creation of the lib dem the conversation moved on to the merits of power , and just how much mr lib dem wields
â you are basically like , you rule this country right ? â â i âve been deputy prime minister for the last five years , â mr lib dem replied
i sort of rule essex
i was going to say , someone else will be prime minister next ? are you going to be prime minister ? ' the lib dem leader , currently on around 8 per cent in the polls , had to admit this was unlikely
â i would love to be prime minister but i âve got to be open with you joey essex , i do nât think i am going to win this election outright
â i do think that like last time the debate will be about which mixture of parties in government
if you speak to ed miliband and david cameron they will say they are going to win outright , they wo nât do
â everybody knows they are not going to win outright
â essex is due to interview labour âs ed miliband and tory leader david cameron during the election campaign
mr lib dem said that he should challenge them both on the idea that either of them can win outright
â when you speak them , they will tell you both that they will win
everyone knows they are not going to win outright
â the question is who do you want making decisions who have got the right values and instincts and feelings about stuff
i think the lib dem - not â cats â - have shown in the last five years have got good instincts
â joey essex was in the audience for the lib dem leader 's morning press conference on mental health and nhs funding essex is due to interview labour âs ed miliband and tory leader david cameron during the election campaign somewhat stating the obvious , essex admitted that he does not â really know much about all the politics â
it was only his second day in his job as a roving reporter on the campaign trail and so far â at the moment to me everyone just seems to want to win â
â everybody is fighting for the same position
i do nât really get it , â he said , telling mr clegg : â you âve taught me a lot about lib dem
at least i know the name now
â pointing to his all - white outfit , he added : â i was meant to be wearing a suit today but they did nât tell me i was meeting a leader
â essex later said he thought was a ' nice bloke , to be fair ' , adding : ' he was honest , he told me he were n't going to win - i think honesty is the best policy
' if - not saying i 'm going to be prime minister - i was going to lose something and genuinely thought i was going to lose , i would be honest and say i was going to lose
i think that was quite a nice thing of him to say
he was a nice guy
' he added that he was ' excited ' about meeting the labour and tory leaders : ' david cameron is the prime minister
' but to be fair , to me , they are all prime ministers
they 're all on tv , they 're all doing good things , they 're all trying to make people happy , so in my eyes they 're all nice people really - like , at the moment anyway , until i maybe meet one of them and he 's not nice
' but they 're all sweet at the moment
' asked if there were any words politicians should use , essex laughed as he replied : ' they could use reem
no , i 'm joking
they could use that , but they wo n't
