britons left wheelchair - bound by multiple sclerosis can walk , run and even dance again after being given a pioneering stem cell treatment
doctors have described the recoveries as â miraculous â , while patients say they have been given their lives back
the treatment uses a patient âs own stem cells â the body âs master cells â to fight the disease
recovery : ms sufferer drewery became wheelchair - bound after the birth of daughter isla , but thanks to the stem cell transplant she can dance , run and chase after isla in the park if it fulfils its early promise , it could be the first therapy that does not just slow the damage done by the condition , but reverses it
professor sharrack , of the royal hallamshire hospital in sheffield , said : â since we started treating patients some three years ago some of the results have been miraculous
today , drewery can run after her daughter isla
two years ago she could take her for a walk only if someone pushed her wheelchair while she held on to isla âs pushchair
miss drewery , 25 , of sheffield , pictured with isla , was diagnosed with ms after suffering numbness and blurred vision
she became wheelchair - bound after her health worsened on isla âs birth
she needed help with basic tasks and could nât even wiggle her toes
three weeks after the stem cell transplant she was able to walk out of hospital
now , more than 18 months on , she is almost back to normal
she has a part - time office job and , although she still gets tired , can dance , run and chase after isla , two , in the park
she said : â all i wanted to be able to do is take isla out
i am more or less back to normal
â sam ramsey collapsed when out celebrating her 22nd birthday and six weeks later was paralysed from the neck down by ms other treatments failed but now , after the stem cell treatment , miss ramsey , 25 , of newark in nottinghamshire , can walk on crutches , has passed her driving test and ordered a car
she told the sunday times : â this treatment has given me my life back
â ' this is not a word i would use lightly but we have seen profound neurological improvements
â however , more research is needed to prove the patients are not just experiencing a temporary remission , which does happen in ms the neurological condition , which is more common in women than men , usually strikes those in their 20s and 30s and affects 2.5million people worldwide , including 100,000 britons
it can cause blindness and paralysis , but current drugs are not suitable for all and there is no cure
the disease occurs when â friendly fire â from the body âs immune system destroys myelin , the fatty protective sheath around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord , disrupting the transmission of vital signals
the sheffield treatment uses the stem cells to â reboot â the immune system so that it stops attacking the body and brain
first , a sample of the patient âs blood is taken and stem cells are removed from it and stored
the patient is then given a high dose of chemotherapy to wipe out their faulty immune system
finally , they are given their stem cells back
as master cells , they are able to form a new , healthy immune system
the transplant has a one - off cost of around Â£ 30,000 , similar to the amount spent on some patients â drugs each year
as well as stopping the disease in its tracks the treatment , known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation , seems to heal damage that has already been done
sam ramsey , 25 , of newark , pictured with her mother tina , was paralysed as result of her ms , but now , after treatment , she can walk on crutches and has passed her driving test a number of ms sufferers were given pioneering therapy at the royal hallamshire hospital in sheffield multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is a chronic disease that attacks the central nervous system ( the brain , spinal cord and optic nerves )
the progress , severity and specific symptoms of ms can not be predicted
ms is a lifelong disease for which a cause and cure are yet to be found ; however , doctors and scientists are making discoveries about the treatment and management of ms every day
the visible and hidden symptoms of ms are unpredictable and vary from person to person and from time to time in the same person
however , symptoms can include difficulties walking , pain , dizziness , slurred speech , emotional and mood changes , memory problems and extreme tiredness
a man who was blind in one eye has almost normal vision again
a woman in canada who needed 24 - hour care appears free of ms more than a decade after being given a transplant of her own stem cells
despite these dramatic improvements , the treatment is not suitable for all patients
a us trial on almost 150 , reported last month in the journal of the american medical association , showed it to help roughly half the time
there are also concerns about complications including potentially lethal infections
professor sharrack and colleagues are seeking patients with relapsing - remitting ms , the most common form , for an nhs - funded trial
the ms society described the sheffield work as â very encouraging â and said it is eagerly awaiting the results of larger trials .
