greaves did not attend wembley on sunday
a lot of people tend to get upset when this happens
the one who does nât is greaves
if he wanted to go , as a guest of either chelsea or spurs , his former clubs , he could have secured a ticket , no problem
the football league would probably love to have him , too
the issue is nât that greaves is short of invitations
he âs just not that into it
greaves was a great player , and does n't need a fuss around him when he decides not to attend games this can happen when you âre 75
greaves thinks of wembley and , as much as the match â which he would enjoy â he imagines the queues of traffic on the north circular , the hassles of parking and of spending the hour before kick - off having a big fuss made about his presence when he would rather be sat with a pot of tea in front of liverpool and manchester city and then the rugby
truth be told , if ireland versus england captured his attention , he might even have delayed changing channels until it was over
he finds it strange that people are still interested in getting him to wembley
we want our heroes to behave like besotted fans , but jim âs interests were always broader
greaves ' interests were always broader than just football , and he should be left to enjoy his retirement he liked playing , and was quite brilliant at it , but since retiring he âs as likely to be engrossed in a test match as a cup final , and he has nât the ego to wish to be feted wherever he goes
he does nât claim to be an expert on the modern game , having not been a part of it for so long , but feels no animosity towards the premier league or its high - earning players
for a man whose problems with alcohol led him to a psychiatric unit shortly after retirement , the second act of jim âs life has been a triumph
we should perhaps acknowledge this , rather than wonder why he is nât constantly seeking attention or another lap of honour
we should wish every former athlete the quiet contentment of greaves
greaves does n't claim to be an expert about the modern game , and did n't want to attend the league cup fianl
