michel platini has backed fa chairman greg dyke 's plan to increase the minimum number of home - grown players in club squads from eight to 12
greg dyke is facing opposition to his plans from the premier league but uefa president michel platini said the european body would work to help him
it comes as greg dyke said it was ' depressing ' to read rio ferdinand 's newspaper column claiming that managers such as chelsea boss jose mourinho may not be giving young english players a chance
uefa president michel platini agrees with gerg dyke 's plans to increase number of homegrown players the fa chairman wants to increase the minimum number of home - grown players from eight to 12 while there is a slight increase in the number of english players in the premier league this year â up from 32 % last year to 35 % â that is largely down to burnley being promoted
if they were to be relegated and replaced by watford â second in the european championship â the proportion would fall to 31 %
however , only 22 % of the starters in the current top four teams are qualified to play for england , compared to 28 % last year
in 2014 , just 23 english players appeared in the champions league group stage , compared with 78 spanish , 55 germans and 51 brazilians
this season the three english clubs that reached the knockout stages of the champions league started only 10 english players , compared to 12 french and nine spanish in those three sides
in the last two weeks only five english players started in the second legs of the knockout stage
in 2010 england under 17s won the european championship , beating spain in the final
of that 18 - man match - day squad , only four have gone on to play more than 20 top - flight games , while double that from the spanish squad have done so in la liga
of the 12 clubs who have played in each of the last five premier league seasons , the average number of home - grown players per squad has gone from 11.4 to 9.4
only 62 % of current home - grown players are qualified to play for england
michel platini , speaking after the uefa congress in vienna , said : ' this is a position we defend
we 're not only talking about england , we 're talking all of european
mr greg dyke 's struggle with the fa is something we share and we agree with him
' with the new leader of the european commission it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect home - grown , grass - roots young players in the different countries
we share the same perspective
we will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one
' there is free flow of workers but there are some things that does n't work well and we need to address it
' uefa general secretary gianni infantino admitted that its similar rule of eight home - grown players in european squads was not working as well as it should and called greg dyke 's initiative ' fantastic '
he added : ' we are at eight out of 25 and we see it is not really as great as it should be so whatever move in favour of increasing home - grown players is something we can only support
' greg dyke 's proposals are set to be discussed at a premier league chairmen 's meeting on thursday as well as the fa board
they also include changing the rules so that ' home - grown ' means having trained in england for three years before the age of 18 rather than 21
the fa chairman said : ' i thought rio ferdinand 's column was in some ways quite depressing
it virtually said jose mourinho is virtually saying he is not going to play the kids anyway
why have an academy then ? ' it 's not fair on the kids
it was always tough for kids to get through but it seems unfair now
' asked if he had looked at how the fa could force the new rules through despite opposition , he replied : ' we have but that 's not the way we want to go
we have looked at it yes
' former england defender rio ferdinand claimed that youngsters were not being given a chance at chelsea chelsea ' s ruben loftus-cheek is highly rated but has found chances limited under jose mourinho greg dyke said all the proposals were open for discussion
he added : ' i think it 's more about the clubs than the leadership if you want my honest opinion
it 's the unfairness of a system that is massively improved because of the elite player performance plan ( elite player performance plan ) which was introduced by the premier league led by richard scudamore , he has done a great job
' the trouble is that it is only any good if the kids get through the system - if they ca n't get through the system why bother ? ' we are open to discussions on all of it
this is a set of ideas which we think will work
