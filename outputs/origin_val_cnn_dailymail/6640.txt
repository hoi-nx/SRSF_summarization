the saying ' just when you think something is idiot proof they invent a new idiot ' was proven again this week when a man set fire to his car after using a cigarette lighter to see while filling it with a jerry can
in the early hours of sunday morning a man from sunshine in victoria ran out of fuel about one kilometre east of ararat on the western highway
he went on foot to a local petrol station to get a jerry can but could not see what he was doing when he returned to the car
cars have gone up in flames for a variety of reasons , but setting one on fire because the person was using a cigarette lighter to see while filling it with a jerry can has to be the worst one yet abc reports that acting inspector broadbent said the man lost all common sense when trying to find a solution to the problem
â because there was no light he 's actually , in the process of pouring fuel into his vehicle , he 's used his lighter to light up the area so he could see , â he said
police said the man abandoned common sense in the search for a solution to filling his car with the jerry can in the dark â subsequently the fumes have ignited and the vehicle 's caught on fire
â the rear of the car was burnt but acting inspector broadbent said the man was lucky to escape without injury
â that could have been far worse
