trolled : robinson has been attacked by online trolls after revealing he has lung cancer veteran broadcaster robinson has been abused online after announcing he is battling cancer
the beeb said at the weekend that its political editor is to take time off to have a tumour removed from his lung
but he was immediately the subject of vile abuse online from twitter trolls who accused him of both pro-tory bias and anti-snp sentiment
smyth , whose twitter â handle â â his online name â includes an scottish national party logo , sent a message reading â karma â direct to mr robinson , 51 , and the beeb
other twitter users described mr smyth as an scottish national party member and urged the party to expel him
last night , the scottish national party had not confirmed or denied if he was a member
phoenix45blog â the 45 seemingly a reference to the percentage who voted yes â wrote : â a bit of chemotherapy would do the biased beeb man good
â this prompted widespread condemnation on the site , with posters calling it â vile â and â disgusting â
one , alex , tweeted : â you are one sad individual
â initially , phoenix45blog replied : â nope , i âm quite happy about this news
â but he later changed his mind , tweeting : â i apologise unreservedly for the prior tweet
i wish you a speedy recovery nick
â jimmy james â whose twitter profile sports the number 45 â said that â diagnosis aside â mr robinson was an â * * * * hole â
it was not just cybernats who were guilty of abuse
maenad nanna tweeted from wales : â self - respecting lung tumour wants removing from mendacious @ tory shill robinson
â when prime minister cameron tweeted he wished mr robinson well , one individual replied that he was a â little englander scumbag like that * * * * cameron â
a second tweet responding to the same message said : â looks like @ davidcameron âs director of communications is off sick , poor man
â sick : two of the vile messages sent to the beeb political editor after he announced he has cancer the comments were widely condemned â including by the scottish national party
former labour first minister lord mcconnell said they were â sick â
first minister nicola sturgeon tweeted her support , wishing mr robinson a speedy recovery
the presenter became a hate figure among some nationalists during the referendum campaign , with protesters outside beeb scottish âs glasgow headquarters calling for him to be sacked for what they saw as biased coverage
at the time , alex salmond refused to condemn them , calling the demonstrations â joyous â
during the referendum campaign , the scottish national party was constantly embarrassed by the online army of cybernats
jk rowling and david bowie were two of many who earned their wrath for speaking out in favour of the union
dispute : the scottish national party had a public spat with robinson , 51 , during the campaign , with dozens of members making official complaints and some even calling him a ' liar ' in banners as they paraded through glasgow 's streets last night , scottish politicians warned such abuse threatened to silence democratic debate in the run - up to may âs general election
a scottish labour spokesman said : â these tweets are beneath contempt
there is no place in scottish life for this kind of bile
â nicola sturgeon and the scottish national party must immediately distance themselves from these vile comments and call on their more extreme supporters to stop polluting social media with vicious personal attacks
â this online bullying is in danger of destroying public debate
â a scottish tory spokesman said : â these comments are despicable , but wo nât surprise anyone who saw the depths some people stooped to during the referendum campaign
â it âs important all political parties lead by example and condemn this sort of behaviour
â an scottish national party spokesman said : â we deplore all internet abuse , as we have made consistently clear , and the first minister has wished robinson well for a speedy recovery
â when prime minister cameron tweeted he wished mr robinson well , one individual replied that he was a â little englander scumbag like that * * * * cameron â mr robinson hopes the operation to remove a bronchial carcinoid tumour from his lung will take place within the next month so he can return to work before the general election
he remarked of his illness and its proximity to the election : â timing lousy
â both the broadcaster âs parents smoked , but while he has admitted to the â odd drag on cannabis at university â , he has said he has always been so anti-nicotine that he â was the sort of irritating child who used primary school art classes to make anti-smoking propaganda â .
