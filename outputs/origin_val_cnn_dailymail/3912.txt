if you have ever wondered why sleepwalkers can navigate their surroundings without bumping into obstacles , a new study may hint at the answer
scientists have discovered that navigational cells in the brain are just as active when we are asleep as when we are awake
the finding builds on last year 's discovery of the brain âs â gps system â which comprises clusters of cells that give us a sense of direction
scientists have revealed that navigational brain cells ( an illustration of neurons is shown ) are just as active when we are asleep as when we are awake
they made their discovery in the brains of mice researchers from nyu , in new york , focused on the ' head direction system ' in mice , which acts as a compass
the brain cells in the systems fire more whenever a creature âs head points in a certain direction
they found that these head direction neurons are active during sleep
the researchers studied brain activity in mice during deep , or rapid eye movement ( rem ) sleep , that âs a stage known for intense dreaming activity in humans , during which brain electrical activity is virtually indistinguishable from that when awake
they found that during deep sleep , the ' needle ' of the brain compass in the mice moved at the same speed when they were asleep , as when they were awake
the researchers studied brain activity in mice during slow - wave and rapid eye movement ( rem ) sleep , that âs a stage known for intense dreaming activity in humans , during which brain electrical activity is virtually indistinguishable from that when awake
a stock image is shown for the first time , conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while they slept
scientists from the industrial physics and chemistry higher educational institution in paris , france , used the brain 's replay process - that of replaying the day 's events - to create new memories in the brains of mice , while they slept
the team , led by karim benchenane , focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about , or being in , a specific place â and help animals and humans form internal maps
he monitored the activity of these cells when the mice explored an â arena â using electrodes , isolating the cell that fired in a certain arena location
while the mice slept , they monitored the creature âs brain activity and when the specific place cell fired , an electrode stimulated the brain areas linked to reward
when the mice woke up , they immediately scurried to the location that was linked to the rewarding feeling , showing that a new pleasant memory of the place had been formed by the scientists
the feat offers hope that the same technique could one day be used to change human memories , which could help people who replay traumatic events over and over in their minds
during slow - wave periods of sleep however , when brain activity significantly decreases , they found a 10-fold acceleration of activity , so that the mice were â looking around â even more than when they were awake
â we have long known that the brain is at work during sleep , â said senior gyorgy buzsaki , biggs professor of neural sciences at the university
â but now we know how it is working in one of the seemingly simpler senses - head orientation - or our sense of where we look at in any given space
â the direction sense is an essential part of our navigation system , since it can reset our internal compass and maps instantaneously , as , for example , when we emerge from the subway and try to orient ourselves
â the finding could lead to new treatments for navigational problems , which are among the first major symptoms of alzheimer âs disease and other neurological disorders
for the two year study , described in the journal nature neuroscience , researchers videotaped the head movements of mice and recorded the electrical activity in the head - direction regions of the sleeping animals
they focused on the antero - dorsal thalmic nucleus and postsibiculum regions of the brain
the recordings were then compared with similar readings made in the same mice while they were awake and navigating in various environments
lead author of the study , dr adrien peyrache , said : â the coordinated activity during the majority of sleep likely represents a consolidation of places , events and times , a sort of navigational backup system in the brain , during which the brain stores a map to memory
â the next step will be to monitor other parts of the mouse brain involved in more complex forms of behaviours to see if similar neural activity patterns are at work
researchers are also planning experiments to test whether head direction and navigation can be electrically controlled and predicted in advance
the finding could lead to new treatments for navigational problems , which are among the first major symptoms of alzheimer âs disease and other neurological disorders
