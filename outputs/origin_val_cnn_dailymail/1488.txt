as manchester united turned in their most dominant display of the season against tottenham on sunday , the influence of one man can not be underestimated
carrick 's return to louis van gaal 's starting xi proved crucial at old , and could be the turning point for manchester united as they look to finish in the top four this season
he took less than nine minutes to stamp his authority on the game and show the old faithful what they have so missed during his two months out
carrick ( second left ) heads manchester united 2 - 0 up against tottenham on sunday carrick is congratulated on his goal by his manchester united team - mates during the 3 - 0 win at old united with carrick p15 w10 d3 l2 win percentage : 66.70 % points per game : 2.2 united without carrick p14 w6 d5 l3 win percentage : 42.90 % points per game : 1.6 with daley blind on the ball at left back and no tottenham players covering a huge gap just in from the left touchline , carrick burst forward to receive the ball before instantly playing a perfectly weighted pass for fellaini to open the scoring for manchester united
ten minutes later carrick had headed his side 2 - 0 up and sent them on the way to a vital win
but it was the composure and attacking intent that carrick provided on sunday that manchester united have missed so much in recent weeks - something which was not lost on his manager
' carrick is not my second captain for nothing
he is one of the best passers also , not only wide but also forward
we need midfielders who have that passing , ' said van gaal after the game
indeed , with carrick in the side manchester united have picked up 2.2 points per game compared to just 1.6 without him
the club have won 66.7 % of the game the midfielder has played but than number drops to 42.9 % without the england midfielder
daley blind played at left back against tottenham but has spent most of the season in central midfield herrera ( left ) has impressed in midfield for manchester united since signing from athletic bilbao in the summer fellaini ( left ) has been played in an advanced midfield role for manchester united this season liverpool ( away ) - march 22 aston villa ( home ) - april 4 man city ( home ) - april 12 chelsea ( away ) - april 18 everton ( away ) - april 26 west brom ( home ) - may 2 crystal palace ( away ) - may 9 arsenal ( home ) - may 16 hull ( away ) - may 24 in truth , nobody should be surprised
carrick has been a mainstay of manchester united 's midfield for years now , anchoring the side from a deep position
whether his midfield partners have been of the necessary quality over the years is debatable , but with the likes of herrera and blind - as well as the revitalised fellaini - now available , carrick should not have to carry the burden all by himself
at 33 , however , carrick remains manchester united 's main man
as well as herrera and blind have done in their first seasons in english football , neither have the authority or influence of carrick
with trips to liverpool , chelsea and everton to come too , carrick 's big - game experience will also be key
with nine games to go , manchester united will be hoping carrick stays fit , because with him in the side , they have a much better chance of finishing in the top four .
