evans has grudgingly accepted the six - match ban imposed on him by the fa for spitting at cisse
there is no right of appeal for the united defender and he begins his ban immediately by missing monday 's fa cup quarter - final with arsenal
though he maintains that he did not spit at the newcastle striker , the fa found evans guilty and confirmed in a statement : â mr evans denied the charge but it was found proven
â evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the newcastle striker , who then retaliates evans and cisse clash near the half - way line at st james â park following the unpleasant exchange united defender evans has received a six - match ban from the fa after the ugly incident cisse already served a three - match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing everton âs seamus coleman in december
as a result , the newcastle striker gets an additional one - match suspension after admitting his guilt , while evans gets six
the incident , during united âs 1 - 0 win at st james â park on wednesday , was not seen by referee anthony taylor or his assistants , but was caught on tv
a three - man panel of former referees reviewed the footage on thursday and agreed the players should have been sent off , prompting the fa to bring a charge
an independent regulatory commission heard the charge and decided both players should be banned
cisse , 29 , pleaded guilty and issued an apology for his part in the incident
he is suspended for an extra game as he was banned in december for elbowing everton âs seamus coleman
by contrast , evans , 27 , had denied the charge on thursday , saying : â i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at cisse
â cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the fa on thursday tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from newcastle and united gather on the pitch arsenal ( h ) , monday ( fa cup quarter - final ) tottenham ( h ) , march 15 ( premier league ) liverpool ( a ) , march 22 ( premier league ) aston villa ( h ) , april 4 ( premier league ) manchester city ( h ) april 12 ( premier league ) chelsea ( a ) april 18 ( premier league ) the fa also looked at an incident where evans was alleged to have spat in the direction of emmanuel riviere during the game but that was dismissed
evans will potentially miss any fa cup semi-final should united progress plus their premier league games against tottenham , liverpool , aston villa and manchester city
if united were to lose on monday , evans would then miss the trip to chelsea and would not return until united âs premier league trip to everton on april 26
united defender evans has received a six - match ban from the fa - one less than newcastle striker cisse there is no right of appeal so evans will not be able to contest the decision by the three - man panel 1
the affiliated association or competition may act against a participant in respect of any ' misconduct ' , which is defined as being a breach of the following : ( a ) the laws of the game ; ( b ) the rules and regulations of the association and in particular rules e3 to 28 below ; ( c ) the statutes and regulations of uefa ; ( d ) the statutes and regulations of fifa ; ( e ) the rules or regulations of an affiliated association or competition ; ( f ) an order , requirement , direction or instruction of the association
that would be a blow for united manager louis van gaal , who insisted ahead of the fa cup clash with arsenal at old trafford that the main priority for united this season must be to qualify for the champions league
united have nât won the fa cup since 2004 and have nât landed any silverware since sir alex ferguson left , but the dutchman says the competition must still be treated as a welcome bonus rather than the club âs primary objective
â i always want to get the goals we have set
and the goal we have set is the top four , â said van gaal
â a title is fantastic
when you win the fa cup you are not in the champions league , which is important for the club , but you have won a title
so for the players it is fantastic , for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the champions league
