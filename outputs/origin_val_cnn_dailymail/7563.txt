though most brides dream of their one - off wedding dress being hand sewn by designer couturiers , that could soon be a thing of the past
one company in china is now making 3d printed bridal dresses
unveiled at the tct + personalize asia exhibition shanghai this weekend , the dresses have been created using advanced technologies and nylon powder , rather than silks , lace and chiffon
the future of fashion ? two 3d printed wedding dresses were unveiled this weekend at shanghai 's tct + personalize asia technology expo , created by china designers specialising in digital technology but despite their less - than - luxury beginnings , the designers claim the dresses are soft to touch , comfortable to wear and durable too
created by china 3d printing specialists xuberance , who also make ties , hair pins , jewellery and home accessories using the technology , the dresses could signal fashion of the future
rather than the revered traditional dressmaking skills of parisian couturiers , normally fantasised about by brides - to - be , these dresses are made using a process called selective laser sintering ( sls )
the dress ' fabric ' is constructed by using lasers to fuse together the nylon powder , slowly building up the material in layers
each dress takes around one week to make , using advanced digital technologies and laser techniques , to fuse together nylon powders
the specialist process however , comes with a high price tag the cost of the 3d printed wedding dresses is yet to be revealed , but a bridal veil made using the same specialist process is expected to retail at 20,000 china yuan ( approximately Â£ 2167.35 ) and it 's not just dresses and accessories that xuberance applies their innovative digital technology to
though details have been kept under wraps , a 3d printed wedding cake and sugar flowers were also on display at the exhibition
but if you were hoping to cut costs by skipping the bridal shops , it seems unlikely
a 3d printed veil created using the same process currently costs 20,000 china yuan ( approximately Â£ 2167.35 ) , while a metallic effect headpiece retails at 5,000 yuan ( around Â£ 541.84 ) in the company 's online shop
the dresses are , as with the most sought - after haute couture bridal designers , being given the ' price on request ' treatment , but since they each take a week to ' print out ' , costs are likely to be high
despite shunning traditional fabrics like chiffon or lace , the tech - savvy dresses are intricately detailed and designed to resemble the real thing , but offer new scope for more ambitious patterns would you wear xuberance ? though bridal dreams are traditionally filled with thoughts of chanel , vera wang and oscar de la renta , new technology could soon change the face of wedding fashion
