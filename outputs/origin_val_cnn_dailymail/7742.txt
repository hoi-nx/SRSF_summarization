kerry looks stunning on the the latest cover of marie claire - but more importantly the scandal star looks like herself , following last month 's controversy in which instyle came under fire for allegedly altering her appearance on its march issue
marie claire 's cover shot featuring the beautiful 38 - year - old actress , who donned a smokey eye , tousled hair and nude lips for the magazine 's april issue , is a far cry from the unnatural - looking pictures that instyle had debuted over a month ago
when kerry happily shared the instyle images on her instagram last february , fans became outraged , accusing the magazine of allegedly whitening her skin and altering her features - which instyle quickly denied
' we have heard from those who have spoken out about our newsstand cover photograph , concerned that kerry 's skin tone was lightened , ' instyle said
' while we did not digitally lighten kerry 's skin tone , our cover lighting has likely contributed to this concern
' the magazine added : ' we understand that this has resulted in disappointment and hurt
we are listening , and the feedback has been valuable
we are committed to ensuring that this experience has a positive influence on the ways in which we present all women going forward
' posting on her own twitter account , kerry thanked the publication for making such a ' beautiful statement ' , adding that she was grateful the magazine had taken the time to open up such an ' important ' conversation

different person : instyle came under fire last month for allegedly altering the scandal star 's appearance on its march issue ( pictured )
the magazine blamed her seemingly altered skin tone on the ' lighting ' style star : earlier this week , kerry posed for photos at the paley center for media 's 32nd annual paleyfest close cast : she also smiled while taking a group selfie with jimmy kimmel and her scandal co-stars ' when i think about any of the missteps in my life that i 've made , all of which i 'm grateful for , it 's because i just so wanted to be truly seen and heard for who i am and was afraid i was n't or would n't be
' she added : ' i see you , i hear you , i 'm with you as you are
' kerry also noted that she never felt particularly beautiful when she was younger
the actress , who attended the spence school in manhattan with gwyneth paltrow , noted : ' i did n't grow up thinking i was pretty
' there was always a prettier girl than me
so i learned to be smart and tried to be funny and develop the inside of me , because i felt like that 's what i had
