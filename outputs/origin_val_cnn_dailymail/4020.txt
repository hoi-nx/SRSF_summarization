dame esther was giving evidence in trial of mellor who allegedly sent hundreds of abusive tweets to campaigner keenan childline founder dame esther rantzen has denied that she was told about jimmy savile 's child sex abuse in 1986 while giving evidence in a cyber stalking trial
dame esther today discussed allegations by child sex abuse victim and justice campaigner keenan that were printed on the front page of the the sun under the headline ' abuse campaigner : i told esther rantzen about paedo jimmy savile 18 years ago
' she said she ' would have remembered ' if she had been told by ms keenan that saville , gary glitter and jonathan king were child abusers
if she had been told of such an ' explosive allegation ' dame esther said she would have told her to go to the police
dame esther was giving evidence in the trial of mellor , 53 , from coven , wolverhampton , who is alleged to have sent hundreds of abusive tweets to ms keenan
ms keenan , from colchester , essex , wrote a book in 2008 called broken , where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather
the revelation led to the conviction of keenan and others in 2002 and ms keenan set up her own organisation , phoenix post , with campaigner dr sara payne , whose daughter was murdered
chelmsford crown court heard that mellor has accused ms keenan of repeatedly lying in her book , claiming she was a fraudster and an attention seeker
mellor called dame esther as a witness to challenge ms keenan 's credibility
dame esther , wearing a navy dress and black jacket , spent nearly an hour in the witness box today
she told the jury that she had not met mellor before today , although mellor had sent her some unsolicited emails about her discoveries relating to ms keenan
dame dame esther told the court she ' would have remembered ' if she had been told in 1986 by ms keenan that jimmy savile ( pictured left ) and gary glitter ( right ) were child abusers dame esther told the court : ' the sun journalist told me keenan told them that i said they were too rich , too powerful and that i , esther rantzen , could do nothing about it
' i said that 's absolutely untrue
i never took the view that anyone was too rich or too powerful
i have a track record in this
' dame dame esther told the jury at chelmsford crown court that she did not remember meeting ms keenan , who had been a guest on her tv show that 's life she said she was concerned that the claim would taint and damage childline 's reputation
dame esther said she was told when she was a young tv researcher , of ' a rumour ' in fleet street that jimmy savile was interested in young girls , but that she did not hear anything to justify or corroborate the rumour
she said that the first time she heard evidence of jimmy savile 's abuse was on an itv documentary in october 2012 , a year after his death
she agreed there was a photograph of her with ms keenan , taken in the bbc hospitality room in 1986 , but said she did n't remember meeting her , and categorically denied the claim
dame esther said : ' eighteen years ago nobody told me anything about jimmy savile 's predilections
' keenan did n't talk to me about jimmy savile in the bbc hospitality room when she was a guest
' dame esther added she attended the women of the year lunch at which dr sara payne and ms keenan received an award
keenan ( pictured left ) wrote a book in 2008 called broken , where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather
mellor ( right ) allegedly claims that ms keenan ' repeatedly lied ' in her book mellor denies stalking ms keenan and causing her serious alarm or distress between january 1 and 16 march 2013 by sending tweets , publishing statements about her in emails sent to work associates and carrying out a course of conduct which had a substantial effect on ms keenan 's day to day activities
mellor , who is defending herself , claims that ms keenan lied in her autobiography broken , and alleges that she is making money fraudulently out of the book and is an ' attention seeker , munchausen by internet '
she also claims that the graphic book is ' titillation for paedophiles ' , that ms keenan should not have written such an account which her own children can read , and ought to be withdrawn
the jury heard the trigger for mellor 's 239 tweets was when dame esther was accused in 2012 by ms keenan of being ' a liar ' and of having known about jimmy savile 's behaviour
dame esther told the court ms keenan went to the national association for people abused in childhood ( napac ) and dame esther was briefly removed from the website as patron before being reinstated
dame esther told the court : ' i am still a patron
nevertheless ms keenan told the press that i had been removed and then the papers ran that but that was not true either
' she said that the allegation was damaging to the work of napac and the nspcc , as childline is linked to both
the court heard a fund - raising event for childline was even cancelled because the organisers believed it ' was in some way involved or was tainted by the allegations made by keenan '
dame esther said she had appeared on itv 's this morning programme to answer ms keenan 's allegations but said that ms keenan had refused to appear at the same time
dame esther said her daughter had defended her on twitter from attacks by keenan and her organisation phoenix post
mellor 's own campaign group , dare to care , supports those falsely accused of fabricating illness , which is known as munchausen by proxy
