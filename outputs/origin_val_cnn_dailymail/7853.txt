peacock tails may be hard to miss , but humans are unaware of the noise created by the bird 's pretty plumage
scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear
male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate

male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate across dusty scrub land , the study claims researchers at the university of manitoba in winnipeg , canada , have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them
most humans hear noises between 20 and 20,000 hertz
dr james hare noticed a peacock displaying and shaking its tail at a wall in a zoo , which he noted looked like a satellite dish and made him question whether the bird was listening to itself , bbc earth reported
this sparked a study , leading him and graduate student freeman to record the sound of 46 peacocks shaking their feathers while displaying
male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers , with males ( stock image ) shrieking out charles darwin first suggested that a peacock âs train serves to attract females and studies have since shown that females tend to prefer males with the most exaggerated male characteristics
amotz zahavi said the train indicates a male âs fitness
males with impressive trains have been shown to be healthier , suggesting that the ornament indicates a male âs ability to survive
his â handicap principle â says that since males with particularly brightly coloured or large plumes will attract the attention of predators , they must be extra fit to survive
females are thought to choose mates with good genes , so males with more exaggerated sexual characteristics , such as a big train , tend to have better genes in a peahen âs eyes
marion petrie tested whether the displays signal a male âs generic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in whipsnade wildlife park in england
she found the number of eyespots in the train predicted a male 's mating success and that she could manipulate a male âs chances of mating success by cutting off some of his eyespot tail feathers
in the experiment , females lost interest in pruned males and became attracted to untrimmed ones
furthermore , chicks fathered by males with impressive trains weighed more than those sired by less ornamented birds
humans hear a rustling sound when this happens , but the experts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels , according to the study published in the journal animal behaviour
male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers , with males shrieking out in response
experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound , but know that some can feel vibration through their legs
ms freeman said that the birds may simply hear the noises through their ears , the inner part of which seems to be the right shape to detect very low noises
other animals , such as elephants , have long been known to produce such infrasound , which humans ca nât hear
and although a type of grouse called the capercaillie produces infrasound , it seemingly does n't use it to communicate , meaning that the bird either ca nât hear it itself or they just does n't care about it
ms freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals
but the noises could also be a way of attracting a mate
she observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers , producing two displays which she called the â shiver train â and the â pulse train â
the shiver train is produced by vibration of the train feathers from the centre feathers to the outside of the array and is used by males when females are far away
ms freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals
but the noises could also be a way of attracting a mate
here , a male displays for a brown , female peahen , hoping she will be impressed by his show of strength the pulse train is produced by a vibration emanating from the base of all the train feathers and it is used when the female is nearby
peacocks â tails are a sign of strength and good genes , so a strong noise may reinforce a message of virility , ms freeman said
this could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland , where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes ca nât see each other
â we think that possibly these signals could signal to females and males who are out of sight behind a bush or over the hill , â she added .
