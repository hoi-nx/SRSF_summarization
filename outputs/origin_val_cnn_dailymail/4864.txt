a lineman who suits up for the baltimore ravens obviously knows his x 's and o 's because he made it to the nfl - but it 's pretty clear this particular player is also quite familiar with the number line
offensive guard john urschel recently had a math research paper published in the journal of computational mathematics
the 23 - year - old pro , who goes by mathmeetsfball on twitter after graduating from pennsylvania state university with a 4.0 gpa and a master 's degree in math , also competed in a chess tournament for the first time earlier this month
a portion of the abstract reads : ' in this paper , we develop a cascadic multigrid algorithm for fast computation of the fiedler vector of a graph laplacian , namely , the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue
' this vector has been found to have applications in fields such as graph partitioning and graph drawing
' the paper was published on march 17 , just three days after pi day
john urschel , who refers to himself as a published mathematician and professional mathlete , celebrated both occasions on twitter
the 23 - year - old pro posts many math - related things while using the handle mathmeetsfball on twitter on march 14 , he wrote : ' happy pi day ! ! ! ! ' take some time to check out all of its properties and the amazing things it 's involved in

john urschel said : ' it 's a very nice number
' with football and math , i 'm very precise
with everything else , i 'm a simple guy
