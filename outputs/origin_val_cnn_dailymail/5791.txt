this saga âs gone on longer than the mousetrap
and let âs be honest â it âs not been handled brilliantly by the ecb
but you can hardly blame pietersen for wanting to throw his lot in with surrey and score some first - class runs
his interpretation of what graves said about playing in the domestic game has given him a lifeline
now it âs up to pietersen to use it
pietersen has agreed to rejoin surrey as he looks to make an unlikely england comeback with graves and harrison coming in as ecb chairman and chief executive respectively , it âs reasonable to work on the basis that everyone starts with a clean slate
they could well be leaning on paul downton , the managing director , with this basic point : the best players get picked
that âs how it works in other sports , so why not in cricket ? pietersen will have a great chance to excel in division two at an excellent club
he âs also fit enough , even in his mid- 30s
he leads a good lifestyle and he âll be desperate to bang the door down
it âs all set up for him
the 35 - year - old will focus on the longer form of the game in a bid to force his way into ashes reckoning pietersen still wants to add to his 23 test centuries despite being axed by england last year people are worried about his book , but the main targets in those pages â andy flower and matt prior â are no longer in the england set - up
i thought the book was a sad read , to learn that he was nât enjoying what should have been among the best moments of his life
that âs a real shame
but if pietersen scores so many runs for surrey that graves and harrison think he âs irresistible , then everyone will just have to sit down and talk things through
yes , it would become tricky for downton and peter moores , who pietersen did nât rate highly in his first stint as england coach
but i âd put the key players in this drama in one room and tell them not to reappear until they âve bashed out a compromise
treat it like a jury : do nât emerge until you âve got a majority decision
the batsman , pictured playing in australia 's big bash , may change his indian premier league contract peter moores did n't see eye to eye with pietersen during his first spell as england head coach pietersen is the best batsman i âve seen for england and if he can get his mojo back playing for surrey then at least he âll have fulfilled the criterion that graves laid down
test cricket is what gets pietersen âs juices flowing
it âs unrealistic to imagine he could still be around for the world cup
but he âs found himself a county and now he âs got to get some runs
it âs going to be a very interesting summer
england fell to an embarrassing early exit from the world cup after a defeat by bangladesh in adelaide
