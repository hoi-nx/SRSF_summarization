since he invented the tea in november 2011 , an has collected 10 tons of panda droppings to fertilise the plantation
he promises drinkers they can expect ' a mature and nutty taste '
mr an said : ' pandas have a very poor digestive system and only absorb about 30 per cent of everything they eat
poo power : mr an has used 10 tons of droppings of these cuddly animals since 2011 to grow green tea ' that means their excrement is rich in fibres and nutrients
' just like green tea , bamboo contains an element that can prevent cancer
' first batch of tea every year , usually picked in spring , is considered the best brew in china
an said he hoped his ' panda poo tea ' could make it into the guinness book of world records as the most expensive tea
