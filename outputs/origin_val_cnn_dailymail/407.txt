comedian and prankster mandel became the butt of a joke when his house was tp 'd with more than 4,000 rolls of toilet paper
fellow prankster atwood brought the toilet paper and friends to mandel 's californian mansion as the deal or no deal host was flying home from new york
they unloaded the truck full of materials and atwood and friends - along with mandel 's son - covered the house end to end
thirty minutes later , mandel , who pranked people in his tv show howie do it , pulled up to the house , shocked to see it covered in toilet paper
' oh my god ! how do you get into a gated community ? are you f * * * * * * * kidding me ? what is this ? ' he said as he walked up to the house
atwood and his friends had enough toilet paper to fill an entire u-haul truck
they unpacked it all and lined the house before throwing it on to the roof with toilet paper ready and lined up with the house , atwood , friends and mandel 's family took turns throwing rolls when mandel ( pictured ) arrived home , however , he did not seem pleased with the mess
at first he was shocked anyone could get into his gated community atwood even wrote a special message with the toilet paper - ' smile more ' - and mandel eventually found humor in the prank
at the end of the video mandel can be seen picking up paper from around the driveway , and atwood jokes that he has to leave
' it 's so weird
i was going to run out to get toilet paper
give me a key to the door , i have to go to the bathroom
i really have to go , it 's not a joke
i 'll take some with me , it 's crazy ! ' mandel said in a behind - the - scenes video
but by the end of the prank when atwood reveals himself , mandel laughed and embraced the toilet paper mess
