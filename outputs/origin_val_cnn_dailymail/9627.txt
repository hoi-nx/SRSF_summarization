a guest at an 007 - themed swingers ' party drowned in a swimming pool after apparently downing most of a bottle of jack daniel 's whiskey
the 35 - year - old man was one of about 30 pleasure - seekers at the ' james bond meets pussy galore ' event in a Â£ 2.5million country mansion in the home counties
he is thought to have entered the pool naked with a woman he had met at the party before suddenly starting to thrash about in the water and then sinking to the bottom
organiser janet harrison ( left ) with friend in an image from a website that promotes the swingers ' parties the sex party was reportedly ' just getting started ' when a 35 - year - old man drowned in the swimming pool of the Â£ 3million gated property ( pictured is a pool at the mansion ) detectives are investigating the ' unexplained ' death and the 50ft covered pool has been sealed off while toxicology tests are carried out to check that the water is safe
the party was one of the regular swingers ' events put on by retired management consultant stanley , 66 , and his partner janet harrison , 58 , at their eight - bedroom home in radlett , hertfordshire
the couple , who appeared in a channel 4 series last year , say they do not run the sex parties as a business , but ask for contributions to their costs
the event on friday night featured 007 references including a roulette wheel , a woman covered in gold paint inspired by goldfinger and chocolate replicas of the weapon from the man with the golden gun
the man got into difficulties in the water just after midnight
the death happened at a swingers party run by stanley and janet harrison , pictured in the channel 4 documentary jon richardson grows up the owner of the house , who organised the sex party , said there were safety notices around the pool ' the party was really only just getting started , ' a guest told the sun. ' i was in the garden when a naked couple walked into the heated pool
she was white and in her 30s or 40s , he was black
' there is a steep incline in the pool , which is about 3m deep , and the guy went in deeper by himself and started whacking the water
i thought he was playing
' after a while the woman screamed and i saw the guy lying on the bottom
his body looked like it was moving , but then i realised it was ripples in the water
' revellers dragged the man out and performed cpr on him at the poolside , but he could not be revived and was pronounced dead at watford general hospital
the victim , who told other guests he was called edmund , was not a regular at the parties
he is believed to be nigerian and from north - west london
the woman who entered the pool with him , who was not well known by other guests , was left distraught
mr stanley said the victim had apparently ' severely dented ' a bottle of jack daniel 's he brought with him before entering the pool
the group 's website states that there are health and safety rules for using the large indoor swimming pool the couple have been hosting sex parties at the mansion - which includes a dungeon - for 10 years he added : ' i heard a shout and ran over
i dived in fully clothed , pausing only to take my iphone out of my pocket
three of the guys pulled him out , with me pushing him from behind
they put him straight into the cpr position and tried to revive him
one of the guests was a qualified nurse
' i got straight on to 999
the call operator gave very clear instructions , which i shouted to the team performing cpr
we kept doing that until the ambulance arrived
' then the police turned up â there were about a dozen officers in total by the end of the night
after interviewing various people , the inspector said to me , ' this is a non-suspicious death '
it may well be that he had a heart attack
' the mansion boasts a sex dungeon , a dance room with a pole and a sauna for the ' hot - blooded sexual olympians ' who attend the parties
mr stanley and his partner decided to go ahead with a planned alice in wonderland - themed party on saturday night after receiving messages of support from their regular guests
the property features a converted attic which mr stanley calls the ' dungeon in the sky ' the tragedy struck in the early hours of saturday at the mansion ( pictured ) in radlett , north of london the mansion 's owners say the pool complies with all health and safety rules and has been inspected ' my first reaction was that having a party the following night was not going to be appropriate , ' mr stanley said
' but we had so many supportive emails and texts saying things like , ' the first thing you do if you fall off a horse is get back on it ' , and ' it was what he would have wanted '
' somebody said when a plane crashes into the alps , you do n't stop all aviation
you sit down around a table and think about whether you could have done anything differently
' that 's what we are doing
the health and safety people will come over this week and we will go through what we could do better
' mr stanley said he would invite the victim 's friends and family to visit his house and set up a memorial there if they wished
a hertfordshire police spokesman said : ' an investigation is on - going at this time to establish the circumstances surrounding the man 's death , which is being treated as unexplained pending the outcome of a post-mortem
this is due to take place in the next few days
' a documentary showed pornographic films are played on a large screen during the parties and a pole has been fitted to the centre of the dancer floor the website states : ' to assist those who feel torn between eating out or frolicking , we ease the burden by feeding you to a fair standard '
