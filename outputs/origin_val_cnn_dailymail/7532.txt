the ancient mound of silbury hill was built as lighthouse and harbour to help neolithic traders navigate waterways , an expert has claimed
archaeologists have long speculated that the enormous manmade structure in wiltshire was an ornate grave or a ceremonial altar used in rituals
but a cartographer and local historian claims he has found evidence of a stone avenue between the mound and the nearby stone circle of avebury
land ahoy ! the expert a claims southern britain was a series of islands linked by waterways , channels and swollen rivers , and that stonehenge was effectively located on the coast
the mound ( pictured ) would have acted as a lighthouse and harbour for those travelling by boat langdon said this suggests the hill was a lighthouse for travellers who docked at the mound and walked to the circle for goods
he said : ' the maps i have produced indicate that avebury was a trading place for our ancestors
' my assumption is that the nearby monument of silbury hill would have been used as a harbour , once the waters had eventually receded from the main site of avebury
final destination : the cartographer and local historian claims he has found evidence of a new stone avenue between the mound and the nearby holy stone circle of avebury ( pictured ) mysterious : until now archaeologists and historians have speculated the huge man - made structure in wiltshire ( pictured ) was an ornate grave or a ceremonial hilltop to get closer to the gods mr langdon says southern britain was a series of islands linked by waterways , channels and swollen rivers , and that stonehenge was effectively located on the coast
he believes he has discovered an avenue leading to the massive stone circle at avebury - an older and bigger site than stonehenge
he said this indicates silbury hill was merely a beacon to guide people to avebury and added : ' this concept and use of hills are commonplace at the time of the roman empire and thereafter , but it was not their invention
' the romans inherited the idea from other cultures such as the egyptians , who had their " lighthouse of alexandria "
' we have now found our very own ' lighthouse of avebury ' , but some 2,000 years earlier
' ' therefore , a direct pathway would have been used from silbury hill to avebury for goods , which according to archaeologists does n't exist
' if you are going to spend years or even decades building such a construction , there has to be a social or financial reward for your endeavours
' we now know through recent excavations that this mound was built in stages , starting small , then getting taller
' if it was purely symbolic you would n't need to change the size
' you only change the height of this monument if it serves as a beacon to attract ships and boats to the trading place of avebury , for the higher you build , the greater the visible range
' iconic silbury hill is a 98ft ( 30 metre ) high prehistoric artificial chalk mound which is part of the stonehenge , avebury and associated sites unesco world heritage site

archaeologists have long speculated that the enormous manmade structure in wiltshire was an ornate grave or a ceremonial altar used in rituals the neolithic period - also known as the ' neolithic ' - spanned from around 4000 to 2,500 bc and was characterised by the adoption of agriculture and a more sedentary style of living
gods : new importance was placed on religion , and ritual ( neolithic religious monument pictured ) the preceding period of the last , post-glacial hunter - gatherer societies is known as the mesolithic , or middle stone age
to make room for the new farmland , deforestation took place which permanently transformed the landscape
this moment is sometimes referred to as the ' neolithic revolution ' but radiocarbon dating has revealed that the transition from hunter - gatherer to farmer was relatively gradual
it was believed that the introduction of farming into britain was the result of a huge migration from mainland europe , but genetic research suggests that the influx was probably small - somewhere around 20 per cent of the total population
these people also brought with them the first seed grains of wheat and barley , which had been bred from wild grasses that grew in the region of modern - day iraq
new types of stone tools requiring more skill began to be produced too
the neolithic also saw the construction of a wide variety of monuments in the landscape , many of which were enormous
the earliest of these are the chambered tombs of the early neolithic but later stone circles were built , a trend that continued into the bronze age
these constructions reflect a shift in culture - a new importance that was placed on religion , ritual and social hierarchy
the people that lived during this period left behind no written records , however , so all that is known comes from archaeological evidence
