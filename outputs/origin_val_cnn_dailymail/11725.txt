now , with easter just a few days away , a california couple has been shocked by the â miraculous â appearance of jesus ... on their pine dining table
jaimie beebe , 37 , a casting director from los angeles , said : â we were having dinner with some friends when we noticed it
it just appeared that night , it was like a miracle
â i âve sat at this table a million times but never seen jesus on it before , â he said
its deep spiritual meaning has nât stopped them putting the table on ebay with a $ 5,000 ( Â£ 3,350 ) price tag - however it is yet to receive any bids
in october , cranfield , 24 , who lives in manchester , inserted a slice of wholemeal bread into the toaster and was baffled when it popped out with the face of jesus
mr cranfield , a catholic , said he was sure it is a message from god , adding : â as a strong christian i believe that this was no mistake , i believe that god himself had sent it to me to prove that he exists and that i should not give up my faith
â over the years , images of jesus have also appeared on crisps , pancakes , banana peel , pizza and ice cream
