anyone found supplying illegal workers can be jailed for up to ten years and fined , while people employing from an unlicensed gang leader can be fined and jailed for a year
but mr broatbent critcised the sentences which had been handed out to those convicted of using modern day slaves

this had led to crime syndicates using fake universities , sham marriages , forged documents and a network of solicitors and accounts to illegally traffic people
once in the britain , the victims , many of whom were from the european union , were trapped in ' debt bondage '
the gangs would claims their victims owed them for their travel fee and documents and would force them to work by deducting money for food and accommodation
mr paul broadbent told the times : ' slavery was abolished 200 years ago but it 's alive and thriving in the britain , ' he added
' people are being forced to work against their will
' there are physical threats and intimidation as well as psychological abuse
it 's systematic coercion and control
