inhaling the delicate bouquet of a glass of wine can leave most of us at a loss for words to describe what we are smelling
but it turns out it may be our language that is hampering our sense of smell
scientists have found that english speakers struggle to identify and describe odours compared to other languages
i 'm getting blackberries and thistles : the english language is not the best for describing odours say scientists researchers found those who use english as their first language can take five times as long to describe an odour than they can a colour
however , native speakers from the jahai tribe in perak , malaysia , described odours far more consistently and in less time than they can a colour
looking at someone who is overweight or obese can alter our sense of smell to make the scent of the world around us appear less pleasant , scientists have found
researchers discovered viewing images of fat people caused participants in a study to rate odour samples as smelling worse - even though they were actually fragrance free
the scientists believe the effect may be caused by inbuilt negative bias that many people have towards those who are overweight and obese
surprisingly they also found that those who had a higher bmi themselves tended to give the scent samples a lower rating
this suggests that people who have their own weight problems are perhaps also the harshest critics of others who are fat
the jahai have at least 12 specific abstract words that relate to smells while the maniq , a tribe of hunter gatherers in southern thailand , have 15 words
these abstract words describe smells in the same way as we use blue , red and yellow to describe colours
the findings suggest english speakers appear to have lost the ability to accurately describe smells
professor asifa majid , who led the work at the centre for language studies at radboud university in nijmegen , in the netherlands , said : ' our findings show that the long - held assumption that people are bad at naming smells is not universally true
' odours are expressible in language , as long as you speak the right language
' professor majid has found that the english language has few specific words that are capable of describing smells
one of the few that is used is the term ' musty ' , which describes a stuffy and dusty odour of an old book or room that has been unused for a long time
most of the time english speakers have to rely upon the source of the smell as a description - using words like fruity or lemon
in a study published in the journal cognition , professor majid asked 10 english speakers and 10 native speakers of the jahai to describe colours and odours
they were presented with 12 odours , including cinnamon , turpentine , lemon , smoke , chocolate , rose , onion and gasoline , and 80 different colours
they found that when describing the odours , there was little agreement among english speakers when describing the odours
the jahai use 12 abstract words to describe odours ( shown , left ) in the same way they do colours ( right ) in many western societies , smell has become a largely under - used sense
in many cases odours have become something undesirable and to be avoided , according to professor majid ( picture posed by a model ) they also used far longer descriptions when identifying the smells
for example when presented with a cinnamon odour , english speakers described it as spicy , sweet , candy , smoky , wine and pot pourri
however , the jahai were found to use a series of succinct terms to describe the smells , such words that mean to ' smell edible ' and ' to have a bloody smell that attracts tigers '
these works were predominantly abstract words , much like those they used for colour
however , while abstract words were dominant among the english speakers when describing colour , they used source based descriptions
in a later study in the journal of cognition , professor majid and her colleagues looked at the language of the maniq , a 300 strong nomadic tribe in southern thailand , and found they use words for smell that have complex meanings
they wrote : ' smell is particularly important in the lives of the maniq , and lies at the core of the indigenous ideology
the table above shows the specific abstract words used by the maniq tribes to describe different odours ' the maniq surround themselves with odors believed to be beneficial for health and that repel danger
they stay constantly alert for potentially harmful odors
' the maniq system is remarkable because there are dedicated terms for olfaction and these are part of everyday talk
west languages simply lack this
when describing smells , english speakers , for example , most often resort to source - descriptors , such as like a banana or fruity , but even these descriptors are not applied accurately
' it is unclear exactly why english speakers have lost the ability to describe smells accurately , but vision has become the predominant sense in almost all human cultures
in a recent study published in the journal of cognitive linguistics , professor majid and her colleagues found that english speakers use specific words for vision and hearing but have few for the other senses like touch , smell and taste
there is a similar pattern in other western languages
however , smell plays a far greater role in the language of the semai of malaysia , for example
speaking to new scientist , professor majid said : ' there seems to be something culturally different too
' people in the west seem to do everything they can to get rid of smells , and in many contexts odour is a taboo topic
' this might be linked to changes in our smell environment since the industrial revolution
' if you read stories from the uk or france from before the revolution , there 's sewage in the streets and people are using perfume to cover up body odour
' these days , we do everything we can to sanitise our environment
