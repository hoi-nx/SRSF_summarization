david gill , the fa vice- chairman , says fa cup replays and the two - legged league cup semi-finals may have to be sacrificed in the season of the qatar world cup
why wait ? if anything , replays are detracting from the excitement of the competition , and the format of what is currently the league cup is an anomaly
it should not take fifa âs monstrous destruction of football âs calendar to make the english game see sense
by chance , there were no replays in the fa cup fifth round this year and they were not missed
the great qatar world cup shocks of this campaign have all happened on the day , inside 90 minutes
david gill suggested removing cup replays , and he has a point , even if it it has taken qatar to make it happen cambridge united were excellent to earn a replay against manchester united , but lost the second game that is when bradford city beat chelsea and sunderland , when middlesbrough eliminated manchester city , when blackburn rovers beat swansea city then stoke city
a few lower division tussles aside , all the games that went to replays went with form
manchester united defeated cambridge united , sunderland won at fulham , liverpool came from behind to beat bolton wanderers and southampton won against ipswich town
replays favour the bigger teams anyway
if cambridge could have taken manchester united to extra-time , and maybe to penalties , on a crummy pitch at a boisterous abbey stadium , who knows what might have happened ? heading to a decider at old trafford , their moment had passed
jonathan stead 's goal against chelsea was part of a shock that re-affirmed the fa cup 's giant killing tradition bradford celebrate their win at stamford bridge , and did n't need a replay to upset the premier league leaders we cling to tradition , but tradition had teams playing replay after replay until they could be separated
those encounters had an epic feel
in 1979 , arsenal and sheffield wednesday needed five matches â including three that went to extra-time â lasting nine hours before they could be torn apart
the second replay ended 2 - 2 , the third 3 - 3
arsenal won the fourth 2 - 0
that is the true gladiatorial tradition of the fa cup , but it is unthinkable with modern fixture congestion
so as the shoot - out that completes the first replay is in itself a compromise , why is it needed at all ? middlesbrough also caused an upset , by beating manchester city , but replays rarely lead to shocks smaller clubs might be better rewarded if games were decided on the night by a penalty shoot - out a game decided on the day , one hit , with extra-time and penalties , would go some way to restoring tension and drama
when the fa has to alter its company accounts because the fa cup sponsorship deal confidently included by former general secretary alex horne has not materialised , it is ridiculous to pretend the current format is a winner
the same with the league cup
it is decided over one game in every round , then two in the semi-finals , and back to one for the final
what is the point of that ? better to have consistency and let the calendar breathe a little
it should not need fifa âs selfishness to be a catalyst for reform in the english game
the time to change is now .
