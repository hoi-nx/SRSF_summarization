dog or jewish boyfriend ? ' girls ' star dunham , pictured here with her boyfriend jack antonoff , has been criticised for an article some claim is anti-semitic quiz : dunham asked : ' do the following statements refer to ( a ) my dog or ( b ) my jewish boyfriend ? ' she is pictured with her dog lamby row : ms dunham , whose own mother is jewish , has been criticised by twitter users , as well as the adl ( adl ) - an organisation which fights anti-semitism and all forms of bigotry also among the 35 statements were ' my grandma dottie loves him and says he âs a â good , good boy " ' and ' bald men trigger a primal fear in him '
abraham h. foxman , adl national director , said : ' some will certainly find dunham âs stereotypes about cheap jews offensive
others will take issue with the very idea of comparing a dog and a jewish boyfriend
' while we understand that humor is its own special brand of expression and always try to give leeway to comedians , we wish that she had chosen another , less insensitive way to publicly reflect on her boyfriend âs virtues and vices
' we are surprised that the the new yorker chose to print it
' twitter users were quick to criticise the piece , while others used it as an opportunity to troll the star
one user wrote : ' i am so glad @ adl_national finally has taken on the task of charging people for their jewish humor
mazel tov ! ' earlier today , one wrote : ' whoa ... yikes
besides it being offensive , it is n't even close to funny , let alone original
i get being edgy ... but lame
' choice : also among the 35 statements were ' my grandma dottie loves him and says he âs a â good , good boy " ' and ' bald men trigger a primal fear in him other twitter users jumped to her defence
one said : ' is n't jewish ? what 's the big deal ? ' the new yorker editor - in - chief david remnick also baked the publication 's use of the piece in a statement released on saturday and condemned those who had whipped up the storm on social media
it read : ' the jewish - comic tradition is rich with the mockery of , and playing with , stereotypes
' anyone who has ever heard lenny bruce or larry david or sarah silverman or who has read â portnoy âs complaint â knows that
dunham , who is jewish and hugely talented , is a comic voice working in that vein
' richard pryor and chris rock do the same about black stereotypes ; amy schumer does it with women and gender
i do nât mind if one reader or another did nât find the piece funny
people can differ on that
' but considering all the real hatred and tragedy in the world , the people getting exercised about the so - called anti-semitism of this comic piece , like those who railed at philip roth a generation or two ago , are , with respect , howling in the wrong direction

it is the latest in a series of controversies involving the star
the quiz in the new yorker 's march 30 edition included statements like ' he does nât tip ' , ' he never brings his wallet anywhere ' and ' he has hair all over his body , like most males who share his background ' in january she was forced to apologize after suggesting the storm over bill cosby 's rape allegations is as significant as the slaughter of millions of jews while speaking to the new york times
referring to judd apatow 's ' obsession ' with the revelations , she said : ' it âs sort of like saying someone âs obsessed with the holocaust
' this is a huge issue , and it speaks to the way that we abuse power and the way that celebrity allows for injustice
' in december she claimed she was raped by an acquaintance in college , detailed in a passage from her new book not that kind of girl
some accused her of making it up but she has since stuck by her story
during a chapter she says a ' flamboyant republican conservative ' that she met at oberlin college in ohio identified as ' barry ' , attacked her at a party
in november it emerged that she was suing truth revolt website after they claimed she sexually abused her little sister when they were children
the claim is based on an excerpt from the girls star and creator 's new book , not that kind of girl , and details how she once looked at her sister grace 's vagina when her sibling was a year old and she was seven
dunham defended the action as innocent childhood exploration based on curiosity , but the website truth revolt called the memory ' unsettling ' and ' disturbing '
the website adamantly declined , with editor ben shapiro wrote explaining why they would not heed to the demands of dunham 's lawyers
we refuse to withdraw our story or apologize for running it , because quoting a woman âs book does not constitute a â false â story , even if she is a prominent actress and left - wing activist
' dunham may not like our interpretation of her book , but unfortunately for her and her attorneys , she wrote that book â and the first amendment covers a good deal of material she may not like , the article reads
