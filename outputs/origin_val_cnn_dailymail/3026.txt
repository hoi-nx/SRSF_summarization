searching for clues to the recent decline of angel di maria , the break - in that occurred at his house in january can not be overlooked
di maria âs form had dropped off before that , true , but not as alarmingly as it has in recent weeks
he was nât getting hooked at half - time before this event
negredo suffered a similarly shattering blow that ended his family âs love for their new country
he was not the same player after it happened
di maria is believed to be relocating his family to a new , high - level apartment following their traumatic experience
angel di maria has seen his form drop off in recent months and has been substituted in the last few games di maria has been replaced in manchester united 's last two premier league games negredo had a tough time at manchester city and left for valencia negredo has returned to spain on loan with valencia the player would not be human if he was unaffected , particularly as - like negredo - he is still learning to speak english and must already feel quite alone
manchester city came to the conclusion that negredo was lost to them , and only a return to spain would solve his problems
manchester united may decide this is also the case with di maria â but have so much more to lose , financially , if he departs at the end of the season .
