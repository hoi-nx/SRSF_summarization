police initially used teargas and bamboo canes to rescue the man , but it did n't work , he said
" there were students in uniform

india made international headlines this month when it banned a documentary showing an interview with a convicted rapist , who blamed his victim and said she " should just be silent and allow the rape
" outrage has grown following the incident , which gives a window into the violence against women in the nation
the woman in the documentary incident was attacked by five men on a public bus in 2012
she later died from her injuries , sparking an outcry worldwide
