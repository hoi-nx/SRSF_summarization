roberto martinez insists he does not take the backing of toffees chairman bill kenwright for granted as he vowed to arrest the club âs worrying domestic form
toffees may have been impressive in europe this season but results in the premier league have been poor and a sequence of one win in 11 matches has seen them slide to the fringes of the relegation zone
the patience of some supporters has been stretched by those results but bill kenwright is not a man who makes knee - jerk decisions and roberto martinez recognises how crucial that is , given that other chairman might not have been so tolerant
toffees manager roberto martinez insists he does not take toffees chairman bill kenwright for granted bill kenwright and roberto martinez are all smiles on the day the spaniard was appointed toffees manager in june 2013 â remember when you make a decision in becoming a manager of a football club you take that into consideration , â said roberto martinez , whose side face stoke on wednesday night
' i was always very aware of the support that i would get from the chairman
bill kenwright is a mad toffees who became a chairman
â it âs not the other way round
he âs not a chairman that gets to know the football club
i can feel that relationship
i had his support when we were flying in the league , when we were flying in europe and i âve got his support when we have nât been able to get the wins we wanted in the league
â he is always supportive and hands on in terms of helping and that âs where a manager can be at his best â when he feels the support of his chairman
it is just support and pain â because when you do nât win and you are a proper toffees we all feel pain
â romelu lukaku reacts after missing a chance during toffees 's 2 - 0 defeat to arsenal on sunday this might be the most scrutiny roberto martinez has faced in his career but he maintains the pressure is not comparable to the game he played in for swansea in 2003 when their professional status was on the line
â it does nât get any worse than that because if you lose your status people lose their jobs around the club , â said roberto martinez
â we were 2 - 1 down with two mistakes and that is a pressure situation when you have 50 minutes on the pitch to get it right as a player
â those moments help me because i can see the seriousness of a situation and it is a serious position we are in , but i look at our squad and believe me it is a lot easier to win games with this squad
i am very confident we will improve
