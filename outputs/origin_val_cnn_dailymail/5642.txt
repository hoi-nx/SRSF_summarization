with plenty of dogs waiting eagerly to be petted and a warm welcome from staff , the queen 's visit to the battersea dog 's home could n't have got off to a better start
then david gandy , the 35 - year - old essex - born model who has been dubbed the world 's most handsome man , arrived - and it appeared to get even better
queen , smiling broadly , happily shook the model 's hand and followed it up with a chat with britain 's got talent judge amanda holden , another high - profile battersea supporter
after being welcomed by a ' dog guard of honour ' , the queen and the philip were ushered into the reception where david gandy and a group of other supporters , among them comedian paul o'grady , were waiting to meet her
the queen 's encounter with mr david gandy is the third time a member of the royal family has had a brush with the world of showbiz in less than a week
last wednesday , the duchess of cornwall found herself starring in a snapshot with glamour model katie price , taken during a visit to the cheltenham festival
it was the duchess of cambridge 's turn the following day , with the 33 - year - old royal pictured happily hobnobbing with the cast of downton abbey during a set visit
lovely chat : the queen smiled as she was introduced to amanda holden in the battersea reception unexpected meeting : the duchess of cornwall bumped into katie price at cheltenham last week happy hobnobbing : the duchess of cambridge with downton abbey 's michelle dockery ( lady mary ) glamorous though mr david gandy is , the queen saved her biggest smile for the homeless dogs - many of whom were enjoying a grooming session in the new kennels when she arrived
one , a corgi named beama , came within a whisker of being adopted by the world âs most famous corgis enthusiast
the eleven year old pedigree , who arrived at the renowned animal rescue centre just last week , was introduced to the queen as she toured the site in south london
at first the gentle and well - behaved pooch put on a suitably regal show
but as the afternoon wore on he did what most dogs would have done , he sighed and appeared to nod off â leaving the dog - loving sovereign looking on with affectionate bemusement
asked by battersea ambassador , actress amanda holden , whether she was tempted to take the corgis home with her , the queen was suitably diplomatic
â maybe , â she said
miss amanda holden then asked the queen âs husband , prince philip , the same question
almost ! beama the corgi was almost adopted by the pet - loving monarch adorable : the queen could n't resist stopping to pet members of her doggy guard of honour â what corgis ? â the bemused royal asked , before turning to david gandy and asking , ' have you got a corgis ? â â no , sir , but i am tempted , â the underwear model replied
the queen once owned a huge pack of the pampered animals â a breed she has loved since she was a girl - but given her advancing years has slowly been allowing the number she owns to dwindle
currently she owns two corgis , willow and holly , and two dorgis , candy and vulcan
although she has long been associated with pedigree breeds , the queen appeared delighted by the group of waifs and strays that greeted her today as she arrived at the home
the sovereign was visiting the iconic rescue centre in her role as its royal patron , a position she has held for almost 60 years
waiting to greet her , appropriately , was a â guard of honour â comprised of a dozen of the 9,000 dogs ( and , now , cats ) that pass through its doors each year
after passing through the canine guard , the queen and her husband philip , were greet by the home âs chief executive , claire horton , chairman heather love and her cousin , prince michael of kent , who is battersea âs president
the royal party then proceeded to the new mary tealby kennels , named after battersea 's founder , which will provide accommodation for 56 animals
enjoying the visit : both the queen and prince philip looked thrilled to be at battersea keeping an eye on things : the queen watches exercise classes ( left ) and heads to the reception ( right ) the kennels have been designed to make the often stressful experience of being brought to the home as comfortable and easy all as possible
all of the kennels have in built speakers so soothing music can be played to the animals , some of battersea âs most vulnerable and anxious dogs
the queen viewed the new facilities , meeting both staff and dogs , including an adorable mongrel puppy called harry , who was found wandering the streets last week , and a three - year - old greyhound , harvey
prince philip was taken aback by the facilities on offer , which also boast underfloor heating
â they have inside and outside areas and beds ? wonderful , â he said
they were also taken to see the exercise paddocks where more dogs were undertaking training and exercise , before unveiling a plaque to mark the opening of the new kennels
it was in the exercise area that the sovereign was introduced to beama by television presenter paul oâgrady , who outlined his sad story
the corgis was actually rehomed by battersea as a puppy eleven years ago and proved to be a wonderful family dog , playing with his owners â children and grandchildren
sadly , however , the elderly couple have moved to a retirement village where they are not permitted to keep animals , which means beama has found his way to battersea again
â he âs a beautiful dog and if i did nât have five already myself i would be tempted to take him , ' said mr paul o'grady
grand opening : the queen unveils a plaque after officially opening the mary tealby on her way : her majesty makes her exit after touring the battersea dog 's home in london ' he has the most lovely temperament
she seemed fascinated by him but was nât in the market , unfortunately
but now he has met her majesty at least we can say he is by royal appointment
â before they left the royal couple were given bags packed with treats such as collars and toys for their own dogs
prince philip appeared tickled pink , joking : â gives new meaning to the phrase doggy bag ! â afterwards amanda holden said she had been thrilled to see the queen offer her support to the home
â i was always a huge fan before i took on the ambassador âs role
we already have one dog but i have told my daughters we may well get another one in the autumn
we will see how things go , â she said
battersea dog 's home was established in 1860 by mrs mary tealby who was concerned by the number of stray animals roaming the streets of london
then known as ' the temporary home for lost and starving dogs ' , it was originally based in north london before being moved to battersea in 1871
since then , battersea has rescued , reunited or rehomed more than 3.1 million dogs and cats and currently cares for around 9000 animals a year
the queen is , of course , most famously associated with the corgis
the breed was introduced to the royal family by her father , king george vi , in 1933 when he bought a corgis called dookie from a local kennels
the animal proved popular with his daughters and was described as â unquestionably the character of the princesses â delightful canine family â and â a born sentimentalist â
a second corgis was acquired called jane who had puppies , two of which , crackers and carol , were kept
for her eighteenth birthday , queen was given a corgis named susan from whom numerous successive dogs were bred
some corgis were mated with dachshunds ( most notably pipkin , who belonged to princess margaret ) to create â dorgis â
at present , the queen owns two corgis : willow and holly and two dorgis : candy and vulcan
the queen âs corgis travel with her to the various residences , with her majesty looking after them herself as much as possible given her busy schedule
over the years , the royal family seem to have embraced dogs as their favoured pets
formal portraits from the 17th century onwards show kings , queens and their children happily posing with their beloved animals , from pugs to greyhounds , king charles spaniels to corgis
some pets have even merited their own portraits , and , as in many households , were considered very much members of the family
when queen victoria âs beloved collie , noble , died at balmoral in 1887 , he was buried in the grounds of the castle and given his own gravestone , which read : ' noble by name by nature noble too faithful companion sympathetic true his remains are interred here ' a terrier named caesar belonging to king edward vii was given even greater status when , having outlived the king , he walked behind his majesty âs coffin in the funeral procession
the duchess of cornwall owns two jack russell terriers , beth and bluebell and , who both came from battersea dog 's home .
