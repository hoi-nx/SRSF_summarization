britain 's loudest manhole cover bangs and screeches every time a car drives over it , but the council and utilities company are at odds over who should repair it
the faulty cover , by the side of busy roundabout in horsham , west sussex , has been causing havoc for nearby residents , since it came loose in november last year
ruth mcgeown , who can hear the constant banging from her home , first contacted west sussex county council about the issue in mid-january
but the utilities company claim the responsibility to fix the drain belongs to the local council
miss ruth mcgeown said : ' i understand there 's a level of bureaucracy in these sort of things but i just feel that both sides , southern water and the council , knew what the problem was but nobody was prepared to take responsibility for it
' she added southern water had taken more than two weeks to fix a different drain in the same road - and then told her it was the county council who were responsible for the repair
the council then passed it back to southern water , who passed it back to the council

the father - of - two added : ' this is driving us crazy
we are reporting it but they do not seem to be able to co-ordinate a response and be able to figure out who is responsible for it
' a west sussex county council spokesman said : ' we are just waiting on our contractor to give us a date to schedule when the repair work gets done
' a spokesman for southern water said the manhole cover was the responsibility of the county council
