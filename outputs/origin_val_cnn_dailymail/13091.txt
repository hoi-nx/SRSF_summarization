nbc chief tackles bill cosby , live musicals and comedy woes for nbc , " the wiz " combines two of tv 's biggest trends : live programming and the growing appetite for diversity â both in terms of casting and programming that best reflect society today
it comes as networks continue to look to live programming like sporting events and awards shows in a bid to break through the clutter in a crowded dvr landscape
in terms of diversity , the success of fox 's hip - hop drama " empire " and other scripted entries including " black - ish " as well as " fresh off the boat , " " cristela , " " scandal " and " how to get away with murder " have prompted a crush of diverse castings again this pilot season
" the wiz " was one of two productions nbc had been eyeing ( alongside " a few good men " and " music man " )
greenblatt confirmed in january that he had optioned both properties
