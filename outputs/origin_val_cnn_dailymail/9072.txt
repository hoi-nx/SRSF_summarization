easterby , 34 , says she no longer takes daughter alexis to sure start centre , darlington , after she was told to take her buggy outside council bosses have come under fire after barring parents from bringing their prams into a mother and baby centre for ' health and safety reasons ' , telling them to use an outside buggy park instead
the angry parents say staff at the sure start centre in darlington are forcing them to leave expensive prams chained up in freezing weather , and fear they could become a target for thieves
it is thought the buggy park has been in place for around three weeks , despite previous government advice saying there is no need for a ' blanket ban ' on prams inside children 's centres
mother easterby , 34 , says the ban means she no longer fells comfortable taking her four - month - old daughter alexis to the centre
she said : ' it 's health and safety gone mad
my baby has underdeveloped eyesight and doctors told me to use the sensory room there but i ca n't now as i ca n't take her pram in
' there is no way i 'm going to leave the pram chained up outside , i could n't afford to replace it if it was stolen and i do n't want to put my baby into a freezing cold buggy when we come back out
' if word gets out that we are leaving our prams outside then we could be targeted
' the staff have been abrupt and say it 's health and safety but that never stopped us before - i 've been going there for three months , the prams were n't causing problems or blocking corridors
' i was there one friday with no problem at all and by the same monday we were turned away at the door
there was no warning given at all
' after refusing to leave her pram unattended , natalie henderson , 28 , claims she was told to take her baby to another centre to be weighed
she said : ' i went to the centre twice a week until they told me to leave my pram outside
' i 'm not putting my baby into a freezing cold pram - it needs sorting , i ca n't get my baby weighed
' they say it 's health and safety but that 's rubbish , it 's supposed to be a centre for babies and children and they could get sick as a result of this nonsense
' darlington council said the ban on taking prams inside the centre ( pictured ) was made after staff carried out a risk assessment and found they were blocking walkways and fire exits jade davidson , who is mum to four - month - old charlie , added : ' it was about three weeks ago when i first encountered the ban
i could n't believe what i was hearing i thought it was a joke
' charlie has not been very well since birth so when i was asked to leave his pram outside in the sleet and rain i was really upset
' i needed to take him in to be weighed so i agreed but when i came back out and put him in the buggy he was freezing and developed a cold as a result
' i understand that the ban wo n't be such a big deal in summer and i went back last week and explained that i could n't leave my buggy inside again
' they let me bring the pram inside that day because it was a quiet time but it 's not really good enough
' a spokesman for darlington borough council said that the ban was put in place after staff carried out a risk assessment and found the prams were blocking walkways and fire exits
she added that the centre has recently become busier as a result of new courses being put on , and was struggling to fit the extra pushchairs inside
the government 's health and safety executive responded to similar cases by saying : ' there is no health and safety reason for a blanket ban on buggies and prams in a children 's centre
ms easterby , who takes her daughter to use the sensory room at the centre after she was born with underdeveloped eyesight , says she fears the pram park could become a target for thieves ' seeking a solution that works for everyone would be infinitely preferable to hiding behind quoting " health and safety " as a blanket excuse
' darlington 's mp jenny chapman said : ' only a crazy person would insist parents wake their sleeping children before they 're ready
' i 'm sure there were sound practical reasons for suggesting the rule but we need to make sure nothing puts parents off accessing services
' jenni cooke , a councillor responsbile for children , families and learning , added : ' we have n't banned people from bringing prams and buggies into the centre but it is a question of safety for everyone who uses it
' we 've asked people to use their judgement , particularly at busy times , and park their prams and buggies in the covered , on - site buggy park
' we will provide locks and help people get in and out of the centre if they need help
' councillor cyndi hughes added : ' our priority is on speaking with these families to find workable solutions to the problems they have raised
' we know the success of our children âs centres depends on our ability to make it as user friendly as possible
