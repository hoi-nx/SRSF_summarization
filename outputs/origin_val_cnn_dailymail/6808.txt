hidden patterns of climate change have been revealed by scientists using a method more normally used to diagnose heart disease
the scientists used multiscale entropy analysis to measure the ' pulse of the planet ' in an attempt to look for subtle changes in temperature on earth
the technique is normally used by surgeons to detect irregular heartbeats in large amounts of data from echocardiograms
the graph above shows how the entropy - or predictability - of european air temperatures have become less predictable over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months
the black lines shows the temperature predictability between 1850 to 1960 while the red lines shows the entropy between 1961 and 2014 researchers at the university of leicester , however , have used it to look at the variability in the temperature in europe
they found that the climate appears to have become less regular recently when temperatures are examined on times - scales of longer than 12 months
the chances of heatwaves in europe have dramatically increased in the past decade as a result of warming temperatures , experts have said
extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are now likely to happen twice a decade , a study from the met office found last year
the chances of extreme heatwaves , such as the one in 2003 which led to tens of thousands of deaths across europe , have also increased tenfold , from a one in 1,000 year event to around one in a century
by the 2040s , such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise , according to the research published in the journal nature climate change
the study is an update of research carried out in 2004 into the heatwave the previous year
it found the likelihood of it happening again has at least doubled as a result of human activity , such as burning fossil fuels
despite a slowdown in rising global temperatures since the late 1990s , the new study found summer temperatures in central and europe affected by the 2003 heatwave had increased by 0.81 â° c ( 1.4 Â° f ) between the 1990s and the period 2004 to 2013
they say this may be a sign that the regional temperatures are being influenced by more complex feedback systems and may explain why extreme weather events such as heatwaves , floods and cold spells are happening more irregularly
professor balzter , a climate scientist at the university of leicester who led the study , said : ' i had the idea to apply a new method to the climate data
' it has been applied a lot to diagnose heart disease , because it is good at detecting regularity and randomness in time - series data
' we are literally taking the pulse of the planet
' interestingly , the changes we found only operated on time - scales longer than about a year
' on these time - scales the climate seems to have become less predictable
' multiscale entropy analysis works by searching data for small patterns of information that appear repeatedly
it many of these chunks are found then the data has low entropy and high regularity
if few are found then the system is harder to predict
the research team , shoe work is published in the journal climate , used this approach to analyse the european variance - adjusted mean monthly air temperature anomalies
they found that air temperatures between 1961 and 2014 have become less predictable than between 1850 and 1960 over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months
professor balzter said : ' evidence is mounting that the temporal dynamics of the climate system are changing at the same time as the average global temperature is increasing due to multiple climate forcings
heatwaves , like the one above hitting brighton beach , have become harder to predict because temperatures patterns across europe have become more irregular , according to the new research by climate scientists this map of central europe shows where entropy has increased ( blue ) and where it has decreased ( red ) this map of central europe shows where the temperature data had the greatest change in entropy , as shown by the colours where yellow is the greatest change and hardest to predict while white is an entropy change of zero ' a large number of extreme weather events such as prolonged cold spells , heatwaves , droughts and floods have been recorded around the world in the past 10 years
' such changes in the temporal scaling behaviour of climate time - series data can be difficult to detect
' it is possible that climate system feedbacks are expressed in altered temporal scales of the european temperature time - series data
