pope francis has not been able to enjoy a slice of pizza since being elected as the head of the catholic church in march 2013
he laments that he can no longer go out for a quick bite , so one of his loyal supporters brought one to him in the most bizarre circumstance
the pontiff was waving to thousands of supporters in naples on saturday when a local restaurant 's chef drove alongside his popemobile and personally delivered him a pizza
his co-worker at the don ernesto pizzeria filmed the incredible moment that mr cacialli got close enough to hand it directly to the pontiff , as frenzied crowds cheered him on
a smiling francis accepted the pizza which had ' il papa ' - or the francis - spelled out in dough and topped with cherry tomatoes
cacialli - whose father made a pizza for former us president bill clinton in 1994 - said he was ' full of joy that he accepted a pizza straight from my hands '
he told naples ' newspaper il mattino that he used yellow tomatoes rather than red to reflect the colours of the holy see
the heart - warming moment comes shortly after the francis 's interview with mexican tv station televista in which he spoke about his sadness at no longer being able to go out for a pizza
he said : ' the only thing i would like is to go out one day , without being recognised , and go to a pizzeria for a pizza
' it was not the only treat the pontiff received on his day - trip to naples
he was also gifted some biscuits and sweets made by cloistered nuns who affectionately mobbed him as he sat in naples cathedral
handmade : the man who made the pizza for the francis spelled out il papa-or the pope - on it with dough and dressed it with yellow cherry tomatoes to resemble the holy see abstainance : the francis recently gave an interview to mexican tv station televista in which he spoke about his sadness at no longer being able to go out for a pizza their behaviour was condemned by naples ' archbishop cardinal crescenzio sepe who made a special dispensation for them to leave the cloister for the papal visit
he did admit that the cookies were very good and he eats them with milk for breakfast every single day
pope francis also enjoyed lunch with at least 10 gay , transgender and hiv - positive inmates at a prison in naples on saturday
they were among 90 prisoners invited to dine with the pontiff on his day - long trip to southern - italian
the stop - off at the giuseppe salvia detention centre in poggioreale was not originally on his schedule , according to italian tv station tv 2000
breaking bread : on his day - trip to southern - italian , francis also had lunch with 90 inmates at a local naples prison invitation only : at least 10 of the inmates who dined with the pontiff at poggioreale prison were gay , transgender or hiv - positive gifts : as well as the pizza , the pontiff received other treats including some cookies specially made for him by cloistered nuns but the francis reportedly insisted on the meal which was prepared by the prisoners themselves
the inmates who dined with the pope were chosen by lottery from around 1,900 , the vatican website has reported
and it was a very simple and ' frugal ' because the francis wants to take the time to get to know every prisoner personally , the head of a prison ministry told vatican radio
the prison visit formed part of a very busy day for francis in the italian city that lies 150 miles south of rome
francis began praying at a sanctuary in pompeii , before holding a string of events which include an outdoor mass and meetings with young people and the sick before heading back to the vatican this evening .
