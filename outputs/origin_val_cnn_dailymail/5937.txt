austin and kane are both jostling for a spot in roy hodgson 's england squad , which is announced later this month , but the qpr striker had only praise for his compatriot
qpr striker austin has praised the ' exceptional form ' of spurs counterpart kane this season kane , who scored twice for spurs at qpr on saturday , has impressed austin this season kane fires home spurs ' second goal in the premier league encounter at loftus road ' kane has been in exceptional form this season , ' austin told paddypower.com
' he was the difference between us and spurs on saturday - and he is a great example of this self - belief
' that brace makes it eight goals in six league games and when you 're on that run you just want the games to keep coming
' he 's confident going into games , and he 's confident when he 's front of goal that he 's going to score
' that 's the kind of confidence that a striker really wants and it will inevitably benefit the team
' austin has enjoyed an excellent campaign himself , scoring 15 goals in his debut season in the top flight
austin is also in england contention after scoring 15 premier league goals this season austin 's shot flies past spurs goalkeeper hugo lloris for a consolation goal on saturday a dip in form saw austin score just once in seven matches at the start of the year but two goals in his last three games suggests the 25 - year - old his rediscovering his rhythm
' if you 're a confident striker the ball will always fall to you in the right positions , ' austin said
' if you 're in form there 's nothing stopping you picking the ball up 25 yards out and having a shot , whereas a striker low on confidence might play it out wide and be slightly more conservative
' if you get the goal to kick - start the run , your self - belief keeps growing and you know you 'll keep getting chances to score
' austin is only five away from reaching the 20 - goal mark in the league this season but the striker insists he has not set any targets
england manager roy hodgson monitored both kane and austin at loftus road on saturday ' i 've never got into the habit of setting myself personal targets , ' austin added
' if you set yourself a target you can give yourself something to achieve , but if you do n't hit those aims you see yourself as a failure
' for me that is n't a motivation
it was my first season in the premier league this year and i wanted to go in all guns blazing and just see what i could do
