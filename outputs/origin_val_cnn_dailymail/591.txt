colorado 's legal marijuana is three times stronger than it was a generation ago and is often contaminated with heavy metals , pesticides , fungus and bacteria , a startling chemical analysis of 600 samples has found
additionally , modern pot has very low levels of cannabidiol , or cbd , the compound that medical marijuana advocates say gives the drug its healing properties
in most samples , the cbd levels were so small they were undetectable
the findings come from andy lafrate , a ph.d. chemist and the founder of colorado testing firm charas scientific
andy lafrate will present the results of his research today at the national meeting of the american chemical society in denver
' it 's pretty startling just how dirty a lot of this stuff is , ' he told smithsonian.com
also alarming is the fact that people using marijuana for its reported medicinal properties usually have no way of knowing how much cbd is actually in their products
colorado only requires marijuana dispensaries to test and advertise the levels of thc - the compound in pot that gets user ' high
' cbd and contaminant levels are not tested
' i 've heard a lot of complaints from medical patients because somebody claims that a product has a high level of cbd , and it turns out that it actually does n't , ' andy lafrate says
children who are given marijuana to control epilepsy can actually be worse off because they 're being given strains of the drug with virtually no cbd and high levels of thc , which can trigger seizures , he added
andy lafrate 's tests used liquid chromatography , a highly accurate method of chemical analysis that separates out the component parts of a substance
andy lafrate says more testing is needed on the effects of contaminants on people who consume marijuana he found that colorado 's legal marijuana has thc levels of 18 to 20percent
sometimes thc is as high as 30percent
marijuana from the 1980s usually had thc levels of less than 10percent - meaning modern pot is two to three times stronger than it was a generation ago
it 's no coincidence that colorado 's marijuana is dramatically stronger and has dramatically lower cbd levels than the pot of yesteryear
growers responded to a demand from consumers for more potent pot by breeding varieties with higher levels of thc and less cbd
andy lafrate says he found very small levels of genetic variation between ' strains ' of marijuana
this means , the claims of pot with exotic names - ' skunkberry , ' ' ghost train haze , ' ' girl scout cookies ' - are usually just slick marketing ploys
additionally , much of colorado 's marijuana is contaminated with high levels of fungus spores and bacteria
it 's not known what levels of those microorganisms are safe for marijuana and more study on the subject is needed , andy lafrate says
many samples also contained traces of cancer - causing heavy metals , which come from the plants growing in contaminated soil
others had high levels of pesticides
andy lafrate warned that the marijuana growing industry is getting by on it 's hippy reputation and that many consumers believe the plants are grown naturally using organic methods - when in fact , that usually is not the case at all
even more troubling were the 200 samples of marijuana concentrates - or pot extract - that lafrate tested
these are used to make edibles and can contain up to 90percent thc
because they are concentrated doses , they can also contain very high levels of heavy metals and pesticides - as the thc level is dialed up , so are the levels of background contaminants
the solvents used like alcohol and heptane to make the concentrates also contribute startling levels of contaminants , andy lafrate warned .
