attack : the lspca ( lspca ) has said it is investigating new orleans ' second goat beheading in two months - this one with a samurai - style sword the lspca described the video in a wednesday release , saying ' while the men stand in a circle around the plastic swimming pool , string is tied around the goat âs neck and hanged from an above object
one man then beheads the goat while the other men cheer in the background and record the felony act with cell phones
' once beheaded , the goat âs legs continue to move while the body lies in the swimming pool and the head still hanging from the string
