fa chairman dyke challenged more clubs to grow their own harry kane as he unveiled his new quota proposals designed to boost the numbers of elite england footballers
dyke wants to change the rules until nearly half of each 25 - man squad in the premier league is ' home grown ' under his stricter definition of what makes a ' home grown ' player
together with new home office rules on work permits for non-eu footballers , agreed with the fa and set to be introduced in may , he believes this can increase the ratio of england players in the premier league from 35 to over 40 per cent and produce an england team to win the world cup in 2022
dyke has challenged more clubs to grow their own harry kanes to help england win the world cup fa chairman dyke has proposed three rule changes to what makes a home - grown player while there is a slight increase in the number of england players in the premier league this year â up from 32 % last year to 35 % â that is largely down to burnley being promoted
if they were to be relegated and replaced by watford â second in the european championship â the proportion would fall to 31 %
however , only 22 % of the starters in the current top four teams are qualified to play for england , compared to 28 % last year
in 2014 , just 23 england players appeared in the champions league group stage , compared with 78 spanish , 55 germans and 51 brazilians
this season the three england clubs that reached the knockout stages of the champions league started only 10 england players , compared to 12 french and nine spanish in those three sides
in the last two weeks only five england players started in the second legs of the knockout stage
in 2010 england under 17s won the european championship , beating spain in the final
of that 18 - man match - day squad , only four have gone on to play more than 20 top - flight games , while double that from the spanish squad have done so in la liga
of the 12 clubs who have played in each of the last five premier league seasons , the average number of home - grown players per squad has gone from 11.4 to 9.4
only 62 % of current home - grown players are qualified to play for england
dyke set this target 18 months ago when he established a commission to investigate the diminishing number of england players at the top level and a clock on the wall of the coaches ' room at st george 's park is counting down to the world cup final in 2022 , albeit the wrong date since fifa confirmed the qatar tournament will be moved to winter
dyke warned he is prepared to force his rule - changes through the courts if agreements can not be reached with the premier league and the football league
his proposal is to make three changes to the ' home grown ' player rules , to be phased in over four years from the start of 2016 - 17
1 ) a home grown player is a player irrespective of nationality who is registered to play in england or wales for three years before his 18th birthday ( rather than his 21st birthday as currently stated )
this takes players like cesc fabregas out of the equation , and others signed at 16
2 ) reduce the number of non-home grown players in a 25 - man first - team squad from 17 to 13
and so increase the home-grown players from eight to 12
3 ) introduce requirement that at least two home grown players are ' club trained ' , ie. have been registered with their current club for three years prior to their 18th birthday
dyke 's vision is to open pathways for those like harry kane to make the final step from talented development player to the first - team without unexceptional foreign players blocking the route
' how many more harry kanes are out there who just ca n't get a game ? ' said dyke , summoning the example of the 21 - year - old tottenham striker who has broken into the first - team this season , took his goal tally to 29 with a hat - trick on saturday and has been rewarded with his first senior england call - up
harry kane scored his first premier league hat - trick for tottenham at the weekend and has a bright england future england manager roy hodgson has called up harry kane to the england senior squad for the first time ' suddenly an england kid who was out on loan and touch - and - go to get a game in the first - team is the top - scorer in england football
' a lot of very talented kids are going into professional football clubs at a very young age and an awful lot are getting lost
we have to do more to help these kids and give future england managers a greater chance of success
' it is also not aimed at disadvantaging our clubs in uefa competitions
apart from porto , who have this established association with brazilians talent , every other club in the champions league quarter - finals would satisfy these criteria
' if bayern munich , real madrid , barcelona , juventus , atletico madrid , psg and monaco can do it , why ca n't our clubs ? ' dyke ( centre ) has a vision that he hopes will enable england to win the 2022 world cup only 23 england players appeared in the champions league group stage this season , and three - terry ( left ) , steven gerrard ( centre ) and frank lampard ( right ) - have retired from international duty only 23 england players appeared in the champions league group stage this season , compared with 51 brazilians , 55 germans and 78 spanish players
three - terry , frank lampard and steven gerrard - have retired from international duty
only five england players started in the second leg of the last 16 ties : terry , gary cahill , joe hart , james milner and danny welbeck
' that 's the grim picture at the top of the game , but it 's hard to argue we don ' t have the talent , ' said dyke , who applauded the work of the academies and the premier league 's elite player performance plan
the fa chairman reaffirmed the his commitment to improving coach education and grassroots facilities but has abandoned the idea of allowing b - teams to compete within the football league framework
gary cahill ( left ) was one of just five england players to start in the second leg of the champions league last 16 steve cotterill 's bristol city won the johnstone 's paint trophy on sunday , but plans are forming to include under 21 teams alongside league one and two clubs ' there 's no point flogging a dead horse , ' he said , but plans are forming to include u21 teams from premier league clubs in the johnstone 's paint trophy
asked about the reaction he expected from the clubs , dyke replied : ' some will buy in , some wo n't
we will go round and try to convince them
we will ask : are you sure you have n't got a harry kane playing in your youth side ? ' it 's not an option i 'd like to go down but the fa could change the rules
or we could persuade uefa to change the rules
' dyke has taken legal advice and believes he could force this through
the italian fa have agreed to non-eu restrictions in serie a from 2016
mame biram diouf qualifies for a work permit under the old formula , but not under the new formula bryan oviedo ( right ) is another player who would struggle to obtain a work permit under the new system the home office work permit changes are expected to quicken the process
from may , non-eu work permits will be reset with a new formula involving the player 's cost combined with his nationality and international experience and leagues where he has played
the top 50 ranked nations will be eligible , rather than the top 70
overall this would increase the opportunities of brazilians and argentines but reduce those from lower ranked nations , meaning that players like bryan ovideo , ryo miyaichi , roger espinoza , brek shea , mame biram diouf and geoff cameron who qualified under the old system , would fail
the fa estimate that 42 players who acquired work permits in the last five years would not under the new rules
and , although there will be an appeals process , it will be less lenient than before when 80 per cent of appeals were successful .
