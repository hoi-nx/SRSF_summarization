california will run out of water in 12 months , according to a nasa scientist
the state only has one year of supply left in its reservoirs due to persistent drought and is also running out of backup groundwater , jay famiglietti , senior water scientist at the nasa jet propulsion laboratory , wrote
the drought means that total water storage in california , which has been in decline since 2002 , has been sapped by the need to use the resource for farming , he said in the los angeles times
jay famiglietti suggested immediate water - rationing measures , which are being considered in southern california , across the state
the use of groundwater for farming in the central valley has caused land to sink by one foot a year
sprinklers and other landscaping accounts for 70 per cent of urban water use , according to the sacramento bee
governor jerry brown declared a drought emergency at the beginning of last year , though california only reduced their water usage by 9 per cent instead of a hoped - for 20 per cent
beyond residents ' consumpton , use of groundwater for farming in the central valley has caused land to sink by one foot a year
he also urged the acceleration of task forces and programs meant to ensure that california will have enough water in the future , which are currently slated to ' achieve sustainability ' in 2042
the current drought in the western us , which is entering its fourth year , is the worst in modern us history
snowpacks in california mountains like the sierra nevadas , which the state relies to melt into water , have been near record lows this year
scientists from nasa , cornell university and columbia university released research in february that said there could be worse droughts to come

jay famiglietti , writing in the los angeles times , said he 'd ' like to live in a state that has a paddle so that it might also still have a creek ' scientists from nasa , cornell university and columbia university released research in february that said there could be worse droughts to come
a ' megadrought ' that could last several decades and would be worse than any other such phenomenon in 1000 years is expected sometimes between 2050 and 2099 , according to their research published in science
the current dryness affects not only the west coast , but also the rest of the country
california grows the majority of many fruits and vegetables for the us
their produce makes up 69 per cent of carrots , 71 per cent of spinach , 99 per cent of artichokes and more than 90 per cent of broccoli , according to slate
jay famiglietti said that ' the public remains detached from discussions and decisions ' about conserving water and urged them to take ownership of the crisis .
