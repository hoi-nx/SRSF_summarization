thousands of miles from the playground , real lessons of life and death are played out every day in what 's left of the wild world
this was one such class in kenya 's maasai mara national park , where a lioness taught her cubs how to hunt and kill a wildebeest to stay alive
captured by south african photographer mark dumbleton , the lioness began by circling her prey before her cubs joined the hunt
the animal fought back - but outnumbered and separated from the herd , it was only a matter of time before it was overpowered
mr mark dumbleton , a wildlife photographer since 2007 , said : ' it was amazing to watch a mother training her children for when they have to leave the pride
' i could n't believe the animal instinct they had
the lioness was roaring at them , but they knew exactly how to take down such a large animal
' the whole experience only lasted a couple of minutes
