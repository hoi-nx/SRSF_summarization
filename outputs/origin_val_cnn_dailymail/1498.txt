swiping through the air to control items on a screen conjure up images of the sci - fi technology seen in minority report
but a norway firm has not only designed the system using an everyday smartphone , it has designed it to work from up to seven feet ( 2 metres ) away
the system tracks a user âs hands movements using ultrasound to skip through images , play and pause videos and music , take selfies and control characters in online games
ultrasound signals sent through the air from speakers in smartphones and tablets bounce against a user âs hand and are recorded by standard microphones
elliptic labs â technology uses these signals to recognises hand gestures and uses them to move objects on a screen
the company compared it to the way bats use echolocation to navigate
gestures can be recognised from all sides of the device at 180 degrees
during mailonline âs demonstration , elliptic labs â vice president of product development , strutt showcased how the technology can be used to show or hide the controls on youtube videos
dubbed ultra-fast ultra-far interaction , the system was built by experts at norway - based elliptic labs

he revealed how photos can be moved and managed using slow or fast swipes left and right , how an on - screen octopus could be controlled on a mobile game by moving his hand up and down , and taking selfies by virtually tapping a shutter button
and on a tablet , a music app and playback was controlled by virtually pressing the play button
a previous version , which measured gestures from 19 inches ( 50cm ) away , was showcased at this year âs consumer electronics show in las vegas in january
this demo introduced multi layer interaction ( mli ) which lets mobiles and tablets display different content depending on the location and distance a user âs hand is from the device
by using technology that is already inside smartphones along with software that can sit on top of existing operating systems , elliptic labs hopes to launch the technology in handsets later this year
science fiction to reality : the technology that involves swiping through the air to control items on a screen conjures up images of the futuristic world seen in minority report ( scene pictured ) elliptic labs â technology uses these signals to recognises hand gestures and uses them to move objects on a screen
the company compared it to the way bats use echolocation to navigate ( demo handset pictured ) mr strutt said the company had already partnered with two manufacturers but did nât reveal which ones
â with elliptic labs â gesture recognition technology the entire zone above and around a mobile device becomes interactive and responsive to the smallest gesture , â said the firm
â the active area is 180 degrees around the device made possible by ultrasound [ and ] elliptic labs delivers the largest interaction space for consumer electronic devices while using very low power
â mr strutt added that the interaction space can also be customised by device manufacturers or software developers depending on how they want it to be used .
