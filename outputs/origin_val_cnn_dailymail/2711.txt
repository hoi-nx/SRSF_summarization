microsoft 's co-founder has used his own submarine to find the wreck of the japanese navy 's biggest warship - which has lain undiscovered at the bottom of the ocean for the past 70 years
allen revealed his amazing discovery to the world on tuesday , by posting a photo to twitter of the world war ii battleship musashi 's rusty bow , which bore the japanese empire 's chrysanthemum seal
the musashi - which , along with its sister ship yamato , was the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleship ever constructed - was sunk by the navy in 1944 , taking with it more than 1,000 crew members
but despite numerous eyewitness accounts , its exact location had remained a mystery - until now

billionaire allen said the octopus , his luxury yacht and exploration ship , found the long - lost ship on the floor of the sibuyan sea - 1.6 miles under the surface
the octopus ' remote operated probe octo rov located the musashi on monday , according to allen 's website
the octopus is also outfitted with an exploration submarine
allen and his research team had used the historical records of four different countries in order to pinpoint the location of the ship
on tuesday , allen posted a photo of a valve from the wreckage , which he described as the ' first confirmation ' that it was of japanese origin
' rip ( rest in peace ) crew of musashi , approximately 1,023 ( lives ) lost , ' allen said in another tweet
he said on twitter he would soon post video of the ship 's catapult and valve areas
found : allen took to twitter to reveal he had found the wreck of the musashi , sunk in 1944 war : u.s. warplanes sank the musashi on october 24 , 1944 , at the height of the second battle of the philippine sea record breaking : the musashi was the largest armed battleship to ever be made

but in 1944 , it was the scene for a battle considered the largest naval encounter of the world war ii - a battle which would be the musashi 's last
the battleship , which weighed 73,000 tons fully loaded , and was armed with nine 45 caliber type 94 main guns , was sunk by u.s. warplanes on october 24 , 1944 , at the height of the second battle of the philippine sea - in which u.s. and australian forces defeated the japanese
about half the crew died when it went down
sister ship the yamato was damaged in the fighting , according to the navy , and u.s. warships finally sank it a year later as it attempted to reach okinawa
discoveries : the u.s. billionaire ( pictured ) has also pursued space exploration for seattle - born allen , 62 , who founded microsoft with bill gates in 1975 , the discovery of the musashi is a thrilling moment
' since my youth , i have been fascinated with world war ii history , inspired by my father âs service in the u.s. army , ' allen said
' the musashi is truly an engineering marvel and , as an engineer at heart , i have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction
' i am honored to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honoring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her
' allen , the 51st richest person in the world with a net worth of $ 17.5billion , according to forbes magazine , is known for his love of history - and also his generosity with the octopus to help other exploration missions
in 2012 , allen loaned the same ship that located the musashi to the british government to locate hms hood bell from the bottom of the denmark strait
the search was eventually called off due to bad weather
the octopus has also collaborated on google earth âs ' explore the ocean ' feature , and has helped the discovery science channel capture footage for a documentary to study the effects of nuclear detonation on the marine environment
director james cameron has also used it , for a seven - hour solo journey to the earth 's deepest point back in 2012
but allen is not confined to undersea exploration , either

allen pictured here with george lucas in 2005 the u.s. is also working on a project called stratolaunch , which aims to put ' cost - effective ' cargo and manned missions into space
he launched spaceshipone , the first privately built craft into suborbital space in 2004
spokespersons for the philippines ' navy and coast guard told afp they were not informed of the discovery
for four days in october 1944 , the seas around the island of leyte bore witness to what some believe is the biggest battle in naval history
the second battle of the philippine sea , formerly known as the second battle of the philippine sea , began on october 23 , pitting the combined force of the u.s. and australian forces against the imperial japanese navy
three days earlier , the u.s. had launched an attack on leyte ; the japanese responded with sho-go - an operation designed to lure u.s. forces away from the san bernardino strait
but the japanese navy was attacked by u.s. submarines as it moved into position on october 23 - the first of four major encounters over the battle
the musashi survived this first encounter , but the next day , as it passed through the sibuyan sea , came under bombardment from the u.s. warplanes
it was first hit at 10.30am , and then again in a second wave
however , the ship did not finally disappear under the waves until 7.30pm that evening
it had been struck by at least 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes during the battle
by october 26 - the end of the battle - the japanese lost 26 battleships , but only sank six of the u.s. 's ships
the japanese had also suffered huge numbers of casualties : more than 10,000 men are believed to have died
the allied forces , on the other hand , lost around 1,500
the battle of leyte gulf was the largest loss the japanese navy had ever encountered sources : encyclopedia britannica and militaryhistory.com
