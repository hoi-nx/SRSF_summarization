the top layer of your skin is full of dead cells
microdermabrasion is a great way to get rid of dead cells and dirt
â pmd personal microderm ( Â£ 150 , harrods.com ) solution : the pmd personal microderm ( Â£ 150 , harrods.com ) is a hand - held gadget for at - home microdermabrasion

under this is a small , flat head covered in fine aluminium oxide crystals
read the instructions carefully â this could damage your skin if used incorrectly
epionce intensive nourishing cream ( Â£ 79 , epionce.co.uk ) i choose a medium - strength head and turn it on , running the end of the nozzle up the back of my hand
