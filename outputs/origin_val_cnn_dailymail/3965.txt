but having returned to action last december for spurs , kyle walker is buzzing to be back as he pushes for a start in friday 's euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania
' i have had a lot of tests in my career so far , ' said kyle walker , who has been capped 10 - times for his country to date
' i think obviously being injured and missing the world cup was tough
not being able to play for my country in brazil was a big kick in the teeth
' in football you 're going to have a lot of ups and downs , but you need to stay mentally strong and you need to stay focused
you need to know you 're a professional and you 've got a job to do
' it âs not a one - man game
it 's 10 other players on the pitch that everyone must rely on to get the three points you âre striving for throughout the week
' kyle walker could spend a long time selecting a pair of trainers from his huge collection the defender admits his obsession with trainers drives his girlfriend insane kyle walker looks proud of his huge footwear collection now you see it ... kyle walker has at least one pair of trainers with a camouflage design kyle walker is set to return for england , having last played in a friendly against germany in november 2013 the right - back is back in the spurs first team after a nine - month spell on the sidelines through injury away from the pitch , the former sheffield united right - back revealed he enjoys playing golf with his mates
but it is rather is obsession for cleanliness that drives his model girlfriend annie crazy
' i like things to be clean , ' he said , speaking to a nike q&a as part of the american brand 's launch of air max day
' i do n't like mess
my missus will probably tell you that i drive her insane with all my cleanliness
' it âs probably why i 've got 20 packs of baby wipes in a cupboard down there just so when i come into my sneaker closet , i can keep them clean and fresh
' kyle walker blames his other obsession - trainers - on his mum , however
' i 've always had a trainer fetish , ' he added
it was flip - flops , not trainers , when kyle walker and annie holidayed in barbados in summer 2013 and the couple hit the sea on a jet ski during the same holiday despite england 's woeful performance , kyle walker says missing the 2014 world cup was ' a kick in the teeth ' ' that 's just my thing
i think i caught it from my mum , because i know my mum does like shoes
so i think i 've caught it off her , but i think i 've kind of overtook her now , definitely
' how many pairs have i got ? oh , i do n't know
i could n't tell you
' i know i 've got some in the garage that i still have n't unpacked , because obviously i 've just moved to this new house
so i 'd say i 've got quite a bit
and you know what ? i think mum has actually got a full bedroom of them at home
' now he is fit and firing again , kyle walker will be hoping to collect a bedroom full of england caps too .
