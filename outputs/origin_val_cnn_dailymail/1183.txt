manchester united boosted their champions league chances with a convincing win over spurs , racing into a three - goal lead in the first half before seeing the game out
carrick bossed the midfield , before wayne rooney stole the show with a brilliant goal - and an even better celebration
sportsmail 's matt barlow was at old trafford to run the rule over both sides ... wayne rooney celebrates with his ' knockout ' celebration as manchester united take a three - goal lead manchester united david de gea : a relaxed spectator from the moment he scrambled across his goal to keep out back - pass from jones until he saved from harry kane in the last minute
antonio valencia : few problems of a defensive nature after his error against arsenal and combined well with mata in attack
chris smalling : few centre halves have coped so well with harry kane in recent weeks
read it well , quick into the tackle and ran the ball out with style once or twice
7 david de gea , who had remarkably little to do until a last - gasp save from harry kane , celebrates the win phil jones : strong and assured - but for the sloppy back - pass which almost caught out de gea in opening minutes
6.5 daley blind : splendid first half , raiding forward from left - back to link up with young as manchester united tore spurs apart before half - time
carrick : took a grip of the game with two instances of clear - minded wit in the first half : a pass for marouane fellaini âs opener and a goal with his head to make it 2 - 0
mata : like carrick making his first premier league start for two months , playing wide on the right where he often struggles to cover the ground
carrick heads the ball back across goal to put manchester united two goals up after some poor spurs defending carrick , who also created manchester united 's first goal for marouane fellaini , was the best player on the pitch ander herrera : supplied good energy , invention and forward thrust from midfield and a key to success of the formation
marouane fellaini : huge first - half contribution
spurs could not cope with him
one well - taken goal with his left foot and a key header in second
young : excellent reminder of his acceleration and trickery on the left - wing
tormented walker in the first half as manchester united won the game
marouane fellaini celebrates putting manchester united into the lead with a well - placed finish in the ninth minute of the game wayne rooney : mobile and tireless , with wonderful vision to link up with his midfield runners
scored a fabulous goal and may have had more
subs : pereira for mata ( 79 min ) premier league debut
falcao for marouane fellaini ( 83 )
rafael for carrick ( 87 ) manager : louis van gaal : having started the season trying to cram as many attackers onto the pitch as possible , this 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 shape had a pleasing balance
wayne rooney slots away after being handed the ball by lacklustre nabil bentaleb in the opening 45 louis van gaal waves to the manchester united fans after a game where he finally found his team 's balance spurs hugo lloris : badly exposed by his team in the first - half
little he could do with any of the goals , but unable to save spurs this time
kyle walker : torrid opening 45 minutes when he could not contain the first - half threat of young and blind on manchester united âs left
not helped by his midfield 4
eric dier : beaten in air by marouane fellaini for manchester united second
easily side - stepped by wayne rooney for the third
easier after the break when manchester united cruised
jan vertonghen : perhaps the only one of the defensive unit to escape with a little credit
even so , not able to keep manchester united at bay
the spurs defenders look shell - shocked at the half - time whistle after being completely over-run danny rose : not the result or performance he would have wanted in front of england boss hodgson , but most of the damage done by manchester united on the other side
ryan mason : appeared overwhelmed by manchester united âs intensity and the thrust of marouane fellaini and herrera
dragged right to help with young and blind , left holes for marouane fellaini to exploit
nabil bentaleb : like mason , found it impossible to get any sort of grip on the game in midfield
awful mistake for the third goal
townsend : a torrid half - hour
he supplied precious little protection for walker and enjoyed little quality possession to attack
townsend was withdrawn in the first half after a torrid first 30 minutes in manchester townsend can not bear to look as he sits on the old trafford bench after being replaced so early on christian eriksen : flickers of magic from the dane were absent
a victim of spurs âs inability to secure possession
nacer chadli : poor clearance gave carrick chance to score the second
swtiched to the right after townsend subbed to provide more solidity , which he did
harry kane : a difficult afternoon in front of hodgson
ran hard as ever but was isolated and starved of the ball and it was the 89th minute before he tested de gea
subs : dembele for townsend ( 31 ) helped make spurs a little more solid 5 ; lamela for mason ( 64 ) minimal influence 4 , adebayor for chadli ( 79 ) out of exile to little effect
mauricio pochettino may have made an early chance , but it was already too late for spurs on sunday manger : mauricio pochettino : his team were stunned by manchester united âs intense start and slow to adjust until he sent on dembele for townsend , by when it was too late
referee : mark clattenburg : back at old trafford for manchester united v spurs a decade after missing the pedro mendes goal which crossed the line
this experience was far less controversial
