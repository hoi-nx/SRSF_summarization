a teenager has been diagnosed with depression after she was hit with a whopping Â£ 5,000 holiday phone bill
searle , 17 , visited egypt with her family for eight days and mistakenly thought she had a Â£ 120 limit on her contract with o2
but when the shop worker , from bridgwater , somerset , returned home she was horrified when her mother sharon - whose name was on the contract - received a Â£ 4,908.69 bill
distraught searle - whose family ca n't afford the repayments - felt so guilty about the bill she went to the doctors and was prescribed anti-depressants
searle , 17 , pictured with her mother sharon searle , after she ran up a Â£ 5,000 phone bill in egypt mother mrs searle , 51 , said : ' my daughter has had to go on anti-depressants since she got the bill
it has really affected her
' she 's been really upset
she did n't realise that this was happening
the contract is in my name and she feels guilty
' you do n't expect your 17 - year - old daughter to be on anti-depressants
' searle is really worried that we wo n't be able to pay it back and the bailiffs will be round
' they said we can pay Â£ 100 a month
we ca n't afford it
we could maybe afford Â£ 50 , but that would take years
i think they could do more
' i do n't know what to do
i 've cried , i 've been angry
what the hell will i do ? the family flew to sharm el sheik , egypt , for a christmas holiday on december 22 and searle thought she was using the hotel wifi to keep in touch with friends on facebook
she was sent a text asking if she wanted to increase her bill limit to Â£ 120 - or 200mb of data - and she agreed
the family headed to sharm el sheik , egypt for a christmas holiday and searle chatted with her friends searle , pictured with her mother and her mother 's partner leigh ( right ) , thought her bill was capped at Â£ 120 but when she got a second text later to say she had reached that limit , she agreed to remove the data restriction , mistakenly thinking she still could n't go above Â£ 120
she thought the bill would be more than covered by the Â£ 200 she set aside before her holiday , so was astonished to return home to a Â£ 3,704.34 bill on january 2
however , not all data she used on her iphone 6 to browse the web and facebook was included in the first bill , and it was upped to Â£ 4,908.69 on february 27
searle is now taking anti-depressant citalopram every day and is nervous the bill will tear the family apart
mrs searle , an administrator , who was on holiday with her partner and his son , added : ' if i had known i would have told her to stop
searle thought she was still within the Â£ 120
' i just got an email to say the bill was Â£ 3704.34
' they put it up in february
they said they had n't included everything in the january bill
when i rang in january saying i needed help they said ' unlucky '
' i was ringing them every day
how do you bill for something in january and then again in february ? ' she had set aside Â£ 200 for her bill while she was abroad , but the family now face years of paying it off since the huge bill was sent , o2 has slightly dropped the cost to Â£ 3,191.97 as a gesture of goodwill
a company spokesperson said : ' to help protect customers from higher costs charged by overseas networks we cap data usage at Â£ 40
' customers need to tell us if they want to increase this limit and confirm to us again if they want the cap removed completely
' we received two separate notifications from ms searle 's mobile asking us to do just that
' we are clear with customers on the cost of overseas charges and would always advise customers to think carefully before choosing to remove the usage caps
