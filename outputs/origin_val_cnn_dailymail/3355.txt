one man alone is not going to save english cricket
the kevin pietersen storyline is a good'un , full of rage , intrigue and hypocrisy
but the longer it goes on , the less we will be inclined to analyse what really ails our game
england will not win or lose the ashes on the basis of whether kevin pietersen returns
there are n't , after all , many examples of test series being won by a single player : harold larwood needed bill voce during bodyline , ian botham needed bob in 1981 , mitchell johnson needed brad haddin in 2013 - 14
and a 35 - year - old kevin pietersen is unlikely to be in any of those categories
if he does return , we may â briefly â get more people talking about cricket ; he may produce some magic to belie his age ; critics of downton may feel vindicated ; it will almost certainly be a whole lot of fun
kevin pietersen shows off his latest flamboyant hairstyle on his way to the fox sports studio on tuesday that 's the best - case scenario
but let 's not pretend it would solve much
english cricket has always presided over a deeply imperfect system , one hampered by a fear of revolution
occasionally we commission a serious report , which makes us feel progress is being made
but entertaining diversions are just as crucial to the psyche of the english cricket lover : they mean we can go easy on the self - analysis
from wg âs gamesmanship via compton âs knee through to ian botham âs extra-curriculars and kevin pietersen âs tweets , our game has always quietly welcomed the glamorous , scurrilous sideshow , the tabloid tittle - tattle to balance out broadsheet sobriety
yet if the game is reduced over the coming months to a string of will - he - wo nât - he bulletins about the future of a player who has , at best , two years left at the highest level , then we will be doing the game a disservice
( i hope kevin pietersen proves me wrong
if he returns to international cricket , i hope he scores lots more test hundreds and gives us all something to cheer about
the point of this article is not to pick on kevin pietersen
) kevin pietersen is gunning for an england recall after his exile from the side , but turns 35 in the summer the batsman has enjoyed some stellar achievements with england , such as here after the 2005 ashes win kevin pietersen 's antics entertain the public just as ian botham 's extra-curricular activities once did
here the all - rounder was pictured dressed as a rabbit next to team - mate phil defreitas in melbourne in 1986 what should concern english cricket right now is how one of the best - resourced teams in the world spent the world cup looking like one of the worst ; how an air of fatalism about their chances became a self - fulfilling prophecy ; and how downton appeared so intensely relaxed about the fact that england were miles off the pace
in fact , batting was not even the half of their problems â another reason why the kevin pietersen debate risks straying into red - herring territory
five members of the top seven averaged over 35 , with strike - rates ranging from jos buttler âs 135 to ian bell âs 77
these are not figures to win you a world cup , but neither are they out - and - out disasters
far worse was the bowling , with james anderson and stuart broad taking nine wickets between them at an average of 55
not until chris jordan was given a game against bangladesh did anyone nail a yorker
steven finn went for nearly seven an over , which was expensive even by the standards of this world cup
and the refusal to look at james tredwell and ravi bopara until it was too late was plain stubborn
video we take responsibility for exit - morgan stuart broad was a key member of england 's struggling bowling attack during the world cup steven finn ( right ) has gone backwards in both pace and achievement as a bowler chris woakes has added pace but england 's bowling stocks pale in comparison with the likes of australia these are all questions that should concern colin graves and tom harrison in the short term
but the long term is even more worrying : where are england âs fast bowlers going to come from ? this is the area that has always been most poorly served by an overcrowded domestic schedule played on tired pitches
even james anderson has always relied on craftsmanship rather than speed , while stuart broad keeps breaking down and steven finn has slowed
how long before satisfaction over the extra yard of pace added by chris woakes gives way to another sense of anti-climax ? for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on twitter : @ the_topspin english fast bowlers emerge in spite of the system , not because of it
pudding - like pitches help medium - pacers
why waste all the effort of tearing in at 92mph when you can put it there or thereabouts â three words that get to the heart of english cricket â at 78mph and watch the grass do the rest ? we ca n't simply blame the climate
a decade ago , old trafford would cause steve harmison to lick his lips
the oval has had its moments too
taunton makes bowlers work hard for their wickets
more damaging , we 're left to conclude , is a domestic set - up which encourages fast bowlers to throttle back if they 're to stand any chance of making it through the season
it should n't be the case that england feel the need to take promising young quicks out of the domestic game , away from the coaches who know them best
a glance at australia 's list of fast bowlers provides an unnerving glimpse of the future
if england are able to come up with an attack that regularly takes 20 wickets , then the inclusion or otherwise of one batsman will feel like an irrelevance
that was the week that was then again â¦ michael vaughan believes kevin pietersen has a 10 per cent chance of playing for england again
the mystery is why kevin pietersen is n't doing his best to increase the odds
speaking on fox sports last week , he had some fair things to say about the way peter moores had handled england 's world cup campaign â but basic psychology tells you they were the kind of points better made by an out - and - out pundit , not a man hoping to resurrect his international career by working with â¦ peter moores ! peter moores ( left ) will hardly be encouraged by his previous with kevin pietersen ... and kevin pietersen 's latest comments ' i heard the coach come out and say : " we do nât have a settled side " , ' said kevin pietersen
' well mate , you played six months of one - day cricket before that game
even if you do nât think you 've got a settled squad , you do nât go and tell the whole world you do nât have a settled squad
" later : ' i 've played under flower and i had a worse relationship with flower than i did with peter moores
' it 's fine to have these views
we all have thoughts we realise it 's best to keep to ourselves
but , not for the first time , you do wonder : who , if anyone , is advising kevin pietersen ? morgan has conflicting ipl and england duties double standards ? that said , it would be intriguing to know what kevin pietersen makes of morgan 's decision to place his ipl deal with sunrisers hyderabad ahead of england 's trip to dublin in may for a one - day international that has taken on an extra dimension following the world cup farce
kevin pietersen has been criticised in the past â including by this writer â for seeking to place ipl commitments ahead of national duty
yet the ecb 's more relaxed approach to the ipl sheds a more sympathetic light on kevin pietersen 's wishes
he has not always helped himself , but his contention that english cricket is riven with double standards is boosted by morgan 's position
and morgan , do n't forget , is england 's one - day captain
a proud tradition there was uproar last week when zimbabwe 's herald newspaper published a nasty piece headlined ' alcoholic dumps zim out of world cup ' â a reference to a crucial catch held by ireland 's john mooney to dismiss sean williams , with replays suggesting mooney 's foot made contact with the boundary as he held on
mooney has previously admitted problems with drink and depression , though quite what this had to do with the incident in question was anyone 's guess
ireland 's john mooney was the subject of a cruel piece by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper mooney helped ireland eliminate zimbabawe from the world cup by catching out sean williams tv replays suggested mooney 's foot touched the boundary rope , meaning the catch should not have stood a south african colleague , however , suggested we were all misplacing our energy
so absurd , she said , was the herald that it recently ran an editorial berating journalists for their coverage of mugabe 's comedy stumble on a carpet at harare airport
the herald was so keen to prove that mugabe 's accident had nothing to do with his age ( he is 91 ) , and everything to do with a ' poorly laid - out carpet ' , that it solemnly listed other moments of high - society slapstick
