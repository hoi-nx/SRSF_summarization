cab driver david perry , 52 , sexually assaulted two women who fell asleep in his taxi a black cab driver who sexually assaulted young women who fell asleep in his taxi after nights out has been jailed for 10 years
david perry , 52 , attempted to rape his first victim and sexually assaulted the second after climbing into the back of his cab and removing the women 's clothing while they slept , in separate attacks some 16 months apart
but scotland yard believe the cab driver of 25 years may have preyed on more women and urged potential victims to come forward
judge john lafferty said the victims had suffered ' serious psychological harm ' as a result of the attacks as he sentenced the father of two to 10 years in prison and a subsequent five - year licence period at snaresbrook crown court
the court heard how david perry told police after his arrest that he had been ' worried about what he might do ' because of his high hormone levels after the break - up of a relationship and had sought help from his doctor
the women , in their 20s , were both heavily drunk after socialising in east london when they were assaulted in the early hours of the morning , the first attack in january 2013 and the second in may 2014
prosecutor peter clement told the court that david perry was in a high position of trust when he took of advantage of the women
' both victims had been out with friends , both had been drinking and both were at the relevant time highly intoxicated , ' he said
' they were , by virtue of their drunkenness , particularly vulnerable
their incapacity made them no less deserving than anyone else of being safe
' they each sought the security and safety they were entitled to expect from a london taxi - a black cab
' he exploited his passengers ' obvious vulnerability for his own sexual gratification
one of the victims , who last remembered being in or around commercial road ( pictured ) in shoreditch , woke to find herself without her trousers or underwear on and the driver lying beside her ' whilst each was asleep in what should have been the safety of his black cab , he stopped , got in to the back of his cab and stripped and sexually assaulted each victim while they slept or were semi-conscious
' in the first attack , the court heard that the victim had been out drinking with friends since lunchtime but could not remember leaving shoreditch house in bethnal green
the woman , who was not in court , said she woke up half - naked in the back of a taxi while the driver was performing a sex act on her
he then twice attempted to have sex with her but was unsuccessful
david perry was sentenced to 10 years in prison and a subsequent five - year licence period at snaresbrook crown court ( pictured ) she described being unable to focus or rationalise what was happening and was next aware of being at home , where she made a ' hysterical ' phone call to a friend , recognising that she had been the victim of a serious sexual assault
it was not until more than a year later , when a second victim of a similar sex assault came forward , that police were able to track david perry down
the second victim , who last remembered being in the commercial road area of shoreditch , woke to find herself without her trousers or underwear on and the driver lying beside her
the driver then dropped her home , where the woman raised the alarm with her boyfriend
she was able to give police details about the driver and his cab and officers trawled through cctv which led to david perry 's arrest
detective chief inspector samantha price , from scotland yard 's sexual offences unit , praised the victims for reporting the assaults and for their ' strength and determination ' in seeing david perry brought to justice
she urged other potential victims to come forward
' david perry was a taxi driver for some 25 years and i must consider the possibility he may have committed other offences that have not been reported to the police , ' she said
' as part of this investigation we have made detailed inquiries into his past and eliminated unsolved cases from this inquiry
' i would now appeal directly to anyone who , as a result of this case , thinks they may have been raped or assaulted by david perry
' i would like to reassure anyone worried about coming forward that they will be treated with the utmost sensitivity and specially trained officers will be available to listen to them and support them through each step
