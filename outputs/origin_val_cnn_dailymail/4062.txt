a millionaire tory donor and prominent party supporter has been a heavy cocaine user for years , the daily mail can reveal
the businessman âs identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class a drug
he has spoken of personally meeting prime minister cameron but leads a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes
the businessman âs identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class a drug ( file image above ) just last month he attended the party âs high - profile donors â ball , and the entrepreneur has frequently spoken out in favour of government policies
but despite initially keeping it a secret from even those closest to him , he has now admitted â behind closed doors â to using prodigious quantities of the dangerous stimulant and of hiring prostitutes on a weekly basis
his consumption of the drug is so high that people are routinely jailed for possessing the same amount he takes in a single day â because it is assumed that only a drug dealer would carry so much
and remarkably â despite spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on his habit in just a few years â the businessman has so far avoided any prosecution or publicity about his addiction
however he is not shy about appearing in the public eye
he always seems full of energy when caught on camera , and has been very talkative with journalists
he has waged a very loud publicity campaign for his business , putting many details about his life into the public domain
the addict has also spoken out against labour policies and in favour of the conservative government â including for moves which benefited him financially
among the tory fundraising events the man has supported is the black and white winter ball attended by cameron and samantha cameron in 2007 ( above ) the donor refused to comment , however when asked about the heavy cocaine addiction , a source close to him said : â there âs a court order and it would be a contempt of court if he was identified
â he is not a well man
he âs trying to sort it out and sort himself out
he definitely does n't want to talk about it at this stage
â among the tory fundraising events the man has supported is the black and white winter ball â a glittering occasion swarming with the super rich
the most recent ball â at the grosvenor house hotel on exclusive park lane â attracted criticism because the wealthy donors included porn barons and tax avoiders
tables for ten at the february event cost up to Â£ 15,000 each , while the minimum price for a single ticket was Â£ 500
dinner was scheduled to go on for three - and - a - half hours with speeches by mr cameron and the conservative chairman lord feldman
guests could bid to go shoe shopping with home secretary theresa may , have a cup of tea with boris johnson , go for a 10km run with iain duncan smith , or have a week in a luxury chalet in switzerland
in the final big fundraiser ahead of the general election , Â£ 210,000 was spent on a bronze bust of margaret thatcher and Â£ 220,000 was bid for a week - long holiday in a spanish fortress
one of the paying guests forked out Â£ 110,000 at the auction for a single night âs exclusive use of annabel âs nightclub
but a major cocaine abuser was also among them , rubbing shoulders not just with hedge fund managers and oil tycoons , but also with major party figures â including chief whip michael gove , foreign secretary philip hammond and the education secretary nicky morgan
