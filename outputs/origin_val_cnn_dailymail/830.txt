saucy : the athena poster that led to the apology it 's the cheeky poster that adorned the bedroom walls of countless teenage boys in the 1970s and 1980s
whether athena 's tennis girl is a suitable adornment for the genteel surrounds of the wimbledon lawn tennis museum is another matter entirely
following a volley of criticism and cries of sexism on social media , the all england club was forced to apologise for using the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition
earlier yesterday they had tweeted a photograph of the dress worn by the blonde model and her racket , alongside the famous image , to promote its powerful posters exhibition , due to open tomorrow
that such a saucy shot should appear to have won the approval of the historic and respectable club immediately raised eyebrows on twitter
tennis fan kishore sharma was outraged , writing : ' ca n't believe wimbledon used this pic for upcoming ' powerful poster exhibition '
' roger federer fans who call themselves ' fed 's angels ' on twitter , posted : ' come on wimble ! i thought you were the classy slam ! ' the offending image was swiftly deleted from the official twitter account and a new post went up which said : ' we apologise for offence caused by the athena tennis girl poster
it is a controversial piece of poster history but we do not endorse it
' the all england club used the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition however , a twitter user responded with the comment : ' the poster does n't show the history of tennis , the girl is n't a tennis player , you are just publicising sexualisation of females
' and campaign group the everyday sexism project asked : ' wimbledon having deleted your tweet , can you confirm if the poster you tweeted will be included in your exhibition ? ' last night an all england club spokesman said the poster would remain in the exhibition despite the apology
he added : ' we 're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis
' the image in question is from a 1970s poster that was extremely popular , selling over 2million copies worldwide and it is part of an historic exhibition about tennis posters dating back to 1893
' not to include it in the exhibition would perhaps be an oversight since it is the most famous tennis poster of all time and should be regarded in this context only
' use of the saucy shot on the official twitter page immediately raised eyebrows on twitter last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster , one of the world 's best - selling , really is that controversial after all
one twitter user said : ' come on wimble ! i thought you were the classy slam ! ' sadie hochfield tweeted : ' wimbledon are getting stick for sharing iconic poster
political correctness gone mad / do n't pretend you 've never seen it before ! ' sara smith-jones posted : ' wimbledon [ has ] nothing to apologise for â i think it 's a great poster , is of its time in history
' mark staniforth said : ' wimbledon has just tweeted an apology for any ' offence ' caused by a link to the 40 - year - old athena girl poster
the world 's gone mad
' others merely saw the funny side
' i think wimbledon were right to delete the athena poster tweet , ' one twitter user wrote
' no one should have to see that appalling 1970s court surface again
' the year - long exhibition will range from the earliest poster in the museum 's collection , an 1893 advertisement for the championships , through to the original artwork for this year 's grand slam at the world famous venue in london sw19 .
