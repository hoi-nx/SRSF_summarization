perryman allegedly stalked a female colleague after she spurned his advances , a court heard a senior manager at an nhs hospital bombarded a female colleague with letters calling her a tart after she spurned his advances , a court heard today
the ' dark and spiteful ' notes allegedly composed by head of complaints and legal services perryman , 52 , accused o'neill of cheating on her partner , dressing ' like a hooker ' and ' sleeping her way to the top '
they also claimed the complaints manager had noisy sexual relations ' on hospital time ' and warned ominously : ' you will reap what you sow
' a total of eight letters were sent to miss o'neill , her mother and other managers at queen elizabeth hospital in king 's lynn , norfolk
the letters began in december 2012 and were addressed to ms oâneill , her partner , her line manager , her mother and the human resources manager at the hospital
they were supposedly from an anonymous christian woman who worked at the hospital and wanted to put a stop to the ' deplorable conduct ' of miss o'neill and deputy director of ict brown
but a jury was told they were all written by perryman after miss o'neill rejected his attention and began a relationship with mr brown
prosecutor jude durr said : ' these letters had dark and spiteful undertones
all concerned rank , status , sex , lying , cheating , flirting , dressing inappropriately and reaping what you sow
' by the time she made a statement â¦ these letters had already had a significant effect on her life
' she felt genuinely frightened that she was being watched every time she attended a meeting or saw a colleague in the corridor
it was also affecting her home life
' she did n't at that stage have any idea who could be so vindictive and hateful
the invasion of her personal , professional and private life caused a real devastating fear of escalation
' miss o'neill was initially turned down for a job after an interview at the hospital , king 's lynn crown court was told
but perryman is said to have called her afterwards to say he was ' so impressed with her as a candidate that he would do his damnedest to get her a job '
a couple of months later she began working in his department and he promised to ' take her under his wing '
he described her as his ' prodigy ' and she soon began covering his job when he was on leave
the two shared friendly ' banter ' but the relationship soured when he allegedly purchased a necklace for her from jewellers ernest jones and she refused the gift
he then sent a friend request on facebook under the name earnest jones , which she declined
perryman was head of complaints and legal services at queen elizabeth hospital ( pictured ) in king 's lynn , norfolk , when he allegedly bombarded colleague o'neill with letters at the time , her relationship with partner twite , 39 , was breaking down and she had begun a friendship with line manager mr brown
the first anonymous letter arrived at the hospital in december 2012 and said mr brown had been ' bragging ' about having sex with miss o'neill and another female member of staff
it claimed : ' both of these women are allowed to dress like hookers in short skirts and dresses â¦ they are dressing like tarts
this is a hospital , not a knocking shop
' two letters were sent to mr twite 's home the following month in which the author claimed to have heard miss o'neill and mr brown having sex ' with my own ears '
one said : ' she has had many promotions she does not deserve even though she has been described as next to useless by senior clinicians â¦ one manager even said she is sleeping her way to the top
' a few days later miss o'neill received a letter which accused her of ' plotting and scheming ' for her own advantage
it warned : ' you will reap what you sow â¦ we will listen to your corridor conversations , when you 're in the bathroom , so we can get firm evidence for your partner with what you 've done
' another letter she received had biblical references and described her as ' jo jo judas ' , while one to her mother , titmarsh , claimed she had told people her father had sexually abused her
miss o'neill , who is now married to mr brown , told the jury perryman , who was her line manager , said he would ' destroy ' her if she told anyone about his bullying
she said : ' he made me feel like he got me the job , i had to be loyal and i owed him
' he said there were women who did n't like the way i looked , his wife would n't like me because i was just his type , petite and blonde
king 's lynn crown court ( pictured ) heard miss o'neill was initially turned down for a job after an interview at the hospital ' he said if i went against him he would destroy me , destroy my credibility and my career
it 's worked because i 've moved hundreds of miles away
' he said he had something on everyone and if i spoke out no one would believe me
' she added : ' i was frightened because someone had written to my home address and said horrible things
' it was upsetting as i was going through a break - up and felt like someone had intruded and was saying lies about me , which upset us both
' what was going on between my partner and me was private
' the court heard police traced the letters to perryman and found drafts on his computer
after his arrest he allegedly approached mrs titmarsh and threatened ' you do n't know what 's coming to you ' while making a ' thumb across the throat ' gesture
he denies one count of stalking and another of intimidating a witness
