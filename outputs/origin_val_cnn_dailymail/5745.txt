giles is concerned england could end their dismal world cup campaign with an embarrassing defeat at the hands of afghanistan unless they give the game their full attention
giles was england 's limited - overs coach when they were knocked out of last year 's world twenty20 in the group stage , ending their campaign with a shambolic loss to associate outfit holland
the side that day were careless and distracted in defeat having already been ousted and giles believes a similar story could unfold if england are not focused
giles believes england could fall to an embarrassing defeat against afghanistan england head coach peter moores is under extreme pressure after his side 's early world cup exit ' unfortunately we 've got a bit of a habit in these games of being a bit dozy and lazy , ' said giles
' we have to win and we have to be ruthless to do that
' we wanted to finish well in the world t20 against holland but we played dozy cricket
' it 's a real banana skin
' most pundits still make england favourites to see off afghanistan , but giles has warned the unfamiliarity of their attack could pose problems for a struggling top order
' afghanistan have some good bowlers , with a bit of pace , and they play the game a little differently , ' added the lancashire coach
' while our players have come up against the big nations a lot - which means they know how it comes out of the hand , the actions , the run - ups - some of these guys are pretty new
' you can watch videos but it 's not quite the same so you can get surprised
