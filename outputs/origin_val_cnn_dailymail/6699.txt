hodgson is confident in harry kane 's ability to shine for three lions , it is just a case of whether there is space for him in the upcoming squad
this has been quite the season for the 21 - year - old , whose 24 goals in all competitions is far and away the best tally from any english striker this term
that form has impressed three lions boss hodgson , who has strongly hinted recently that harry kane will earn a first senior call - up in two weeks ' time
three lions manager hodgson is open to the possibility of calling up tottenham striker harry kane the tottenham front man has is a regular in the three lions under 21 set up and has been in great form for his club harry kane was far from his best in the capital one cup final but hodgson said he thinks the striker is ' ready ' it is not just the tottenham man vying for a striking berth , though , with a number of other in - form , uncapped players hoping to be involved against lithuania and italy
saido berahino , danny ings and charlie austin have all impressed for their clubs this season - but it is harry kane who is the main talking point
' he 's in my thoughts of course , he deserves to be , ' hodgson said , speaking at the london football awards , which raises funds for national charity , willow
' he 's scoring goals for one of our top teams in the premier league but i know him anyway , he 's done a lot of good work for the under - 21s
burnley striker danny ings ( right ) is among the names for a call up to the three lions first team qpr 's charlie austin ( left ) and west brom 's saido berahino ( right ) have both been in fine scoring form ' what pleases me most is young players are getting their chance to play
in the past 19 , 20 , 21 - year - olds would be loaned out or would have to sit back and wait for their chance
now more and more of them are taking the chance when they get it
' i 'm delighted for him and we 'll see when i select my squad at the end of month if he 's in it
' asked whether harry kane was ready to make the step up to the senior side , hodgson said : ' he 's ready
if he was n't ready he would n't be playing for tottenham and scoring lots of goals
' the question you ask is has the player got the quality and talent we 're looking for and is there a space for him ? ' if he comes in then someone 's going to drop out and most forwards we 've got have done quite well in the autumn
' but i ca n't include everyone unfortunately
it 's not always a question of are they good enough , it 's a question of is there space at this time
' however harry kane is the one gaining all the attention having scored 24 goals in all competitions this season wayne rooney , daniel sturridge and danny welbeck look set to be involved in the squad , while rickie lambert and jermain defoe are other experienced forward options when the national team reconvene after a four - month break
' i am looking forward to it , we all are , ' hodgson said
' certainly i and my coaching staff are
i hope the players are looking forward to it , too
' it will be nice to see them again
we did plan a little meeting in january but we found another way of staying in touch with them
' it will be nice to see them physically again and i hope to see them in as good a shape as i thought they were last autumn
