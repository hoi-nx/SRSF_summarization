we 'd always wanted to get married but we just never got round to planning it

we knew from that moment we needed to act fast
' our wedding day was the best day of our lives , it was perfect in every way - i just wish i could have my wife for longer than just a few short weeks
' it was mine and natalie price âs dream to get married and thanks to our family , friends lisa dorgan and laurence walsh , and local businesses , we were able to fulfil that wish before it was too late
' it breaks my heart to think about the future without her but i need to stay strong for our boys
' seeing natalie price come down the aisle in her dress allowed me to forget all the heartbreak for just a minute
fibrosing alveolitis is a relatively rare lung condition which causes scarring and thickening of the alveoli - tiny air sacs - leading to shortness of breath
developing over a number of months or years , the condition is difficult to treat and is usually long term
in some cases , fibrosing alveolitis is the result of an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the body âs own healthy tissues
however , about half of all cases are idiopathic , which means no cause can be identified
' it was the most magical day and we will never forget it
' natalie price âs wedding day was provided free of charge by micheala evans , manager at the southcrest manor hotel , redditch , who arranged for the registrar and 100 guests to attend the ceremony
' i ca nât believe how amazing our local community has been , they âve made mine and natalie price âs dream come true and it âs a day we âll never forget , ' added fiance andy
' she looked beautiful on our wedding day and our boys bradley and callum really enjoyed themselves too
' before the wedding we sat down with the boys and the primrose hospice to tell them that their mummy is going to die

' family friend , lisa dorgan , decided to help raise funds to pay for specialised treatment for natalie price in america by taking part in the 10km birmingham morrisons run in may and so far has pledges amounting to Â£ 5,000 via her gofundme page
' i 've known natalie price for years as our mums were best friends , ' she said
' i decided to raise funds for her to go to chicago for a life - saving transplant but natalie price âs health deteriorated so rapidly and after being given just weeks to live , that was no longer an option

' ' natalie price has been through so much in her short life , ' said fiance andy
natalie price is pictured here on the left with her sister vanessa two years ago , before her lung condition worsened ' her mother , tracy , died of lung cancer at just 39 , when natalie price was pregnant with our eldest son , callum , so she never got to meet him
' then in 2006 , bradley was born and at four months old he was rushed to hospital with a collapsed lung
bradley spent seven months in hospital and was later diagnosed with the same disease as natalie price
' we now have the worry that he too will end up like his mum , although he is a normal healthy boy at the moment
' the wedding helped us to forget all the heartbreak for just a minute
' there are many people to thank and we will get round to doing just that
