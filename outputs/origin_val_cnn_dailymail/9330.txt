jon walters is the kind of footballer who holds up an imaginary substitutes â board when a referee goes down injured , who picks up a matchday programme hurled in his direction and has a flick through
during stoke âs victory at aston villa last month , his reaction to referee roger east âs attack of cramp was more comic than concerned
it was similar when an irate newcastle fan chucked the makeshift missile as celebrations followed peter crouch âs equaliser
â a referee with cramp ! can you believe it ? â chuckles jon walters
â he needed to come off , did nât he ? the programme was a good read
you âve got to enjoy yourself
when need be , i âll get stuck in but i play with a smile
jon walters spoke about many subjects , including his desire to play in euro 2016 , in a revealing interview the stoke star takes his football seriously but also has a a fun side as his on - field antics show the 31 - year - old striker / winger claims he has mellowed since being involved in a ruck with roy keane â it âs the best job in the world , if you do nât enjoy it there âs something wrong
â that encapsulates jon walters , one of the premier league âs unlikely lads ; tough yet funny , revelling in his fifth year as a premier league player
he is delivering one - liners on the radio that amuse and slightly frighten , suggesting in the wake of the jonny evans - papisse cisse flare - up that any player who spat in his face will be â eating his supper through a straw â
he is laughing about his appearance in roy keane âs book during their final fraught days together at ipswich â â a bust - up â¦ effing and blinding â â having buried the hatchet at ireland camps
â i knew what was going to be written â¦ it could have been worse , ' he says
and he is pleased by having had such a good season after an inauspicious start
jon walters became the first stoke player to score a premier league hat - trick with his right - foot , left - foot , header combination against queens park rangers in january and was shortlisted for ireland âs player of the year award
all this after losing his place at stoke side last summer
his appearance in ireland âs dramatic 1 - 1 draw in germany in october meant he had completed more minutes for country than club : 180 to 139
â we were losing games and i was nât getting on , that made me worry more than anything , â admits jon walters , 31
â i was going away with ireland asking a few of the lads how many games they âd played
championship lads were saying , â 15 , 20 ... â
jesus ! â oâneill and roy keane showed a lot of faith to play me
then i came on ( for stoke ) against swansea city when we were chasing the game and i scored
since then i âve stayed in the team
â walters flicks through a matchday programme thrown at him after peter crouch scored against newcastle the potters joker found the funny side when referee roger east was forced to withdraw with cramp jon walters carries the match ball after becoming the first stoke player to score a premier league hat - trick listening to soothing sounds has helped
â before kick - off , i âll have my earphones on and be tuning into some classical music , â jon walters says
he lists pachelbel âs canon in d major and material by pianist ludovico einaudi as favourites
he should be listening to some strings before playing against poland in a game ireland need to win to further their euro 2016 ambitions
his participation was in doubt after he suffered a fractured cheekbone a fortnight ago but surgery and a protective mask make him available
â it âs a massive game , â he says
â it âs a difficult group but it âs in our hands
there will be ups and downs
germany was a high , scoring in the last minute
the scotland defeat was a low
qualifying is the main thing , it does nât matter how
â jon walters âs career has been in the ascendancy since he left then league two side chester in 2007
he is stoke âs top scorer in a season that could still lead to a record - breaking points total and premier league finish
impressive when you consider the reshaping done by manager mark hughes since succeeding pulis when jon walters âs profile seemed not to quite fit
whether operating up front or , more frequently , on the wing jon walters has crafted his game to suit the passing style now employed under mark hughes
â in terms of evolving i âve done that my whole career , from youth at blackburn , then bolton , going down the leagues and coming back up , â says jon walters
â you have to change your game constantly
â there are going to be technically better players
you see some very gifted players down the leagues who just have nât had the luck
â i âll always work hard but i âm not just here on hard work
you have to have a certain amount of ability
i was taught as a striker , all my runs , my movement , getting in the box
i âve only really taught myself to play as a winger

â you get the clean sheet bonus , do nât you ? â he quips
that flexibility has certainly aided jon walters , who was bought by pulis for Â£ 2.75million in 2010
he believes stoke are like that , too , able to alter their game to suit situations in a way that everton , his boyhood team , find tricky
â mark hughes came in with different ideas and from day one everyone bought into it , â he says
â we play a slightly different way but still retaining that steely grit
â certain teams we play against , sometimes we have to go a bit more direct
having all those strings to your bow is massive in this league , teams can figure you out
we can change during a game , me included
â jon walters âs view on the game has been coloured by the health issues suffered by his eldest daughter scarlett , who was born with gastroschisis , a condition in which the intestines protrude outside the abdomen
in 2005 he switched from championship side hull to league two wrexham so as to be closer to his family on the wirral when scarlett needed surgery
â i asked to leave to go back home with her as she was so ill , â he said
â i was living in a hospital for three months
â scarlett , 10 , is better now , with a sister and brother aged six and four
jon walters has picked himself up too , joining ipswich in 2007 before stoke came calling
that move was the reason for his fallout with roy keane , who details in his autobiography how jon walters did not believe him that no enquiry had been made
â there was a bit of shoving , â writes roy keane
â i got carried away and jon walters got carried away
â walters ' goal against swansea city in october saw him cement a regular starting place in mark hughes ' team jon walters has adjusted his game to make an impression both domestically and internationally this season jon walters had felt compelled to send in a photograph of his vomit to prove he was sick enough to miss an earlier league cup game
here , sitting in an armchair at stoke âs training ground , he smiles knowingly
the pair shook hands after roy keane became oâneill âs assistant
â when he first came to ireland we spoke about it and had a laugh
i get on really well with roy keane
i know he can be hard but he âs pretty spot on in what he says
â jon walters tends not to mince words either , choosing that rather graphic turn of phrase to air his views on spitting
he knows though , with team - mate stephen ireland âs horrific leg wound in mind , more serious things happen on a pitch
â it âs an insult to spit , â he says
â anything that threatens a career , breaks bones , or seriously injures someone has to be worse
â feigning injury does infuriate him
â to see people rolling round when they get touched is poor
what annoys me is to think about if two people are going head to head in the street , would one fall over like they âve been shot ? â jon walters has made up with former ipswich manager roy keane after the pair 's infamous bust up the potters forward nets against tottenham in november , he has 10 premier league goals this term jon walters is made from stern stuff and hates it when players feign injury on the football pitch one creeping concern is his contract , which expires in the summer of 2016
â it âs always at the back of your mind
we have nât had any talks yet
they âre always looking for someone to replace you
it âs been no different since i âve been here
â the strikers we âve had in : eidur gudjohnsen , michael owen , john carew , kenwyne jones , cameron jerome , crouchy is here , mame biram diouf
if the club want to keep me , they will come to me
â jon walters is recently over a mystery knee injury that had troubled him for more than a year and believes he can play until he âs 38
â fitness-wise i tend to do more running , more high - intensity sprints , more recoveries than anyone
we have heart - rate monitors every day
you have to look after yourself off the pitch through diet
i have six , seven years , without a shadow of a doubt
