they share the bond of a grandfather and granddaughter , but in the 18 years they have known each other , have never actually met
when she was 11 - years - old , new york girl nicole - who asked that her surname not be published - was given a school assignment to write to a pen pal , with an ad placed in different newspapers calling for people in other states interested in corresponding with the students
norman , a writer from bastrop , texas , came across the ad and responded , subsequently beginning an exchange that would - and continues to - last a lifetime
that was 1996 , and norman - then 61 - and his wife , bobbie , started to eagerly await letters from their young pen pal , nicole , kvue tv reported
finally : nicole and norman have been writing to each other for the last 18 years , but have only just met each other in the flesh in batrop , texas first meal : the two decided to meet for dinner and share their first meal together
both were in tears both would send photos in their letters and celebrate birthdays and holidays with each other from afar
one year norman playfully told nicole he wanted either a cadillac or rolls royce for his birthday
nicole then sent a toy car of each make
the couple witnessed nicole grow up through her letters , and norman has kept all of them , even a poem nicole wrote for him when she was young
however , much to his dismay , norman , now almost 80 , was forced to stop writing back to nicole recently , as his parkinson 's disease worsens and his hands are too shaky to put pen to paper
unwilling to be cut off from her surrogate grandparents , nicole traveled the 1,600 miles from new york to bastrop , to finally meet them
a reunion of sorts : norman and his wife bobbie ( together ) finally got to meet nicole ( center left ) and her family , after nicole traveled from new york to meet with the couple norman sat anxiously in the restaurant where they planned to meet
' i 'm so excited
i 'm nervous , ' he told kvue tv
then nicole , now a 29 - year - old woman , finally arrived
she ran in with tears streaming down her face and her arms outstretched
' we made it , ' she said
' how are you ? can you believe it ? ' norman was crying just as much
' i 've never had anybody go to this much trouble to see me before , ' he said
celebration : together with their families , nicole and norman ( back left ) have now finally met once the tears stopped , the two shared their first proper conversation and meal
they have now agreed to speak over text , with bobbie helping her husband type and read the messages
nicole acknowledged that , with technology the way it is now , other children wo n't get to have an experience like she did
' the connections you make are way more important than anything you 're going to learn in a book , ' she said .
