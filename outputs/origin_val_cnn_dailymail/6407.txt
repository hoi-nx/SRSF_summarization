pietersen has paved the way for a summer of potential embarrassment for the ecb after agreeing to rejoin surrey in an improbable bid to regain his test place
pietersen will be available for the county across all three formats but will focus on the four - day lv = county championship as he attempts to force his way back into the england team following his sacking a year ago
confirmation of his surrey return is expected on thursday
another remarkable news cycle for the english game began with pietersen telling test match special listeners he would do â anything â to play international cricket again
pietersen will return to surrey in the summer to play in the lv = county championship 29 - pietersen âs average in the 5 - 0 ashes drubbing in 2013 - 14 , the last series he played
that is well below his test average of 47
20 - months since he last played a first - class match for surrey 19 - months since his last century in any form of the game , 113 against australia at old trafford 39 - his highest score in the t20 blast for surrey last season
in 12 innings , he averaged 22 that comment prompted english cricket âs beleaguered powerbrokers to close ranks once more
going into a summer in which england desperately need to reconnect with their fans and regain the ashes , the ecb fear pietersen will act as a non-stop , hard - to - silence distraction
test captain cook , in abu dhabi for the season âs curtain - raiser on sunday between mcc and yorkshire , was quick out of the blocks
â there âs been a hell of a lot of stuff happened with his book , â he said , â so he is unlikely to come back into the team
â england selector whitaker , who would have preferred to focus on wednesday âs announcement of the test squad for the caribbean , told sky sports : â we have nât had discussions at all about pietersen
this last 12 months we âve been successfully rebuilding the test team and he âs not part of our plans
â we âve produced some good middle - order players with gary ballance , joe root and ian bell continuing to perform well , so we are happy with where we are in the middle order
â pietersen has hinted he could change his ipl contract in a bid to push for an england place both whitaker and ecb managing director paul downton â the man behind last year âs controversial sacking â have repeatedly insisted pietersen will never play for england again , a fate that appeared to have been sealed by the publication in october of his score - settling autobiography
but pietersen , desperate to add his england - record tally of 13,797 runs and 32 centuries , seized on a stray comment made this month by new ecb chairman graves , who said the â first thing he has to do if he wants to get back is start playing county cricket â
but graves was simply stating the obvious : affiliation to a county is the minimum requirement for anyone with england hopes
but , emboldened by what he regarded as the first stage of a peace offering , pietersen took every opportunity to state his desire to play for england once more
after playing for the big bash league 's melbourne stars , pietersen has signed with the sunrisers hyderabad surrey were initially wary of resuming ties with a cricketer who turns 35 in june but pietersen has often been at his best when he has had a point to prove
and the prospect of a hatful of division two runs as surrey push for promotion prompted director of cricket alec stewart to bring him into a middle order alongside sri lankan veteran kumar sangakkara
county bowlers may not agree , but the move is a smart one
as long as whitaker , downton , coach peter moores and cook remain in situ , it is inconceivable that pietersen can resume his international career
but assuming he manages to extricate himself from his Â£ 200,000 ipl deal with sunrisers hyderabad , as well as a contract with st lucia zouks in the caribbean premier league , that means he could be available for most , if not all , of the county season
the nightmare scenario for the ecb officials who have stated their position so unequivocally is a glut of runs for the man they continue to consider persona non grata
kumar sangakkara appeared to confirm pietersen 's return to surrey this season after sri lanka bowed out of the world cup with a convincing defeat by south africa the call from his many fans on social media for pietersen âs return would grow â especially if england fail to put a disastrous world cup behind them as they embark on an absurd programme of 17 tests in 10 months
on wednesday pietersen told test match special : â if i can do anything that can help me get back into it for england then it âs something i want to do
i love playing for england
â his best hope is the sacking of all the men who object to him â and for that to happen england would need to perform terribly in the ashes
in other words , the only plausible scenario that can rescue pietersen is one he can not be seen to hope for
not for the first time , english cricket and pietersen find themselves engaged in a tense catch-22
pietersen has not played for england since the ashes tour of 2013 - 14 after which he was dropped
