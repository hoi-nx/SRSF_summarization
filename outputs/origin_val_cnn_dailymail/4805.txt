gary neville and jamie carragher pulled no punches in their scathing assessment of manchester city 's performance during the 2 - 1 defeat by liverpool at anfield
gary neville felt sunday 's showing was far from what is to be expected of title challengers and indeed of last season 's champions
meanwhile jamie carragher , who also writes a column for sportsmail , has questioned the suitability of city manager manuel pellegrini 's tactics
sky sports pundit and sportsmail columnist jamie carragher laid into manchester city 's poor performance liverpool midfielder jordan henderson ( left ) pressures manchester city 's james milner for the ball liverpool playmaker philippe coutinho ( right ) had an outstanding game against manchester city ' if i was a manchester city player , i 'd be embarrassed how easy it is to play through them , ' gary neville said during live commentary on sky sports
' we 're judging manchester city as champions of the premier league
there has to be progression year on year , you have to get better
but this team , we keep seeing the same mistakes being made ' prior to the liverpool game , questions had been raised over manuel pellegrini 's decision to play with two strikers and leave his midfield exposed
with flair players david silva and samir nasri also not fulfilling their defensive duties , the chilean 's bold selections appeared to have signalled some oversight
and in the post-match analysis , jamie carragher offered his opinion : ' to employ that system ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) in the big games is so naive
it 's embarrassing really for a manager at that level to go into a game against barcelona two years running and then again at anfield like this
' something is not right about manchester city and there has to be changes at the end of the season
' city sit second in the premier league table but they are five points off the pace of leaders chelsea having played a game more
