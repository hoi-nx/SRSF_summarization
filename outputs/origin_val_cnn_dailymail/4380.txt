shortly before the incident , ms nina carberry was covering the ground very well and just jumped clear into second place when the french horse slewed hard to the left , crashing into the irish challenger
mr mccann was standing about 30 feet from the fence beside the rail when quantativeeasing was forced through the plastic barrier
mr mccann tried to dive out of the way , but he was struck by the rail , which is designed to give way if a horse loses control
the eventual winner of the race was just three lengths behind when the incident happened and jockey davy russell used the space which suddenly became available to power home to victory
nina carberry , in green and yellow , was pushed off the course by the following horse mccann had no time to get out of the way as the horses came towards him at full speed mr mccann attempted to jump clear of the scene as he noticed the horses rapidly approaching cheltenham spokeswoman sophia brudenell told the racing post : ' mccann was standing at the second - last fence
he 's a regular racing photographer who understands the rules and at the moment , as it reads , we 're not concerned with where he was standing
he was under the running rail and seemed to be moving away as the horses approached
' having looked at the images , the horse did n't go over him , he brushed past him rather than trampled over him
the horses just moved to their left as they were jumping , mccann was in that position off the rail , where we 'd expect him to be
they did violently move to the left and mccann felt the consequence
' stewards at the course reviewed the accident and noted that any currency , which finished second had ' jinked left ' approaching the penultimate fence
this forced toutancarmont to jump left into ms nina carberry 's horse
the stewards said the incident did not involve a riding offence
however , miss nina carberry is facing a one day ban after she was accused of allowing her horse to canter into the start of the race
jockey davy russell , in maroon with a white star , takes advantage of the crash to win the race mr mccann , right , is believed to have suffered a broken leg and was taken away to hospital by ambulance
