as long as 7,000 years ago , the chinchorro people who lived along the desert coast of what is now chile and peru were mummifying the bodies of those who died
but , after millennia in which the mummies have remained well preserved , those ancient remains are now in danger of rapid decomposition , harvard scientists have warned
the culprit ? according to the harvard school of engineering and applied sciences , in a news report published monday , rising humidity that helps microbes flourish on the mummies ' skin is to blame
as a result , scientists at the university of tarapaca 's archeological museum in arica , northern chile , have already seen some of its 120 prized examples of chinchorro mummies start turning into a " black ooze , " it said

" you have these bodies out there and you 're asking the question : how do i stop them from decomposing ? it 's almost a forensic problem , " he is quoted as saying
a " complicated process " was used to prepare the mummies , said marcela sepulveda , professor of archaeology at the university of tarapaca , cited in the news release
it involved removing the brain and organs , replacing them with natural fiber and ash , stitching the body back up with reeds and covering the skin with a paste of manganese , ocher or brown mud , depending on the period
the chinchorro people mummified human remains for more than 3,000 years
