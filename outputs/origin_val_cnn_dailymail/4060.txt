the future of the humble bar of soap may in be hot water as more people are choosing to use liquid hand wash and hand sanitiser

the proportion of people buying liquid hand soap at least once a month has risen from 56 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2014 experts believe the nation 's changing hygiene habits could be down to the public fear over international health scares such as last year 's ebola outbreak

research by mintel found that 87 per cent of people are more likely to purchase liquid soap than bar soap , 71 per cent
more than half of us also use hand sanitiser gel , with a third buying it once a month or more
professor isabelle szmigin , a consumer behaviour expert at the university of birmingham , said the shift to liquid soap was ' purely an improvement ' ' the large majority of young brits purchasing hand sanitiser shows that , despite preconceptions , this group have a particularly cautious attitude towards spreading germs , ' added ms libby

' experts believe the nation 's changing hygiene habits could be down to the public fear over health scares such as last year 's ebola outbreak young men , aged 16 - 24 , were the most likely to still choose a bath over a shower with a quarter claiming that the bath is their cleaning method of choice , compared to the national average of 19 per cent
one in five men young men said they are taking more baths compared to three years ago with a quarter of describing the bathroom as their ' sanctuary
' prof mitchell said the increasing use of baths by young men reflects the rise of male grooming and the metrosexual phenomenon
