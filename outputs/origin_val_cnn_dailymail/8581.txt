airport officials have revealed that throwing knives , samurai swords and even a grenade launcher were among the 300 illegal weapons seized at perth airport , in only the last two months
the deadly haul , brought into the country by passengers arriving in australia , included flick knives , knuckle dusters and a crossbow
the grenade launcher , believed to be from russia , was one of the more alarming finds
heavily armed : knuckle dusters , nunchuks and a grenade launcher were among the weapons seized from january 1 to march 4 figures released by the australian customs and border protection service that over 30 real and imitation firearms were seized from airline passengers
passengers could face a $ 425,000 fine or 10 years in prison for importing dangerous goods without permission
authorities say that people must be starting to understand these kinds of weapons wo n't be let into the country after they saw a drastic decrease in the number of weapons seized from 2013 to 2014
last year 1,318 illegal weapons were discovered , a significant drop from the 3,075 seized in 2013
assistant minister for imm â­ igration and border protection , michaelia cash , told perth now that it 's overseas vendors that are to blame for selling the weapons to australia under the guise they will make it across the border
authorities say australia are being deceived by international vendors who lead them to believe the weapons will make it home ' people may think that items such as laser pointers , flick knives , and shock devices make for an impressive souvenir but they could end up costing you more than you bargained for , ' senator cash said
she recommends that travellers make sure they understand the restrictions placed on what comes through customs so they do n't end up throwing their hard earned cash away
' every year , travellers are losing their hard - earned money by bringing items and gifts back into australia that they ca n't keep
' if you bring these things back they 'll be seized
you 'll lose the item , waste your money and may face a Â­ penalty
' airports are n't the only target with reports claiming firearms are being trafficked through the mail in an annual report , by the australian customs and border protection service , it was found that the number of undeclared handguns detected by customs had skyrocketed by 60 per cent
the report advised people are using the mail to conceal and deliver handguns in illicit firearm trafficking networks
authorities maintain that identifying and dismantling these networks is a ' high priority '
' we have strengthened our targeting regimen and enhanced opportunities to increase detection of illicit firearms , ' the report said .
