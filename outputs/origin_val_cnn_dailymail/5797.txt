the proposed Â£ 16million fee that fiorentina will pay chelsea to sign salah on a permanent deal in the summer of 2016 is beginning to look like daylight robbery
the 22 - year - old condemned juventus to their first home defeat in 48 matches with his sixth goal in seven games after being allowed to leave stamford bridge on loan in february
salah was used as a bargaining tool for juan cuadrado to go in the opposite direction for Â£ 23.3m , rising to Â£ 27m with bonuses , but has been the more devastating of the two for their new clubs
' are you listening , jose ? ' jose mourinho allowed salah to leave chelsea on loan to fiorentina the front pages of italian newspapers were dominated by salah after his two goals against juventus salah 7 games 6 goals juan cuadrado 5 games 0 goals salah did not suit jose mourinho 's style of play and made just two starts in 2014 - 15
he averaged nine minutes per game between august and january , and the arrival of cuadrado saw him further kicked to the curb
jose mourinho and salah agreed it was best he get first - team opportunities elsewhere , and fiorentina 's faith has been rewarded against juventus he sent a message to chelsea by starting a run from his own half in a lethal counter-attack
he outpaced simone padoin before beating goalkeeper marco storari in the top left corner to make it 1 - 0 in the 11th minute
hazard and didier drogba were on the same wavelength when they tweeted salah is ' on fire ' and the egypt , four years younger than cuadrado , has plenty of time to improve
salah opens the scoring with after a superb solo run from his own half against juventus the egypt international salutes the crowd after scoring against serie a champions juventus salah ( right ) spent most of his time at chelsea on the substitutes ' bench under manager jose mourinho basle : 67 appearances , 13 goals
chelsea : 19 appearances , two goals
fiorentina : seven appearances , six goals
egypt : 35 appearances , 20 goals
on his arrival , fiorentina manager vincenzo montella announced salah would have to ' adapt to our football ' and that ' this is a league that 's different from the swiss and the english '
louis van gaal admitted it could take a year for manchester united 's signings to develop , but no such time frame has been required for salah
any suggestion he could not perform against barclays premier league teams was dismissed on march 1 when he punished tottenham hotspur in the europa league with a quick - witted one - two
and three days later he scored the winner against inter milan at the san siro to earn fiorentina 's first win in that fixture since may 2000
all this has helped fiorentina stretch their unbeaten run to 13 games as the man behind hazard , willian , oscar and cuadrado in the pecking order gets put to good use elsewhere
