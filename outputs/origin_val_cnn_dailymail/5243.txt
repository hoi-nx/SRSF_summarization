illegal immigrants are being smuggled out of uk to avoid deportation â before being sneaked back in after gaining immigration status elsewhere in european
using the â asylum loophole â , people smugglers charge Â£ 1,000 per person to arrange trips to european , allowing illegal immigrants to gain legitimate paperwork
it means that if they are caught trying to return to uk , they are not sent back to their birth country but to the european state that gave them their first asylum - seeking status
illegal cargo : the migrants in the romanian lorry which they boarded in kent before it headed for calais via dover the lorry was never searched and was said to have breezed through immigration controls in uk and france the lorry driver was confronted by reporters from bbc 's south east today programme the ruse was exposed by the bbc âs south east today programme which was broadcast last night
reporters contacted a gang of people smugglers â using a fixer called ajmal â who agreed to take him out of the country and bring him back for Â£ 1,000
hidden cameras showed ajmal getting on to a romanian - based lorry in kent before it headed for calais via a dover ferry
the truck was never searched and was said to have â breezed â through immigration controls in uk and france
only hours later , ajmal was released in belgium along with 20 other illegal immigrants from india , pakistan and afghanistan
the report told how many of the illegal immigrants â and some who had outstayed their student visas â were told to make their way to italy to apply for asylum
once there they are fingerprinted and are able to gain immigration status , allowing them to lengthen their stay in european
if they are caught trying to return to uk , they only face being returned to italy or other european countries rather than their countries of origin
many illegal immigrants were told to make their way to italy to apply for asylum john vine , the former chief inspector of borders and immigration , said : â i do nât think people realise the extent of the trade of shipping people out of the uk to other parts of european and elsewhere in the world ' less than two years ago , border officials spoke of their shock of people trying to smuggle themselves out of the uk asked how he would return to uk , ajmal said : â when i want to go to the uk â¦ he say â ring my same number and i will tell you what to do and where you need to come â i will take you back to the uk â
â last night john vine , the former chief inspector of borders and immigration , said : â i do nât think people realise the extent of the trade of shipping people out of the uk to other parts of european and elsewhere in the world
it is an issue the authorities need to look at very seriously
â in 2006 , italy announced it would grant citizenship to immigrants who had stayed in the country for five years
however , it emerged that from january to august last year , 140,000 illegal immigrants had entered european via italy
the eight - month figure was more than the entire total for the previous year
less than two years ago , border officials in the uk told of their â shock â at the â very unusual â case of 28 illegal immigrants trying to smuggle themselves out of uk
the immigrants from bangladesh , pakistan , afghanistan and sri lanka hid on a polish lorry on a p&o ferry bound for france
they were returned to dover to be questioned at the border force immigration centre .
