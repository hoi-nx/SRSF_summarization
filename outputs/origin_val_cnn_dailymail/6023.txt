harry kane may have taken the impact debut to another level with his goal after 79 seconds but he was not the first new cap to make a quick impression in england colours this season
in october , delph left his mark on the swiss in more ways than one , adding much - needed
he was booked less than nine minutes into his first england start as he launched a series of tackles
for a time it was hard to know if his premature end would be via red card or substitution
delph of england speaks to the media during the england press conference ahead of the clash with italy delph left his mark on the swiss in more ways than one , adding much - needed bite to hodgson âs midfield delph cleaned up his disciplinary record to help international career after collecting 20 yellows in two years the villa midfielder soon settled , however , and it turned out to be neither
he produced a terrific display in basle and won his fourth cap against lithuania on friday
he has also cleaned up his disciplinary record to help his international career and , after collecting 20 in two years , has just one yellow and one red in 26 appearances this season for club and country
â you âve got to be more careful , â said delph
â i like to tackle and i âve managed to curb it this season
i got the yellow against switzerland and then the red against sunderland but other than that i âve been pretty clean
i âm usually on about nine or 10 bookings at this stage ! â it âs hard to lunge into tackles in international football
if you lunge in on a top - class international footballer they just skip round you or you bring them down
i tried to set a target
i âve been able to do that so i âm quite proud
â harry kane made a big impact on debut twith his goal after just 79 seconds seconds at wembley stadium both harry kane and delph shone for england as hodgson 's side swept lithuania aside at wembley stadium even so , his natural aggression lifted england in switzerland , where a 2 - 0 win restored some of the confidence lost at the world cup
â i remember lining up a few tackles and getting them wrong , but it did nât faze me , â said delph
â it was one of those things
i tried to impose myself early on and mistimed it
after that it was just about trying to stay on my feet , trying to get through the game , trying to perform well , with good energy , keep the ball moving and i managed to do that
â dennis can testify to this fondness for physical combat having been cut down by a teenage delph during one of the regular games between the leeds staff and youth team
dennis , manager at elland road at the time , liked his style and picked him for the first team before he was 18
lithuania 's tomas mikuckis tracks villa and england midfielder delph during the game at wembley stadium â those games did get quite tasty , â said delph
â i did tackle him and he tackled me back
they tended to get quite heated
he gave me my debut
i âm so grateful to dennis
and gus , his assistant
gus could kick a few people as well
â this breakthrough rewarded years of commitment from delph and his mother donna , who would hop on various buses and trains together to get to academy training sessions
â it âs funny to look back on this little kid jumping off the bus to training , â he said
â at one point , it would take three buses and one train
but it âs worked out well
i âve always been pushed hard to succeed
to get those buses , it was nothing
â as soon as he was able , he bought his mother a house
â she âs my hero , â said delph
â we did nât have a car , so she took me on the bus or on the train and she believed in me
she was just a great mum and a great role model
â delph speaks to the media at an england press conference ahead of the midweek clash with italy determination is a recurring theme for delph , who swapped hometown bradford for leeds at the age of 11 and then joined villa for Â£ 6million in 2009 , only to be hit by serious knee injuries
â i ruptured my anterior cruciate ligament , had bad medial ligament damage and tore my lateral meniscus and ( knee surgeon ) andy williams managed to save that , â said delph
â i got back quite quickly and then broke down four times
i did my medial again on the other knee and then the knees were done and it was my ankles ; the left ankle , the right ankle a few times
it was a rollercoaster ride
it made me realise how much it takes to play at a high level and physically be strong
i worked really hard in the gym
villa midfielder delph has a pop at goal during england 's clash with lithuania at wembley stadium â i was confident of coming out the other end but there were always questions
is he going to get back to his best ? is he going to be the same player ? â as it turned out , he did get back , won his place back in the villa team and took his england opportunity in the absence of steven gerrard and frank lampard
he missed two months with a shoulder injury soon after breaking into hodgson âs team but bounced back again , signing a new deal which ties him to villa park until 2019
at 25 , delph is a regular in the england midfield
he is still making an impression , five months after his explosive full debut , and he has the cards under control .
