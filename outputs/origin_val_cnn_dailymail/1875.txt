greedy rail firms are charging customers up to Â£ 215 per day to park at city centre stations in what has been branded ' daylight robbery ' by union bosses
the ' outrageous ' parking charges amount to a ' stealth tax ' on train travel adding up to 50 per cent of the total cost in some areas , according to the tssa rail union
the worst offenders were birmingham new street , liverpool lime street , manchester piccadilly and leeds , all of which charge Â£ 215 for a 12 - hour stay
liverpool lime street station was named among the most expensive for parking in the country , forcing customers to pay Â£ 215 for a 12 - hour stay union bosses accused train companies of using parking charges , such as the Â£ 215 - per - day fare at birmingham new street , as a way to get around rail fare price caps issued by the government the most expensive annual parking tickets are snow hill at Â£ 3003.30 , reading at Â£ 1805.50 , guildford at Â£ 1,800 and cambridge at Â£ 1,596.30
these parking charges are on top of hefty annual season ticket prices such as from reading to london at Â£ 4,796 , cambridge to london at Â£ 4,648 and from guildford to london at Â£ 3,248
figures released today also show that transport companies and network rail are making Â£ 800million a year from non-railway charges including parking and catering
per 12 - hour stay birmingham new street new street - Â£ 215 liverpool lime street - Â£ 215 manchester piccadilly - Â£ 215 leeds - Â£ 215 per year snow hill - Â£ 3,003 reading - Â£ 1,805 guilford - Â£ 1,800 cambridge - Â£ 1,596 union bosses claimed companies were using the extortionate charges as a way to get around the caps on rail fares which are imposed by the government each year
the report says : ' rip off rail firms have been profiteering at passengers expense by hiking ' back door ' car parking increases to by - pass inflation only curbs on fare rises
' network rail and the private rail firms are charging as much as Â£ 215 for day long stays at city centre rail car parks while also charging as much as Â£ 3,000 for annual parking tickets
' union general secretary cortes said : ' rail passengers are being caught in the cross fire by these greedy rail firms
' they can charge what they like for parking because , unlike key rail fares , there is no government cap , it is a free for all
' he added : ' charging over Â£ 200 for all day parking in station car parks at birmingham new street , manchester piccadilly and leeds is little short of daylight robbery
' and charging over Â£ 3,000 for an annual parking ticket at snow hill in birmingham new street is simply outrageous , that 's as much as many commuters pay for their annual season ticket
' mr cortes said : ' parking charges as high as Â£ 1,800 at commuter hot spots like guildford and reading were effectively putting another 40 per cent to 50 per cent parking tax on top of annual season tickets which are already way too high
' ministers may have limited regulated fare rises this year to 2.2per cent this year but passengers have still got both barrels with big hikes in parking on top of these ceaseless rises in annual fares
a report by union chiefs accused rail companies of ' daylight robbery ' after it was revealed they are making Â£ 800million per year from non-travel services , on top of Â£ 9billion made from ticket charges ' these firms now simply regard stations as profit centres with passengers as captive cash cows
' mr cortes wants the government to include parking in the price control curbs that is used to fix annual scheduled fare increases like season tickets and off peak travel
he said : ' when you consider that the rail firms are making Â£ 800million a year in parking fees from these passengers who already paying out Â£ 9billion in fares , i think commuters deserve some additional protection
they are effectively being squeezed dry at the moment
' network rail own and run the 18 largest stations in the country , including king 's cross , waterloo , birmingham new street , manchester piccadilly , liverpool lime street and leeds
the remaining 2,500 stations are run by private franchises like virgin , stagecoach , first great western , gtr and london midland which operates snow hill
figures from the office of rail regulation show that train operators last year made Â£ 772million from non-railway charges which includes parking and catering - up more than 4 per cent on the previous year
annual car parking fares at some train stations such as guilford , which charges Â£ 1,800 for a pass , come on top of annual travel tickets which cost more than Â£ 3,000 edmund king , president of the aa , said : ' station car parks face a difficult balancing act in not setting parking charges that are lower than those in neighbouring car parks , encouraging non-rail users to take spaces intended for train travellers
unfortunately , this becomes an excuse for much higher parking charges , although longer - stay car parking does demand a higher and more costly level of security
' the root of the problem is the high cost of train travel - high parking charges at stations rub more salt in the wound
if we want to encourage drivers to allow the train to take the strain then it is imperative that railway car park charges are kept down
' rail operators should look at some way of allowing rail customers to recoup the cost of parking from train fares
parking operators are very keen to devise ways to catch drivers who make mistakes in failing to comply with parking rules , they should be equally enthusiastic in finding ways to make life fairer and easier for often stressed train travellers
' rail industry officials denied companies were ' profiteering ' from car park charges , adding that total train operator profits were Â£ 250million in 2012 - 13 , down from Â£ 270million in 1997 - 98
they said many stations do not charge for car parking , and where they do , charges set by train companies are similar to those in town centre car parks
officials across the country millions of pounds are being invested in station car parks to add extra spaces and to make car parks safe and secure for passengers , they pointed out
over the same period , money paid by operators to government to reinvest in more services has increased 400per cent from Â£ 390 million to Â£ 1.96billion , they added .
