pg tips has become the latest big - name brand to quietly shrink its product but not the cost â in a step likely to infuriate uk 's tea lovers
the pyramid teabags are sold on the basis they contain exactly the right amount of tea for a perfect cuppa
but each one now has had its leaves reduced by 0.2g , meaning a box of 80 regular teabags has come down in weight from 250g to 232g
that is the equivalent of six teabags â yet the price of the boxes has stayed the same
the change was made so quietly that it seems even supermarkets were caught by surprise
rip - off : each pg tips teabag has had its leaves reduced by 0.2g , meaning a box of 80 regular teabags has come down in weight from 250g to 232g this week , tesco stores had shelf labels with a price of Â£ 1.99 for a box of 80 pg tips at 250g
but the boxes on the shelf were the new version , weighing 232g
the change was spotted by a former buying director for tesco , safeway and nisa , melvyn searle , who said : ' i have never seen anything like this in my many years in the grocery trade
' they have reduced the weight of tea in the teabag but not the number of teabags in the box
' people are getting less tea and that must reduce its strength
i really feel that customers are being short - changed
' this is one of the biggest tea brands in the country and people will rightly want to know where their tea has gone
' the lighter teabags have resulted in the weight of other pg tips ' boxes coming down , too
a box of 40 is now 116g instead of 125g , the 160 pack is 464g , not 500g , and the 240 carton is 696g , down from 750g
every day , 165million cups of tea are drunk in the uk
ninety - six per cent of these are brewed from teabags
this means even a tiny reduction in weight can equate to millions of pounds of savings for manufacturers
but last night pg tips ' parent company unilever said that the weight change was due to a different mix of leaves â and that the tea still tasted exactly the same
a spokesman explained : ' we 've introduced a new blend and new bags whilst ensuring the same great taste of pg tips
sneaky : the change was made so quietly that it seems even supermarkets were caught by surprise spot the difference : this week , tesco had shelf labels pricing a 250g box of 80 teabags at ï¿½ ï¿½ 1.999 - even though the boxes on the shelves were the new 232g versions ' our new blend includes a proportion of leaves that have been pressed to release a natural tea juice
' this , combined with new paper , complements the blend , ensuring that the brewing time is unaffected and flavour of the blend is as great as it 's always been
' the firm said it had tested its new bags with hundreds of customers who were happy with the flavour
but which ? consumer group claimed the change was another example of ' grocery shrink ray '
this is the increasingly popular trend for big - brand manufacturers to shrink their products without offering corresponding cuts in the prices
the net result is a stealth price rise , because customers get less for their money
other culprits in the last five years have included cadbury dairy milk , which reduced its 140g bar to 120g , walkers crisps ( 34.5g to 32.5g ) , mars bars ( 58g to 51g ) , nestlã© munchies ( 150g to 126g ) and cadbury creme egg multi-packs ( six eggs down to five )
in all cases , the prices remained the same
which ? executive director richard lloyd said : ' shrinking products can be a sneaky way of putting up costs for consumers because pack sizes shrink but the prices do n't
' we want simpler pricing so that people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest
