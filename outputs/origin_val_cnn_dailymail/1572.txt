pictured with a fish in its mouth , this bear was seen thrashing around in an effort to keep the catch under control wildlife photographer , sergey ivanov , 52 , spent days photographing the bears hunting at kuril lake in kronotsy reserve , russia slippery customer : the cub wrestles with the huge fish as a parent stands in the river nearby amusingly , the bear 's sibling was also seen looking on in awe as the cub wrestled its meal into submission
but although the feisty fish was nearly equal in size to the little cub , the youngster managed to win the battle to bag himself a hearty lunch
after finding a secluded spot near the river , the cub then tried to tuck into its supper in peace but it was n't long before its brother wondered over to see the impressive catch for himself
sergey ivanov said : ' i 'd been watching this bear family for some time and i had spent a few days around them
amusingly , the bear 's sibling was also seen looking on in awe as the cub wrestled its meal into submission trying to fin - ish the job : the tiny bear grapples with the fish , which puts up a brave fight as it stands in the shallow water sergey ivanov said ' the lakes and rivers here are full of salmon and that 's why the bears look so well , they do n't even sleep in the winter until late january because they have plenty to eat ' fight on a grand scale : the bear cub just ca n't seem to get a grip on its prey and looks up anxiously for support ' i was not really far from them , probably no more than 50 metres and after a few days they get used to your presence and pay you little attention
' the lakes and rivers here are full of salmon and that 's why the bears look so well , they do n't even sleep in the winter until late january because they have plenty to eat
' but considering the fact that the lake is full of fish , i have never seen such a small bear tackle such a big fish
it was pretty hilarious to watch him trying to cope with a fish as big as this one
' i even remember laughing out loud when i saw this through my viewfinder
' but the bear is a strong animal , even the cubs , and it finally managed to win the fight
' looking at the pictures you can see it was n't just me that thought the fish was too much handle , it looks like his sibling had the same idea
