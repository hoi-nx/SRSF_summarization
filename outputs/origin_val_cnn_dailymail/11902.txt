inspired by military obstacle courses , parkour involves turning everyday pieces of street furniture into objects to be ducked under , swung from , vaulted and climbed
the discipline has in turn inspired freerunning , the urban athletics movement followed by tens thousands of people around the world
' sidewalk skiing ' is another dangerous craze altogether , and was popularised in 2013 by a team of daredevils in neighbouring saudi arabia
sidewalk skiing : the craze of tipping a moving truck onto two wheels was popularised by a group of daredevils in saudi arabia in 2013 ' my inspiration is dubai 's prime minster sheikh mohammed who said that uae does not have a word for impossible ' , the 21 - year - old said backflip : the amateur daredevil said he wanted to push the urban gymnastics craze to its limit in his home city of dubai , uae to tip a truck onto its side a driver usually uses an asymmetrical ramp , then there is the difficult part - balancing it without allowing it to tip over while a daredevil scrambles into position on top
mr abdullah omar alali now wants to push parkour even closer to its limits
' while the stunt is risky , i wanted to show how far people could push their skills with this sport , ' he said
' my inspiration is dubai 's prime minster sheikh mohammed who said that uae does not have a word for impossible - it does not exist in our lexicon '
mr abdullah omar alali also explained that his next goal is to create a parkour training facility where people all over the region can come and discover the sport

' i want to show the world that the uae is a place where you can find talented people
' poise : the truck is not moving in all of his shots , but must be when it tilts on its side - with a driver who is able to keep it balanced do n't try this at home : with long stretches of highway and more than enough desert , the uae is a suitable place to develop the craze mr abdullah omar alali said his next goal is to create a parkour training facility where people all over the region can come and discover the sport
