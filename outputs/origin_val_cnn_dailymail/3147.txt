breast implants in france will come with a health warning after experts discovered a link with a rare form of cancer
france 's national cancer institute said there was a ' clearly established link ' between a specific type of implant and the disease
experts said they have identified 18 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma since 2011 , linked to silicone breast implants
given the rarity of cases , the national cancer institute said there is no need to recommend the removal of the implants
breast implants in france will come with a health warning after 18 women were found to have a rare form of cancer after having an augmentation operation ' this complication presents very infrequently , ' the body said
france 's health minister immediately sought to calm fears haunted by a similar scare in 2011
france firm pip sparked a global health scare in 2011 , when plastic surgeons began reporting an unusual number of ruptures in their products
the pip implants were banned and the company eventually liquidated
' we do not recommend that women carrying these implants have them removed , ' health minister touraine said
anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare type of non-hodgkin lymphoma - a blood cancer
it is a cancer of the lymphatic system , which forms part of the body 's immune system
the rare disease is more common in children and young adults
it develops when abnormal white blood cells divide in an uncontrolled way
the cancerous white blood cells then travel to parts of the body , commonly the lymph nodes , spleen , bone marrow and blood and form a tumour
symptoms of the disease include : the disease makes up around three per cent of all non-hodgkin lymphomas in adults and 10 to 30 per cent in children
it grows quickly and usually needs immediate treatment with chemotherapy
some patients may also need radiotherapy or stem cell transplants
source : macmillan cancer support and lymphoma research foundation she urged women not to get ' carried away by excessive worry ' , about the implants
' our vigilance is absolute , ' she said
ms touraine said no particular brand of implant was in question
however the parisien daily reported that 14 of the 18 cases of the rare cancer were found in women with breast implants made by us pharmaceutical company allergan
allergan said in a statement : ' the security of patients is our first priority
' it added the company is collaborating closely with the health authorities and the drug agency ansm
the company added that all women aged 25 or over should have an annual health check
the head of the national cancer institute , agnes buzyn , said the increased detection rate could also be attributed to better screening
according to francois hebert , deputy head of the ansm drugs agency , around 400,000 women in france have had breast implants
of those 80 per cent had the procedure for cosmetic reasons , while 20 per cent had the operation following breast cancer
almost 50,000 women in the uk and some 400,000 worldwide , were affected by the pip scare came to light
there was uproar when it emerged the france firm poly implant prothese ( pip ) had been manufacturing implants using industrial grade silicone intended for use in mattresses
however a report into pip scandal , published last may , found ' no convincing ' medical data which suggests women with pip implants should have them removed
france firm pip sparked a global health scare in 2011 , when plastic surgeons began reporting an unusual number of ruptures in their products european health officials found no medical or toxicological evidence to justify removal
the european commission 's scientific committee on emerging and newly identified health risks found no reliable evidence that ruptured pip implants posed a health risk
they concluded a ruptured pip implant posed not greater threat than a ruptured implant from another manufacturer
their findings backed a 2012 review by nhs medical director professor sir bruce keogh , which concluded the implants were not toxic or carcinogenic
however jean-claude mas , the founder of the company , was jailed for four years in 2013 for fraad , at a court in france .
