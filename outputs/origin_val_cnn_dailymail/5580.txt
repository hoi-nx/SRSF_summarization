it rather summed up a week when he made headlines for all the wrong reasons that rory mcilroy should find the water twice on the 18th hole at the wgc-cadillac championship at doral on sunday
on american television over the weekend it was impossible to escape footage of him tossing his three iron into the water on friday
before the start of play , trump , preposterous owner of this overrated venue , had presented rory mcilroy with the said club , after it was retrieved by a scuba diver
how typical of trump that he plans to have the club mounted in the hotel , thereby glorifying an action that would have every regular golfer drummed out of their club if they tried it
rory mcilroy hits a shot from the ninth fairway during the final roudn att the wgc-cadillac championship rory mcilroy 's round was shaping up nicely before his unfortunate finish on the 18th hole the world no 1 tries to play his way out of trouble during a disappointing final round at doral rory mcilroy himself is keen to put the incident behind him and did his best with a round that was shaping up nicely until an unfortunate finish
he stood on the 18th tee tied for sixth but put his drive into the water on this brutal hole and then , after adding a penalty shot , his third shot as well
at least he did nât lose his sense of humour
he feigned to throw another club in the drink , but this time held on to it
through the back of the green in five , rory mcilroy was facing a difficult chip down the slope and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple or worse
he chipped it in to the end the tournament with a more characteristic demonstration of his usual swagger
the resultant double bogey meant he signed for a 71
he still finished in the top 10 , though
all those missed putts , shots and water adventures therefore , and still only a handful of players beat him
among the leaders , it was hard not to feel sorry for american jb holmes
he began with a five - stroke lead but got his choke in early
watson plays a shot out of a bunker on the 11th hole at trump national doral blue monster course there was a seven - shot swing in the first seven holes between him and watson , leaving the the masters champion with a two - shot advantage
watson , however , then dropped a couple of shots himself
with eight holes to play there was a three - way tie for the lead involving these two and fellow big hitter dustin johnson
one of the best rounds came from england âs danny willett , who shot 68
the 27 - year - old , early leader of the race to dubai , is getting more comfortable at this rarefied level , and this was a fine confidence boost ahead of his first appearance at the masters next month
the resultant top - 15 finish boosted his world ranking and , as a member of the top 50 , assured him of a first appearance in a regular pga tour event at the arnold palmer invitational in 10 days
he will also play the houston open before augusta
dustin johnson winds up a shot on the 10th hole during a strong final round for the american â i âm obviously very pleased , â he said
â it âs a tough course and the set - up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week , i âd have bitten your hand off if you âd offered me that on thursday
when you âre playing with the top 50 you know they âre not going to give you anything , but i âm feeling more comfortable all the time
â how far can he go ? one area of concern remains a chronic back injury that has caused him to withdraw from plenty of tournaments over the years and one this year already
â i âm taking painkillers and managing it , â he said
â i âm going to stay over here through the masters because flying back and forth is no good for it
there âs no point worrying about it , i âve just got to get on with it
â he is doing that all right .
