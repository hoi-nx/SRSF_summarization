a penn state fraternity has been suspended for sharing offensive pictures
according to police , several members of the kappa delta rho fraternity posted photos to a secret facebook page that showed mostly nude women who were ' sleeping or passed out , ' drug sales and hazing rituals
authorities were able to obtain some of the photos with a search warrant , but by the time they arrived at the fraternity house all of the computers had been wiped clean
the first page , called covert business transactions , was shut down after a female saw the page on a computer at the fraternity when one of the members left his computer on , and realized there was a topless photo of her that had been posted
she threatened the men , though unknown to her the page was moved to a new group , this one called 2.0
a former member who was invited to join gave police his account so they could gather evidence , and from this they were able to get 20 photos posted , that should nude photos and drugs including ' marijuana , edibles , concentrates , attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication and some cocaine
' he said in a statement to authorities ; ' this is the type of stuff that happens at kappa delta rho
' now , the fraternity has been shut down while it is being investigated by law enforcement
' in response to the discovery of the two facebook pages allegedly hosted by kappa delta rho , the chapter was immediately placed on full chapter suspension by penn state âs ifc , ' the ifc said in a statement
' upon completion of all investigation into this matter , kappa delta rho will be summoned by the ifc to undergo a conduct review session
' police are now going through the photos they obtained and trying to identify the victims , though no arrests have been made at this time
