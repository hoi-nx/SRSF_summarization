a medieval castle in tuscan set over more than 1,500 acres has gone on sale in italy making it the largest private home on the market
the stunning estate found slightly east of siena boasts farmhouses , vineyards , woodland and sunflower fields in its grounds
built in the early 12th century it is one of few medieval castles which remain in european and is thought to have been the home of pope pius ii at one time
the property , whose owners wish to keep themselves and the castle 's name unknown , is being sold by sotheby for 28 million euros - almost Â£ 20million
the piccolomini family are thought to have lived there intermittently from the 15th century
two of the family 's most notable members , piccolomini and francesco piccolomini went on to become popes pius ii and iii. little is known of how the noble family cultivated their wealth other than that many of their riches were acquired through trading
having spent decades in the ownership of the family , the castle it changed hands sometime in the 1920s
the new owner remained anonymous , selling on the sprawling estate again in the 1980s
it has since remained in the possession of its current owners who refused to disclose why they were moving on
while estate agents are reluctant to reveal exactly where in the rolling tuscan hills the special property can be found , they promised it to be one of rare value
' it 's very rare in italy to have a medieval castle , there are so many that came before and after , mostly after , but to find a medieval one is rare , ' said jonk , who is handling the sale for sotheby
' all the original fireplaces and ceilings are in tact
it 's a very special opportunity
' while in total the estate has more than 100 bedrooms most are found in farmhouses and smaller properties scattered across its grounds
these are rented out as holiday accommodation while its vineyard and restaurant attracts diners
in the castle itself are 10 bedrooms and as many bathrooms , a drawing room and dining room
elsewhere on its sprawling grounds are sunflower fields and farmland , added mr jonk
the villa just east of sienna is one of few from the early 12th century which remain in italy
all its fireplaces and ceilings have been preserved from their original state aside from the property 's 10 - bedroom main castle there are several farmhouses scattered around its grounds from the same era the piccolomini family are thought to have lived in the castle intermittently from the 15th century and two of the family 's most notable members , piccolomini and francesco piccolomini went on to become popes pius ii and iii the castle is a very rare find in italy because it dates back to medieval times , according to jonk , who is handling the sale for sotheby mysteriously the existence of the castle is not widely known and it has never really been filmed or appeared on television the castle also has its own chapel and vineyard
it belonged to the same family for generations before being sold privately in 1920 ' there 's a lot of woodland , there 's a vineyard
' from some parts of the property there are views of siena too
' although the property is one of the few remaining of its kind in italy it has remained mysteriously off the radar for decades
' that 's the interesting part - there have been television crews that have come from rome over the years and have interviewed people in the restaurant in the castle but it has n't really been used for filming or anything like that , ' mr jonk said
in its restaurant staff serve red wine and food produced on the grounds
with herds of boar and deer roaming its fields too there is no shortage of wildlife to entertain visitors
' when people talk about organic foods , this is what is meant
in italy everything is still quite good that way , it 's very organic
' despite its large price tag , mr jonk added the property had attracted attention from all over the world
' we have had interest from european buyers and non-european buyers
' it 's a special opportunity for someone who can afford it but , as i tell my clients , to find an exclusive property in london nowadays would n't cost much less

' with sprawling grounds , multiple smaller properties and access to your own vineyard , many can see the perks of paying Â£ 20million for their own tuscan castle in italy
but any hopes of snapping up a similar deal closer to home have been dashed by the ever inflating prices of london flats
for roughly the same price as the castle near siena , house - hunters can just about afford a three - bedroom flat in the heart of the capital
while one hyde park apartments afford owners an exclusive postcode and plush surroundings - set between harrods and harvey nichols in london 's knightsbridge - the glass - fronted flats do n't quite offer as much space
in fact the internal floor space of one flat sold last year for more than Â£ 20million was less than 4,000 sq ft. the living room in one of the three - bedroom flat at one hyde park , a luxury apartment complex in knightsbridge
