the number of customers trapped in poor - paying isa has doubled in the last two years savers are being hit with the worst interest rates in history with a third of isa accounts now paying less than 1 per cent a year
the number of customers trapped in poor - paying isa has doubled in the last two years as interest rates on them plummet to new lows
one in six accounts offer less than the bank of england âs base rate at just 0.5 per cent , while some savers are stuck on rates of 0.1 per cent
the proportion of these tax - free accounts returning below 1 per cent has doubled in the last two years , from one in six to one in three
it means that on the current worst isa rate of 0.1 per cent , someone depositing Â£ 15,000 would make a paltry Â£ 15 a year in interest
in contrast , a saver on the most competitive rate of 1.5 per cent would make Â£ 225 â a difference of Â£ 210 a year
with four weeks left to use this year âs Â£ 15,000 isa allowance , many savers will question the value of such accounts
the building societies association said there was not â one single factor â driving down isa rates but said the â persistently low base rate â had contributed to lower returns
a spokesman added : â i do nât think there is a hard correlation between isa rates and mortgage rates
the building societies association said there was not â one single factor â driving down isa rates but said the â persistently low base rate â had contributed to lower returns â each provider has to strike a balance between savings rates and mortgage rates as they need both savers and borrowers
â experts also blame the government âs funding for lending scheme , which allowed banks to borrow cheaply in return for handing out home and business loans after the economic crisis
the scheme meant that banks were no longer dependent on savers â money â reducing the need to offer competitive rates , it is claimed
anna bowes , of independent savings website savings champion , said : â after six years of the base rate at 0.5 per cent , this is toughest time on record for savers , and isa savers have certainly not been immune to the pain
â isas were once seen as the go - to savings product due to their tax - free status
â but with rates at an all - time low , some savers â especially those looking to build up a short - term lump sum for perhaps a house deposit or a car â may need to be more creative
â high - interest savings accounts offer rates of up to 5 per cent before tax , so even a taxpayer could find that this route could earn them more interest
â but rachel springall , of the website moneyfacts , warned : â despite the gloomy outlook on savings rates , consumers need to use their tax - free allowance or lose it
â while there might be an abundance of taxable savings accounts out there , it is always worthwhile to track down an isa equivalent and use the yearly tax - free allowance
â savers have lost out on Â£ 4.7billion in the last three years due to low interest rates .
