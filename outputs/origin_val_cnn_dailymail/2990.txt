sarah stares at the camera , her pupils large and black , and her gaze unfaltering
her soft skin is peppered with freckles and the corners of her mouth are turned , just slightly , at the corners
though she is not quite smiling , she is beautiful in the dim light of the hospital room
she has a terminal illness and has accepted that she will soon die
she is one of 20 people photographed by american photographer andrew george , who spent two years in hospitals taking pictures of people like sarah , who are preparing for the end of their life
â at least i got to see the black president , â reads sarah âs page in mr andrew george âs new book , right before i die
mr andrew george , who lives in los angeles , wanted to explore perspective and what people value in their final moments , saying he admired the â brutal honesty â displayed in his subjects â testimonies
he decided to leave out their former professions , or the disease or condition that was killing them , calling these things â the least relevant facts â
instead , as well as the haunting pictures , he gathered stories from their lives , vignettes of experience and fragments of how they would advise others
here , in an extract from his book , he shares some of the photographs and accompanying words ... sarah , in her hospital bed
she said : â time is so precious
god , it 's precious
life is definitely not infinite
you never know what is going to come up and you really have to take risks
i ca nât really think about what âs fair â fair does nât make any sense
things are not fair or unfair , it âs just the way life is
things happen â or they do nât
you take opportunities â or you do nât â josefina , pictured in hospital , said she has never been afraid to die : â if you âre dead , you âre dead
it does nât come back and i do nât think we reincarnate
i know the bible says otherwise and i do nât want to contradict it , but to me , i do nât believe that
when we die , we die and we go to nothing
dust to dust ... i think the end of the world reaches you when you die â renã© said his biggest regret is not being in touch with his daughter in el salvador
he said : â i did nât give her the right to be part of my life
â he adds that there is â no such thing as happiness in life â
â what we call happiness are contributions ; all we have is what we are and what we have given at that moment
the meaning of life is the search for it â joe wrote just these brief words to accompany his photo
he said : â i feel like i am the luckiest man in the world
i have a wonderful wife , son and daughter , grandchildren and great grandchildren
no one could ask for more than that ' sally said she was taking care of her sick brothers and sisters when she developed cancer
she said being in love is the greatest happiness in life : â being in love is like being in a different world
you can take anything that âs dished out because there âs someone who cares for you
happiness to me is when you feel good and you make somebody else feel good
you do nât even know what you âre doing and you âre making someone happy â kim said people should take the opportunity to tell others how they feel
she said : â i âll be remembered by my mom and kids for how much i care about everybody
and i show it a lot because i think you should
i do nât think you should hold something like that back because we do nât know how long we âre here and if you love somebody you should tell them
they do nât have to love you back but i think that if you love somebody that they should know it because you never know â you do nât know what âs going to happen tomorrow â nelly said although she has suffered hardship , she has no regrets
she said : â with my first husband i chose someone not knowing that he was a bad guy
i had never been with a man before and from day one throughout all six years of that marriage i had been hit ... to the point where i had to go to work with bruises all over my body , raped many , many times and everything else
the day after my second son died , i came home and my husband punched me in the forehead , there was blood all over the place
a week after that , i left with my other son and we went to california
i went on with my life , i went to school and i never asked for child support or anything
i am very happy , actually , and i do nât have regrets even though i âve been through hell
as far as i know , i âve accomplished what i âve had to accomplish in my life â sara said being loved makes people offer love to others
she said : ' i think growing up with love makes people give love back
and you have to five love to receive love , you have to be good without expecting anything in return
you do it because it comes from within you to do it
i âve always fought to improve myself and risen to the occasion
it âs what i was taught growing up and was very ingrained in me
i think that âs what i âll be remembered for when i pass on â the exhibition , right before i die , is being held at the musea brugge , belgium , until 28th june 2015 .
