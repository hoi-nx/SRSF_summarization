manila forty years ago , one of the greatest boxing matches in history took place in an unlikely setting : the capital of the philippines
muhammad ali 's epic win over great rival joe frazier in 1975 became known as the " thrilla in manila
" four decades later , and a crowd is gathered at the same venue in this sweating , sprawling city -- known as the araneta coliseum -- for a very different contest : a basketball game between two of the country 's pro teams
and yet , the araneta coliseum can not seem to escape its boxing legacy
the most famous athlete on court today just happens to be a boxer
pacquiao is the coach , as well as one of the shortest players on the roster at just five foot , six inches ( 168cm ) tall , of team kia carnival
but the philippines is best known around the world as one of the greatest boxers of his generation , the first fighter to win championship belts in eight different weight divisions
but despite his on - court distraction , he 's not finished in the ring
pacquiao is little more than two months away from the most highly anticipated battle of his career
on may 2 , he will finally go toe to toe with u.s. welterweight boxing champion mayweather in vegas -- the fight most boxing fans have wanted to see for years
but for today , he seems more concerned that kia carnival trails several points behind the talk ' n text tropang texters
in the locker room , pacquiao , who only played for a few unremarkable minutes in the second quarter , gives a short half - time speech to fire up his players
he speaks mostly in tagalog , the main language of the philippines , peppering his locker room speech with english expressions like " offense " and " man - to - man defense
" seemingly inspired , the team charges back on court shortly after
surprisingly , pacquiao says he gets more nervous on the basketball court than when he faces a barrage of punches in the ring
" my hands [ get ] cold ! " he says with a laugh , while rubbing both hands together in the air
" i believe in my heart that my second sport is basketball , " he says later , explaining that it is a vital part of his cross-training for boxing
but he adds that he 's choosing to spend fewer minutes playing in professional basketball games these days to avoid injuries ahead of the mayweather showdown
" i can say [ this will be ] one of the most important fights in my career , " pacquiao says , during an exclusive interview with cnn
we speak at his cavernous home in a wealthy , gated community in manila
he is dressed in shorts , flip - flops and a red nike t - shirt with his photo on it accompanied by the slogan " spirit
" a diamond - crusted gold watch glitters on his wrist
several giant paintings bearing quotations from the old testament decorate the walls
the mayweather fight " has been five years in the making , " he says
" and finally it 's happening
i think the fans deserve it
" in fact , if it was n't for a chance encounter at another basketball game , the mayweather and pacquiao camps may never have agreed to a fight
last january , the two boxers happened to attend the same miami heat game in florida
pacquiao says the meeting in miami gave both sides " confidence to push " for the fight
in doing so , the 36 year old says he 's fulfilling the wishes of the two eldest of his five children
" my son and my daughter , they really wanted this fight to happen , " he tells us
" three years ago [ they said ] ' daddy , i want you to fight mayweather
i want you to fight mayweather
' i said , ' why ? it 's not my fault
he does n't want to fight
' and now finally now it finally happened
they really , really want to watch the fight
" of course , the battle in vegas will be much more than the fulfillment of the dreams of fans and pacquiao 's children
there is serious money riding on this fight
it 's estimated that the may 2 bout will break all financial records in the history of professional boxing
the pacman is believed to be earning around $ 80 million for the fight , while mayweather -- who is undefeated -- is expected to earn 20 % more
asked how the whopping paycheck makes him feel , pacquiao replies " i feel blessed and i owe a lot to the fans
first to god but also the fans because of their support
" the philippines ' most famous son has come a long way from a childhood mired in poverty and hunger
his rags - to - riches story explains part of the enormous appeal he enjoys in a country where a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line , according to the world bank
" he is a receptacle of hope , " says trinidad , a veteran columnist at the philippines daily inquirer
" everybody believes pacquiao should win
they are joyful because they see themselves in pacquiao , because pacquiao comes from deep , deep down in the soil , " trinidad adds
as a boy pacquiao eked out a living selling donuts in the street , recalls his childhood friend and member of his corner , fernandez
the two were neighbors in general santos city , a city on the southern island of mindanao
it was there that pacquiao was introduced to boxing
as a teenager , he earned extra money to feed his family by battling in underground boxing fights
" i remember when i started boxing , i earned two dollars , only two dollars , " pacquiao recalls
he says two of his friends died competing in these unofficial bouts
now a multi-millionaire and superstar , pacquiao says he and his wife are trying to teach their children to appreciate the life of comfort they now enjoy
to prove the point , he says he transferred his children from an academy for international students to a school with no air conditioning
" i want them to experience , so they can meet hungry families , " he says
" so they will not mistreat other people or treat other people different , " he adds , making a slapping gesture
when pacquiao travels through the perpetually grid - locked traffic of manila , he moves in a black armored escalade with the license plate " 8 " on the front
a pair of motorcycle cops escort his convoy
his gym , located in the working class neighborhood of sampaloc , is decorated with huge posters of the champion , as well as an undeniably cute cartoon statue of the goateed fighter that could be described as " pacman junior
" cameras from more than a dozen philippines television crews click and whir as pacquiao spars in the ring for an hour with fernandez , the stocky trainer who winces when he occasionally takes hits to his round belly
some of the younger neighborhood boxers who have gathered to watch appear to have adopted haircuts and goatees similar to the man whose rapid - fire punches helped earn him the local nickname " pacific storm
" but fernandez says pacquiao has n't started the most intense period of his training yet
this will begin in the next few days when team pacquiao flies to los angeles to work with roach , the u.s. coach who helped the philippines achieve global stardom over the last decade
" my relationship to roach is amazing , " pacquiao says
" since i met him , that was in 2001 , and until now , i did n't change my trainer because we understand each other
" but roach will not be available to work with pacquiao until after march because he is in china training another boxer
as for pacquiao , he has at least one more professional basketball game to coach in manila before he flies to the u.s. since his rise to superstardom , pacquiao 's activities and interests have multiplied
in addition to basketball and scuba diving off the beaches of mindanao , he has dabbled in singing , acting and politics
several years ago , he won an election to a seat in the congress
pacquiao proudly points to legislation he says he helped pass aimed at curbing the scourge of human trafficking in the philippines
but one local newspaper has also highlighted that paqcuiao has one of the lowest attendance rates in the entire legislative body , pointing out that the boxer could boast more championship belts than days physically spent in congress
pacquiao insists that instead of networking in the capital , he focuses on helping poor people in his electoral district
" if you compare my accomplishments to other congressmen , i think i did a lot , " he says
some critics argue pacquiao 's boxing has suffered due to his many other distractions
" he 's spreading himself thin , " says trinidad , the newspaper columnist
trinidad points to pacquiao 's knock - out at the hands of juan manuel marquez in 2012
" i hope pacquiao could win [ on may 2 ] , i 've been praying , " trinidad says
but the journalist fears pacquiao may not be able to break through mayweather 's much - vaunted defense
" he 's got to adopt a more mature style of boxing
he can not rely on what we call an explosive , kamikaze style , " trinidad tells cnn
back on court at the araneta coliseum , pacquiao 's kia carnival still trails by several points
but they soon manage to pick up some momentum and for the first time , take the lead
the boxer stalks the sidelines , watching closely , exchanging high - fives when his players come on and off the court
when the final horn sounds , pacquiao 's underdogs have beaten their better - ranked opponents -- an upset unlikely to be lost on him as he plots his own success against a more fancied opponent in the ring .
