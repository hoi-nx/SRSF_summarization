gutierrez says he will never forgive newcastle for the way he was treated during his battle with testicular cancer
the 31 - year - old was told to find a new club when he returned having beaten the illness for the first time in november 2013
gutierrez was eventually loaned out to norwich city for the remainder of the season
the cancer , however , returned last summer and he underwent a course of chemotherapy in argentina
gutierrez has admitted he will never forgive newcastle for the way they treated him newcastle winger gutierrez runs for the ball with mathieu flamini during their defeat by arsenal gutierrez swaps shirts with olivier giroud after arsenal beat newcastle at st james ' park last week alan pardew has since left newcastle for crystal palace but the manager told gutierrez to find a new club he returned to tyneside in december and was afforded an emotional welcome when he made his first appearance earlier this month during the 1 - 0 defeat at home to manchester united
but gutierrez â who paid for his own medical treatment - says he remains hurt by the manner in which the club hierarchy and manager alan pardew told him he was not needed following his initial battle with cancer
' i wo n't be able to forgive the way i 've been treated , no , ' he said in an interview with canal +
' i do n't think it was the right time nor the circumstances and i think at times like that , you should look after the individual , the player
' i was operated on in argentina
the post-surgery studies were good and well , i went back to england after being discharged
' i returned mid-november ( 2013 ) and at the beginning to mid-december the manager said i should find myself another club , that it was best
i understand a lot of things about football that , well , that for the directors it is a business , no ? gutierrez pictured when he competed in the buenos aires marathon while he battled testicular cancer gutierrez gives a thumbs up as he ran the race in support of a cancer charity following his diagnosis ' it is clear that they look after the club 's interests , but i think in a situation like that , you need to save ( consider ) other things , even more as i had been playing for five years before having this problem
' and i never asked for anything
i paid for it [ medical treatment ] because , for me , the most important thing was my health
' gutierrez is out of contract in the summer and it is thought he will leave after seven years at st james ' park
however , the winger admits he would prefer to stay for at least one more season
' i know the situation here ( at newcastle ) is n't the easiest but i 'm going to fight to remain here
time will tell what i can do and it 's in my control to leave everything , to give the best of me and see how far i can get , ' he said
gutierrez has returned to newcastle and hopes to stay despite admitting he can never forgive them gutierrez smiles during newcastle 's warm - up ahead of their premier league loss to arsenal on march 21 ' without doubt one , after a problem like i had , sees things from a different perspective and the order of priorities changes
' but it 's also difficult to get other people to understand because for everyone their own troubles are more important , are n't they ? ' i think the most important thing is health
sometimes we get into a lot of trouble for things that really are n't significant
