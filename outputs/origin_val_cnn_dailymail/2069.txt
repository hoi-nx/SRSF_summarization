men drink considerably more than women and at around age 25 peak at around 13 drinks per week , according to a new study observing drinking habits in uk
women drank the most , between 4 and 7 drinks per week in their 40s , but lessened their drinking after 65 , says research published in the journal of bmc medicine based on data from nine longitudinal studies in the uk
frequent drinking ( daily or most days of the week ) became more common during mid to older age , most notably among men , reaching above 50 per cent of men , said the study
men versus women : men drink considerably more than women and at around age 25 peak at around 13 drinks per week whereas women peak in their 40s middle - aged men do n't drink as much as men in their twenties but they tend to drink more regularly even in old age
according to the world health organization , us drink less than people living in the uk and up to 30 per cent of the us population does nât drink at all
the study found that non-drinking in the uk was as low as 10 per cent and that it only rose to 20 per cent in those above 90 - years - old
the post reports that low to moderate drinking , especially of red wine , is linked to health benefits and it 's therefore not surprising that so many men drink into old age
however , prior research has documented that both heavy drinkers and nondrinkers have higher risks of premature death than their peers who drink in moderation
some data linked to non-drinkers may be skewed because some non-drinkers may have chosen to stop drinking due to pre-existing health problems
drink frequency : men drink more frequently in older age than women but do n't drink as much as they did in their 20s whereas women stopped drinking at around 65 - years - old the post also mentions that alcohol is one of the most toxic substances that people consume and can often interfere with certain blood pressure medications that people take later in life
' it raises concerns that [ men ] are becoming dependent on alcohol and there are risks in this age group mixing alcohol with medications , ' said dr annie britton at university college london , who carried out the study
one drink doubles someone 's chances of going to the emergency room and is an even greater risk for drunk drivers who may crash their car while under the influence
heavy drinking poses grave dangers to health and makes people more likely to die from suicides , homicides , liver disease , and some cancers , reports culture of health .
