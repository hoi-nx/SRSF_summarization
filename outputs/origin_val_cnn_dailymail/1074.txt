the Â£ 1million home of peaches has remained untouched for nearly a year following her tragic death
however , a pile of children 's toys , a sofa , plastic furniture and a pram could be seen stacked outside the kent property today - suggesting work is finally underway to sort the family 's belongings
decorators could also be seen entering the property armed with paint brushes as neighbours claimed they believe it will now be cleaned out and sold on
it comes ahead of the one - year anniversary of the mother - of - two 's death , who was discovered in an upstairs bedroom in the property after overdosing on heroin
however , the items could be seen dumped in the driveway today as workers attempted to sort the home one man could be seen on the phone in the window of the property as the homewear stood on the driveway furniture , children 's toys and boxes of belongings were piled outside the front door of the Â£ 1million home photographs of the home over the last 12 months have suggested it has lain untouched , with a pram discarded in the front driveway and children 's toys littering the garden
but today 's developments suggest her family may now be clearing out the property and sorting through her and her family 's belongings , which will no doubt harbour sentimental value
a neighbour , who saw the workers arrive at the property this morning , said : ' since she died , no one has been back
' if you look at the place , it is very strange , it looks like time just stopped , everything is in exactly the same place from when she died
' i was a bit shocked to see people going in there today , but it looks like they are doing some decorating inside
' i would guess her partner will want to sell the house , it would be hard for anyone to go back after what happened there
' the men inside were painting and cleaning , that 's all i could see , but when i asked them about it and tried to find out if the property was going to be sold , they would n't tell me
' but from where i was standing that 's what it looked like
' the home does not appear to be up for sale as of yet
