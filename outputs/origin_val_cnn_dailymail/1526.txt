i ca nât wait to compete at the european indoor championships in prague , which is the biggest competition of the season so far
for multi-eventers , packing your suitcase to go abroad can be a bit of an ordeal
i noticed it more last year when i just did long jump at the world indoors and i only had to take one pair of trainers
with pentathlon i âve got five different pairs of spikes for the hurdles , high jump , shot putt , long jump and 800m
all kinds of things come with being a multi-eventer and making sure you have room in your case is just one of them
it was easy for this weekend because i âm not away for long so will pretty much live in my gb kit and a couple of pairs of jeans
british 's katarina johnson-thompson spoke about her preparations for the european indoor championships the 22 - year - old athlete will be competing in the pentathlon in this year 's indoor championships in prague normally at championships i room with holly bleasdale or jodie williams but neither of them are competing in the indoors this season so i do nât know who i âll be in a room with this time â you get the chance to pick but i just left the box empty
sprinters normally have their events in the afternoon so they can stay up later and sleep in whereas i âm always on first thing so it âs more about trying to find someone that matches your timetable than your personality
i âm just competing for the one day on friday so i âll have the rest of the weekend just to relax and be a spectator so it will definitely be good to do that
as well as being supported by the national lottery i am supported by the philanthropist barrie wells , who also sponsors jenny so i âll be with him in the crowd cheering her on and holding a banner for the 800m final on sunday
if i âm rooting for any athlete other than myself it âs going to be jenny because she âs had such a tough past
she âs been so unlucky not just with injuries but competing with lots of drugs cheats in her event
i âm glad athletics is being cleaned up because to have an equal playing field means so much to us as athletes
you dedicate your life to it and it âs so upsetting to think someone might be getting an unfair advantage and there âs literally nothing you can do about it
it âs definitely good that all the drugs cheats are getting exposed and it âs going to be a clean sport
i âve got personal bests in the long jump and high jump already this season
the last time i did pentathlon was 2012 because i did nât do an indoor season in 2013 and last year i was ill. i was a little kiddy in 2012 so i definitely should be getting one this time
the liverpudlian is confident after recording personal bests in the long jump and high jump this season i feel like a different person since i had a foot injury , which ruled me out of the commonwealth games and european championships last year
i ca nât really pinpoint what has changed i just enjoy being out there and i âm not nervous to compete any more
sometimes before the injury i used to think : â i just want to be a normal teenager or young person â but i realised it was this that i love and enjoy
it made me realise what i will be missing out on
i âve been focussing so much on the indoors that i have nât had chance to do a lot of javelin training which is one of my weakest events
i âm really looking forward to my next session with the british number one goldie sayers , who is helping me work on my technique , in april
away from competition , there âs been a new addition to my household - i âve got another sausage dog as a companion to chorizo
i âve called him bronx
i wanted to call him richmond to stick with the sausage themed names but my boyfriend said it was too posh and i was trying to push the sausage names too much ! he âs well trained though , much better than chorizo
i think it âs like having children - you make more mistakes with the first one and then correct them with the second ! as well as funding the road to rio athletes , every week national lottery players raise over Â£ 33 million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities
