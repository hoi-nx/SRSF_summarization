a british artist living in dubai has created a collection of tongue - in - cheek posters , depicting life as an ex-pat in the uae
clare napper , 36,used her artistic skills to gently poke fun at everything from ubiquitous holiday snaps in front of the burj al arab building to the childcare and home help habits of foreigners living in dubai
the former saatchi & saatchi graphic designer said the poster collection is a celebration of one of the world 's most dynamic and cosmopolitan cities
inspired by the good life led by ex-pats in dubai , clare napper first got the idea when working on a campaign for the dubai metro at saatchi & saatchi
' dubai is a new city and there are none of these old commercial printed ads , so i thought it could be a nice new art space to explore here , ' she tells mailonline travel
dubai is known for its many high - end shops , which clare napper addresses in this ' poverty sucks ' poster of ex-pat surrounded by purchases one of the themes in clare napper 's illustrations is to poke good - natured fun at the frequency with which ex-pats employ hired help , such as maids with temperatures of up to 40c in summer , activities such as playing golf are far from recommended in the uae but is living in dubai really as glamorous as these posters make it out to be ? ' it depends on where you 're from and what your socioeconomic background is like , ' clare napper says
' for people like myself , an average middle - class ex-pat from the british , day to day life in dubai is generally like living in any cosmopolitan city in the world
' people go to work , they take the kids to school , they get coffee , go to the supermarket , you name it , we do it here
' the differences - aside from living in sunshine all year round , which improves everyone 's mood massively - are that earnings are tax - free , we have a huge selection of great beaches and you can get anything delivered to your doorstep
' i would also say that dubai is one of the safest places in the world - every apartment building has a pool , gym and 24/7 security
' jumeirah beach residence , or jumeirah beach residence , is a 1.7 km waterfront area , frequented by ex-pats looking to soak up the sun despite the joking tone of her travel posters , clare napper insists that most middle - class ex-pats live a relatively normal day - to - day existence ' real food at ravis ' : in dubai , this cheap pakistani eatery is known as a great place to get a quick and unpretentious bite taxis are readily available and inexpensive , due to the prices of petrol in the region , but it still may take awhile to get to your destination despite such a reality , clare napper recognises that it 's not uncommon for british to have many misconceptions about dubai
' yes , the uae is a muslim country , so there are certain laws and rules that might take a bit of getting used to , but the uae is extremely tolerant , ' she explains
' after all , there are about eight million expats living here from all over the world
' many friends ask about the nightlife here and while we do let our hair down here , it all happens within the confines of licensed bars and clubs , or at home
' you do n't walk down the street being openly intoxicated
we all respect the culture
' clare napper admits that one of the best things about living in dubai is seeing the city develop - both in its infrastructure and also artistically from excursions to ras al khaimah and fujairah to having to renewing a visa : day tripping possibilities are endless in dubai in a gentle mockery of ex pat living , this image depicts a scruffy - and presumably lazy - young woman takes delivery of a chocolate bar as for clare napper , who has been in dubai for eight years after intending to stay for just 12 months , she ca n't imagine living anywhere else
' the best part is seeing how the place is developing , ' she adds
' both in terms of infrastructure but also artistically
' as more people arrive , you get more diversity
' there are so many talented people doing amazing things here and you get the feeling that there 's something exciting happening all the time
' people say that dubai has no history or soul , but i disagree
how much history or soul did london or paris have when they were only 40 years old ? '
