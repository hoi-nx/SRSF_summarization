a utah restaurant has caused a stir over the anatomy of a giant bull it uses to advertise the eaterie , businessman ward applied to hurricane city for permission to erect the giant bull above his restaurant named barista 's and unveiled the beast earlier this month
however , locals have attacked the massive sign and have even started a petition for the council strip restaurant of its business licence
locals in utah have complained about the size of a bull 's anatomy , pictured perched above barista restaurant more than 500 people have signed a petition for the restaurant to lose its business licence due to the bull owner ward , pictured , said locals in hurricane city dislike him and that is why they are complaining more than 500 people have already signed the petition , which has been created charge.org
according to the petition : ' as a member of the hurricane city council has already said , barista 's has given hurricane city , utah a " black eye "
' it 's owner is a terrible representation of what our community stands for
he takes advantage of every person that walks into his restaurant
' they intentionally take excessive advantage of those that are visiting our community from other parts of the world
' they have a horrible reputation that shines a bad light on the rest of hurricane city , utah
we as a community will not stand aside and allow this false representation be made ! ' local resident denise mackelprang told the st george news : ' it looks terrible
i could see the bull , but not the details of the sex
it âs r - rated to me , especially with young school kids seeing it and talking about it
' fellow resident lindsay knapp complained : ' the giant bull is awesome
the giant , weird testicles and penis are not even anatomically correct â¦ that is my issue
' however , mr ward said local residents do not like him and that is the main problem
he said : ' if i put pinocchio up there , its nose would be too big
it âs not the bull
it âs not the restaurant
they do nât like me
but you know what , where does it say in the world , in the constitution , that they can prevent me having the right to do legal commerce in the united states ? that is my god - given right
' as well as the petition , some residents have threatened to go to a council meeting to lobby politicians to act against the giant bull .
