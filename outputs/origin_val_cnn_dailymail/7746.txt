as soon as mourinho declared chelsea 's capital one cup final against tottenham as the most important final of his distinguished managerial career , it was hard to see past mourinho 's side
and that could , in part , be down to the chelsea manager 's brilliant record in cup finals : he 's lost just one final across 11 full seasons as a coach , winning 10 along the way plus seven league titles and four community shields or super cups
that makes it 21 trophies across 727 games , an average of a winner 's medal every 35 matches
mourinho holds the capital one cup aloft , it is the 21st trophy of his career as a manager the portuguese coach lifts the cup in delight , and he believes ' finals are not for playing , they are for winning ' the ecstatic chelsea boss showed a contrasting mood to the miserable figure from recent press conferences june 15 , 2003 : taca de portugal final

' finals are not for playing , they are for winning , ' mourinho said at full - time at wembley , and he certainly believes in his own words given the impressive record he holds on show - piece occasions like sunday
victory over tottenham ended a two - year mini-drought for mourinho , having come through a difficult final season at real madrid before failing in all three cup competitions and finishing third in the premier league with chelsea last season
that was his longest stretch without a trophy while in constant employment as a manager - and sunday marked his first cup final success in almost four years
the only final that a mourinho - led team has been beaten in came in 2013 's copa de rey final when real madrid were defeated 2 - 1 by local rivals atletico madrid - and even then it took extra time to kill off mourinho
prior to that though , he had won all nine of his previous finals , picking up the taca de portugal , uefa cup and champions league with porto , two carling cups and an fa cup in his first spell at chelsea , a coppa italia and champions league with inter milan and a copa del rey with real madrid
the stats show chelsea 's master motivator knows how to gee up his players for the big occasion : you do n't have such a strong record without that ability
' for me , it 's important to feel that i 'm a kid , ' mourinho said after the game at wembley

' this is a good problem , to have that feeling that two years is a long time
that 's a good feeling
' with mourinho giving his players just 20 minutes to celebrate before thoughts were focused back on their premier league title charge , mourinho will hope to add a couple more trophies in the 13 games ( or as many as 18 if they reach the champions league final ) before the end of the season
and now that he 's managed to give his new squad the big game pedigree that they needed , few would back against the portuguese coach to add to his rich honours list
