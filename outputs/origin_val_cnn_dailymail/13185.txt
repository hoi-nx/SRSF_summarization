baghdad about 75 % of the besieged iraqi city of tikrit is now back in government control , the head of a key paramilitary force taking part in the attack told cnn on thursday
the other 25 % is in the hands of about 150 isis fighters who continue to hold out , said main al-kadhimi , commander of the hashd al-shaabi militia
there has been no independent confirmation of such a significant advance by the iraqi forces
but they have been making progress in recent days
isis ' spokesman , abu mohammed al adnani , called reports of coalition - member victories " delusional and fake
" he spoke of the coalition 's use of fighter jets , heavy artillery and tanks , saying it is a " nightmare and will go eventually
" on wednesday , joint iraqi forces gained control of tikrit military hospital , a few blocks south of the presidential palace
it 's part of their ongoing quest to wrest control from isis , which captured the city last year
the predominantly shiite militia has been working with iraqi troops as well as sunni fighters to try to regain tikrit
tikrit , best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , fell in june to isis , which has captured large areas of iraqi and syrian for what it says is its islamic caliphate
on march 1 , iraqi prime minister al-abadi ordered iraqi forces to retake tikrit and salaheddin province
isis was n't making it easy , however
the sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near tikrit , preventing the joint iraqi forces from using it to cross the tigris river to approach the city from the east
nevertheless , forces have made progress , forcing isis fighters to retreat toward the city center from front - line positions , hashd al-shaabi 's media office said
there have been several failed attempts to recapture tikrit since the second half of 2014
if iraqi regains control of the city , it could mean that retaking mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible
the tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters
also assisting is iran , which has provided advisers , weapons and ammunition to the iraqi government
according to the pentagon , iranian may be operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well
gen. dempsey , chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff , told a hearing of the senate foreign relations committee on wednesday that the consensus was that iran 's involvement was positive in military terms
" anything anyone does to counter isis is in the main a good outcome , " he said
but dempsey also voiced concern over what might happen after isis is defeated
a key question , he said , is " whether the government of iraqi will remain on a path to provide an inclusive government for all of the groups " in iraqi
tikrit could act as an important testing ground , with some observers concerned that if the predominantly shiite militias seize control , thanks in part to the support of majority - iran , they could carry out reprisal attacks against the remaining sunni population there
such attacks could inflame already simmering sectarian tensions within iraqi and make future efforts to retake mosul and bring peace to the country yet more difficult
in a possible sign of the problems to come , a number of posts on social media appear to show iraqi soldiers in extremely graphic " selfies " with the heads of alleged isis militants , or striking odd poses with bodies behind them
most of the photos are thought to have been taken during the iraqi military offensive to retake tikrit and other areas in salaheddin province , which started 10 days ago
two senior security officials in samarra told cnn , on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to media , that they are looking into these claims and they are also investigating similar incidents
they did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the images
cordesman , a security expert at the center for strategic and international studies , said sectarian division was an issue to be " extremely concerned " about as iraqi forces gain ground in tikrit
" it 's already been very clear to iraqi that this is an iranian - led operation and not one which has the support of the coalition , " he said
as some iraqi question why the u.s. has not taken more decisive action , he said , " this may be a case where iran may be gaining very serious influence
" if there are reprisals in tikrit and it becomes a " shiite - on - sunni struggle , " cordesman said , then not only will iran 's influence increase " but you can see the country divide and islamic state ( isis ) be replaced by a conflict between iraqi shiite and sunni
" strong leadership will be needed from the government in baghdad , headed by al-abadi , militia leaders and senior religious figures to prevent this outcome , he said , with a lot already being done on this front
the top iraqi shiite cleric , grand ayatollah ali al-sistani , he said , " very clearly says that iraqi must act as iraqi , not divide along sectarian lines
" the challenge will be ensuring that fighters on the ground , some angered by the killings of their relatives by isis , do not seek vengeance against sunni communities whom they suspect of supporting the group
while iraqi forces piled the pressure on isis in tikrit , the sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in iraqi 's western anbar province , where it is finding a support base among the predominantly sunni population
more than 40 iraqi soldiers were killed when isis blew up the iraqi army headquarters just outside ramadi , an anbar provincial leader told cnn on thursday
militants dug a tunnel and detonated hundreds of homemade explosives , said al-karhout , head of the anbar provincial council
isis launched a new offensive on ramadi , west of baghdad , on wednesday morning , al-issawi , the deputy head of the council , said in a statement
the city is being attacked " from all directions , " with isis firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets , he said , and explosives - laden vehicles used to attack security checkpoints and a bridge
officials believe " this is an isis response to the tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north , " al-issawi said
u.s. - led coalition forces carried out 13 airstrikes in iraqi between wednesday and thursday morning , a statement said
five hit isis targets near kirkuk , and three struck isis units and a vehicle near falluja
elsewhere in anbar province , iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of karma , near falluja , from isis , said al-karhout , the head of the anbar provincial council , on wednesday
iraqi security forces were fighting side by side with shiite hashd al-shaabi units and local tribesmen , al-karhout said
isis is also battling in many places far from tikrit , including syrian , where the militant group is more on the offensive , according to the syrian observatory for human rights , a london - based monitoring group
clashes continued thursday between the kurdish people 's protection units , or kurdish ypg , and isis fighters in ras al ayn , a syrian strategic border town with turkey , the syrian observatory said in a statement
hundreds of isis militants launched a large - scale offensive wednesday in the town , the group said
dozens have been killed from both sides
