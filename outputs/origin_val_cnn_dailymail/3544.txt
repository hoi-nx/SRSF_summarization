online music videos are to be given age ratings in a bid to protect children from explicit images and lyrics
top artists including sam smith , george ezra and joss stone could see their music videos handed 12 , 15 or 18 certifications under the government - backed pilot scheme
the bbfc , which is running the initiative , has estimated that one in five videos released will be deemed unfit for those under 12
video sharing sites youtube and vevo have signed up to the scheme and pledged to include the warnings on clips uploaded to their sites
vevo puts the rating in the top corner of the video , while youtube includes it in the information beneath however some of the world âs raunchiest performers , such as miley and rihanna , are not covered by the scheme and there are no measures in place to enforce the guidelines rapper dizzee rascal has already seen his video â couple of stacks â rated 18 under the initiative
ellie goulding âs â love me like you do â , recorded for the film fifty shades of grey , was handed a 15 warning and kasabian âs â stevie â was rated 12
but even with these ratings in place , there is nothing to stop younger music fans stumbling across the inappropriate clips which often include sexual imagery , violence and obscene language
only videos released by the british arms of sony music uk , universal music uk and warner music uk are covered by the scheme and the companies are free to choose which videos they want to submit for certification
this means videos from artists such as miley , nicky minaj and rihanna , who are not signed to those labels and are known for their raunchy videos , will not be included in the ratings system
video sharing sites youtube and vevo have signed up to the scheme and pledged to include the warnings on clips uploaded to their sites
vevo puts the rating in the top corner of the video , while youtube includes it in the information beneath
however , there are no checks to make sure the person watching is of the correct age
youtube is the world âs most popular video sharing platform , with one billion worldwide users
it hosts videos for the vast majority of musicians
some of the world âs raunchiest performers , such as miley and rihanna , are not covered by the scheme and there are no measures in place to enforce the guidelines a spokesman for vevo said : â there is no signing in as such or filters â although this is a next step that may be added in time
at the moment this is about giving parents and users the information they need to make a more informed viewing choice and decision
to be effective it requires that parents also take an active interest in what their children are watching
â campaigners said last night that the latest move is a â fantastic step â but called for stricter enforcement and for all music videos to carry the â kite mark â of an official age rating to help parents protect their children
the scheme has been running since october last year and has so far seen 84 videos rated , with 27 given a 12 classification , 39 a 15 and one a 18
the bbfc has estimated that one in five videos released will be deemed unsuitable for children under the age of 12

dizzee rascal âs video was given the highest rating because of â strong bloody violence , gore , very strong language â
the three and a half minute clip contains extreme violence with the rapper ripping the heart out of a stripping woman , brandishing a knife while covered in blood and decapitating a woman whose body then stumbles around the room
he also holds a family hostage and serves a cake with severed fingers instead of candles
he is shown pulling out a person âs eyeball , slitting one woman âs throat and cutting another âs head in half
vivienne pattison , from campaign group media watch - uk , said : â when parents are surveyed , the two areas that came up as being particularly problematic were soap operas and music videos , those are the two areas that come up again and again as the issue
one in five , that âs a huge number of videos
' what happens is one video pushes the boundaries and the next artists is under pressure to do the same in order to get people talking about it
it becomes a great merry - go - round and i think that is a fantastic illustration of exactly where this is gone , it âs quite extraordinary
â it âs not a magic bullet but it âs a fantastic step and i think it will really make a difference
i do nât know where we will end up down the line but i would like this to act as a kite mark for music videos
this is not a move about censorship , the videos will all still be there , but i think artists and record companies need to take seriously that if they are targeting young fans they have got to do it responsibly
â on the lack of enforcement of the ratings , she said : â you ca nât go into a shop and buy a 15 rated film without id and we need to see about extending those protections online
