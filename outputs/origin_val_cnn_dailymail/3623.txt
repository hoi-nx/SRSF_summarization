uefa president platini has strongly supported fa chairman greg dyke âs campaign for more home grown players in the premier league
greg dyke revealed on monday that he wanted to increase the minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12 in order to help the england team
platini , speaking after being elected unopposed for a third term at the uefa congress in vienna , is the best possible ally for greg dyke , who is sure to face formidable opposition from the all - powerful premier league
uefa president platini agrees with gerg dyke 's plans to increase number of homegrown players the fa chairman wants to increase the minimum number of home - grown players from eight to 12 greg dyke wants more homegrown players in premier league teams , raising the number per squad from eight to 12
but only three current squads fall short of that number , though many of their homegrown players have yet to play for the first team
chelsea ( 11 ) : cesc fabregas , cahill , john terry , nathan ake , andreas christensen , jeremie boga , mitchell beeney , dominic solanke , ruben loftus-cheek , isaiah brown , jamal blackman
tottenham ( 9 ) : kyle walker , danny rose , andros townsend , ryan mason , harry kane , nabil bentaleb , ben davies , harry winks , joshua onomah
manchester city ( 8 ) : joe hart , james milner , frank lampard , gael clichy , richard wright , dedryck boyata , bersant celina , jose pozo
platini said : â this is a position we defend
we âre not only talking about england , we âre talking all of europe
mr greg dyke âs struggle with the fa is something we share and we agree with him
with the new leader of the european commission ( jean-claude juncker ) , it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect homegrown , grassroots young players
â we share the same perspective
we will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one
there is free flow of workers in europe but there are some things that does nât apply to , like in this case
â uefa general secretary gianni infantino was also enthusiastic about greg dyke âs mission
he said : â it âs fantastic
eight out of 25 ( the number of home - grown players that currently must be included in a champions league squad ) is not as many as it should be
so whatever move in favour of increasing homegrown players is something we can only support
â greg dyke âs proposals have irritated the premier league who never like being dictated to by the fa
greg dyke said on tuesday : â we âre open to discussions and i âd like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue
â greg dyke 's plans also include ' home - grown ' players having to train in england for three years before the age of 18 united director david gill said the proposals needed ' to be discussed by all the stakeholders ' it could make for some tension between greg dyke and the premier league at the club summit tomorrow , especially as the professional game representatives on the fa board had advised greg dyke ( left ) last week not to go public
united director david gill sits on the uefa exco and will join the fifa exco in may after his election on tuesday as the british vice-president
gill , who is also a premier league representative on the fa board , said : â it âs a relevant thing to look at , but it needs to be discussed by all the stakeholders
â michael carrick said he would love more homegrown players to get opportunities but admitted it is difficult michael carrick said that the system does n't always work in favour of players like it has for harry kane of late united and england midfielder michael carrick said : â we âd all love more homegrown , british players to get opportunities
there are two sides to the argument : you âve got to be good enough to get the chance in the first place but someone âs got to give you that chance
â someone like harry kane is the perfect example of how we âd all like it to be
he gets his chance and takes it and has elevated himself to another level
â but it does nât always work like that
plenty of times you look at young lads and think , he âs got a chance but it does nât quite work
â england team - mate cahill said : â i agree with some aspects
i think it âs important to have a mixture
i love to see young players getting opportunities
but i âm respectful of the fact that the premier league is one of the best leagues in the world and it attracts some of the top players
â fans want to see exciting players and top clubs want top players and sometimes they are overseas
it is a matter of getting that balance
â cahill wants more young players to get opportunities but respected the premier league 's position cahill hopes a balance can be reached between the quality of the league and young players coming through ritchie humphreys , the pfa chairman and an fa commission member , said : â any foreign player who comes to this country we welcome
but we also have a duty of care to our national game and to young homegrown players
â everything we are working towards on the fa commission is with the aim of making our national side more competitive at elite level
