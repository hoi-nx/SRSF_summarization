washington house speaker boehner said army sgt. bergdahl is " innocent until proven guilty " after the united states military charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy , but emphasized in an exclusive interview with cnn 's dana bash that he was more concerned about the circumstances of his release
bergdahl 's attorney also released a statement on wednesday , outlining his defense of the soldier and containing a two - page letter from bergdahl describing the torture he endured , which included months spent chained to a bed and further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage
shortly after the charges were announced , bergdahl 's attorneys released a lengthy statement that includes a letter sent to milley earlier this month outlining their defense of the soldier
" in light of the nearly five years of harsh captivity sgt. bergdahl endured , the purpose of his leaving his unit , and his behavior while a prisoner , it would be unduly harsh to impose on him the lifetime stigma of a court - martial conviction or an other than honorable discharge and to deny him veterans benefits , " attorney eugene r. fidell writes in the letter
the statement includes a two - page accounting from bergdahl of his time in captivity , in which he recounts months spent chained to a bed , then further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage
read the statement and bergdahl 's letter bergdahl said for years his body and health declined due to malnourishment , and sores on his wrists and ankles from the shackles grew infected
" my body started a steady decline in constant internal sickness that would last through the final year , " he said
bergdahl was frequently beaten , at times with copper wire or a thick rubber hose , and forced to watch taliban videos , he said
he had no concept of time , and was repeatedly told he would be killed and would never again see his family
" i was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years , with little to no understanding of time , through periods of constant darkness , periods of constant light , and periods of completely random flickering of light and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening beyond the door i was held behind , " he wrote
bergdahl tried a dozen times to escape , he wrote
in his interview with bash , boehner said " like any united states , you 're innocent until proven guilty
" " and these charges are coming
there will be a trial , " boehner said in an interview taped wednesday to air sunday on cnn 's " state of the union
" boehner said the " more troubling part " of bergdahl saga is the fact that the united states government traded five taliban fighters for bergdahl 's release , and that recent reports indicate one has returned to the battlefield
he expressed concerns about other detainees held at the united states military prison at guantanamo bay , which president obama is working to close , " ending up back on the battlefield and threatening united states here and abroad
" obama " violated the law " in failing to alert congress before the prisoner swap occurred , boehner added
" and i still believe that 's the more troubling part of this , " he said
" we 've made clear in the past that we wo n't negotiate with terrorists , and but yet here we did
" military officials announced wednesday afternoon they would charge bergdahl with one count each of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy
bergdahl left his post in afghanistan before being captured and held captive for five years
for that , he faces charges that carry a maximum penalty of life in a military prison , and he could also have to forfeit pay and be stripped of his rank , army col. king said as he announced the charges
bergdahl faces a military procedure similar to a grand jury that will whether charges are appropriate , king said
then , he could face court martial proceedings
the decision comes nearly a year after bergdahl returned to the united states as part of a prisoner exchange and since the army began a formal investigation into his disappearance from his unit in eastern afghanistan in june 2009
the army concluded its investigation into the circumstances of bergdahl 's capture in december
until now , it has been in the hands of gen. milley , head of u.s. army forces command , who made the decision to charge bergdahl
several united states military officials cnn has spoken with suggested privately that the process took longer than expected
ahead of wednesday 's announcement , officials said milley only had a few choices
though the sense had been that bergdahl must be held accountable for his actions , there had been little appetite for a lengthy term in military confinement given the five years bergdahl was held by the taliban
now 28 , bergdahl was taken by the haqqani terrorist network
but the circumstances of bergdahl 's departure from his base and how willingly he left have not been clear
king said he could n't offer those details on wednesday , and that they 're being treated as evidence for the upcoming proceedings against bergdahl
senate armed services committee chairman john mccain , r-arizona , called the charges an " important step " on wednesday
" this is an important step in the military justice process towards determining the accountability of sgt. bergdahl , " he said in a statement
" i am confident that the department of the army will continue to ensure this process is conducted with the utmost integrity under the uniform code of military justice
" sen. lindsey graham , r - south carolina , meanwhile , lambasted the " unevenness " of obama 's swap of five taliban prisoners for bergdahl
" i would n't have done this trade for a medal of honor winner , " he told cnn
" no military member should expect their country to turn over five taliban commanders to get their release
it 's not the nature of his service that drives my thinking it 's just the illogical nature of the swap
" some members of bergdahl 's platoon have criticized him , labeling bergdahl a deserter
" i was pissed off then , and i am even more so now with everything going on , " former sgt. matt vierkant , a member of bergdahl 's platoon when he went missing on june 30 , 2009 , told cnn last year
" bergdahl deserted during a time of war , and his fellow united states lost their lives searching for him
" bergdahl was freed in may when president obama agreed to swap five taliban prisoners who had been detained in guantanamo bay to secure bergdahl 's freedom , sending those detainees to qatar
obama announced bergdahl 's release to fanfare in the white house rose garden , flanked by the army sergeant 's parents , bob and jani bergdahl
his hometown of hailey , idaho , had planned a parade to celebrate bergdahl 's homecoming but later canceled that celebration amid security concerns stemming from the unanswered questions surrounding his disappearance and the resulting controversy over his release
after returning to the united states , bergdahl had been on active duty at an administrative job at fort sam houston in san antonio , texas
there , the army assigned bergdahl a " sponsor " to help him adjust to life in his new post
upon returning , bergdahl refused to meet with his parents -- and months later , army officials had said he was communicating with them but still had not met them face to face
the five figures the united states exchanged to secure bergdahl 's release were khair ulla said wali khairkhwa , mullah mohammad fazl , mullah norullah nori , abdul haq wasiq and mohammad nabi omari
they were mostly mid- to high - level officials in the taliban regime and had been detained early in the war in afghanistan because of their positions within the taliban , not because of ties to al qaeda
the detainee swap for bergdahl has become increasingly controversial in recent weeks after a report published by the office of director of national intelligence james clapper said one of the 17 intelligence agencies operating under its umbrella had judged that a prisoner released in the exchange had since contacted the taliban
