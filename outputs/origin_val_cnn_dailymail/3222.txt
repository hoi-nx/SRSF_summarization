warning : graphic content fanatic : shaun dixon keeps up to 32 iguanas and other reptiles in his cheshire home unusual : mr shaun dixon attaches his reptiles to leads and walks them around his local neighbourhood mr shaun dixon 's passion for rescuing abandoned animals was sparked in his childhood by his aunt , who also kept iguanas in her house
he last has a girlfriend in 2006 , but they broke up because she could not bear to be around so many reptiles
' my reptiles are my children , ' said mr shaun dixon , from crewe
' i made the decision a long time ago that it would take a lot to commit to a long - term relationship or have children of my own because my pets mean the world to me
' i had a girlfriend while i was at college and there 's no doubt that that the reptiles were a key factor in the reason we split : she hated them ! i 've been single ever since
' occasionally there have been opportunities and nice people who have tried to flirt with me but i know they 'd never understand my reptiles , or put up with sharing the bed with a lizard

' my iguanas live in my bedroom as that is the place i go to relax , ' he said
' i love having them in there with me because i can just lie on my bed and enjoy nature 's wonderful creations
' i also wash my reptiles in the bath because i love seeing them swim like crocodiles in the bathtub
' in the summer months i take them outside for walks on leads and i 'll let them climb the trees we have around us
' at present i have four iguanas , a chameleon , one leopard tortoise , four tarantulas and two costa rican zebras
' mr shaun dixon works with vets around cheshire to rescue abused reptiles , then nurses them back to health at his home before either adopting them as pets or giving them away to caring new owners

' at one time i had 32 lizards including bearded dragons , water dragons , chameleons , leopard geckos , fat - tailed geckos and a golden gecko
' i also had around 17 snakes comprising of corn snakes , rat snakes , king snakes , three boa pythons , a rainbow python and a colombian python
' are they dangerous ? yes
can they bite ? well , anything with a mouth can bite , even people , so it really does n't bother me
' iguanas and monitor lizards are renowned for being highly territorial and for taking up a large amount of space , but this does not faze mr shaun dixon
hands - on : mr shaun dixon has been passionate about reptiles since he was just a child danger : these photographs show the gory bites mr shaun dixon has sustained from his beloved animals he said : ' their frustrations can be taken out on the owner so of course they can be dangerous
' they can inflict serious bites but , in my experience , bites are never given without some kind of warning
the problem is recognising the warning signs
' what i like about reptiles is that they 're difference from your usual household pets
' i love seeing a full repertoire of natural behaviour
an iguana head - bobbing , for example , is majestic and almost dragon - like in appearance
' i learn new things every day
i 've seen at least 15 different communicational head - bobs from my big male iguana , albus
' he added : ' my auntie was rescuing and rehabilitating iguanas for as long as i can remember and much of what i learned came from her
' sometimes my big male iguana will even come up and sit on my knee and defeat the laws of his very nature
there is nothing more rewarding than that
' and at least they never nag me to do the washing up
