many of the planets discovered elsewhere in our galaxy are not like earth , but rather more like jupiter
such gas giants , as far as we know , are not hospitable to life , but now it has been suggested that the moons of these planets could be habitable
if confirmed , it would suggest these locations could be the predominant sources for life in the universe , not worlds like our own earth
the idea was discussed by dr sarah ballard of the university of washington in seattle , on the pri 's ( pri ) show the takeaway

she said exomoons could be the ' predominant sites of life in the universe '
shown is an illustration of upsilon andromedae d , the large world in the distance , orbiting the gas giant in the foreground , which could have habitable moons she explained how jupiter - sized planets in the habitable zones of stars - where conditions are ideal for water , and perhaps life - are more common than single rocky worlds like earth
hot exomoons too close to a star and an exomoon may have an average temperature above the boiling point of water , making it highly unsuitable for any form of life
habitable exomoons exoplanets orbiting in a system âs habitable zone ( where liquid water can persist on a planet âs surface ) still need sufficient gravity to trap an atmosphere that regulates their temperature
if these conditions are met , however , the prospects for life are promising
snowball exomoons moons formed in the outer reaches of an alien solar system are likely to be dominated by ice
they will remain deep - frozen unless heated by tides from their parent planet - again these are unlikely to be habitats for life
transient exomoons moons of planets with elliptical orbits might be habitable for most of their planet âs year , but can experience hot or snowball periods as they venture too close to their star , or too far from its life - giving heat

in particular , she focused on the world of upsilon andromedae d , a gas giant exoplanet about 10 times the mass of jupiter , located 44 light - years from earth
while the planet itself is not thought to be habitable , it is possible that a moon in its orbit - known as an exomoon - could be
and if you were to step on the surface of the moon , you would see â beautiful tumultuous clouds on the jupiter planet â and â incredibly complex cloud activity , â according to dr sarah ballard
so far , no exomoons have been discovered , but given that six of the eight planets in our solar system have moons , most astronomers regard it as an inevitability rather than a possibility that one will be found
it might be possible to find one in data collected by nasa âs kepler space telescope , or it may be necessary to wait for a more powerful planet - hunter to come online , such as the tess ( tess ) , due to launch in 2017
finding exomoons is a bit of a problem though , as their mass and size is so much less than their host planet
one technique to find them that may prove successful is gravitational microlensing , which uses a foreground star to magnify a more distant one
the chance alignment can reveal exoplanets around a star , and could possibly even be used to spot a moon in orbit

it might be possible to find one in data collected by nasa âs kepler space telescope ( illustration shown ) and we are able to rule certain planets out - ones that are too close to their host star , like mercury and venus in our own solar system , are unable to cling on to natural satellites
but finding out if moons are common in our galaxy will be key for the search for life , and could signal a change in goals for planet - hunters in the near future
â the fact we reside on a single rocky hunk of rock , orbiting without a big brother planet , might be relatively unusual , â added dr sarah ballard
