an investigation into the 1959 plane crash that killed buddy holly and three others could now be reopened after a respected pilot brought forward new factors as to how the aircraft may have gone down
at the time of the crash , the aeronautics board ruled the probable cause of the crash was error by the pilot , roger peterson , who took off from mason city to moorhead , minnesota , in inclement weather , even though he was qualified
the chartered plane crashed in iowa not long after takeoff , killing holly , roger peterson , and musicians ritchie valens and j.p. richardson
now l.j. coon , an experienced pilot from new england , says a variety of other factors - such as weight and balance calculations , the rate of the plane 's climb and descent , fuel gauge readings and the passenger - side rudder - should have been considered , according to the globe gazette
wreck : on february 3 , 1959 , a light aircraft chartered by buddy holly crashed in clear lake , iowa , killing the singer and three others aboard
an investigation into the reasons for the crash - ruled at the time to be pilot - could now be reopened , after a pilot petitioned for other factors to be considered fiery : the accident , known as ' the day the music died ' , that occurred on february 3 , 1959 , killed rock and roll musicians buddy holly , ritchie valens and j. p. ' the j.p. richardson ' j.p. richardson , as well as the pilot , roger peterson too young : buddy holly was only 22 when he died , with his career only lasting 18 months
he is still considered one of the best musicians of all time tragic : the body of one of the three famous rock ' n ' roll singers killed in the crash of a single engine bonanza lies a few feet from the wreckage of the plane on february 3 , 1959 , in clear lake , iowa the ntsb has agreed to consider reopening the investigation
l.j. coon 's motivation was to ' the heroic effort that took place in those 4.9 miles ' by the pilot , roger peterson , before the plane crashed
the plane had been in the air less than four minutes
l.j. coon received a letter from the ntsb saying they had received his call for a reinvestigation
' you have gotten our attention
let us do our due diligence in order to give you a proper answer , ' the letter stated
the ntsb will now determine whether or not the submission meets the requirements of a petition for reconsideration
history and many other people believe that roger peterson was the direct cause of the february 3 , 1959 crash
killed : holly , who was one of the most popular entertainers of the 1950 's , died in a plane crash in 1959 in memoriam : a giant pair of glasses marks the place where buddy holly died in clear lake , iowa moore , author of hey buddy , a book about holly 's life , told the globe gazaette that the aeronautics board got it right 56 years ago
' i think that what ( a new investigation ) is going to find it is its pretty simple , ' moore said
' the pilot was unqualified to fly in those conditions and he lost control of the airplane
' holly , a rockabilly pioneer , was only 22 - years - old when he died , with a career lasting 18 months
despite such a short time , rolling stone in 2004 ranked holly as number 13 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time .
