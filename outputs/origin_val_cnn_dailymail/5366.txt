for those who witnessed republic of ireland âs approach to playing scotland at celtic park in november at close quarters , suggestions that they are a robust and direct unit scarcely seem tantamount to slander
martin oâneill âs side may not quite have mirrored the ultra-industrial style favoured by jack charlton âs men all those years ago , yet there were precious few morsels of real quality for the game âs purists to feast on
were poland then , doing any more than stating the blindingly obvious this week when they spoke extensively of republic of ireland âs one - dimensional , strong - arm strategy in their qualifying games thus far ? aiden mcgeady celebrates scoring for republic of ireland against georgia you would nât have thought so but , then again , martin oâneill , whose republic of ireland side entertain the poles in dublin , has never been one to resist an ever - so diplomatic counter-swipe at such accusations
clearly keen to gain the slightest psychological edge ahead of what is being viewed as a must win game for the republic of ireland , the former celtic manager bristled when word of the poles â comments was relayed to him at their malahide base on friday
â i âm not really bothered about what they say â genuinely not bothered , â martin oâneill insisted
â i âm not so sure they could glean that from the games we have played
it âs not for me to retort but poland are as physical a side as i have seen in some time
adam nawalka âs side are a pretty accomplished one , too , however
currently sitting on top of group d , republic of ireland will surely need snookers to catch them if they leave the aviva stadium with another maximum return of points
having won in georgia and pinched a point in germany , republic of ireland âs campaign hit the buffers with defeat in glasgow in their last competitive outing
in a section with next to no margin for error , martin oâneill âs side badly need to begin a sequence of four home games from five with a win
in that regard , a degree of calculated risk taking is in order
aiden mcgeady âs downturn in form has seen him excluded from roberto martinez âs everton side since january 31 but â while far from ideal - his international manager sees that as no barrier to inclusion
aiden mcgeady âs downturn in form at everton should not affect his republic of ireland position â you can get away on a bit of adrenaline if you are reasonably fit and i think he âs been fit for a number of weeks
he just has nât played for everton in that time , â said martin oâneill , who handed the player his celtic debut 11 years ago
â adrenaline can carry you a certain distance
you would nât want to be going into a game with say three or four players not having played that much football
â that may happen but you know that as some stage these players are going to tire a bit
but it is what it is
â it âs a disappointment from this side but i âm not in charge of their club commitments
â listen , it would be absolutely fantastic if players were coming in here on the back of having played games the last couple of weekends
â you always sense it âs never going to be that way
i was involved as a player at northern ireland and we had players coming in who had nât played much at club level but suddenly they got a lift from playing international football
â that âs what i âd be hoping for
â if martin oâneill is bemused by aiden mcgeady âs exclusion at club level , he made a fine job of hiding it
â that âs entirely up to everton , â he straight - batted
â if i was to make that judgment on every single player at club level , i might be listening to the wrong comments
â roberto martinez is absolutely entitled to pick whoever he wants to at club level
â if he does nât think that aiden is playing well enough to be picked for his team , that âs entirely up to him
republic of ireland coach roy keane shares a joke with aiden mcgeady during training session â we âve a different aspect here
he is obviously very important for us
he âd a great start against georgia , continued that on although he may have been a little disappointed ( in how he played ) against scotland
â overall , he is important to us
i think just the change of environment might just give him that lift
â he âll be a bit disappointed that he âs not in the everton starting side
but he â s here , he knows what he âs done for us in the recent past and that should give him a lift
â aiden mcgeady might well be facing a familiar figure in the poles goal
boruc , also formerly employed in glasgow âs east end , is being tipped to win his 60th cap here after wojciech szczesny âs recent relegation to the arsenal bench
â it âs some years ago but in his spell at celtic he was one of the top five goalkeepers in european football , â said martin oâneill , who left parkhead in 2005 just as boruc was coming in
â of course , there âs some water under the bridge since then and he âs now down at bournemouth
but he was a fine goalkeeper before and if the manager is thinking of picking him , he must have great faith in him at the moment
â self - confidence among the poles is scarcely at a premium
still unbeaten in the qualifiers , their only blemish so far came in the 2 - 2 draw with scotland in warsaw
martin oâneill knows â from bitter experience in glasgow â how the entire dynamic of the section can turn in an instant
his warning then , not to gift the likes of robert lewandowski a prized victory hardly needs to be overstated
â we âre 75 minutes into the game and our concentration faded , â martin oâneill recalled of shaun maloney âs winning goal from a set - piece
â i know as you get tired in a match your concentration goes a little bit , but that really should nât happen
â i think poland âs approach will be a pretty positive , as suggested by the results they have got
â in the game against germany there were moments in the match where i would say fortune broke for them at the time
â but they have earned that and they have put up points on the board
â their second - half performance against georgia in georgia was particularly strong
â i âm expecting a big , big game
but this is the first match of a run where we have four out of five at home and it is up to us to do something about it
