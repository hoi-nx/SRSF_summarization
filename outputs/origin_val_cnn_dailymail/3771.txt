it can take months of planning and its fair share of disagreements on the way to plan the perfect road trip
but now one u.s. scientist believes he has planned the perfect european road trip that means we can all put away those atlases and close down google maps
michigan data scientist , randy olsen , has come up with route using an algorithm that calculates shortest distance , excluding any journeys over water
covering 16,287 miles and 14 days of driving , mr randy olsen advises putting three months aside to explore the cities
rather than looking at every possible solution , olsen used something known as a ' genetic algorithms ' which starts with just a few random solutions
it then manipulates these solutions , while trying something slightly different each time , until it finds one that it ca n't improve on

using similar methodology , olsen then took on the challenge of planning the best u.s. road trip - ensuring the car would never leave home soil on its route
his only limitation was to make one stop in all 48 contiguous u.s. states , along with washington d.c. and two stops in california
there is a scheduled stop - off at the world famous prehistoric monument of stonehenge in wiltshire , uk each stop would be at a national natural landmark , national historic site , national park or national monument
and the car could never leave u.s. soil
to create the map , mr randy olsen first found the shortest distance by road between each of the 50 landmarks provided
the tricky part was putting the landmarks in order to eliminate as much driving back on himself as possible
you will get the chance to stretch your legs and take in some cycling exercise with a stop - off in amsterdam
