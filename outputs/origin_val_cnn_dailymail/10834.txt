england could be looking for a new bowling coach for the ashes after saker confirmed he would be returning to his native australian to coach melbourne renegades in the big bash league
saker , 48 , who has been with england for five years , has a six - month termination clause in his ecb contract , which could yet mean he sees out the summer in this country before heading home
but he is keen to move back to australian sooner rather than later , and also hopes to become head coach of a state side in the first - class sheffield shield competition â with victoria the favourites
england bowling coach saker has confirmed his return to australian with melbourne renegades saker , pictured speaking to anderson , has worked with the england team for the last five years if the ecb do allow saker to head home before the australian arrive to defend the ashes this summer , that could pave the way for the return of ottis gibson , who quit as west indies coach last year and was saker 's predecessor in the england fast - bowling role
saker told the melbourne age : ' my first three years in the job for english cricket was a bit of a fairytale
but like most things it 's hard to keep that form up
we lost some senior players , which made it a little bit harder
' i 'm sure everyone in the australian camp do n't think they can just walk up and win the ashes
if they think that they 've got something very wrong with them , because england in england are always hard to beat
' saker 's exit could open the door for ottis gibson , pictured with anderson in 2007 , to return to the role the 48 - year - old , pictured with chris woakes , could yet see out the summer with england
