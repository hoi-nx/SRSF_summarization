outspoken top gear host clarkson has been involved in a string of controversies
most recently , the bbc trust ruled that clarkson was not being racist when he used the word ' pikey ' on top gear - a decision which has sparked condemnation from the traveller movement
the presenter put up a placard with the words pikey 's peak on the bbc2 series in february last year
he and the top gear team were chased out of argentina after angry locals reacted with fury to clarkson 's number plate containing an apparent reference to the falklands war
the h982 fkl plate was seen locally as a veiled reference to the 1982 conflict
however , the top gear denied their use of it was a deliberate reference to the war , and claimed it had simply been a coincidence
in july , ofcom ruled clarkson deliberately used racist language by referring to an asian man as a ' slope ' during a burma special
the india high commission in london formally complained to the bbc in 2012 about a special in which clarkson travelled round india in a jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot
clarkson was also reported to have referred to the then prime minister gordon brown as a ' one - eyed scottish idiot ' in 2009
and the year before , the bbc received more than 500 complaints after he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes
clarkson also made a mock nazi salute while talking about a mini design that might be ' quintessentially german ' and received flak after describing those who jump in front of trains as ' johnny suicides '
all three men 's contracts expire three days after the norway gigs , which could render any disciplinary hearings redundant

i 'm doing it today
' he later continued to make jokes that may have alluded to the fact that the show he hosts alongside clarkson and hammond has been put on hold pending an inquiry into the ' fracas '
he tweeted : ' great news ! we also need some new hoover bags
i can spin that out for an hour or two , ' followed by a haiku about his boredom
the motorbike enthusiast , who earlier this week described his co host as a ' knob ' , wrote : ' life , once so dazzling sinks into a grey fog of not - done - it - yourself '
he continued to make light of the amount of free time on his hands , writing : ' vegetables peel more easily if you wet them , yes
but why ? # unemployed
' ' seriously , if you really are unemployed , good luck to you
it 's not funny in reality
' then with a picture of the ferrari badge he tweeted : ' oh sod it
i 'm going for a ' spin
'' he also made what could be interpreted as dark hints about the future of the show earlier in the week , saying : ' last night , at precisely the moment top gear was due to start , the headlights on my car packed up
not sure where i 'm going with this
' hammond also joined in with the dark hints today , tweeting a picture of a dog alongside a poem
he added : ' not trying to be cryptic , just enjoying a gorgeous morning
