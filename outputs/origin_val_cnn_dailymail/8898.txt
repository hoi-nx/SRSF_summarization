â coming out of the champions league i think they âll really focus on their last nine games
the attitude at that football club will be : â can we win nine ? " it âs up to us to go and give them a good game
' you look at their squad , they have enough to win nine games
if they do , who knows ? i âm sure they âre talking about it
