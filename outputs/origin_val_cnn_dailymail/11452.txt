if an englishman âs house is his castle , his garden shed is his fortress : a refuge that has nurtured many a seedling and saved many a marriage
but today a mere shed is not enough
timber is so last year
so meet the Â£ 22,000 solardome â an eden project for the burbs
it âs the ultimate uber - shed , a grand , permanent 20ft - across structure made from glass
hundreds of these and similar egg - shaped conservatories are springing up around the country â and now john lewis is about to start selling the smaller - scale Â£ 599 garden igloo
if it âs good enough for john lewis , it âs good enough for me
now , i do nât claim to be a practical man
while i can happily whip up braised saffron sweetbreads or layer a ceviche , diy remains a strange and alien country
i can barely wire a plug without bringing down the national grid
ikea is , truly , a four - letter word
when we first moved in together 100 years ago , my wife deborah brought with her a set of power tools that would not have disgraced a formula 1 mechanic
i brought my spice rack and a pastry brush
so it was with some trepidation that , yesterday morning , i took delivery of an enormous , corpse - heavy cardboard box , dispatched â with typical teutonic efficiency â from a berlin factory in just 24 hours
grand : egg - shaped conservatories are springing up around the country like the solardome ( pictured ) which is a permanent 20ft - across structure made from glass it might be called an igloo but , much to my daughter âs disappointment , you do nât have to hand - carve blocks of pack ice , which would have been undeniably tricky in dorset at the end of march
but even with a set of faultlessly efficient instructions â the poles are all numbered , the instructions straightforward , albeit tedious â i was a worried man
in fact , gazing at the 164 poles , all of differing lengths , and 62 connectors , i have not felt quite so fazed since being trounced in the first round of the krypton factor in 1992 by a postman from peterlee
he managed to build a 6ft dice from scratch ; i did nât
a breezy promotional video shows some beanie - hatted hipster nonchalantly putting his igloo up in just 30 minutes , but it took me two - and - a - quarter hours , slowed by the shaming fact i clearly ca nât tell the difference between a hexagon and a pentagon and , as a result , got two of my joints muddled up , wreaking havoc
as my wife said tartly : â i do nât think it âs meant to have a hole in the roof and a pole left over
â cue some furious , ill - tempered dismantling followed by a quick first - aid break as i clumsily managed to all but deglove my finger unscrewing one of these stubborn joints and spattered the white doorway with blood : not a great look
inspiration ? the conservatories are stylistically similar to the maze featured on classic game show the crystal maze there was one last glitch as my wife and i grumpily managed to slide on the skin - tight pvc cover , inside - out
this is arguably the trickiest section : imagine trying to coax a single cover over a double duvet while swearing â and sweating â under plastic
but finally , finally , it was done
and the satisfaction was immense
it was then time â with help from sherborne âs castle gardens â to dress my new man cave : an orange tree , a fig and a fern , table and chairs , a ghetto - blaster and , more crucially , a wine - cooler
the garden igloo might look funkier than your average potting shed but there is one drawback : it is completely transparent
if you âre after a secret doze or a hush - hush hideaway for your home brew , this is not for you
and it is crazily hot : a stand - up polytunnel
certainly , my fig tree is flourishing in this sun - warmed fug , so too my oranges
tomatoes would be perfect , so too pineapples
if you can ignore the sickly reek of new pvc , this weather - proof quasi-sauna is a little idyll
newly on sale in here , the manufacturers of the garden igloo , also called garden igloo , believe the uk is the perfect marketplace
sales in germany have been relatively modest â about 1,500 last year â but chris dimpker , head of marketing , says : â our product is 100 per cent weather - proof and really suits the uk
you have warmer winters and cooler summers â this multi-purpose dome is tailor - made for those conditions
guided by the efficient instructions , after 30 minutes the base is almost complete
so far , so good
i 've passed the two - hour mark after muddling my connectors and slicing through a finger
where does that top piece go ? 3
i enlist my wife 's help
after trying to slide the cover on inside - out , tempers fray
we 're both ready for a sit - down
with the igloo finally up , it 's time to dress the dome : cue pot plants , a hi - fi and of course , a wine cooler
now that 's more like it - a chilled sun - downer , some tunes on the ghetto - blaster and a good book
at 12ft across , this is a roomy space to make of what you will : the perfect sci - fi housing for a paddling pool or hot tub , as long as you do nât mind looking like a slightly comical extra from blake âs 7
and , despite being incredibly strong , it âs absurdly portable , hence the ten anchor poles that you will absolutely need if there is so much as a breath of wind , unless you want to see your treasured igloo disappearing over your fence like a startled jellyfish
but this is clearly the year of the dome and the options are as variable as the prices
luminair makes a unique canvas dome designed by an airship engineer that can be built up a tree , complete with its own solar power and a wood stove
its prices start from Â£ 8,000
there is even a designated camp site
gloucestershire âs dome garden â recently voted the uk âs best glamping site â is made up of 11 vast geodesic domes
but you could , this easter , do a great deal worse than this budget version of the glasshouse retreat : my new dome - office - come - sweat - lodge
i âm about to fill the wine - cooler and i âm battening down the hatches
i may be some time .
