saudis and allied warplanes struck rebels in yemen on thursday , with saudis threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor 's civil war , potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the middle east
the swift and sudden action involved 100 saudis jets , 30 from the uae , 15 each from kuwait and bahrain , 10 from qatar , and a handful from jordan , morocco and sudan , plus naval help from pakistan and egypt , according to a saudis adviser
the egypt state news agency on thursday quoted egypt 's foreign ministry as saying egypt 's support also could involve ground forces
what do those countries have in common ? they 're all predominantly sunni muslim -- in contrast to the houthi rebels , shiite who have taken over yemen 's capital of sanaa and on wednesday captured parts of its second - largest city , aden
the saudis consider the houthi proxies for the shiite government of iran and fear another shiite - dominated state in the region
" what they do not want is an iran - run state on their southern border , " cnn military analyst lt. col. rick francona said of the saudis
the airstrikes did not include warplanes from the united states , which has worked with yemen governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling president hadi -- to go after al qaeda
in fact , a senior official in president barack obama 's administration said " there will be no military intervention by the united states " but united states secretary of state john kerry on thursday did tell foreign ministers from saudis , the uae , qatar , kuwait , bahrain and oman that the united states commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing , targeting assistance and logistical support , according to a senior state department official
how did yemen get to this place ? houthi supreme leader abdul malik al-houthi spoke live thursday night in yemen on al-masirah tv , saying , " if any army try to invade our country , we will prove that yemen will be a grave for those who invade us
" he added , " we call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner
" iran denounced the military intervention
afkham , a spokeswoman for the country 's foreign ministry , said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to yemen 's monthslong internal strife
it also wo n't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like isis and al qaeda , she said
" this is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries ' national sovereignty , " afkham said , according to a report in iran 's state - run islamic republic news agency
iraqi -- 60 % of whose citizens are shiite , with about 20 % being sunnis -- offered similar , albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its foreign ministry called " the military interference of the gulf cooperation council , " which is made up of bahrain , kuwait , oman , qatar , saudis and the uae
" we call on the arab states to live up to their role to support national dialogue ( that includes ) all political forces to find a political solution for the crisis , " the iraqi ministry said
the houthi are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in yemen
in addition to airstrikes , the saudis adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in yemen
just a day in , the coalition airstrikes are already costing the houthi
hundreds of explosions ripped through sanaa overnight , said journalist hakim almasmari , who is staying in the capital
the health ministry reported 18 dead and 24 wounded in sanaa , the houthi - run saba news agency said
while sanaa was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the houthi ' combat and control operations there , the saudis adviser said -- it was n't the only place struck
compounds and military installations in saada and taiz also were targeted
by thursday afternoon , the saudis controlled yemen airspace , the adviser said , and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter yemen ports
the military operation , dubbed al-hazm storm , was launched after the houthi rebuffed an initiative by the gulf cooperation council , arab league chief al-arabi said in a speech thursday
it was done in accord with a joint arab defense treaty , al-arabi said
specifically , the strikes aim to support hadi , who was ousted in january after talks with the houthi faltered , but still claims to be yemen 's rightful leader
" we are determined to protect the legitimate government of yemen , " said jubeir , the saudis ambassador to the united states , in announcing the beginning of the military campaign
" having yemen fail can not be an option for us or for our coalition partners
" why is saudis bombing yemen ? jubeir told cnn 's " the situation room with wolf blitzer " that saudis was concerned that the houthi had control over yemen 's armed forces ballistic missiles and air force , and the fact that iran backs the houthi was troubling
" this is really a war to defend the legitimate government of yemen and protect the yemen people from takeover by a radical militant group aligned with iran and hezbollah , " he said
united states military commanders said they did n't know about saudis 's action until the last minute
" we have been discussing this matter with the united states in principle for many months , " jubeir said
" we have been discussing this matter in more detail as the time approached and the final decision to take action did n't really happen until the last minute , because of circumstances in yemen
" egypt foreign minister sameh shoukry on thursday proposed a joint arab military " to deal with these challenges
" but at least one major player in yemen besides the houthi -- the general people 's congress , which is the party of longtime leader ali abdullah saleh -- thinks the saudis and their partners should stay out
the general people 's congress says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties
the best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table , the group said
" the ( party ) expresses its rejection of the attack on the yemen and the capital , sanaa , considering what ( is ) happening is an internal affair , " the general people 's congress said
" ... the general people 's congress ( calls on all parties ) to return to and accelerate the completion of a national , historic agreement that ... maintains unity and democracy
" meanwhile , the last person to be elected president of yemen -- even if he was the only one on the ballot -- is out of the country and will soon be headed to egypt to petition arab officials , according to yemen officials
the location of hadi had been a mystery for days , with conflicting reports about whether he 'd left yemen and where he 'd gone
saudis 's state news agency , spa , reported that hadi arrived thursday in riyadh , where he met with the saudis defense minister and intelligence chief
but two yemen officials close to hadi said that the deposed president is in oman
they said that his next stop , on friday , will be an arab league summit in sharm el-sheikh , egypt
meanwhile , some 3,000 to 5,000 troops from the saudis - led coalition are expected to reach aden , the yemen city that was hadi 's last known location , in the next three days , according to the officials
their aim is to make that port city safe enough for hadi to return after the arab league summit
whether the rest of yemen will be secure at that point is another matter
unfortunately , there has been little in the last few months to inspire optimism that peace is around the corner
