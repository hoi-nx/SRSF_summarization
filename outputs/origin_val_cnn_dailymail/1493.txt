her beaming face was a rare moment of joy amongst the devastating scenes of katrina
a decade on , staff sgt. mike maroney is desperate to trace the beaming little girl he rescued from katrina 's floodwaters
the us airman was with an elite air force pararescue unit when he plucked her to safety from her family 's destroyed home in new orleans , during the disaster
moment of joy : staff sgt. mike maroney rescued the unknown girl and her family from their flood hit home in new orleans , a week after katrina struck the little girl and her family were still waiting for help about a week after the storm hit when the specialist team swooped in to help
the joyful image went on to appear on coinage and paper placemats at the base exchange , on phone cards and a magazine cover
for mr mike maroney , it was a brief moment of joy during what seemed like a hopeless mission
' it had been such a rough week , when she wrapped me up in that hug , i was in la - la land , ' he said
i was just loving that hug
' the veteran , who has since completed tours of iraq , afghanistan and was deployed to the philippines , had arrived with his team a week earlier to do what they could to help the devastated city
a man suffering from an aortic aneurysm who was unlikely to survive and a comatose woman who had not left her own bed for years , were amongst those they assisted
rescue : a man is hoisted to safety , like the little girl staff sgt. mike maroney is trying to trace , after being rescued from the top of a vehicle in the flooded streets of new orleans , louisiana , in september 2005 devastated : water surrounds homes just east of downtown in this aerial view of damage from katrina , 10 years ago but the dad - of - two was particularly moved by this girl , whose name he never knew , as he had a child the same age
he told the airforce times how he helped save the fearless youngster with her parents and four siblings and remembers how she excitedly pointed out her home and her school from the hoist
she reached out to rub her mother 's back and comforted her as she cried saying ' it 's ok , ' and ' we 're safe
' as he dropped her off at new orleans international airport with the rest of her family , a colleague captured their hug on camera
' if i never do anything else again , that hug and that smile made it all worthwhile , ' he said
he had no idea how far the image would travel until more than a year later , when he was on a deployment to iraq
another airman told him he had seen the image on military coins handed out as change at the base exchange
disaster zone : fire and floodwater in new orleans following the hurricane which left 1,833 people dead mr maroney said : ' it was everywhere , on burger king placemats and at&t phone cards
i did n't expect that
' a foundation for fallen rescue airmen â so that others may live foundation â used it on their brochures
now a civilian pararescue instructor at joint base san antonio - lackland , he left active duty in august 2006 and has spent the last eight years in the air force reserve , rising to the rank of master sergeant
since katrina , he has tried to trace the girl , even sending a letter to oprah winfrey but never heard anything back
he has circulated the picture online once a year in the hope someone might recognise her but to no avail
' i would love to get another hug and see how she 's doing
i 'd love her to know that there is n't a day i have n't thought of her
