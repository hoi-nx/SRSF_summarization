john bilardi is paralysed with an unbearable sense of guilt as he tries to make any sense of what would possess his son , now known as jake , to volunteer to sacrifice his own young life for the islamic state
on the surface jake bilardi was far from what is perceived as a stereotypical recruit for an extremist muslim group : a white boy from suburban australian who , as the youngest of six children , had an atheist upbringing
however , even his father admits you did n't have to dig too deep to see that his 18 year - old son was a troubled soul and now he will live with a life of immense regret
the painfully shy boy had never been happier after converting to muslim and regularly attending mosques but his new lifestyle choice did not end there as he flew to the middle east in december which ultimately cost him his life in a failed suicide mission in iraq last week
his father struggled to find any words to describe his pain and overwhelming sense of guilt when he spoke to 60 minutes reporter usher which airs on sunday night
' he is at a complete loss to try to understand any of it - he 's trying to put the picture together now on not a lot of information at all to be honest - he is learning as much as anyone else is learning in the public forum , ' usher told daily mail australia
john finds it even more difficult to comprehend that his son had plans to orchestrate what would have been a deliberate act of mass murder right in his very own city where he had lived his whole life
jake 's father shared pictures and cards with the programme , showing a happy father 's day cars with the words ' i love you ' written inside jake 's father admitted to 60 minutes reporter usher ( pictured right ) that you did n't have to dig very far to realise that the 18 - year - old was a very troubled soul ' he can barely talk about it all he struggles for words with the fact that his son had plan b which was to commit a major act of terror in melbourne and had begun buying the chemicals for the bombs before he disappeared out of australian , ' usher said
as the youngest of six children , jake had an atheist upbringing ' that atrocity john can not understand at all - the family are desperately trying to now go back and understand who jake was because he was n't the kid they thought he was and tragically all of the warning signs were there of a kid in trouble
' when usher suggested there were clear warning signs that his son had issues , john agreed saying : ' yes they were and i 'm so sorry i did n't do anything about it
' ' he said he was at times very difficult emotionally - even as a little boy , ' usher said
' he also said " i 'm sorry i wish i could have done more to understand my son and stop him " and he 's finding it very hard to grieve because he 's feeling so much guilt , ' usher said
isis leaked a photograph of 18 - year - old australian jake bilardi ( pictured ) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it to add to jake 's complexities , his mother died from cancer in 2012 and was then looked after by his five older siblings as his parents had divorced years earlier
his father described his son as an ' extremely shy ' loner who felt alienated from his family and even expressed in one of his blogs that he felt unsafe with his siblings
he said he felt he should have known about the full extent of his son 's bullying
' i wish i could understand more of what went on , ' he told usher
but john also feels that his son was brainwashed and believes that he was a ' soft target for ' the muslim recruiters
john bilardi ( pictured , left ) in a school photo from year 10 - the year he converted to muslim , according to school friends , and wearing a chelsea football club shirt ( pictured right ) jake bilardi 's father feels a deep regret that he did n't address his son 's issues when he was a child his former fellow pupils also described jake as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets and spoke seriously all of time about middle east politics
although it was unusual that the child from an atheist background converted to muslim there was nothing to suggest that he was acting radically in his public life but online he was in active contact with islamic state recruiters
jake organised to get a passport and told his family he wanted to work at a charity in uganda
' he went online from writing about his love of soccer and wanting to buy a dog to children allowed to join the jihad and i cant wait for my pilgrimage to mecca in december , ' usher said
the last time john ever saw his son was when he asked for his birth certificate in order to get a passport and said he seemed uncharacteristically ' upbeat '
' he said he was articulate and clear and seemed happy and in fact in the last communications he seemed very content and he said to his dad " i feel comfort being a muslim and i feel comfort in muslim " , usher said
' john was optimistic that his son was on a good path that after the divorce and feeling alienated he thought that his son had found some happiness and peace
' however , these feelings were short - lived as john had a growing concern for his son 's welfare by the last time he ever heard from jake again in the form of a facebook message when was in the middle east
footage of jake being bullied at school - his former school mates described him as as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets the last time his father saw jake he was uncharacteristically ' upbeat ' ' the message was pretty veiled other than to say that he was in the region and had some intent , ' usher said
john was understandably panicked but could n't find a lot of places to turn to get help and was at a great loss at what to do
' in fact even at that point , there was still some disbelieving that maybe this was just some great romantic notion of jake 's and he was off some ridiculous journey , ' usher said
' then he could n't contact him and had no further communication from him and john learned of his son 's death as it appeared in the media last week
' john send a warning out to all parents to be more aware about who their children are interacting with online
john was optimistic that his son was on a good path and had finally found happiness and peace jake 's father warns all parents to take note of who their children are interacting with online ' it 's going on , it 's happening , it 's real it 's not just from a muslim background , it 's anybody they can find , any soft target they will aim , human life means nothing to them , ' john told usher
' i could tell he was brainwashed but they are such a powerful influence
' his father never wants to hear again the words that his son will be forever known as - ' jake ' but instead hold onto the memory of his beloved son
' he 's trying to preserve a little bit of who the jake was that he knew and loved - the kid who loved soccer , the kid who used to run around in the backyard and play in the park with his dad ' he said that 's the jake i need to remember - jake i do n't even want to hear that name because i do n't even know who that person is and that 's not my son
