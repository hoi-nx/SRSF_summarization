i 'm playing fantastic darts , and even though i can play better i am happy with this
' the defeat leaves van barneveld in elimination danger next week as he sits third from bottom in the table
adrian lewis , meanwhile , remained in the bottom two after he was beaten 7 - 2 by dave chisnall in the first match of the evening
' i did n't happen for me tonight , ' said adrian lewis
' double top let me down on a few occasions and double five pulled me out of the bag a couple of times , and it 's difficult to deal with
' dave chisnall started the night in ireland with a 7 - 2 win over adrian lewis dave chisnall said : ' i 'm happy with that
adrian lewis was n't at his best and he missed a few doubles , but i capitalised on that - sometimes you need a bit of luck and timing , and today i had both of those
' i 've not played my best darts in the last couple of weeks but i put it right this week
i was confident that i could get the win and i managed to get the victory
' i 've done everything right in preparation and it paid off because once i got into the lead i did n't look back , and i ca n't wait for manchester next week now
' there were no such problems for phil taylor , though , as he beat bottom placed belgian kim huybrechts 7 - 4
phil taylor beat bottom placed kim huybrechts 7 - 4 at the 3 arena in dublin phil taylor said : ' kim huybrechts played pretty well and his finishing was good but he let me in when he missed that 100
it was nip and tuck so i 'm happy to have come out with the win
' it was a tough game but i enjoyed it
i had a 104 average this week and won and a 115 average last week and lost , which does n't make sense , but that 's the game now and there were a lot of nerves on this week
' i can relax next week now but i 'm really looking forward to playing dave chisnall in manchester
' world champion gary anderson was also a winner in dublin as he saw off stephen bunting 7 - 4 while james wade beat peter wright 7 - 3 .
