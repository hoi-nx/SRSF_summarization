owens does a bit of stand - up comedy in his spare time , as well as after - dinner speaking , and one can imagine him being quite funny
the welsh referee , considered among the finest in world rugby , was amusing in his response to being flattened by jimmy cowan a few years ago
â try going past me next time , â he remarked , after eventually returning to his feet , even though he knew full well that he , and not the new zealand scrum - half , was at fault
it was entertaining to listen to him this week as he reflected on a hugely impressive performance at twickenham last saturday
welsh referee owens disputes a decision with england captain robshaw at twickenham television viewers were struck by the manner in which he handled the players during an extraordinary game that occasionally became bad - tempered
he defused certain situations quite beautifully , even addressing individuals by their full christian names to exert some authority
robshaw became â robshaw â christopher â , with owens praising the england skipper and his opposite number for playing some marvellous rugby while ordering them to cut out the nonsense
it worked â players addressed him as â sir â
rugby players generally tend to respect referees rather more than their footballing counterparts but owens , 43 , commands more respect than most
owens commands more respect than many referees when taking charge of top level rugby when he was the victim of homophobic chanting at twickenham last autumn , â two england fans were fined and banned for abusing owens for being gay â he received messages of support from players from england as well as australia , new zealand , south africa , france and welsh
and when he once asked ronan oâgara to sign a copy of his autobiography for his father , the then ireland fly - half wished geraint owens a happy christmas , but also added how proud he should be of his son
he will go up in the estimation of most for the way he handled a situation only this week
the victim of a homophobic tweet after last weekend âs six nations encounter , owens agreed to travel to carmarthen police station to meet the 18 - year - old who had abused him
as part of an agreed adult community resolution â an alternative way of resolving crimes that allows victims to be involved in deciding how the offender can be dealt with by choosing from a list of out - of - court options â owens accepted what he described as â a profound apology â and let the matter rest
international referee owens jokes around with wrestler barri griffiths on a welsh tv show owens , who does some stand - up comedy in his spare time , appears to enjoy the limelight â it âs like refereeing a game of rugby , â owens told me
â you ca nât referee in black and white
there is an awful lot of grey and you have to apply a bit of common sense
â this young man was genuinely remorseful for something he accepts was stupid
he apologised to me publicly on twitter and on facebook
â he could have been left with a criminal record but i saw no point in that on this occasion
the key thing is to get the message out there that it âs not acceptable to insult someone in that way
â i have learned to handle this kind of abuse
but there will be people out there who are struggling the way i once did and they will find it extremely hurtful
this is about protecting them
â getting the key decisions right is how a referee is ultimately judged but players seem to like owens â style
â until someone said it to me i had nât realised i âd called robshaw â christopher â , â he says
â i suppose you could see it as a device that makes clear to someone you âre not entirely happy with them
it might be the way a teacher addresses a pupil
i did work as a technician at a school for a number of years and also with kids in youth clubs
the 43 - year - old directs england and france players during the feisty encounter at twickenham last weekend â but i âd probably address most people by their full name until i know them a bit better
â i learned from derek bevan , a great referee , and i think the secret is to be authoritative , firm and fair but not over-officious
â if you show the players respect they tend to respect you
and sometimes you can defuse a situation with a smile or a quick bit of wit
that âs probably where comedy comes in handy
i âve been doing stand - up since i was 14
â rugby is his first love , but owens follows football too and he takes an interest in some of the issues currently concerning referees in the round - ball game
the crowding of referees is a particular concern , while there is growing pressure for video technology
owens shakes hands with robshaw after last saturday 's six nations clash at twickenham â i certainly do nât think you can officiate at the top level in rugby without the technology that helps you get the key decisions right , â he says
â that âs what we want to achieve across all sports
â it âs still not perfect
even with a video replay , mistakes can still be made
but it âs definitely something i believe football would benefit from
â on occasions in rugby it is over-used and we have to guard against that
and football does nât have the natural stoppages that make it a bit easier to call on video technology in rugby
football has more of a natural flow
â i think something like a captain âs challenge would be interesting ; say one challenge per half per team for the decisions that really matter
â the welsh referee , who took charge of england vs france last weekend , has done stand - up since he was 14 respect is the other issue ; one , in fairness to football , that the authorities have tried to tackle with different campaigns over the years
â only if you are very naive would you say football does nât have an issue with respect , â says owens
â but rugby should nât take the moral high ground either because i âve seen problems in our sport too
i âve seen referees being pushed in grassroots games and so on
â ultimately it âs a problem in society , although football has to recognise it can influence how young people behave in society
but i think the laws of rugby allow referees to deal with these kind of issues more effectively
there are more breaks in rugby that enable you to speak to the players
â referees could also be supported in terms of the citing process
if i make a mistake by giving a player a yellow card when it should have been red , it can be given retrospectively as a red
â this does nât happen in football , but if players knew that was a possibility â that the citing process was toughened up â it would lead to better behaviour on the field
