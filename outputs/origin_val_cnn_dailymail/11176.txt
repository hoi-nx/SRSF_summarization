playing again : paul gray says years of loud music shattered his hearing musician paul gray first suspected he might have tinnitus while mid-way through a tour with punk band the damned more than 30 years ago
â i was in my hotel room one night , and i âd turned the tv off , but could still hear a high - pitched whiney sound , â he says
â i wondered where it was coming from , looked all around the room , opened the windows , and then figured that it might just be tinnitus
â this was in 1981 , and back then few , if any , musicians wore earplugs when they played live
â the yellow foam ones looked uncool and the wax ones were totally unsuitable for musicians as they cut out too much sound , â says paul gray
besides , a lot of musicians â not to mention young fans â saw temporary hearing loss after a gig as something of a badge of honour
â back then , it was a case of â oh , it must have been a great gig , my ears are still ringing â , â says paul gray , who first found fame as a bass guitarist with eddie and the hot rods before going on to join the damned and then later working with former wham ! star andrew ridgeley
tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree , according to the british tinnitus association
many have hearing damage as a result of being exposed to loud noise , be it in industry , the armed forces or the music business
last month , the world health organisation said people should listen to music for no more than an hour a day , to prevent damage to their hearing
tinnitus can also be triggered by conditions such as meniere âs disease , or in older people it can occur as a result of age - related hearing loss
sufferers experience a constant whirring or whistling in their ears and many struggle to find an effective treatment
at first paul gray , now 56 , experienced â a whine in my ears that was louder in my right ear , a bit like the sound of a jet turbine cranking up
â it was worse after gigs , but it would come and go , until one night in 1995 while paul gray was on stage with captain sensible ( who topped the charts with his cover of happy talk in the eighties )
â there was this deafening screech of feedback , so loud that it physically knocked me several feet back , â he says
â i ran off before the next song and stuffed toilet paper in my ears , but the damage had been done
â afterwards any sudden noise â doors banging , car breaks , shouting â would make him jump
back home in cardiff , paul gray âs doctor referred him to a specialist at the university hospital of wales ear , nose and throat department , who diagnosed â high - frequency hearing loss â after acoustic trauma , and advised him to limit his exposure to noise â and to get a new career
but for paul gray , being a musician was more than a job
â it was my life
so i carried on for a couple more years
â however , the tinnitus gradually worsened
â it was exacerbated by extraneous noises i had no control over , such as knives on plates , glasses clinking , children shouting â and i was hugely stressed
â tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree , with many suffering from hearing damage by 1997 , paul gray had to admit defeat and call time on his musical career
he returned to the hospital and was prescribed maskers â a hearing aid - type device that played a hissing noise in his ears , now more commonly known as white noise generators
â we were trying to retrain his brain into not focusing on the tinnitus â it was a distraction technique , â says tim bord , a senior audiologist at the hospital , who has been treating paul gray since the mid-nineties
paul gray was supposed to wear maskers for eight hours a day for a year
â but i could nât follow conversations or hear the television properly , because i had great big pieces of plastic in each ear , â he says
by now , even the click of a light switch aggravated his condition
â i pretty much became a recluse for the next few years , which contributed to my divorce , â he says
in the late nineties paul was referred for counselling with a clinical psychologist , but this did nât work
he turned to alternative treatments , from the alexander technique ( a method of relaxation ) to acupuncture
at one stage he tried â laser pen therapy â â shining a torch into your ear to stimulate the growth of hair cells in the inner ear , as tinnitus has been linked to damaged hair cells
â you name it , i threw money at it , but they were all useless , â says paul gray , who resorted to hiding earplugs around the house to cope with the noise when his young son jeff had friends round to play
nowadays , one of the most common treatments is cognitive behavioural therapy â a psychotherapeutic approach that tries to get the patient to change how they think about tinnitus
while this was some help , paul gray concluded he was just going to have to learn to live with his condition
he carries custom - fitted maximum protection earplugs â which keep the frequencies down and cuts external noise by about 25 decibels â
basic sets can be bought from most music shops , while specsavers charges between Â£ 50 and Â£ 100 for a made - to - measure pair
paul gray also avoids noisy places as , like for many sufferers , background noise makes the problem worse
â if i âm in a pub or restaurant i always try to position myself against the wall , so i only have sound coming from one direction , â he says
there have been some advances in treatments since paul gray was first diagnosed â such as the introduction of smaller â in - ear â white noise generators , and devices that combine a hearing aid and sound generator in one
paul gray has now learned to live with his condition and is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music a new treatment , neuromodulation â an earplug - type device designed to target the specific frequencies that distress an individual â is available privately , but is still undergoing trials
recently , researchers at the university of western australia said they âd identified a drug that blocks â hyperactivity â in the area of the brain that processes sound â although they are yet to test the effect in humans
meanwhile , paul gray is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music
â we run a scheme called the musician âs hearing passport , which gives comprehensive tests and advice on hearing protection by an audiologist , â he says
â often when i ask students to raise their hands if their ears have ever rung , eight out of ten will put their hands up
these kids are 18 , 19 years old , and do nât realise the damage that âs already been done
â there âs still the attitude that i had , that noise is fun and that â if it âs too loud , you âre too old â
â paul gray , who has recorded a new album , a postcard from britain , with his old bandmate captain sensible , is able to play again for up to an hour at a time , so long as he wears his earplugs
he says his father had always warned him being in a rock band would â make me go deaf â but he had ignored him
â if i knew then how my life was going to be affected by noise damage â i âm pretty deaf now â i would definitely have taken steps to protect myself
after all , a musician needs ears
they âre pretty vital tools of the trade
