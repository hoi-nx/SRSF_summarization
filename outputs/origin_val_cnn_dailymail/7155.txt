lancaster is refusing to ' dream ' of seeing his england team crowned six nations champions for the first time on saturday night
the red rose have been installed as favourites to replace ireland as champions on a climatic final round that will conclude with france visiting twickenham , yet they could finish as low as fourth in the table
ireland and wales are also in the hunt with the staggered kick - offs - starting in rome at 12.30pm and concluding when england take the field at 5pm - ensuring a nerve - jangling afternoon awaits

lancaster is desperate to lift the first piece of major silverware of his reign but having finished runners - up for the last three years , the head coach is acutely aware of how best laid plans can be foiled
' to win at twickenham would mean a huge amount , - for the players and the fans , ' he said

' but you ca n't start thinking about things like that until you get the detail of the game right
we 've got a huge challenge coming our way from france
' they 're a high quality team - very big and physical
as they showed last year when they played ireland , they played right through for the full 80 in that last game even though they could n't win the championship
' it could still be the case they have something to play for , so we wo n't start dreaming yet , we 'll get our detail right

lancaster will inform his players of the results of wales ' clash with italy in rome and ireland 's match against scotland at murrayfield , but insists their over-riding ambition on must be to secure victory rather than chase a score
' there are lots of hypotheticals
you do n't know how the other two games will play out
clearly we 'll know the outcome before we start , which is an advantage on last year , ' he said
' we were in a similar position going into the italy game last year when we knew points difference would decide it
the challenge for us was to score as many points as we could

' it 's impossible to insulate the players from the results of the previous games because 82,000 people are shouting it at them when they run on to the field
' but the critical thing is to ensure the players are all completely focussed on their own preparations leading into the game
' by the time the ireland game finishes we 'll know what the objective is and will feed that through to the key decision - makers
' everyone else should be concentrating on their job to get a win for the team
