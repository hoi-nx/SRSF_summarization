attorney walker is is representing families of people who have fallen overboard on other cruises
he said that the industry must do more to ensure passenger safety
a ' ship overboard system ' could be installed , he said
this would alert the bridge immediately when there is a man overboard , greatly increasing chances of rescue
he told khou.com : ' this type of technology assists the cruise line in realising that a guest has gone overboard such that they can conduct a search and rescue assistance
' mr walker said that 90 per cent of cruise companies do not use this safety equipment .
