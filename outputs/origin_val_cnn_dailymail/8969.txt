britain 's richest woman kirsty bertarelli and her husband ernesto have left their neighbours ' apoplectic ' with plans for their home britain 's richest woman kirsty bertarelli does nât usually have to dig deep to get what she wants
when it came to extending the former miss uk âs london home , however , excavating a vast two - storey subterranean extension seemed the perfect solution
but neighbours in the exclusive street have been left feeling angry â even undermined â by the plan to create a family home for her , husband ernesto , a switzerland businessman , and their three children
they had raised concerns about the excavation possibly harming the property and adjoining buildings , and about the noise and upheaval caused by the work
adding to their ire , the council is to restrict such developments by the end of the year because of the disruption they cause â but the bertarellis got their application in just in time
planners at westminster this week approved the application , which will add a dining room , family room and cinema area on one of its levels and a kitchen , gym and laundry area on another

staffordshire - born mrs kirsty bertarelli , 43 , who was 17 when she was miss uk and also runner - up to miss world , is the richest woman in britain , worth nearly Â£ 9.75billion thanks to her marriage to ernesto , 49 , a harvard - educated biotechnology tycoon , according to the sunday times rich list 2014
they bought the victorian house 15 years ago for Â£ 5.5million
architects boundary space said the â double decker â basement is required because the house is no longer big enough for the family , who divide their time between london and homes in geneva and gstaad , switzerland
the upgrade will turn it into a â modern family home with appropriate facilities â
dubbed â iceberg homes â , such extensions are the fashionable but controversial solution for rich residents with limited space
the likes of andrew lloyd webber , nicole kidman and roman abramovich are among those who have all extended underground
according to the architects who designed the project , the ' double decker ' basement is required because the house is not big enough for the couple ' iceberg ' homes have become an increasingly popular way for the rich to expand their homes , without flouting planning restrictions ( this image of the house has been altered to protect the owners ' privacy ) some homes on the bertarellis â mews , one of the most affluent areas of the capital , already have basements , but several neighbours had instructed lawyers to fight the latest proposal
while it will be the third property to have a basement , the bertarellis would be the first to excavate to two storeys
staffordshire born ms kirsty bertarelli , who co-wrote girl band all saints ' worldwide smash black coffee , released her own album last year locals were also worried that the basement might be used as a recording studio â mrs kirsty bertarelli co-wrote girl band all saints â worldwide smash black coffee and released her own album last year â although the plans , approved on tuesday , show otherwise
one neighbour who wanted to remain anonymous said : â some of the owners around here are absolutely apoplectic about what âs in the pipeline
these kinds of developments cause huge disruption
â in the past few years there has already been one double basement conversion and a single basement
there will be hardly any earth left eventually
â the houses were never intended to be enormous family homes and the street is just about wide enough to fit two cars down it side - by - side
' it 's like we have rockstars coming to stay when they arrive , there 's an army of drivers and minders for the kids , it 's mayhem
' they are obviously going to spend a huge amount on a place they hardly live in , it 's staggering
but then the richest are oblivious to how your regular people live and we will have to deal with the consequences
' another neighbour said : â this is going to be a three - year project , they are going to completely gut the building and dig down , i have no idea how that âs going to be done without seriously disrupting us and affecting our day - to - day lives
â according to the architects who designed the project , the ' double decker ' basement is required because the house is not big enough for the couple
the planned upgrade , which will apparently take three years to complete , will turn it into a ' modern family home with appropriate facilities ' , they said
the architects added : ' the proposals reflect the client 's family has grown , and the accommodation is no longer conducive to modern family living
' ms kirsty bertarelli , 43 ( right ) , who won miss uk in 1998 ( left ) , bought the house with her husband 13 years ago for Â£ 5.5million in a report considered by the council , it emerged that there had been ' a large number of objections ' from residents in the mews , who were concerned the basement may be used as recording studios
the complaints were backed by local conservative councillor rachael robathan , who said : ' the size of the extension is disproportionate
' john walker , the wesminster city council 's operational director of development planning said in a report : ' there have been a large number of objections from other residents within the mews
' concern has been raised by residents that the use of the basements has not been specified , and that they might be used as recording studios
' they are concerned that the excavation of new basements is a risky construction process , with potential harm to the property and adjoining buildings
' ' iceberg ' homes became an increasingly popular way for the rich and famous to expand their homes , without flouting planning restrictions
ms kirsty bertarelli , 43 , who won miss uk in 1998 , bought the house with her husband 13 years ago for Â£ 5.5million but the london borough of kensington and chelsea became the first local authority in the country to introduce restrictions on the controversial subterranean developments
if the couple lived just a few streets away , their plans would not have been approved because of the ban on ' excessive ' two storey extensions
westminster is to introduce a similar policy to limit the size of basement extensions by the end of this year
speaking about the approved plan , council spokesman nick thompson said : ' this application was approved by committee on tuesday night
' we have a basement policy that is coming in very shortly which will restrict this type of development , as we recognise the disruption that residents in westminster are having to live with
' planning permission was granted with conditions that the excavation work can be carried out only between 8am and 6pm monday to friday
nobody was at the bertarellis â home for comment yesterday .
