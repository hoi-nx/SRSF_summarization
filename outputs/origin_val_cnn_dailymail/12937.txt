the uk 's metropolitan police has summoned five football fans to answer allegations of racism
it relates to an incident captured on camera , prior to chelsea 's european champions league match with paris saint-germain last month
in the french capital before the match an apparent group of chelsea fans are caught on camera , appearing to prevent a black man boarding the paris metro
the video , widely shared on social media , also depicted the group of men chanting : " we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it
" the man in the video was blocked several times from boarding the train and shoved off at least twice
he was later identified as souleymane , a 33 - year - old paris on his way home from work
london 's metropolitan police had appealed for help to identify those responsible but in a statement released wednesday , said five men were due in court later this month
it read : " on 10 march and 11 march , the metropolitan police served summonses on five men involved in incidents on the paris metro before the paris saint-germain v chelsea champions league fixture on tuesday 17 february
" they have been summonsed to appear at waltham forest magistrates ' court on wednesday , 25 march regarding a police application for football banning orders
" the authorities have not identified any of the alleged perpetrators
chelsea were quick to condemn the group , saying in a statement after the incident that the chanting was " abhorrent " and something that " has no place in football or society
" manager mourinho said he was " ashamed " by the flashpoint , while the club moved quickly to suspend the five men involved
it said they faced a life ban should they be found guilty
" i watched the image the next day , i did n't want to watch again , i watched only once , " mourinho told reporters a few days after the match in paris
" it is enough for me , it is sad enough for me
it is a humiliation for that gentleman , i imagine myself in that same situation , i want to go home after a day of work and a couple of guys they kick me out of my public transport
" a club spokesperson also confirmed that chelsea 's russian owner roman abramovich was " disgusted " by the incident whilst french president francois hollande personally spoke to souleymane
chelsea invited him to attend the return fixture at stamford bridge but he declined the offer
" i wo n't go , " he was quoted as saying by french radio station rtl
" they ca n't buy me with a little piece of paper
i 'm not a child
" i do n't want to sit in that stadium next to those people who pushed me
i still hear the voices of those people who pushed me because of the color of my skin
" football banning orders can last for between three and ten years , and any breach can result in a criminal offense , with a prison sentence of up to six months .
