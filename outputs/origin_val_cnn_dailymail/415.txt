usually as technicians , we look to give our clients the most suitable , beautiful hair colour , working with their skin tone , eye colour etc. to give them a look tailored perfectly to them
this colour on kim is none of the above but is very editorial , high fashion and certainly creates a statement
at some point in her life every woman needs to make the jump from brunette to blonde , although there are many variations it is important to remember when going for such an extreme blonde to consider the effects on your hairs condition , you will need to do regular treatments to keep it feeling healthy

at hob salons , we use wella professional products and would obtain this look by using the blondor lightening system
