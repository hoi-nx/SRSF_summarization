lose all nine , get rid of him , â he said
â that âs a bit of tongue in cheek , but it âs true
everybody would go away and say what a bad season it âs been
if we turn it around , what a great season
â i do nât have to defend myself to the owners
we all know in terms of where we are
â david sullivan and david gold are very disappointed in the run we âve had up to now
at the end of the day we âre still 10th
we âve still got 39 points
we âve still got nine games to go
â anything less than 10th is going to end up being hugely disappointing , and around eighth is massive progress for us
anything more than that would be a massive over-achievement for this squad
