the 2013 volkswagen jetta belonging to officer henry solis , 27 , of the lapd , was found a short distance from the site where salome rodriguez jr was gunned down early friday , but the cop remained at large
solis was off - duty at the time of the shooting and failed to report to work the next day

this afternoon , an arrest warrant was issued for the missing officer , who is considered armed and dangerous , according to a statement released by the lapd
andrew smith , am lapd spokesman , said solis was assigned to a station in the san fernando valley and had not completed his probationary period since joining the force last june
