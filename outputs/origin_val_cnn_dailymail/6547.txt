justice : mr davoud roshanaei 's attacker was sentenced to qesas , ' retribution in kind ' , and has now had his eye and ear surgically removed at a prison in karaj critique : an iranian human rights organisation has attacked the ' eye for an eye ' punishment , calling the practice ' barbaric ' ' we had a meeting with the forensic medicine and they will let us know once there is a doctor who is willing to carry out the sentence '
an international iranian human rights organisation based in norway has condemned the punishment , calling it ' barbaric '
