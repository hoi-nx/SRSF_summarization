israeli 's next prime minister -- whether incumbent benjamin netanyahu or labor party leader isaac herzog -- will be faced with a myriad of international and domestic crises amid deepening tensions with the united states , its closest ally
here are five key issues waiting in the new leader 's inbox after tuesday 's election
repairing relations with the united states there are any number of irritants -- from settlement construction to failed peace talks to israeli military action in gaza and lebanon -- which have long tested the alliance between washington and israeli
but ties have grown increasingly strained between president obama and benjamin netanyahu , playing out over the last several years in a series of awkward photo - ops , anonymous quotes in united states and israeli media and tense body language
relations hit a low point recently with benjamin netanyahu 's speech to us congress criticizing president obama 's policy toward iran about its nuclear program
repairing ties with the white house becomes easier if the next government is formed under isaac herzog , who has pledged to " restore intimacy and trust " with the leadership in washington
repairing ties becomes more difficult if benjamin netanyahu remains in office
for all its official praise for the " unshakable bonds " between the united states and israeli , the white house sees benjamin netanyahu as the problem
if benjamin netanyahu is re-elected , they will have to work with him
personal relations may be fraught now , but obama has never suggested watering down or delaying mostly military united states aid to israeli , which amounts to $ 3 billion a year
privately , however , united states officials have warned the level of washington 's political support for israeli with allies and at the united nations could be affected by benjamin netanyahu 's attitude toward the obama administration
confronting iran world powers are pushing toward a framework nuclear deal with iran before the march 31 deadline
the next prime minister will take office shortly before a july deadline for a final deal and will need to reach key understandings with washington on what security and diplomatic guarantees the united states will provide israeli if the deal goes forward
in addition , israeli will want input on what constitutes a violation of the deal and what would trigger punitive measures if iran reneges
if he remains in office , benjamin netanyahu 's differing perceptions of the threat posed by iran will undoubtedly come to a head as that deadline approaches
benjamin netanyahu has been clear he believes history has handed him the role of delivering the jewish state from an existential threat posed by tehran 's nuclear ambitions
he worries that the agreement that emerges will leave iran as a nuclear " threshold state " with the materials and expertise to quickly break out and build a nuclear weapon
isaac herzog has similarly said he would never accept a nuclear iran and stresses all options are on the table , including the military options
but he has suggested as prime minister he would work closer with the obama administration and other governments negotiating with iran to strengthen a deal , rather than try and block the deal through the us congress
beyond the nuclear deal , the next israeli will leader will face an increasingly emboldened iran in the region
beyond it 's longstanding support to hezbollah in lebanon and backing of the al-assad government in syria , iran has extended its involvement in iraq 's battle against isis and has provided support to houthis in yemen
israeli officials say iran is actively working to open up a front against israeli in the israeli - occupied golan heights
iran said in january an iran general had been killed in an israeli airstrike in the area
solving problems with palestinians the breakdown last april of peace talks led by secretary of state john kerry led the palestinians to take unilateral steps in international forums such as the united nations and the international criminal court
in response , israeli has halted delivering tax revenues , which it collects on the palestinians ' behalf , seriously squeezing their economy
now the palestinians are threatening to halt security cooperation with israeli
coupled with a lack of a viable peace process and a potential economic collapse of the palestinians authority , the lack of security coordination would present a total breakdown of cooperation between the two sides
the next israeli leader will need to stop this free fall before this dangerous cocktail of instability leads to further chaos and perhaps a third intifada
the differences between benjamin netanyahu and isaac herzog seem to be more style than substance
during the campaign , benjamin netanyahu has hedged on his longstanding support for a two - state solution , but has not abandoned the idea entirely
isaac herzog has pledged to restart the peace process , but has expressed skepticism about whether palestinians president abbas is a reliable partner
the new prime minister must also deal with an ever worsening humanitarian situation in gaza , where rebuilding has been slow after last summer 's operation protective edge
egypt has basically cut off the border , further squeezing the strip
while there has been little violence since last year 's war , hamas has not been demilitarized and another round of fighting could be just another matter of time
although hamas belongs to a unity government with abbas ' fatah party , abbas continues to exercise little influence over the group
addressing growing social inequality while israeli voters traditionally cite security issues as a driving factor , the high cost of living has emerged as a major focus in this election season
sky - high housing prices are of particular concern
last month , israeli 's state comptroller issued a report finding housing prices in the country rose by 55 % between 2008 and 2014
rising food prices are another key issue
in july 2011 , israeli saw a massive wave of social protests centering on the expensive housing market and food prices
dubbed the " cottage cheese " protests -- because of the rising cost of cottage cheese , a staple in many israeli pantry -- they were emblematic of a broader concern that benjamin netanyahu 's relentless focus on security issues was at the expense of domestic issues
polls indicate the growing frustration with the economy has resulted in a shift from benjamin netanyahu to isaac herzog
isaac herzog has pledged to spend 7 billion shekels ( about $ 1.75 billion united states ) on affordable housing , health care and other social programs for the middle class , which he called the " sandwich generation
" for the most part , benjamin netanyahu has not addressed the economy in his few campaign events , focusing more on his strong security credentials
in recent days , he pointed to a 5 % decrease in food prices and an increase in affordable housing during his tenure , but acknowledged that the rising costs of living and housing prices were not " fully addressed " by his government and promised to make the economy a top priority if re-elected
reversing israeli 's isolation on the world stage israeli 's next prime minister will need to repair israeli 's increasingly frayed ties with once - friendly countries and its deepening worldwide isolation
leading opposition candidate tzipi livni , who once served as benjamin netanyahu 's main peace negotiator , accused benjamin netanyahu of being responsible for a " diplomatic tsunami " against israeli
indeed , benjamin netanyahu 's aggressive style has been cited as a major factor in strained ties with the united states and european -- a perception caught in a hot - mic conversation between president obama and french president sarkozy in 2011 , in which sarkozy lamented he could n't " bear " benjamin netanyahu , calling him a " liar
" obama replied , " you 're fed up with him , but i have to deal with him even more often than you
" regardless of who is israeli 's next leader , israeli faces growing worldwide frustration over its policies towards the palestinians , particularly settlement construction
the eu , israeli 's largest trading partner , is in the process of canceling tax exemptions on israeli products made in settlements in the occupied west bank and is considering plans to label the origin of other products made in settlements
federica mogherini , the eu 's new foreign policy chief , is seeking a greater role in helping to mediate the israeli - palestinians conflict
in the absence of a viable peace process , several european nations have already recognized a palestinians state , with several more promising to consider such a move
this makes israeli ever more dependent on united states diplomatic support , including its veto at the united nations
washington has traditionally defended israeli against palestinians efforts to achieve recognition at the united nations and legal action at the international criminal court
and it has lobbied its european allies against sanctions on israeli exports
as with the united states , it would seem easier to repair these frayed ties under a isaac herzog - led government
if re-elected , benjamin netanyahu will have his work cut out for him
