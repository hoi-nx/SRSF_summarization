and then there was one
arsenal were victorious in monte carlo , as many thought they would be
they did nât win big enough to progress , however , as few thought they would do
well organised , disciplined , brave , resolute
the region may be famous for speculation and bold gambles , but jose mourinho would be proud of the side produced by his compatriot leonardo jardim
this was a pragmatic , impressive display against a team who knew they needed three goals and threw all they had at that task in the second half

ratings by rob draper in monaco it was horribly tense for monaco once ramsey scored arsenal âs second with 11 minutes to go â but , once again , in this competition wenger âs team lost it in the first leg
that third away goal at the emirates stadium was the killer
it was the one wenger âs players could not match
monaco knew they had done the hardest yards in london and ultimately settled for heroic defeat
it was like watching one of nick faldo âs fourth - day specials
they played to par , laid up at the big one , did nât take the course on , and won
as arsenal threw more at it with the minutes slipping away , monaco pressed forward and substitute yannick ferreira-carrasco nipped one across the face of goal that could have ended the contest there and then
instead , arsenal were left with hope right until the end , a goal short of the last eight
it is the hope that does for you in the end , of course
it probably would have hurt less to have lost both legs
the goal that brought arsenal to the brink of one of the greatest fightbacks in champions league history came in the 79th minute after theo walcott hit a post with a side - footed shot
a rare moment of blind panic saw full back layvin kurzawa clear horribly straight to ramsey
he took a touch and struck it low into the far corner
cue pandemonium in the closing stages , not least when referee svein oddvar moen , from norwegian , signalled a generous period of five minutes additional time
yet , really , arsenal did little with it
they lumped it in , monaco hoofed it out
predictably , monaco âs hoofs were better than arsenal âs lumps
it really is nât their game
nor is the high - tempo , high - energy , gung - ho rollercoaster that was tottenham âs famous comeback against inter in the san siro , a repeat of which may just have rattled the french side
four goals and a goalkeeper down at half - time , tottenham pulled it back to 4 - 3 and would surely have drawn level had they not run out of time
giroud scored in the first half at the stade louis ii to give arsenal hope of pulling off a comeback in their last - 16 tie the french striker picked his spot from a tight angle to give arsenal the lead over monaco in the last 16 second leg monaco 's defenders on the line can not stop giroud 's 36th - minute shot from hitting the roof of the net giroud 's goal left arsenal needing two more to progress in the remaining 55 minutes in the french principality yet they had bale in the ranks that night
arsenal have lovely passers and schemers but nobody who is going to terrify a back four as bale did
the best they could offer was giroud trying to pretend he was marouane fellaini , with ozil in the michael carrick role
monaco lapped up his timid floaters
a more furious approach might have disturbed them , but arsenal lacked that verve
equally , monaco âs centre halves , wallace and abdennour , were exceptional â a different league from the inter team that tottenham faced
so it is now down to manchester city , the last premier league team standing , to restore english pride and claim a place in the champions league quarter - finals
they trail 2 - 1 with a return leg in barcelona âs nou camp
nobody is holding their breath
they were the rank outsiders going into these rematches
ramsey came off the bench to score arsenal 's second in the 79th minute to set up a grandstand finish ramsey celebrates his goal with per mertesacker to pull arsenal within one goal of pulling off an unlikely comeback laurent koscielny celebrates ramsey 's goal as arsenal pushed their opponents all the way in their last - 16 contest ramsey 's strike in the 79th minute was the 300th goal in european competition that arsenal have scored under wenger
england did not have representation beyond the second round in 2013 , either , but twice in three years will be a bitter pill to swallow
arsenal were the better team last night but then they had to be
they had significant levels of possession in the second half without really threatening goalkeeper danijel subasic for long periods
for monaco to progress on away goals appears close but , once again , arsenal deceive
they were never in a winning position , on aggregate , in the 180 minutes of the tie
arsenal grew into the game after a flat opening 15 minutes enlivened only by a cross from hector bellerin that giroud headed wide
santi cazorla , whose heat map is shown above , was at the centre of most of arsenal 's attacking play
click here for match zone sanchez goes down in the monaco penalty area after being pursued by nabil dirar arsenal 's chilean forward sanchez is booked by referee svein oddvar moen for simulation the yellow card given to arsenal striker sanchez for diving after 41 minutes was a poor decision by norwegian referee svein oddvar moen
maybe the contact was nât enough for a penalty but it was nât a dive
you can see what sanchez thought of the referee âs decision ! from there , however , the game began to progress along familiar lines , arsenal in the ascendancy , monaco retreating to massed ranks of stout defence
for a while it looked as if they were more than capable of holding out â monaco are a tight defensive unit with that most old - fashioned of qualities , a couple of big units who do nât mind putting a foot in â but arsenal got a breakthrough after 36 minutes
it was welbeck who set up the goal , driving forward and slipping his final pass to giroud , who was left with only danijel subasic to beat
giroud âs shot was blocked , but the ball rebounded and struck him on the shoulder
with danijel subasic stranded on the floor , giroud reacted quickest and after scanning the immediate area , seized on the loose ball , rifling it into the roof of the net with monaco âs covering defenders helpless
after his travails in the first leg â hooked by wenger to utter derision , having missed enough chances to put arsenal in the quarter - finals â this was a perfect response
he had at least guaranteed to outstrip the two marks out of ten he previously received from french newspaper lâequipe
just two minutes later , arsenal could have been further ahead
alexis sanchex hit a cross which was cleared under pressure from giroud and fell to welbeck whose shot was blocked , sprawling , by abdennour
even then , it spun and almost squeaked over the line as danijel subasic scrambled to recover
sanchez was booked for diving , which seemed harsh â it did nât look like a foul , but not a dive either â and wenger may take a dim view privately of ozil âs decision to swap shirts with kondogbia at half - time
giroud rises highest in the monaco penalty area to unleash a header towards goal which just went wide of the far post ozil swaps shirts with monaco 's kondogbia at half - time at the stade louis ii monaco goalkeeper danijel subasic makes a save from giroud during the first half of the second leg clash in monaco real madrid , porto , bayern munich , paris saint-germain , monaco , atletico madrid wednesday : barcelona ( 2 ) vs manchester city ( 1 ) ; borussia dortmund ( 1 ) vs juventus ( 2 ) true , it was at kondogbia âs request , but it hardly fitted in with the cold determination required to conjure victory against a team that had not conceded three goals at home since 2011
sure enough , one of kondogbia âs first acts of the second half was to go in late on santi cazorla , provoking a scream that could be heard all around the stade louis ii that was a different kind of souvenir to take home
from the free - kick ozil âs dipper was flicked over by danijel subasic , in no mood to return any favours
