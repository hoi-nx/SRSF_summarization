furious parents have attacked a school 's ' ridiculous ' uniform policy after dozens of pupils were put in isolation for refusing to remove charity ribbons and badges
students at grange school , in runcorn , cheshire , were kept out of lessons today after they refused to remove yellow ribbons and daffodils supporting the marie curie cancer charity
head barry carney defended the decision , saying the school selected one charity to support each year and could n't be seen to prefer one cause over another , but parents branded it ' pathetic '
student lily gaynor , 16 , said that up to 70 students from grange school , cheshire , had been taken out of lessons ahead of their gcses for refusing to remove the charity pins pupil lily gaynor alerted a local newspaper to the student 's plight by calling them from isolation
she estimated that between 60 and 70 students had been removed from classes
the 16 - year - old said : ' we have been taken out of lessons before our gcses because we wo nât take off our charity badges
' we âve got cancer badges and ribbons on our blazers and they âre saying it is nât part of school uniform and it âs singling out some charities over others
' we âve been here about an hour
they âre planning on keeping us here all day
it jeopardises our learning and we âve got exams soon
' corinne versleys , whose daughter caitlin mulchrane is among those in isolation , said : ' the school is putting children in the isolation unit for wearing those flowers
' i think it âs absolutely ridiculous - all it is is a little flower
' the majority of kids wearing them are dealing with family members with cancer and they âre being told to remove them
i think it âs absolutely pathetic
' the marie curie daffodil appeal has been running every march since 1986
supporters are encouraged to donate in return for a daffodil badge or ribbon which they can wear
support : pupils were wearing these flowers and yellow ribbons given out by the marie curie cancer charity during march as part of a fundraising drive which last year raised Â£ 8.26million last year the campaign , which is supported by the likes of actors olivia coleman and dominic west , helped to raise Â£ 8.26 million , funding 413,000 hours of nursing care
despite criticism , barry carney , the head of grange school , said he was simply applying the school 's uniform policy , which was available online ' for all to see '
he told the liverpool echo : ' each year we have a nominated charity which we call the head boy and the head girl âs charity
this year it happens to be the teenage cancer trust
' a number of students have been wearing some badges which are not permitted according to the rules of the school , which are pretty clear
' when we asked students to remove these badges there has been a small number who have dragged their heels and said because of personal circumstances they want to show their support
' he said he has spoken to these pupils and suggested organising a fundraising event to support the charity , rather than wearing a ribbon or badge
he added that the school holds plenty of charity events , and has raised Â£ 1,000 for the teenage cancer charity in the past year , with an open door cafe planned next thursday
he said the school was contemplating having more than one nominated charity next year .
