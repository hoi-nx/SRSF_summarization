eoin reddan knows the six nations â staggered final - day format leaves second - placed ireland poised to be agonisingly pipped at the post in the same way as in 2007 , but says they just need to deal with it
ireland handsomely beat italy eight years ago on the final saturday of the tournament but france , playing last that day , went into their game knowing a 24 - point win over scotland would bag the title
they won by 27 , a late try denying eddie oâsullivan âs side
now it âs leaders england who have the scheduling advantage , as their game against france this weekend starts at 5pm following ireland âs 2.30 kick - off in scotland
eoin reddan ( centre ) knows his side are likely to miss out on the six nations title after defeat to wales however , eoin reddan accepts the rules are the rules , claiming it would be â crazy â to be critical of the organisers just a few days before the curtain comes down on the 2015 campaign
â it is the way it is and it presents different challenges , â said the back - up scrum half
â the teams that play early , they have got the mental battle of having to win the game and push on and the teams that play late have a target they can chase
â it âs a flip of a coin whether you say that makes it more interesting or less interesting
tv rights would probably make the conversation null and void , the amount of money tv provides for six nations
the fact that they all want to watch three games is probably the real answer and there is no other way they âre going to do it
â wales dash ireland 's grand slam hopes irish players make a last ditch effort to get the ball over the line during the six nations clash in cardiff eoin reddan came off the bench in rome in 2007 , a day when long - serving hooker rory best and current assistant coach simon easterby started in the pack
ireland were 34 points to the good with time almost up only for denis leamy to tap a penalty in the hope of adding to his team âs eight - try tally
instead , they were turned over and italy scored a converted try through roland de marigny to crucially help france âs cause
eoin reddan has nât forgotten its consequences
â i remember us conceding a try late on that lost us the trophy , which we should nât have conceded
we should have beaten italy by that extra bit and we would have won the trophy
simon zebo is upended during his sides ' loss to wales which ended their grand slam hopes â it âs galling , but you do know the rules
you do know what time the games are on
â we âre not really stepping back trying to judge the competition because it âs not really going to change , is it ? â especially for me , a few days out from this one , to be reflecting that the competition is a bit â off â would be crazy
at the end of the day , we âre playing second and we âre going to have a job to do from the start and that job may change as the game goes on or it may not , â added eoin reddan
â the way to win a title is probably not to think about a title , â he added
â it â s frustrating listening to us because you want to grasp on to the fact that we want to go and win the title and all that , but we have a responsibility where there is no margin for error , no margin for anything
scott williams ( bottom ) is congratulated by his welsh team mates as they defeated ireland last saturday â we ca nât even live in that world ( of title talk ) so that is why we give you what we give you in terms of having to win the game first , because if you take your eye off that for a second there is no championship , there is no win
â treating scotland as if there is nât a championship on the line is the key
realising how good they are , realising their threats and treating them just as you would if this game did nât need to be a points margin ( win ) , treating them like that and keeping it on for the whole game
â there were games last year , like against italy , which got us over the line in the overall
it was 12 points in the last three minutes
that is just about going and going and going again and not getting too carried away with the big picture , just doing your own little thing a bit harder , a bit faster and just keeping that mindset going all the time
â we have the responsibility of letting people dream and think big but our responsibility is to focus on the small little things and keep doing it to the end
â ireland need to better england 's score by four points if they want to win the coveted six nations crown
