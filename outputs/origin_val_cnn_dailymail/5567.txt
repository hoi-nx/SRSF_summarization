the 76 - year - old said : ' i was with tony on iraq
they told us it was n't regime change
' now tony , unfortunately is still in to that
i mean the way he 's going now , he now wants to invade everywhere
' he should put a white coat on with a red cross and let 's start the bloody crusades again
' every time [ people ] watch the television where their families are worried , their kids are being killed and murdered and rockets firing on all these people , that 's what radicalises them
' the event was just days before miliband announced john would be joining the labour as a special adviser on climate change , the daily telegraph reported

the move was backed by alastair campbell , tony 's former spin doctor , who also pledged to join the effort to get miliband elected
