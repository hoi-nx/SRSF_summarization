' we invite avedon in both as a creator and a character
' avedon made his name shooting fashion models for magazines like harper 's bazaar and vogue , but ' family affairs ' stems mainly from his work covering the 1976 presidential election for rolling stone magazine
originally planning to spotlight the campaigns of incumbent gerald ford and challenger jimmy carter , avedon soon realized he wanted to include a wider array of the era 's most influential people , perelman said
men in suits comprise nearly all his subjects , distinguished by variations in their stances and expressions : defense secretary donald rumsfeld , former california gov. ronald reagan , consumer advocate ralph nader and nfl commissioner pete rozelle , to name a few

avedon died in 2004 , before selfies entered popular culture , but even he was n't immune to the concept
as a teen , avedon used a mirror to take a picture of himself and high school classmate james baldwin , who later went on to literary fame
that photo is on display as well
' family affairs ' is based on an exhibition held last year at the israel museum in jerusalem
the philadelphia site will be the only u.s. venue for the images , which are on view through august 2 .
