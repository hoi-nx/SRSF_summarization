the prince has made an impassioned and personal plea to stop plastic being dumped in the oceans
prince said that he was â haunted â and â horrified â by the issue which needed to be solved for the sake of future generations
â speaking as a grandfather with a new grandchild due to appear in this world in a month âs time , i think we probably owe it to everyone else âs grandchildren to grasp that solution , â he said
â one issue that we absolutely can not ignore is that of the increasing quantity of plastic waste in the marine environment , â he said
â i was horrified to learn that , according to recent research , we collectively allow as much as eight million tonnes of plastic to enter the oceans every year
â today , almost half of all marine mammals now have plastic in their gut and i know i am not the only person haunted by the tragic images of seabirds , particularly albatrosses , that have been found dead , washed up on beaches after mistaking a piece of plastic for a meal

he said we had to move quicker to a circular economy â whereby â materials are recovered , recycled and reused instead of created , used and then thrown away â
the conference was attended by david miliband , former foreign secretary and co-chairman of the global ocean commission , which helped stage the event
since 2008 , the mail has campaigned to get rid of plastic bags , many of which make their way into landfill and oceans
the banish the bag campaign secured a major victory in june last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in england
the charge , which will be introduced by october , is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to Â£ 100million a year for good causes , including a raft of green clean - up groups that tackle litter in green spaces , rivers and beaches
similar charging schemes in ireland have led to a fall of around 90 per cent in the distribution of the bags
environmental campaigners say the carriers , each used for just 20 minutes on average , take up to 1,000 years to degrade
in the meantime , they blight the environment and many are ingested by wildlife , in particular marine mammals and sea birds which can suffer lingering deaths as a result
as well as the serious harm to wildlife , they blight britain âs coastline , with some 70 bags littering every mile
the prince and duchess arrived in washington for a three - day visit to the country on tuesday night
first they visited monuments to president lincoln and martin luther king jnr in the heart of the capital city
at king âs memorial they were joined by leading figures from the us civil rights movement , including jesse jackson and congressman john lewis , who organised the famous selma march in 1965 which has recently been dramatised in the oscar - nominated movie selma
as they climbed the steps to lincoln âs memorial , prince told a well - wisher that he was â trying to work out at the moment â .
