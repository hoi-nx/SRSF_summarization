england came at us with huge pace and they moved the ball really well

' but i thought we showed great character getting back into the game
we put pressure on them and started to play our own game
' we got the off - loads going and that 's how we got our try - we moved the ball and played quickly
' next week is a massive test and it 's important we do the same against ireland that we did in that second quarter against england
