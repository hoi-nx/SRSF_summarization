lewis hamilton celebrates his australia grand prix win after he finished ahead of team - mate nico rosberg the british formula one star appeared in good spirits as he was pictured at sydney airport on monday â there is a rule i think ( former fia president ) max mosley put in that in the event of a particular team or engine supplier doing something magic , which mercedes have done , the fia can level up things
mercedes have done a first - class job
we need to change things a little bit now
â what we should have done was frozen the mercedes engine and leave everybody else to do what they want so they could have caught up
we should support the fia to make changes
â the indications were that the fia , the sport âs rule - makers , will not rush to act on ecclestone âs words , which may have been intended primarily to soothe red bull , whose motorsport adviser marko said they might walk away in light of rules that â will kill the sport â

you were 30 seconds ahead
so i know how it must have felt back then
â â he had nobody behind pushing him
at least i âve got my team - mate , who i was really racing
i do nât remember that ever being the case with red bull
â ouch , even though mark webber did sometimes push sebastian vettel , and not all of the germany âs championships were comfortable , with his first title coming down to a four - way decider in abu dhabi
lewis hamilton added : â if you want to put someone in the same car , there is no doubt where i would be finishing
people say it âs all the car
well , it âs a big team that built this car
i âm the one who has to get in and extract the best from it
there has never been a driver that has won the championship that has nât had a great car that year
there âs nobody who had a marussia and won the world championship , is there ? fangio still had a great car
