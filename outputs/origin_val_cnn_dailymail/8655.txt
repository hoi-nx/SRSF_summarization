clarke â who joins allan border , steve waugh and ricky ponting ( twice ) in the pantheon of australia âs cricket world cup - winning captains â scored a classy 74 in 72 balls in his final one - day international before quitting the format to focus on tests
and with australia overhauling the new zealanders â disappointing total of 183 with seven wickets and nearly 17 overs to spare , he went out in style , watched by an melbourne crowd of 93,013 â an official world record for a single day âs cricket

' phillip hughes used to party as good as any of them so i 'll make sure we drink two ( beers ) at a time tonight , one for hughesy and one for us
' phillip hughes would have approved of the manner in which australia crushed their trans - tasman cousins , even if the neutrals were deprived of the climax which the tournament â if it âs honest with itself â so badly needed

but james faulkner , named man of the match for figures of 3 for 36 , removed taylor and the big - hitting corey anderson in the first over of the batting powerplay , and wicketkeeper luke ronchi fell in the next , to the outstanding starc
elliott went on to make 83 , but new zealand âs last seven fell for just 33 in 10 overs
after eight successive games on their smaller , less intimidating , home grounds , they never came to terms with either the occasion or the relentlessness of the australian attack
the dismissal of martin guptill , who had hammered west indies for an unbeaten 237 from 163 balls in the quarter - finals , summed up their day : trying to dab a gentle off - break from glenn maxwell through backward point , he was bowled for 15
australia lost aaron finch to trent boult in the second over of the reply , but for new zealand âs bowlers that was as good as it got
david warner hit 45 in 46 balls , before clarke joined smith â his heir apparent â to add 112
