darnell furlong , 19 , was removed at half - time against crystal palace and replaced by a 36 - year - old with flu , having been given a terrible time by yannick bolasie

darnell furlong ( right ) finds it tough going against glenn murray and was substituted at half - time charlie austin tries to point adel taarabt in the right direction but qpr look to be heading down fighting relegation all season , qpr would have been one of the easiest teams to make

there are some clubs â and tim sherwood has proved that aston villa are one â where an underachieving group can be energised
that is nât the case at qpr
the best players were playing and were nât good enough
it really was no more complicated than that
austin ( left ) looks dejected with team - mates steven caulker and flu - victim clint hill , who replaced darnell furlong fernandes will be in no doubt now that the players at loftus road are not good enough to stay up
