here sportsmail 's rob draper casts his eye over roy hodgson 's side and their italian hosts
england ( 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 ) joe hart 7 no blame attached for the goal and a very good save from eder on 51 minutes
one of the positives for england
clyne 5 ( kyle walker 45 ) always willing to offer an outlet in attack but the system left him exposed in defensive areas and switched at half time

kieran gibbs 6 ( bertrand 88 ) like clyne , often looked lost without support from a wide midfielder

phil jones 4.5 ( michael carrick 44 ) when michael carrick came on to relieve him from the holding midfield role as it was though he 'd escaped purgatory
static and beaten embarrassingly easily for the goal â but better , unsurprisingly as centre half
two italian fans share a smile ahead of the international friendly between italy and england in turin england and manchester united defender chris smalling hassles italy 's eder for the ball jordan henderson 6 ( ryan mason 74 ) scurried here and there with plenty of intent but little guile
did n't ever really settle into the system
fabian delph 5.5 ( andros townsend 70 ) much the same
harried and was strong in tackles but too often was a man chasing around in search of a game plan
wayne rooney 7 the flashes of class england showed invariably came from him ; shot off the bar on 22 minutes , a glorious cross field ball for theo walcott on 27 minutes
tested gianluigi buffon in second half â perhaps should have scored on 72 minutes

looked eager to impress with no opportunity to do so until late on when he had strikes to trouble gianluigi buffon

subs michael carrick 8 provided much better distribution that phil jones could ; baffling why he did n't start
england were much more fluid with him on the pitch
kyle walker 6 exposed almost immediately when eder drifted past him to set up scoring chance but improved from thereon in

incisive and ful of running even though on left

contributed to england 's best spell ryan bertrand 6 southampton and italy striker graziano pelle ( left ) plays the ball ahead of the oncoming defender phil jones ( right ) italy : ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) gianluigi buffon 7.5 rarely called on initially but fine save from the wayne rooney striker on 72 minutes and then again on 80minutes
ranocchia 6.5 part of an immaculate back three for an hour â suddenly looked a little vulnerable as the changes unsettled italy
leonardo bonucci 7 looked imperious until the changes in the last 15 minutes left italy looking a little exposed
graziano pelle scores the opening goal of the game with a glancing header across the england box on tuesday night the ball nestles into the bottom corner as italy take the lead and england defenders watch on helplessly giorgio chiellini 7.5 ( moretti 72 ) beat jagielka to deliver glorious wrong - footed cross for graziano pelle goal
was great in defence before being wrong footed for the wayne rooney chance a minute before being taken off
allesandro florenzi 6.5 ( abate 60 ) solid throughout â was full of running when england 's midfield allowed him space in the first half
marco parolo 7 able and capable in possession â well on top of england 's midfield for much of the game
