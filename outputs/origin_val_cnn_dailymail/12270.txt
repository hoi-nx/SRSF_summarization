new york a federal jury wednesday found naseer guilty of plotting with al qaeda to bomb a shopping center in 2009 in manchester , england , the u.s. attorney for the eastern district of new york said
naseer , 28 , was convicted on three criminal violations : providing material support to al qaeda , conspiring to provide material support for al qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence
the manchester plot was allegedly part of a three - pronged plan that included attacks on the new york subway system and on a newsroom in copenhagen
the new york plot allegedly originated with zazi , who is believed to have corresponded with the same al qaeda contact as naseer
zazi pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and was the first witness in naseer 's trial
naseer , a pakistani national , was in the britain on a student visa at the time of his arrest
among the evidence presented , prosecutors pointed out that naseer had dropped out of classes after only a week
naseer had no intention of completing his studies because " that was never the plan , " assistant u.s. attorney zainab ahmad argued , saying that naseer applied for a student visa as a means of entering the country to carry out the attack
naseer maintained throughout the two - week trial that he was innocent , repeatedly denying all charges and insisting that he was in the britain to find a wife , not to plan an attack
he told jury members that prosecutors were only able to produce circumstantial evidence , with no witnesses offering direct information of naseer 's role in the alleged plot
they did not offer any outright proof of any link to al qaeda or any other terrorist organization , he argued
naseer 's arrest in england was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in britain
he was extradited in january 2013 .
