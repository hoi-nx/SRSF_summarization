as a tory mp in the 1980s proctor had a special talent
some mps courted attention through their colourful personal lives
others with their extremist political views
proctor found controversy in both
in an age before politicians were out of the closet â and when the age of consent for homosexual sex was 21 â it was an open secret in westminster that the impeccably turned - out proctor was gay
but his political downfall in 1987 â accompanied by newspaper headlines of teenage rent boys and spanking parties â was one of the most dramatic scandals in recent memory as he pleaded guilty to charges of gross indecency after repeated public denials that he had done anything wrong
proctor , former tory mp , had his home searched by police as part of a probe into historic allegations of child sex abuse downfall : proctor on his way to magistrates ' court in 1987 to answer charges of gross indecency as for his politics , his views on immigration were considered so far beyond the pale that while serving as an mp he was beaten unconscious at a demonstration in scarborough , had red paint thrown over him when addressing coventry university , and burning papers were thrust through the letter box of his tiny terrace home in billericay
he shared the house with his feisty mother hilda
â i âm the only woman in his life , â she once told reporters
it was nât quite true
proctor , who became mp for basildon in the 1979 general election which swept mrs margaret thatcher to power , was a lifelong fan of the iron lady
proctor was forced to deny any knowledge of the abuse and deaths of three young boys to the media but within weeks of being elected he was irritating her and the tory high command with his strident views on migration , backing a motion calling for a ban on immigration from commonwealth countries
urging the abolition of the commission for racial equality , he demanded the forcible repatriation of 50,000 â coloured â immigrants a year , proposing a Â£ 7,000 payment to encourage them to go
he was also one of seven tory mps who rebelled against legislation allowing parents to exempt their children from corporal punishment in schools
and he attempted to halt the growing tide of political correctness by launching a campaign to save the golliwog
born and brought up in scarborough where he went to the local grammar , scarborough high school for boys , he eschewed his christian name , keith , and always went by his second name , harvey
he studied history at the university of york , where he had his first of many brushes with notoriety
as chairman of the university tory association he invited enoch powell , who had been sacked from the conservative shadow cabinet after his â rivers of blood â speech on immigration , to make a keynote address
there was a predictable uproar and the meeting became a riot
it was a sign of things to come â whenever proctor addressed a university as an mp he was the subject of angry and often violent protests
after university he worked for the tory research department in old queen street near the houses of parliament
by the time he became mp for basildon in 1979 , he was already a darling of the tory right as a leading figure in the notorious monday club , a lobby group for the tory but considered so extreme that in 2001 the party severed all links with it
the group advocated voluntary or assisted repatriation for non-white immigrants , capital punishment , and denounced nelson mandela as a criminal and terrorist who deserved to be locked up
tall and gangly â he was once described in the commons as a loping greyhound â the softly spoken proctor revelled in the notoriety of being one of the most outspoken voices on the tory backbenches
on wednesday , detectives arrived at belvoir castle ( pictured ) near grantham â the seat of the duke â where proctor has lived since 2003 , and searched the 16,000 - acre estate when labour - controlled basildon council passed a motion of no confidence in him as the local mp because of his views on race , he was delighted
after the re-drawing of political boundaries jeopardised his majority in basildon , he was selected for the safe neighbouring seat of billericay , which he won convincingly at the 1983 election
proctor was loved by his local party because of his uncompromising views
he called for the suspension of grants to students if they lacked self - discipline and for administrative and other non-academic parts of universities to be sold to the private sector
his devoted tory followers in basildon and billericay were oblivious to his homosexuality
while he was out with political friends he never discussed his private life
â it âs not relevant to my work as an mp , â was his stock reply
fiercely ambitious , proctor was consistently overlooked for ministerial preferment by margaret thatcher because of views on immigration which even some tories viewed as racist
the whips , in charge of party discipline , also feared his sexuality would be an issue that would return to haunt them
the first story to emerge in public about it was in 1981 , when woods , a flamboyant art dealer who was his boyfriend , had left the mp âs london flat after a row and proctor refused to let him back in
the fracas led to a court appearance in which woods claimed he was in a relationship â albeit it a very tempestuous one â with the mp
proctor repudiated the claim and got away with it
lurid allegations surfaced in a sunday newspaper in september 1986 claiming he had organised gay spanking sessions with canes and teenage rent boys in his flat â allegations he dismissed as monstrous
proctor resigned after he was charged over spanking parties with teenage rent boys at his flat and lost his house and flat , before signing on the dole he was embarrassed again soon afterwards when woods , who remained his long - term lover , was found in his underpants by the police outside the mp âs apartment
he admitted that he â loved â proctor but insisted the relationship was not sexual
days later a story emerged of how a naked arab boy had been found under proctor âs hotel bed on a tunisian holiday
when police eventually charged him over the teenage rent boys in his flat , proctor bowed to the inevitable and announced he was standing down as an mp , admitting to a charge of gross indecency and accepting a fine of Â£ 1,450
he had to sell his house in the constituency and the flat in london and was on the dole for a year
but with the help of a Â£ 2,000 government grant and friends â including jeffrey archer , michael heseltine and other mps who between them raised Â£ 75,000 on his behalf â he turned from politics to hosiery , opening a shop , proctor âs , in richmond selling shirts , gaudy waistcoats , silk ties , and natty cuff links
infamously , he hung a sign in the shop window saying : â shirt lifters will not be prosecuted
â initially business seemed to be flourishing â john major , when he became prime minister , ditched his marks & spencer shirts in favour of proctor âs more elegant wares â and he opened a second shop in knightsbridge
but he could never escape his past
one day in 1992 , two men walked into the richmond shop
one of them demanded : â have you any boys for tying up before you spank them , â and then the men started punching him
after a Â£ 2,000 government grant he set up a chain of shops under his name selling shirts , ties and cuff links proctor âs friend neil hamilton , then a government minister and in the shop at the time , came to proctor âs aide and received a broken nose for his pains
from then on , the shops went into decline
they were forced into liquidation in 2000 and proctor disappeared beneath the radar only to re-emerge in 2004 at the duke of rutland âs ancestral seat , the gothic belvoir castle , where he is the events manager
the 68 - year - old proctor now lives in a large country house on the 18,000 - acre estate near grantham â the birthplace of his heroine margaret thatcher
a house now being searched by the police
