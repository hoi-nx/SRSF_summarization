a charity volunteer who set up a tripwire in a dark hallway to make her neighbour fall down two flights of stairs has walked free from court
janet pearson , 58 , tied wire across the top of a staircase at the luxury apartments she shared with former model kari anderson in lytham , lancashire , in the early hours of the morning
a court heard she knew the 42 - year - old would n't see the trap due to the hallway light being out and she was left with serious injuries to her face , neck and back
janet pearson , 58 , ( left ) was handed a suspended sentence today after she deliberately set up a tripwire and caused her neighbour , kari anderson , ( right ) to fall down a set of stairs , injuring her face , neck and back judge shetty at chester crown court described the incident as ' malicious and pre-meditated ' and today handed pearson a 12 - month jail term , suspended for two years
the jury was told the neighbours had repeatedly argued over various matters and there had been ' a number of issues ' dating back to summer 2013
prosecutor kimberley obrusik explained that in one instance pearson put her belongings in a storage cupboard which miss kari anderson paid to have installed
the former model and law graduate also claims pearson moved in a homeless man , who hurled abuse at her and put cigarette butts in her flowerpots
she has previously accused her neighbour of being jealous of her and described seeing pearson sitting in an upstairs window - overlooking the driveway - and watching her go about her business
miss kari anderson also noticed she changed her appearance and dress style to seemingly look like her - comparing the situation to the film ' single white female '
kari anderson , a former model , was left with serious bruising to her face and chest ( pictured ) she also noticed that large amounts of her mail were going missing , including bank statements and business letters , from the shared letterbox in the apartment complex
meanwhile pearson accused the ex-model of cutting the wire of some fairy lights outside her flat
the court heard how things came to a head on the morning of january 21 , 2013 , when miss kari anderson tripped over the wire laid by pearson , who requires a stick to walk
miss kari anderson , who has lived in a penthouse flat with her 25 - year - old son directly above pearson for 15 years , told the court : ' i was carrying a bin bag in one hand and an overnight bag in the other
' the lights had n't worked since november the year before so i was being careful
i felt something sharp on my shin and that was the last thing i remember
' i fell down two flights of stairs
i was lying at the bottom crying because i 'd hurt my wrist really badly
i have a fused wrist and it bent backwards
it ca n't do that and i still remember the pain
' i could taste blood
it was on my face and in my hair
' as i walked back up the stairs , i used my phone to see what had caused me to fall
i shone the light at the top of the stairs and then i saw the wire
' her door was closed on the wire to keep it in place
' the mother - of - two , who owns a property business and a separate beauty company , was so severely injured that she needed surgery following the incident
she added : ' i damaged my neck as well as my nose , left check bone , jaw , several teeth and left eye socket
' i 'm unable to open my mouth wide enough for the dentists to deal with these problems
after the fall miss kari anderson grabbed her phone light to see what she had tripped over and spotted the wire ' i now have to have corrective surgery to my right wrist
it 's impossible for me to walk long distances or stand for long periods
' because of all my injuries , i 've been off work since the incident
' miss kari anderson told the court she had also been prescribed medication for anxiety and had been left Â£ 12,000 out of pocket as a result of having to hire extra staff to help her manage her businesses
following a two - day trial at preston crown court , a jury dismissed pearson 's claims that she had no reason to set a tripwire
they took just three hours and 25 minutes to find her guilty of causing actual bodily harm
judge shetty , sentencing , said : ' you knew that miss kari anderson often left in the early hours of the morning and you knew that because the hallway light was n't working , it would be dark when she left
' you put a wire across the top of the stairs to act as an improvised tripwire
miss kari anderson lived in a penthouse flat with her 25 - year - old son directly above pearson for 15 years at the exclusive clifton drive in lytham - where a three - bedroom flat can sell for Â£ 450,000 ( pictured ) ' when the emergency services were called you wasted no time in trying to dismantle the scene to cover up your actions
' he also made pearson the subject of a two - year supervision order , issued her with a six - month curfew and told her she must pay Â£ 4,000 in compensation to miss kari anderson
' her injuries could have been much more severe , ' judge shetty added
' you wanted miss kari anderson to suffer to any extent to try and teach her some kind of lesson
' i watched you throughout the trial and observed you give lie after lie
you showed no remorse then and you show no remorse now
' properties on the exclusive clifton drive in lytham , where the defendant and her victim lived , have sold for as much as Â£ 450,000 for a three - bedroom flat and Â£ 1.65million for a detached house .
