mr david coburn âs comment was made during a telephone conversation , in which he spoke about his appearance on bbc show the big immigration debate on tuesday
he claimed that mr yousaf was supposed to be on the show , and said : â yousaf , or as i call him , abu hamza , did nât seem to turn up
â challenged by the mail during the conversation , mr david coburn said the remark was intended to be private
however , there had been no prior agreement that the discussion was off - the - record
glasgow - born mr yousaf was yesterday alerted to the comment by the mail , and replied : â i am utterly appalled , disgusted and hurt by the comments allegedly made by mep
â this is islamophobia of the worst kind
if this was shouted at a muslim on the street none of us would tolerate it , the fact this abuse has come from an elected member of the european parliament is completely unacceptable
' nigel farage has been plagued by accusations of leading a racist party and this outburst from david coburn mep shows that ukip are not just a party with a few rotten apples but rotten to the core
â if nigel farage is serious about ukip being a party that will not tolerate xenophobia in any form then i expect david coburn to be expelled from ukip immediately and have written to nigel farage in that vein
â he added : â david coburn has been exposed making islamophobic remarks and should do the honourable thing and resign

' i am sure you will wish to distance ukip from such attitudes and i note you have taken disciplinary action against those found to make such prejudiced remarks in the past
â i therefore call on you to immediately suspend david coburn while you investigate this matter and if he is indeed found to guilty of making these remarks then i expect he will be expelled from ukip
â first minister miss sturgeon said : â there seems to be no depths below which mr david coburn will not sink

â he has written to mr yousaf offering his sincerest apologies
â david coburn ( right ) pulls a face behind labour mep 's catherine stihler ( centre ) and david martin ( right ) david coburn has managed to offend politicians from most parties in his short tenure as an mep
the 56 - year - old has claimed alex salmond would be â hanging from a lamppost â if there had been a vote for independence , has described nicola sturgeon as â helmet hairdo â , was overhead on a train calling then scots leader johann lamont a ' fishwife ' and dismissed the greens as a ' cult , like scientology '
last year , the mep - who is openly gay â sparked controversy when he claimed same - sex weddings only mattered to ' some queen who wants to dress up in a bridal frock and dance up the aisle
' born in glasgow , mr david coburn was educated at glasgow high school , where he was a milk monitor and later became head boy
he went on to study law at leeds university but failed to receive a degree
moving to london , he found a job in the city as a trader and set up an antiques dealership
prior to his election victory last year , his main source of income was an air freight business he set up , which he was uncharacteristically reticent about when quizzed by the mail at the time - refusing even to reveal the name of the company
certainly , not all of his business ventures are successful
he once ran the lexicon school of english in london 's kensington , which was dissolved in 1993 by the companies registrar after failing to file accounts
he now receives a taxpayer - funded salary of nearly Â£ 80,000 after his party attracted the support of more than 140,000 scots in the european election
