debra milke spent 22 years on death row , convicted of conspiring with two other men to kill her son allegedly for an insurance payout
on monday , a judge ruled that the arizona woman is innocent and dismissed all charges against her
this makes debra milke only the second woman exonerated from death row in the united states
more importantly , the judge 's decision finally clears debra milke after years of legal back - and - forth in a case where she steadfastly maintained her innocence
key to the case 's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct , mainly that of a detective , saldate , who said debra milke confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording
prosecutors withheld from the jury saldate 's personnel record which showed instances of misconduct in other cases , including lying under oath
the two men with whom debra milke was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row
a day after seeing santa claus at a mall on december 1 , 1989 , young christopher asked his mother if he could go again
debra milke 's roomate , styers , took the boy ; then called debra milke saying christopher had disappeared
instead , styers and a friend drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine where styers shot christopher three times in the head , prosecutors said
styers and the friend were convicted of murder and sentenced to death
debra milke was implicated based on alleged testimony from styer 's friend , scott
the detective , saldate , said scott told him that debra milke was involved in a plot to kill her son
and during her trial , prosecutors floated a likely motive : a $ 5,000 life insurance policy she had taken out on the child
but neither scott nor styers testified to a plot in court
no other witnesses or direct evidence linked debra milke to the crime other than saldate 's testimony
saldate further said that debra milke confessed to her role in the murder plot during interrogation and said it was a " bad judgment call
" there was no recording of the interrogation , no one else was in the room or watching from a two - way mirror , and saldate said he threw away his notes shortly after completing his report
debra milke offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role
the trial became a he - said / she - said contest between the two
ultimately , the jury believed the detective and convicted debra milke of murder
what prosecutors did n't tell the court was the detective 's long history of lying under oath and misconduct
saldate had been suspended five days for taking " liberties " with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors
four confessions or indictments had been tossed out because saldate had lied under oath
judges suppressed or vacated four other confessions because saldate had violated a person 's constitutional rights
in 2013 , after more than 20 years in jail , an appeals court overturned debra milke 's conviction
" the constitution requires a fair trial , " chief judge kozinski of the federal 9th circuit court of appeals wrote
" this never happened in debra milke 's case
" " the state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents , " kozinski said
" ... there can be no doubt that the state failed in its constitutional obligation
" debra milke was released on bail , and the court said she could n't be tried again
the state appealed the decision to the arizona supreme court
last week , the arizona supreme court refused to hear the appeal
and on monday , all charges against debra milke were finally dropped
the ankle bracelet she had been wearing while on bail was removed
and debra milke left the court room , sobbing in relief
the case is now closed
debra milke is finally a free woman .
