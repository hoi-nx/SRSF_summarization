new ruling : all eu countries will have to cut the use of throwaway â plastic poison â carrier bags by 80 per cent following a vote yesterday all eu countries will have to cut the use of throwaway â plastic poison â carrier bags by 80 per cent following a vote yesterday
the decision represents a victory for daily mail readers and the â banish the bags â campaign , which launched in february 2008 with the backing of groups from the national trust to the campaign to protect rural england
member states have set the 28 countries of the eu a deadline of 2025 to meet the target which can be achieved through the introduction of bans or charges
the uk is already on course to meet this target following decisions by the devolved governments in scotland , wales and northern ireland , which have already have a system of charges
england is set to follow suit with a 5p levy on the plastic bags in october after supermarkets failed to meet pledges to reduce bag numbers through voluntary schemes
all profits from the charges in england will go to good causes , which will include a raft of green clean - up groups , tackling green spaces , rivers and beaches , as well as other charities
similar charging schemes in northern ireland have led to a reduction of around 90per cent in the distribution of the flimsy bags , which have become a blight on streets and parks
volunteers at the mcs have been working tirelessly to clean beaches and protect sea life such as turtles , which are known to eat the bags because they mistake them for jellyfish
their work has been supported by money raised through a 5p charge on bags by marks & spencer , which led the way among retailers in tackling the blight they cause
pollution and litter expert at the mcs , dr sue kinsey , welcomed the eu vote , as a â useful first step â in the reduction in single use plastic bags
however , she said an original plan for mandatory charges throughout the eu had been watered down with a decision to leave it up to each member state on how to achieve the promised 80per cent reduction
bizarrely , the uk government was among those that opposed the idea of a mandatory charge across all eu states
the mcs is also concerned that the bag charge scheme for england will not be as effective as those in wales , scotland and northern ireland
this is because it carries various exemptions , including a decision not to apply the 5p fee in small shops
an estimated 100 billion carrier bags are used every year in european - with 8 billion ending up as litter
many of those end up in seas and rivers , killing millions of marine animals
wales was the first home nation to introduce a 5p charge four years ago
since then it is estimated that the number of bags issued at the tills is down by more than 75per cent
the decision represents a victory for daily mail readers and the â banish the bags â campaign , which launched in february 2008 ith the backing of groups from the national trust to the campaign to protect rural england there , families have found no significant problems in switching to re-usable bags and baskets for their shopping
some other eu nations already have controls in place
italy has a ban and spain will introduce one in 2018 , while there are levies in the czech republic and malta
a number of countries have taxes on shops which give out free bags , including belgium , bulgaria , danish , france , hungary , latvia , netherlands , romania , and slovenia
the danish green mep margrete auken , who pushed the legislation through the european parliament , called the approval â a historic breakthrough in tackling the pervasive problem of plastic waste â .
