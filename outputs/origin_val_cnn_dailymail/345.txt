' we want your devices to recognize you , to understand what you 're saying â¦ we want the experience to go wherever you do and we want you to feel a great sense of trust as you go

' you - uniquely you - plus your device are the keys to your windows experience , apps , data and even websites and services â not a random assortment of letters and numbers that are easily forgotten , hacked , or written down and pinned to a bulletin board , ' belfiore said
the firm is also confident the system can not be fooled - and has even tested users holding up pictures of others
