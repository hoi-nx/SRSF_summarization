fast food giant domino âs is selling â frankenfood â pizzas to customers while claiming to be â gm - free â on its website the double - dealing has been identified by gm freeze , which is campaigning to raise awareness about how gm foods are creeping into the national diet without the knowledge and approval of consumers
the group âs director , liz oâneill , is now demanding an investigation to see if domino âs has broken labelling laws â as firms using gm ingredients are required to label their use
she said : â domino âs website currently contradicts itself
if they have introduced gm ingredients to their pizza crusts then customers should be told much more clearly
â people in the uk have demonstrated time and again that they do nât want to eat gm food and the fsa âs public attitudes survey recently showed concern about gm at an all - time high
â whether people are motivated by concern for declining wildlife and flourishing superweeds , for the wider ethical issues around gm farming or just their own personal choice , we all have the right to know what we are buying before we get to the till
â waitrose has also been selling imported american confectionery which contains gm sugar beet and a soya derivative domino âs has confirmed that it has been using thin and crispy pizza bases with gm ingredients since the beginning of february after its usual supplier in ireland had a factory fire which stopped production
the firm apologised for not updating its website , and confirmed that it hopes to return to using non-gm bases in september
marks & spencer said its decision to stock gm products â in no way affects our commitment to only using non-gm ingredients in marks & spencer food â
and a waitrose spokesman insisted that any gm ingredients in american chocolate stocked by the store were â clearly labelled â
gm crops like sugar beet , corn or maize and soya have been at the centre of concerns that the associated industrial farming practices have caused serious harm to the environment
marks & spencer has been stocking american sauces and cookies containing gm soya and corn â even though the firm has previously boasted about not using gm ingredients the plants have been altered through the insertion of foreign genes that create toxins to kill insects or give them immunity to spraying with powerful chemical weed killers
there is evidence from the american that certain weeds have developed immunity to the same weed killers with the result that they are taking over many fields
at the same time , the use of sprays alongside the gm crops is thought to have caused a collapse in the population of the monarch butterfly , which is now under threat
critics of the technology are also concerned about the lack of independent research to show the resulting food is safe to eat
a recent fsa ( fsa ) study found a rise in concerns about gm food
some 24per cent listed gm as a concern , which was higher than food hygiene in the home .
