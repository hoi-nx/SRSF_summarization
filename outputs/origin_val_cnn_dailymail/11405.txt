others called him an ' idiot ' , ' dangerous ' , ' arrogant ' and ' bigot ' daisy powell-chandler , a consultant at populus , said : ' it is a fact ignored by most politicians that the public are n't paying attention most of the time
' voters have families , jobs and bills that are much more interesting to them than today 's policy launch or staged visit
' as the election approaches on may 7 , more information will start trickle through
' but many of the electorate will be choosing who to vote for ( or whether to vote at all ) based on how each party leader scores on the ' blink test ' â the immediate reaction when they see or hear party leaders in the media
this poll shows precisely that
' it is clear from the results that all political leaders are polarising figures with strong downsides
people think cameron is arrogant , miliband is weak , clegg can not be trusted , and farage is a racist
' but the flipside of these criticisms are things we like about them : cameron may come across as smug but he is smooth and competent â an assertive leader
' miliband is weird but caring and intelligent
clegg is the likeable liberal and farage a charismatic , funny man
' over the course of the campaign , the electorate need to decide which of these attributes are most important and the emotional connections that the public make with these leaders are likely to be an important factor in deciding who the next prime minister is
