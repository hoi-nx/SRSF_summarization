known at the time as ' america 's sweetheart ' , couric was nbc 's star
and in their moment of need , the station is reportedly trying to recapture that magic
according to a series of reports , the 58 - year - old newscaster is in talks with incoming chairman andrew lack to make a return by replacing disgraced anchor williams on the nightly news
nbc has yet to respond to dailymail.com 's request for a comment
williams is currently suspended without pay for allegedly fabricating anecdotes ' it makes sense ( that she could come back ) because she is so closely associated with the brand , ' a source the new york daily news
' she and andy are close friends , but this is still only in the most preliminary stages
' it is possible that couric could be lined up for other roles at nbc such as hosting the ratings - poor today show or working as a ' special correspondent ' in a ' barbara walters - type role ' , notes stelter , author of top of the morning : inside the cut - throat world of morning tv
writing for cnn , stelter says couric is one of many a-list reporters that harbor a close relationship with nbc 's returning chairman andrew lack - who is credited with masterminding her rise to fame
he writes : ' lack has a special knack for working with a-list television anchors -- he knows how to massage egos , how to manage internal rivalries , how to pair anchors and producers
' a 1999 profile of lack in brill 's content said " a number of on - air talent and top executives have asked to link their contracts with lack 's -- saying , essentially , " i do n't want to be here if it is n't andy
" making a return ? couric , 58 , ( pictured with today 's matt lauer ) became a star on nbc 's today show america 's sweetheart : since being known as america 's sweetheart , she has worked at cbs and 60 minutes ' and one of the stars he 's stayed in touch with , through the decades , is couric
' the alleged talks come after williams , 55 , was suspended without pay for allegedly fabricating anecdotes about the iraq war and hurricane katrina in news reports and interviews
lester holt and savannah guthrie are temporarily holding the spot until williams is reinstated or a replacement is found this summer
couric , who is now at yahoo news , left nbc in 2006 after 15 years presenting today
she worked at cbs evening news until 2011 , while also doing segments for 60 minutes for a reported salary of $ 15 million a year - the most ever for a journalist at the time
the meeting comes as nbc tries to fumble its way back into viewers ' hearts after the scandal surrounding williams ' fabricated anecdotes
williams , 55 , is currently suspended without pay as a team investigates claims he lied in reports about the iraq war and hurricane katrina , among others
in 2011 , couric was allegedly in talks to return to today to reunite with her former co-host matt lauer - a move that was never realized
according to stelter , in his book top of the morning , couric said at the time : ' i feel like it would have been a fun thing to reunite and to show that you can go home again
' but i also thought , there 's a reason why i left the show
' her most famous interview came in 2008 when she sat down with vice presidential candidate palin for a series of pieces that many believed doomed palin and mccain 's campaign
in was during that interview that palin famously talked about alaska 's proximity to russia and was unable to name a single magazine she read on a regular basis , instead telling couric ; ' um , all of them , any of them that have been in front of me all these years
' palin would later claim that couric had a bias against her
couric left cbs in 2011 to go work as a special corespondent at abc , where she did segments for nightline and 20/20 and filled in on all their morning programs at some point : the view , live with kelly and good morning america
then , in 2012 , she launched her own talk show , katie , on abc , which was cancelled after just two seasons in 2014
after leaving abc there were rumors she might rejoin today as the show was struggling in the ratings .
