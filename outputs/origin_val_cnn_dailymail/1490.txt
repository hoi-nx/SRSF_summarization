kitchen was , however , the past president of the huntingdon county bar association , said her attorney , caroline roberto
' she 's an incredibly competent person and she worked very diligently and was devoted to the people she served in the community , ' roberto said
' there are things about the charges we do n't agree with so we 're going to be fighting some of the charges , ' roberto said , though she would n't be specific
but wencker , the current president of the county bar association , said he does n't think the charges are severe enough
' for a decade of that kind of behavior , those kind of charges are insufficient and do n't represent the depth or level of betrayal that was shown , ' wencker said
the forgery charge is a first - degree misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison ; the unauthorized practice charge is a third - degree misdemeanor , carrying up to a year in jail

a representative of the law firm did n't immediately return a call seeing comment friday
but in december , when the huntingdon daily news first reported on the case , the firm issued a statement saying they would be going through all her cases
' sadly , it would appear that our firm was the last , in a long line of professionals , to have been deceived by kitchen into believing she was licensed to practice law , ' the statement said
' we are undertaking a thorough review of each and every file she may have handled
' it was n't immediately clear where else kitchen might have worked
roberto would n't comment on whether any clients were harmed or complained about the services kitchen rendered , except to repeat that kitchen was ' incredibly competent '
she said kitchen , who is married with no children , is no longer working anywhere
' since december , when she was asked not to practice again , she 's just been waiting for this to be resolved , ' roberto said .
