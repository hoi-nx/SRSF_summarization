a toddler has been dubbed the real - life elsa from the disney film frozen because she faces a daily battle to keep warm
gracie , two , suffers from raynaud 's syndrome , and turns blue when she is exposed to the cold
the condition occurs when small blood vessels in the extremities are over-sensitive to changes in temperature , interrupting the blood supply
during an attack , the extremities become first white and dead looking and may then turn blue and finally red and burning when the blood flow is restored
the condition can cause considerable pain , numbness or tingling
gracie is so badly affected she has been given special gloves for extra protection during an attack , the extremities become first white and dead looking and may then turn blue and finally red and burning when the blood flow is restored most patients can cope by wrapping up warm , although some develop painful weeping ulcers , which can become infected
gracie is so badly affected she has been given special gloves for extra protection
her mother laurie , 27 , said : ' when she gets cold , she turns blotchy blue
it starts in her hands then travels up her arms , feet , legs then face
' she has magic gloves which reflect 95 per cent of the heat back into her body
' gracie 's condition means even normal activities such as going outside can become a challenge , and she is not allowed to eat ice cream or consume very cold drinks
she does n't leave the house without dressing in thermals , several layers , two pairs of socks and a hat and scarf - as well as her silver gloves
' the winter months are awful , ' said her mother , who takes gracie 's temperature three times a day to check it does n't drop too low
' she ca n't go outside to play and now she is older ca n't eat ice cream or cold foods because her hands swell when she handles cold things
' my heating is constantly on , and i have got her a heated blanket that i plug into the cigarette lighter which helps to keep her warm when we 're in the car
' gracie 's condition means even normal activities such as going outside can become a challenge , and she is not allowed to eat ice cream or consume very cold drinks her mother said : ' when she gets cold , she turns blotchy blue
it starts in her hands then travels up her arms , feet , legs then face ' gracie also frequently suffers raynaud 's attacks at bath time
her mother added : ' it 's scary
people have stopped me in the street to say she 's wrapped up too much and will overheat
' while i want her to be a " normal " child , there are normal things that she just ca n't do
' so it 's a balance of letting her do all the other things little girls , while i 'm permanently worried about her having an attack
' gracie , from barry , south wales , was diagnosed with raynaud 's a year ago when she was 16 months old - despite her mother noticing from birth she was often cold and turning blue
miss gracie said : ' the worst i have seen is when her hands went almost black and looked like they were about to drop off
' i was so worried because i was taking her to the doctor and the hospital but all the tests they were doing were coming back clear
' they just kept telling me there was nothing wrong but i had a mother 's instinct
gracie is now learning to cope with the condition - helped by snow queen elsa from the disney film frozen
her mother said : ' gracie absolutely loves frozen and when i noticed that she was a bit like elsa , she thought it was brilliant ' raynaud 's condition , triggered by a sudden drop in temperature , causes the blood vessels in the fingers and toes contract , cutting off blood supply
it can also affect the tiny arteries in the nose , ears and tongue
typically , raynaud âs causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb
then , as the blood flow returns , they turn blue and eventually red , accompanied by a burning sensation
attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour
nine out of ten cases are in women , with most sufferers having their first attack before the age of 40
although attacks peak in the cold winter months , symptoms can be triggered by everyday tasks such as taking food out of the freezer , air conditioning , or even stress â all of which cause blood vessels to contract
there are two types of raynaud âs
primary raynaud âs , which tends to run in families , is generally quite mild
most patients can cope by wrapping up warm , although some develop painful weeping ulcers , which can become infected
' she was finally seen by a rheumatologist at the hospital in cardiff who told me what it was , which was great

her mother said : ' gracie absolutely loves frozen and when i noticed that she was a bit like elsa , she thought it was brilliant
' she 's getting to the age now where she does n't understand why she has to wear gloves all the time so i tell her she 's like elsa and elsa is special , which cheers her up
' she loves being like elsa , just like a real - life queen
' there might be a day where she grows out of it and i hope that when she 's older she can go out there and have a normal life
' in the meantime it 's just about teaching her how to deal with it so she can lead as much of a normal life as possible
' liz bevins , ceo of the raynaud 's , said : ' raynaud 's can affect anyone of any age - babies , young children , adolescents , mature adults and the elderly
' cold hands and feet are frequently overlooked , put up with and considered nothing more than a nuisance but if you do suffer from cold extremities frequently , please do n't ignore it
' some of the above diseases have silent phases , so you have very few symptoms or know no pain until the disease is in it 's later stages
' a few simple tests may be able to diagnose the above conditions much earlier , so we 're encouraging you to go to your local gp and discuss any concerns you have , or get in touch with us for further help
' those looking after someone with the condition can also experience distress
we are here to help those people who suffer from the condition but also assist their families and carers to get the help and information they need
