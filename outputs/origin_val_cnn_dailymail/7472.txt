following the birth of george , the prince described the experience of becoming a first - time grandfather as â a unique moment in anyone âs life â
and now , a never - before - seen photograph of the royal and his one - year - old grandson proves just how proud he is of the duke and duchess of cambridge of cambridge 's son
the framed image of the 66 - year - old and george took pride of place on a table in the background of a newly released video clip , which the prince released to support the world 's biggest environmental event , earth hour
in the video , charles speaks about why we should join in with the annual earth hour and turn off our lights this weekend
the photo , of duchess of cambridge and william , who are expecting their second child next month , first son , is rather fitting ; in the message , he urges people to work to save the planet ' not just for ourselves but also for our children and grandchildren '
the new photo , which takes pole position in the video , comes after reports that the monarch is frustrated that he does n't see his grandson very often
in the video , charles speaks about why we should join in with the annual earth hour and turn off our lights this weekend and how important it is for the future of our families charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young prince âs life
at the heart of the heir - to - the - throne âs frustrations is the so - called â middletonisation â of his son william âs life â specifically the inordinate amount of time he spends with his in - laws michael and carole , with whom the duke recently holidayed in mustique for carole âs 60th
in fact , so vexed is charles about the so - called â march of the middletons â that he has complained to friends : â they never let me see my grandson
â a source told the daily mail 's sebastian shakespeare : â carole has rather taken over , dictating when george naps , when and what he eats
all in all , behaving like she âs queen carole
â it is certainly true there have been few , if any , trips to charles âs gloucestershire home highgrove over the past year
some think it âs a deliberate move on william âs part to protect his young family from suffering the same stiff , and often unhappy , upbringing he endured
the video comes in the same month as reports that charles is said to have become increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he occupies in the young prince 's life most of william and duchess of cambridge âs time is spent at their norfolk home , anmer hall , on the queen âs sandringham estate , where the prince has been busy revising for his air transport pilot âs licence
the middletons are frequent visitors and play an active role in the household
they stayed there over christmas day , when william pointedly hosted lunch for them on christmas day rather than eat with the queen , as is traditional
