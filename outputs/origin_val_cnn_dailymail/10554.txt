prosecutors have made serbian 's first arrests of people suspected of carrying out 1995 's srebrenica massacre - a significant milestone toward healing the wounds of europe 's worst civilian slaughter since world war ii officers today arrested eight men accused of taking part in the murder of more than 1,000 muslims at a warehouse near srebrenica , a team of serbian and bosnian prosecutors told the ap altogether , more than 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys were killed in the eastern enclave by the serbs in 1995 - the only atrocity in europe to be labeled a genocide by the un since world war ii serbian prosecutors said they initially arrested seven suspects in pre-dawn raids at different locations in serbian this morning , then caught the eighth suspect following a manhunt later in the day
horror : pictured is the abandoned warehouse where over 1,000 bosniak muslim men and boys were murdered in july 1995
it remains the only atrocity in europe to be labeled a genocide by the un since world war ii memorial : this photo shows the gravestone of muriz - one of the 1,000 victims of the massacre chief serbian war crimes prosecutor vladimir vukcevic told the ap that all those arrested ' are former members of a special brigade of the bosnian serb police
' serbian in the past has put on trial men who took a group of prisoners away from srebrenica to be killed
and in 2011 it arrested mladic - the warlord who masterminded the slaughter â and sent him to an international criminal court in the hague , dutch
but today 's arrests are serbian 's first attempt to bring to justice men who got their hands bloody in the killing machine known as the srebrenica massacre 20 years ago this july
' it is important to stress that this is the first time that our prosecutor 's office is dealing with the mass killings of civilians and war prisoners in srebrenica , ' vekaric , the lead serbian prosecutor in the case , said
he said serbian was approaching a key moment in confronting its past
' we have never dealt with a crime of such proportions , ' said vekaric , serbian 's deputy war crimes prosecutor
' it is very important for serbian to take a clear position toward srebrenica through a court process
' snows covers the area surrounding the now - abandoned warehouse where the massacre took place munira subasic , head the mothers of srebrenica group , called the arrests ' good news
' ' it was time for serbian to do something , ' she said
' this is a message to all criminals who fled and thought they are safe from justice that they can never rest
' the biggest arrest in the sweep was milidragovic , the commander dubbed ' nedjo the butcher , ' who went on to become a successful businessman in serbian , the ap has learned
more than 100,000 people were killed and millions were left homeless in bosnian 's 1992 - 95 war when bosnian serb , supported by neighboring serbian , rebelled against bosnian 's declaration of independence from serbian - led yugoslavia
the collaboration wednesday by prosecutors from former wartime enemies serbian and bosnian â supported by the un war crimes tribunal â is the most important case of judicial teamwork helping to heal the war 's festering wounds
the arrests follow a december sweep by the same team of prosecutors of 15 suspects in a separate wartime atrocity : a massacre that followed an abduction from a bosnian train
still grieving : muriz was among those killed in the warehouse
his wife , suhra ( pictured ) will never forget his last words before he headed into the forest with thousands of men fleeing srebrenica many serbs still view as heroes their wartime leaders - including mladic and former bosnian serbian president radovan karadzic , who are on trial at the un war crimes tribunal - and believe they were victims of a western plot
that makes the current campaign to detain the triggermen deeply sensitive
serbian 's conservative government is allowing the prosecutions to move forward in part because it 's eager to join the european union
that july 1995 , bosnian serb forces opened the srebrenica offensive with heavy shelling , ignoring dutch un peacekeeping troops stationed in the town
the serbs - led by mladic - marched into the town without meeting any resistance
women sought shelter at the dutch base , while bosnian men and boys fled into the surrounding woods and were hunted down by mladic 's forces
more than 100,000 people were killed and millions left homeless in bosnian 's 1992 - 95 war when bosnian serb - supported by neighboring serbian - rebelled against bosnian 's declaration of independence from yugoslavia the men and boys captured by milidragovic 's men were rounded up and crammed tight into the warehouse with no food or water
there was n't even enough room for everyone to sit as they waited in fear
the slaughter started in the late afternoon , when the killers hurled bombs through the windows and fired round after round of automatic gunfire
in the morning , witnesses say , milidragovic ordered the survivors â up to 100 of them â to come out , promising they would be spared
even his troops said they were terrified of the commander
' i was afraid to look him in the eyes , ' one of them , a protected witness , said in a deposition
when the bosnian war ended in a peace deal in 1995 , milidragovic - who is now 58 - moved to the serbian capital , belgrade
he had two children and built a trucking business that transports construction material - prosecutors say his startup capital came from tens of thousands of dollars taken from his victims ' pockets
location : this photo taken earlier this month shows the now abandoned warehouse where over 1,000 muslim bosniak men and boys had been killed in july 1995 in the village of kravica on the outskirts of srebrenica muriz was among those killed in the warehouse
his wife , suhra , will never forget his last words before he headed into the forest with thousands of men fleeing srebrenica
' take good care of my children , ' muriz said as he hugged and kissed munir , 7 , and emina , 4
in muriz ' trousers , discovered with his remains , investigators found his driver 's license and a tobacco box a relative had made for him from un aid cans
suhra kept the box , a pinch of tobacco and the cigarette paper inside - enough for a cigarette he never got to smoke
the box still sits on a shelf in her living room in sarajevo
when the children were small , they would not let visiting friends touch it
' they said it is a sacred object , ' suhra said
muriz ' remains - about half of his body - were found years later in a mass grave
forensics experts brought the remains to suhra in a paper bag
they took out a few bones and showed them to her
' i did not cry , ' she said
' but i almost broke my fingers , twisting them
