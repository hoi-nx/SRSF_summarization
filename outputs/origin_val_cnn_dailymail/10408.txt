target has proposed to pay $ 10million to settle a class - action lawsuit brought against the retailer following a massive data breach in 2013
individuals affected by the breach could get up to a maximum of $ 10,000 each , the proposal says
details of as many as 40million credit and debit card accounts were exposed during the breach , which hurt its holiday sales that year
the proposed settlement would also require minneapolis - based target to appoint a chief information security officer , keep a written information security program and offer security training to its workers
it would be required to establish a procedure to monitor data security , and to respond swiftly to future breaches
' we are pleased to see the process moving forward and look forward to its resolution , ' target spokesman molly snyder said in an emailed statement
the company said in court documents filed in minnesota that the funds for reimbursements will be kept in an interest - bearing escrow account
claims will mostly be submitted and processed online , through a dedicated website
target 's data breach in 2013 exposed details of as many as 40 million credit and debit card accounts and hurt its holiday sales that year the chain has worked hard to lure back customers that were hesitant to shop there after the incident
over the 2014 holiday season , target offered free shipping on all items
it recently announced that it was cutting its minimum online purchase to qualify for free shipping in half to $ 25
and on wednesday the retailer said it will now allow returns for up to a year for its private and exclusive brands
target 's bounce back from a turbulent stretch including the data breach and exit from canada has been met with optimism on wall street
the retailer 's stock traded above $ 80 for the first time monday
earlier this month , target said it would lay off about 1,700 people , eliminate another 1,400 unfilled positions and cut up to $ 2billion in costs
it will also focus more on technology to boost online sales growth
this will involve an investment of about $ 1billion , which will be aimed at beefing up business from shoppers who are more likely to shop online
a court hearing on the proposed settlement is set for thursday in st. paul , minneapolis .
