a federal judge blocked nebraska 's gay marriage ban on monday , but the decision will not take effect for a week and the attorney general 's office immediately appealed to the 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals
the aclu of nebraska sued the state in november on behalf of seven same - sex couples challenging the ban , which passed with the approval of 70 percent of voters in 2000
in addition to prohibiting gay marriage , the ban also forbids civil unions and legalized domestic partnerships
the ban means that same - sex couples miss out on medical and financial benefits available to heterosexual married couples , u.s. district judge bataillon said as he issued the injunction

aclu of nebraska executive director danielle conrad is seen speaking february 19 ' all of the plaintiffs have further demonstrated psychological harm and stigma , on themselves and on their children , as a result of the non-recognition of their marriages , ' he said in the 34 - page ruling
' the plaintiffs have been denied the dignity and respect that comes with the rights and responsibilities of marriage
' bataillon rejected the state 's argument that the ban reflects the will of a majority of voters and promotes family stability
he said he believes the u.s. supreme court will ultimately endorse same - sex marriage rights , which have been upheld in four appellate districts
' the notion that some children should receive fewer legal protections than others based on the circumstances of their birth is not only irrational â it is constitutionally repugnant , ' he said
his order blocking the ban takes effect march 9
bataillon previously struck down nebraska 's gay marriage ban in 2005 , saying it violated the constitutional rights of gays and lesbians
an 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals panel reinstated the ban in 2006
according to the court 's online records , the nebraska attorney general 's office filed an appeal straight after bataillon issued the injunction
a spokeswoman for republican attorney general doug peterson said attorneys in their office were reviewing the ruling and would issue a statement later monday
