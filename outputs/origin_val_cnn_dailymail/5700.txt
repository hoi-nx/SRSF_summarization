when she was 13 - years - old annalisa , from sunnyvale , california , was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome , a hormonal condition that causes an increase in hair grown on her face and body
while her husband supported her decision to grow out her beard after years of shaving , annalisa is unsure about flaunting her facial hair in their anniversary photos
' david is super supportive and accepting of my facial hair
i do n't think he loves my facial hair , but he loves me and that 's all that matters , ' she says in the episode , according to people
several years ago , annalisa revealed to online magazine beardspo.com that , as a child , she had been incredibly confused about why people felt she should be ashamed of her facial hair - but admitted that , as time went on , their cruel comments and jibes left her feeling terrible about herself
' i did nât see why it mattered that i had darker hair on my face , ' she explained
' at the time it was still peach fuzz looking
after being hounded about it , i became self conscious
my mother decided i needed laser hair removal which ultimately did nât work and began shaving my face to look " normal "
' she added : ' about three years ago , i was at the point of shaving my beard twice a day ... it was a never ending battle
i formed agoraphobia ( unable to leave my house ) and would feel anxiety trying to plan outings or go anywhere
when i did leave the house after much stress , crying and worry i found the anxiety would nât calm down
' thankfully my husband helped to get me out of my haze and demanded something be done as it was ruining our life together
' overcoming illness : the california resident has suffered from pcos , which causes increased hair growth , since the age of 13 it was then that annalisa began growing out her beard and embracing her facial hair once and for all - and ironically , at the time of the interview , she confessed that she did n't ' know if i 'll ever remove my beard again ' , adding that it made her feel more ' free , confident and more womanly ' than she had felt in years
