burrowed underground , a grubby five - year - old boy peeks expectantly around a makeshift door as a woman prepares his pancakes
like the rodent he keeps as a pet , pavel has grown accustomed to a subterranean existence after nine months living in a basement where he eats , sleeps and plays
accompanied by his family and a group of others who have seen their city descend into a war zone , the young boy takes refuge from the ever - present threat of stray bullets and artillery fire
waiting for lunch : pavel makeev , age 5 , peeks his head through a doorway while waiting for his lunch to be cooked in donetsk , ukrainian pavel and his family live in the basement of the cultural centre in petrovskiy , an area of donetsk under pro-russian rebel control , and the city above him has seen months of heavy and terrifying clashes between ukrainian troops and rebels

nearly a year of fighting has led to at least 5,793 deaths , according to un estimates
another 14,595 people have been wounded in the conflict
