they prescribed him the painkiller morphine , and put him on an antibiotic drip to try and combat the infection
in the early hours of thursday morning staff woke mr ross-bowker and told him he needed to be moved because his bed was needed
but instead of moving the it worker from brynsiencyn on anglesey to another ward , he was taken to a side room
staff told him it was a ' treatment , assessment , storage room '
a spokesman for the health trust which runs the hospital said the room was a treatment room where clinical procedures are routinely carried out
but not being a part of the general ward , there was no alarm system to call staff so mr ross-bowker was instead given a brass bell to call nurses if he needed to
there were oxygen cannisters on the floor , as well as boxes of medical supplies
and his family said his drip was hung from the ceiling via a light fitting , preventing the 35 - year - old from going to the toilet
his mother said while being shocked by her son 's situation , she can not fault the staff who cared for him
she said : ' it was a converted store cupboard which they have shoved an old bed into
the 35 - year - old had his appendix removed at gwynedd hospital in bangor , north welsh , on monday
but in the early hours of thursday morning he was moved to the side room
he said he was given a brass bell and was surrounded by oxygen cannisters and other medical supplies ' how clean would this room have been ? certainly not as clean as the wards
he had just had surgery and had an infected wound
' he was given a brass bell and the drip was attached to the light fitting , it was like going back to the dark ages
i half expected to see florence nightingale walking down the corridor
' she added : ' the doctor came to him the next morning and asked him if he wanted to stay or go home
' ross-bowker said if he had to spend another night in there he would rather go home , despite being in the same amount of pain he was in before his operation
the doctor said he did n't blame him
' the situation is ridiculous , they have n't got enough beds and are closing wards and hospitals
' ms ross-bowker contacted ynys mã´n welsh assembly member rhun ap iorwerth about her son 's experience
he said : ' i was shocked to hear of the conditions that one of my constituents had to endure at gwynedd hospital this week
' surely this ca n't be right in the 21st century ? especially considering a person is at his or her weakest at hospital , expecting them to use a brass bell to call for help is incredible
' my constituent was full of praise for the nurses working on the ward , but they are obviously being made to work in difficult conditions with a clear lack of resources , and i will be raising this with the health board as well as the welsh government at the first opportunity
' professor matthew makin , executive medical director at betsi cadwaladr university health board said : ' firstly we would like to apologise to the patient for any distress caused
' as part of the health board âs escalation policy , when we âre under significant pressure and unable to off load patients from ambulances , we increase ward capacity in a safe manner , ensuring patient dignity at all times
' the patient was nursed in an appropriate clinical area on the ward , in this instance a treatment room
' this practice is only done in extreme circumstances and is closely monitored to ensure patient safety at all times
' we would like to reassure the public that these instances are temporary and patients are allocated to bed spaces on wards as soon as they become available
