when england crashed out of the last global limited - overs tournament there was just the small matter of a dead rubber against the holland to complete what had been a hugely disappointing world twenty20
fast forward 10 months and here we are again amid more recriminations over another lost campaign and a final match , this time against afghanistan , where england have far more to lose than just a meaningless group match
ashley giles will not need reminding that a dispirited england lost to holland in bangladesh and any hope he had of becoming head coach disappeared along with their chances of making an impact on yet another world stage
moores talks to his players before an england nets session at the sydney cricket ground on wednesday moores ( centre ) chats with captain morgan as england prepare for their final world cup match indications are moores will keep his job , at least for the test series in the caribbean , whatever happens at the sydney cricket ground on friday but the last thing he needs is another humiliating loss against another of the â minnows
â the fact england turned up early on wednesday for what used to be known as naughty boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their desperate need to take something , anything , from their worst ever world cup
england are the laughing stock of world cricket again and there is no body of people who enjoy that scenario more than an australian nation who can not believe their luck that the old enemy have gone out of their world cup so soon
victory against an afghanistan side who have made a remarkable journey from the refugee camps of pakistan to be here would barely regain any pride for an england team who are still coming to terms with what they have done
england 's stuart broad runs with a rugby ball during the training session on wednesday the england team gather round in a huddle as they prepare for the dead rubber against afghanistan but for moores it would perhaps keep the wolves away from his door for just a short while before he helps put the finishing touches to a squad for the three - test series in the west indies next month that will be named on tuesday
england will be without moeen and chris woakes , two players who can still expect a one - day future , when they face afghanistan and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to st kitts on april 2
moeen strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the fateful defeat by bangladesh in adelaide while woakes has a â stress reaction â in his third metatarsal of his left foot
both will be assessed when england get home
in their absence it is to be hoped england give games to the two players yet to appear in this world cup in tredwell and bopara , not least before both could then be making their final one - day international appearances
england 's chris jordan bowls during the nets session at sydney cricket ground morgan warms up ahead of a full training session in sydney cricket ground on wednesday if england are serious about ever making an impact in one - day cricket they have to start from scratch after this tournament with a squad full of players who will be at or near their peak in 2019
that means there is little point in them persevering in 50 - over cricket beyond friday with the likes of tredwell , bopara and the senior trio of ian bell , stuart broad and jimmy anderson , who yesterday insisted he wants to play on
a dead rubber against afghanistan is hardly the way all of them would have wanted to bow out but at least they will be meeting a team with an identical world cup record as themselves â just a single victory against scotland
there was a familiar figure at the helm of the afghanistan team at the sydney cricket ground on wednesday in the avuncular form of coach moles , the former warwickshire batsman who has ignored security advice to work in kabul
moles has been in charge of a team who have defeated england before â when he coached new zealand in the champions trophy â and would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland
moores ( left ) and england vice-captain jos buttler are pictured in discussion on the field bangladesh celebrate after sealing an upset victory against england at the adelaide oval on monday â england are not in the best of nick and we still believe we âve got a scare in us in this world cup , especially if we show composure at the top of the order , â said moles
â if we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock
â i âm obviously sad to see england âs demise but i âm delighted to be here with afghanistan
we âve had some great learning experiences , had our first win and gave sri lanka a scare
this has been a shop window for afghanistan cricket and i think we âve made friends
we play with a freedom that i âve tried to enhance
â it is the ability to play with freedom that has been so badly lacking in england âs cricket but they have one more chance to get it right before they slink off on an early flight home
otherwise they will lose as many friends as the afghanistan have gained .
