a group of writers are challenging the notion that becoming a parent is the key to a fulfilling and happy existence in a bold new anthology of essays , which explores each contributor âs conscious decision to forgo having children
selfish , shallow , and self - absorbed : sixteen writers on the decision not to have kids was edited by los angeles - based author meghan daum , 45 , who curated the essays of 16 writers , including lionel shriver , sigrid nunez , kate christensen , elliott holt , geoff dyer and tim kreider , for her new book , which is slated for release on tuesday
but the anthology does n't take jabs at those who 've decided to have children , rather it takes a look at how others have come to the decision that parenthood is not for them in a culture that worships parenthood
being honest : meghan daum edited 16 writers ' essays about their decision to forgo having children in her new book selfish , shallow , and self - absorbed : sixteen writers on the decision not to have kids just the two of us : ms meghan daum , who does n't have children , posed for this selfie with her husband ' these essays have so many people talking about the ways that they do have relationships with kids , nieces or nephews or kids that they mentor , ' ms meghan daum told flavorwire
she added : ' you âve heard the clichÃ© " it takes a village " , but there are so many ways of being a responsible villager
' the writers who contributed to the book candidly explained about how they came to the decision to live a child - free existence without judgement - which is a refreshing take on a unnecessarily controversial choice that is often met with confusion and criticism
for her book , ms meghan daum sought out the perspective of both men and women , although a majority of the essays in the collection are from female writers
' i think we could be wary of the assumption that parenthood is the only way to be an adult , ' ms meghan daum told the outlet , noting that ' it 's less taboo to say , " i 'm a shallow person " than to say that this is n't for me
' major debut : ms meghan daum 's new collection of essays will be published on tuesday while most conversations about parenting revolve around how women ' can have it all , ' this book suggests that maybe they do n't want to - or even need to
ms meghan daum first thought about sharing the stories of childless adults from a variety of professions and walks of life , but she chose to curate her book with essays from writers because of their ability to ' interpret the world ' in a responsible way
most of the writers featured in the anthology are over the age of 30 , ms meghan daum said she ' did not have an age cutoff ' , but noted that it would be difficult to have someone in her twenties make a public declaration that she would never have children
ms meghan daum wrote about her own choice not to have children in an essay titled difference maker , which appeared the unspeakable : and other subjects of discussion , her collection of persona essays that was published last year
' after more than a decade of being told that i âd wake up one morning at age 30 or 33 - or , god forbid , 40 - to the ear - splitting peals of my biological clock , i would still look at a woman pushing a stroller and feel no envy at all , only relief that i was nât her , ' she recalled in difference maker
throughout the essay , ms meghan daum recounted getting pregnant , miscarrying the baby and subsequently deciding that she did n't want to be a mother
in her new book , ms meghan daum does n't touch upon her own life with children beyond the introduction
' i did feel that i had said all i needed to say , ' she told flavorwire about her previous work .
