mertesacker had to admit that the prospect of ever winning the champions league was a distant dream for arsenal as they came to terms with another early exit
arsenal won 2 - 0 in monaco on tuesday but lost the first leg 3 - 1 in london and went out on away goals
arsene wenger was downbeat and introspective after the game as he tried to sum up the disappointment of a fifth successive campaign ending in the first knockout round
the arsenal boss claimed flippantly that it might be better to finish third in the group and drop into the uefa europa league than keep losing in the last 16
his captain was equally sombre when asked how far this team was from seriously competing for the top prize

â monaco were very under - estimated
but they deserved it by playing well in the first leg
we had one bad game and that was enough to get knocked out
we were missing some good fortune but we did nât deserve it because we played so poorly in the first leg
â it âs difficult after such a good performance to look back and think that in the first game we missed that mental level you need to compete at the highest level
you can see how good we are as a team and how well organised we can be
we need to consider that every single day in training and in games
that âs why we are so far away
â arsene wenger said : â maybe it would be better not to pass the group phase and play the uefa europa league than to be eliminated in the last 16
we would have more chances to win a title

arsene wenger âs team have won 13 of their last 15 games and are third in the barclays premier league
ramsey thinks they can catch manchester city and finish even higher
â the top two is within our grasp , â said ramsey
â it âs only one point and anything can happen
we still have the fa cup to go ... we âre still on for a successful season
â we âre more than capable of beating anyone and it âs a case of being more wise over two games in europe
hopefully if we get a chance next year we can put that right
