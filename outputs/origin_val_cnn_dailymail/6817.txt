the 2010 international player of the year was taken to hospital for x-rays after being hurt during the dragons ' 40 - 40 draw with salford in perpignan on saturday
it was only carney 's second appearance in super league after joining the dragons on a three - year contract
dragons ' carney is expected to be out of acton for three to four weeks with a broken rib carney was taken to hospital for x-rays after damaging his ribs during match against salford referee bentham ruled that salford forward tasi was committed to the tackle on the australian stand - off but the incident infuriated dragons coach frayssinous , who insists the red devils player should have been punished and expects him to be charged when the rugby football league 's match - review panel study the incident on monday
frayssinous was fiercely critical earlier this season of what he claimed was a failure of referees to protect his playmakers and in particular full back morgan escare and expressed his fears that carney would become a target
' i said i was worried over the protection of my quality players and it has happened in only his second game , ' frayssinous said
' i expect tasi to be charged but i also thought he should have been shown a card
' frayssinous was also angered by the decision of bentham to penalise escare in the closing moments for playing on after being tackled near his own line
that enabled josh griffin to draw the match but frayssinous said his full - back should have been allowed to go back and play the ball and expects his critical post-match comments , in which he accused officials of double standards , to result in a fine
' i hope that my Â£ 500 will help the referee to be better next week , ' he said
the result at the stade gilbert brutus set a new record for the highest scoring draw in the 20 years of super league , beating the 36 - 36 draw between london broncos and leeds at the stoop in 2004 .
