i want to see israel survive and not be overtaken by the mad men of this world

voight , a republican , wrote in the piece ; ' if , god forbid , we live to see mr. obama president , we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before , and our country will be weakened in every way
' it 's not just obama either , as he also lashed out at his former costar jane fonda in a fox news interview , saying the actress had been ' aiding and abetting those who seek the destruction of israel
' he has also previously labeled obama a liar and an anti-semite in interviews .
