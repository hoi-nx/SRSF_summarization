aviation experts today reassured travellers that the airbus a320 is still one of the safest planes in the world despite a crash in the french alps which claimed 150 lives
as emergency crews worked to retrieve wreckage from the site near digne-les-bains , in french , theories continued to circulate about what caused germanwings 9525 to fall from the skies
there has been some speculation about the track record of the model which experts were quick to quash
hayes , safety director at aviation consultancy ascend , said : ' the a320 family has a very good safety record considering that there is a fleet of 6,000 aircraft out there
' we have had a couple of events recently but in general jetliners do n't crash during the cruise , ' said hayes
patrick smith , an airline pilot and author of best - selling book cockpit confidential , allayed any fears the accident was purely down to the aircraft model
' the airbus a320 is a very sophisticated and popular model , ' patrick smith told mailonline
' i am not seeing anything in this accident that encourages me to think it is specific to that model
all airbus a320 models are designed similarly , and the airbus a320 is the blueprint for other variations such as the airbus a320 and the a321
' i do n't like the idea of blaming these accidents on specific models ; this question is asked all the time , and all it does it leads to aircraft being compared with other aircraft
' crashes are so rare , and so comparing them considering the type of model is statistically hair - splitting
' what you will also see is there is lots of discussion , and sadly lots of misunderstanding concerning how computers and how pilots ' fly ' the plane
' usually in these cases , there is n't a single case , and it is a chain of events that can lead to something like this happening
' wreckage and debris lie on the mountain slopes after the crash of the germanwings airbus a320 according to separate surveys published last year by manufacturers airbus a320 and boeing 737 , only 10 to 12 per cent of fatal accidents take place when the aircraft is at cruise height
the airbus a320 is described as a ' workhorse ' of the aerospace industry , transporting more than a million people a day from business travellers to backpackers
the 150 - seat medium - haul jet is one of the world 's most intensively used , together with its main rival , the boeing 737
the germanwings aircraft that crashed in the french alps yesterday , killing all 150 people on board , was also flying on the industry 's most widely - sold engines , made by french - us venture cfm
more than 3,600 of the jets are in operation and another 3,700 are waiting to be built as asia 's economic expansion fuels record demand
put together with the rest of the airbus a320 family of twin - engine , single - aisle jets - the a318 , airbus a320 and a321 - more than 6,000 are in use several times a day
experts say its safety record is among the industry 's highest , but it made grim headlines in december when an airbus a320 belonging to air asia plummeted into the java sea , killing all 162 people on board
the crash is still being investigated
the airbus a320 has been described as the ' workhorse ' of the aviation industry ( file photo ) to airlines , the main value of the Â£ 65million ( $ 97million ) jet is reliability and quick turnarounds , the features it shares with the rival 737
but it made dramatic headlines in 2009 when a us airways jet ditched safely in the hudson river after a bird strike
boeing 737 statistics for its rival 's best - selling model show that up to the end of 2013 , there were 0.14 fatal airbus a320 accidents per million departures where the plane was destroyed or written off
the comparable versions of boeing 737 had a rate of 0.11 per million departures , making them both among the industry 's safest models compared with the industry average of 0.76 , or more than 4.6 for the earliest days of the jet age
a helicopter of the french civil security services flies near seyne , south - eastern french near the crash site at 24 years old , however , the airbus a320 that crashed was at the upper end of the service life used by many first - tier airlines
jetliners are built to fly safely for considerably longer but most major airlines sell them sooner for economic reasons
patrick smith added : ' planes are built to last many years , so long as they are maintained in accordance with regulations , this should n't be an issue
' there are airline specific procedures as planes age , and obviously the older they get the stricter the checks will get
' jim morris , partner in uk law firm irwin mitchell , added : ' there are many airliners out there older than this that are flying safely
' germanwings parent lufthansa recently placed orders for over 100 new a320s
to ordinary passengers , the airbus a320 looks much like other jets
but in the cockpit it represented a revolution when it began service in 1988 as the first ' fly - by - wire ' jetliner relying on computers to fly within safe limits and replacing the usual control yoke with a side - stick , inspired by the f - 16 fighter
the increased reliance on computers , though increasingly common across the industry , prompted a bitter debate between airbus a320 and pilot unions over whether too much control was being taken out of human hands
the argument rumbles on to this day .
