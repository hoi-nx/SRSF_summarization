the results of an experiment on the iss to monitor how ants cope with zero - gravity has been published
researchers found they managed surprisingly well , using other ants or the surfaces and walls as anchors to climb
however , their ability to search collectively did not go perfectly as they tumbled and fell while trying to explore
nasa astronaut rick mastracchio is seen here observing the activities of the ants in space csi - 06 investigation aboard the iss the study , collective search by ants in microgravity , was published in the journal frontiers in ecology and evolution
the ants were taken to the station in january 2014 and subsequently studied by astronauts on board
ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules , judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell
working together , the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies
when the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines , covering more ground
but in the micro gravity of space , the ants ' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work
these flexible principles could be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way , for tasks like searching a burning building
â we had no idea what the ants would do
we did n't know if they would be able to search at all , â said professor deborah gordon , a biologist at stanford university , to the bbc
the experiment used eight different habitats in total , with each containing 80 common pavement ants
as barrier doors between the different sections were opened , the ants dispersed to search the new area
the astronauts then recorded the habitats with an hd video camera
a control experiment was carried out on earth , and the results - perhaps unsurprisingly - showed that those on the ground were much better at searching than those in space
in fact , the ants were not even able to explore the entirety of their habitats in space , as they found it tough to grip and dropped off the surface for up to eight seconds at a time
at any one moment , the researchers found that seven per cent of the ants were floating around
the ants in space csi - 06 investigation looked at how an ant colony responds to the extreme environment of microgravity aboard the iss to solve their collective need for resources
data gathered from this study may help with algorithms for robotics on earth
â the ants did not perform collective search as effectively in microgravity as they did in the ground controls , â the researchers wrote in their paper
â because ants in microgravity did not use straighter paths or traverse more distance when the area to be searched expanded , they did not search the area thoroughly
â the researchers noted that one of the reasons the ants struggled to explore their might have been that they were unable to interact with others easily
however , it was not all bad news ; the ants showed an â impressive ability to walk on the surface in microgravity , and an even more remarkable capacity to regain their contact with the surface once they were tumbling around in the air
â the ants also made efforts to remain in contact with the surface
the ultimate goal , though , was to see how they could overcome problems in their collective search method - such as in a human - dominated environment - something which the ants adapted to fairly well
