before getting married next week , there are a couple of things murray would like to achieve in his last tournament as a single man
the immediate goal is to pass the milestone of 500 career victories â he is within one win of doing so after beating colombia âs giraldo 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 in the third round of the miami open
murray can pass the mark on tuesday if he defuses the huge serving power of giant south african kevin anderson
murray could become the first british tennis player to win 500 career games if he beats kevin anderson should murray survive that encounter , it is possible he could edge ahead of rafael nadal and move back up to no 3 in the world rankings , although that also depends on the performances of others here
going past 500 is something nobody can take away from him , however , and it will stand as testament to his consistency at the top of the game
since tennis went open in 1968 â the old barriers between amateurs and professionals torn down to make a unified circuit â only 45 men have clocked that many wins
only eight who are currently active have managed it
murray defeatedsantiago giraldo of columbia in their third round match during the miami open no british player in that time has got there , tim henman pulling stumps on his career within four of the mark
murray said : â it âs nice because when you see the list of players who have won this many matches there are nât loads
â even if it does nât happen here then at some stage i âm sure i will get there
murray could leap ahead of rafael nadal in the rankings if he beats kevin anderson in the fourth round â i obviously want to win more and hopefully i still have quite a few years ahead of me to add to that number
â it âs not easy in this era to win that many matches , so it âs a good sign
â of those murray victories , 24 have come so far at this event , making it his most productive masters level tournament
murray and giraldo shake hands after their match which saw the scot progress to the next round factors like it being a familiar training base for murray â he has a home only three miles away from this key biscayne island site â and the tendency for it to be windy during the tournament have all contributed to that
he is one of the best at adapting to such conditions
after two days of unsettled weather that have hardly enhanced south florida âs reputation for reliable sunshine , it was a regulation glorious morning as he kicked off the programme against giraldo , one of the steady trickle of decent tennis players who come out of colombia
the no 27 seed , who beat murray in their previous meeting on the clay of madrid last year , is the kind of opponent who illustrates that racking up the wins on the atp tour is hardly a straightforward endeavour
murray 's form is improving as the season continues and he looks in good shape for wimbledon he gives the ball an almighty biff from the back court but was slowly unpicked by murray âs clever mix of angles and spins
the scot definitely looks a better player than he did a year ago , although the tendency towards the odd lapse in concentration is still evident
he let the south american , as usual enjoying good support in this part of the world , creep back from 5 - 1 down in the second set but then served it out at the second time of asking
