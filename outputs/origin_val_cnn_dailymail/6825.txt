the ' hit king ' is taking another swing at returning to baseball
rose , who agreed to a lifetime ban from mlb in 1989 after an investigation found he bet on the reds to win while managing the team , has submitted a new request to be reinstated
the career hits leader ( 4,256 ) applied for reinstatement in september 1997 and met in november 2002 with previous mlb commissioner selig , who never ruled on the application
rob manfred said after meeting with the los angeles dodgers in spring training on monday that he has a formal request from rose
he said : ' what i intend to do is be in communication with his representatives , and we 'll talk about how we 'll handle it from a process perspective
' rose , who turns 74 next month , denied for 15 years that he bet on baseball
in his 2004 autobiography , rose : my prison without bars , he came clean about betting on the reds
the new commissioner was not involved in the investigation into rose 's gambling as it was handled by outside lawyer john dowd
he said : ' i want to make sure i understand all of the details in the dowd report and commissioner giamatti 's decision
' i want to hear what rose has to say , and i 'll make a decision
' rose won the world series in 1975 and 1976 with the reds and in 1980 while he was a member of the philadelphia phillies the mlb career hits leader ( 4,256 ) will be at the 2015 all star game july in cincinnati , ohio the hall of fame ( pictured ) voted to ban players on the permanently ineligible list from induction in 1991 if rob manfred did reinstate rose , it would be a step towards him eventually reaching hall of fame
the hall of fame voted to ban players on the permanently ineligible list from induction in 1991
even if rose is put back on the baseball writers ' association of america ballot , members of the group will not necessarily vote him in despite his hall of fame - worthy statistics
in addition to managing the reds , rose also played for the team for nearly 20 seasons and helped the club win the world series in 1975 and 1976
he also won the world series as a member of the philadelphia phillies in 1980
rob manfred is a member of the hall of fame board , but he said he has not spoken with the hall about its plans for rose , according to espn
he said : ' honestly , i do n't think people should read any disposition into what i 'm saying about this
' i see it as a really simple thing
he 's made a request
' part of my obligations under the major league constitution is to deal with those requests , and i 'll deal with it
' these days , rose spends his time is las vegas signing baseballs for money
that may not fit the lifestyle commissioner giamatti suggested when the ban agreement was announced
giamatti said at the time : ' the burden is entirely on mr rose to reconfigure his life in a way he deems appropriate .
