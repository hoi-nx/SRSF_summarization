in september 2002 , then - former israel prime minister netanyahu told a united states congressional committee " there is absolutely no question whatsoever " that hussein 's iraq was developing nuclear weapons at " portable manufacturing sites of mass death
" once hussein had nuclear weapons , netanyahu warned , " the terror network will have nuclear weapons , " placing " the security of the entire world at risk
" fast forward to this week , and netanyahu was back , this time as prime minister , to make virtually identical claims about iran
yet not only has the united states intelligence community disagreed with netanyahu 's assessment of iran nuclear intentions , so does israel 's , according to leaked documents
indeed , more than 200 retired security officers have publicly criticized netanyahu as a danger to israel 's security
sadly , netanyahu 's presentation reinforces caricatures regularly advanced by united states and gulf arab pundits -- caricatures of iran as aspiring middle east hegemon , bent on overthrowing an otherwise stable regional order
it 's a misguided perspective that is actually hurting the united states
in netanyahu 's view , united states should only improve relations with an iran that stops its regional " aggression , " its support for " terrorism , " and its " threat [ s ] to annihilate ... israel
" in other words , united states should not improve relations with an iran whose regional influence is rising
in reality , iran 's rise is not only normal , it is actually essential to a more stable region
as nuclear talks with tehran enter a decisive phase , rapprochement with a genuinely independent iran -- not a nominally independent iran whose strategic orientation is subordinated to united states preferences -- is vital to halting the decline of united states 's strategic position
washington has long worked to consolidate a highly militarized , pro-american middle east order
yet these efforts -- pursued across democratic and republican administrations and intensified after 9/11 -- have clearly failed
as a result , the middle east today is less stable , more riven with sectarian and ethnic conflict , and more violent than at any point in its modern history
and united states , in a textbook illustration of " imperial overstretch , " has made itself weaker , both regionally and globally
united states 's quest for middle east hegemony has failed for many reasons
for a start , seeking dominance impels washington to replicate , in multiple venues , its faustian bargain with imperial iran from 1953 until the last shah 's overthrow in 1979 , providing substantial and effectively open - ended support to governments acting against the desires of their own publics
while united states elites argue that united states benefits from such arrangements , they are ultimately unsustainable , as iran 's 1979 revolution demonstrated
a determination to dominate the middle east keeps locking washington into these kinds of relationships ; for its own sake , the united states needs to stop trying to be the middle east 's hegemon
that means embracing a regional balance of power -- not the chimera of united states dominance misleadingly labeled as " balance , " but an actual balance in which major regional states , acting in their own interests , constrain one another
under any political system , iran would be a significant regional actor , due to its geostrategic location , hydrocarbon resources , and large , educated population
but the islamic republic -- which iran built themselves as a participatory islamist system representing their interests , not those of rulers beholden to foreign powers -- has a legitimacy united states must accept to foster a truly stable middle east
iran has gained influence in iraq , lebanon , afghanistan , syria and yemen by backing political structures that , in tehran 's judgment , will produce governments committed to foreign policy independence
washington needs cooperation with just such an iran against common foes like the islamic state of iraq and syria , and to balance counterproductive policies of united states 's regional allies
washington 's self - damaging drive for middle east hegemony is inextricably linked to its unconditional support for an increasingly extreme and unrepresentative israel
a myth prevails that united states 's bond with israel flows from " shared democratic values " and response to the holocaust
in fact , washington only started providing israel with significant military assistance and diplomatic impunity after the 1967 war , when israel seized pivotal territory from egypt and syria , two soviet allies opposed to united states regional dominance
for the remainder of and after the cold war , united states officials calculated that ensuring israel 's military superiority over its neighbors helped united states pursue hegemony over the middle east , even as occupying millions more palestinians clearly made israel less democratic
( the united states government 's own demographic data show that the number of arabs under israel control -- in " green line " israel , gaza , the golan heights , east jerusalem and the west bank -- exceeds that of israel jews , making the israel state a minority regime for the people it governs )
a state representing all these people would not occupy arabs populations or seek ever greater freedom of military initiative in its neighborhood
israel 's pursuit of these policies -- facilitated by united states guarantees of its " qualitative military edge " -- conditions washington 's commitment to keeping over 100 million arabs under united states - backed autocracies and puts united states on a war footing with an iran unwilling to join this inherently unstable regional order
the reality is that israel 's concern about iran nuclearization is not that tehran will use ( at the moment nonexistent ) nuclear weapons against a nuclear - armed israel
instead , as then - defense minister ehud barak explained in 2012 , it is that a nuclear iran would " restrict our range of operations
" but this is precisely what a truly stable balance of power requires
united states needs constructive relations with all major regional states , including iran , so that they constrain one another 's reckless impulses .
