none of this " eat to live " stuff for me
i am a champion eater
no carb is safe â no fat , either , ' she readily admits
' at a recent dinner party i shared bread and olive oil , followed by chocolate ice cream with my husband
a woman near me looked at me , appalled , and i thought , " i do n't care , " ' she writes
women over 50 typically have to choose between preserving either their face or their butts and she writes that she has happily chosen the former

' i am incapable of this

bergen was nominated for an emmy award seven times , winning five , for her role as murphy brown , left
in the 1960s she had also modeled for vogue as her acting career was taking off , right ' there was something in the writing of the murphy brown character that hooked me , as she eventually hooked many women
' is it that she was , in many ways , who we wished we could be as women ? successful in a field dominated by men ? free of the need to please ? impolitic , impolite , yet in some weird way , irresistible ? ' despite the network initially trying to have the role rewritten for a younger actress such as heather locklear , writer - producer diane insisted it had to be about a 40 - something woman fresh out of the betty ford clinic
' the character fit me like a glove
i was instantly comfortable with the writing , ' recalls bergen
' diane had created a complex , original , endearing , feisty , take - no - prisoners woman
and more surprisingly , a woman who cared not a whit what others thought of her
that character gave me permission to be my brattiest , bawdiest self
' bergen writes that the character was the first time she felt able to thrown myself into a role ' with such abandon and joy

but while her big screen roles had played on her ' glacial nordic looks ' , the role of murphy brown allowed her to express must more range
' what i had going for me was the element of surprise
no one ever expected me to be funny , not least because of my glacial nordic looks and affect , ' she writes
' i 'd mostly been reviled in my acting career
my oscar nomination for starting over was an anomaly ; basically i 'd had fifteen years of bad notices by the time murphy brown came along
' as well as receiving recognition for her acting talent , bergen said the role also saw her receive recognition as a style icon
' i wanted every outfit to be an event
and in a way , they were
women loved what murphy brown wore , ' she writes
bergen even lays claim to inventing the open - backed baseball cap
bergen was married for 15 years to french director louis malle before he died of cancer in 1995 ' when i wanted to wear a baseball cap with a high ponytail , we could n't find one with an opening in the back , so judy mcgiveney , our wardrobe woman , made one by cutting a hole in the back , ' she writes
' a couple of months after the show aired , you could buy them in any store
' bergen writes that she enjoyed ten years of ' insane fun ' playing murphy brown
' yet i never wanted it to end ; doing murphy brown was insanely fun
when the writing was good , it was a giddy , joyous experience
i was the most comfortable and confident i 'd ever been , ' she writes
' the part was a godsend â a fantastic role that completely suited me
my friends were all happy for me ; it was unusual for a woman my age to get that role and that success
