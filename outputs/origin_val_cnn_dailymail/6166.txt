australia reached the semi-final âs of the world cup as they defeated pakistan by six wickets on friday
under the lights at the adelaide oval a drop by rahat ali proved to be the turning point as australia chased down the below - par 213 set by pakistan
the recalled hazlewood took 4 - 35 to restrict the 1992 world cup winners to such a low total before shane watson hit an unbeaten 64 to give the hosts victory in a fiercely contested tie
starc celebrates a wicket with his team - mates as australia ripped through pakistan 's batting line - up sohail khan successfully appeals for the wicket of aaron finch , as pakistan fought back with the ball sohail khan puts down a catch in the outfield , as pakistan failed to take their chances and apply the pressure aggressive , brave , attacking captaincy choices have been the building blocks for the best sides in the world cup so far
brendon mccullum , ab de villiers and today michael clarke are proving that despite the wickets by - and - large being a paradise for batsmen , their ingenuity can and does lead to success
yet misbah brings his own unique style of captaincy to the table with a calm demeanour , even in the face of collapse and struggle , that breeds belief within his side and almost earned them a shock win
pakistan came into the match in a confident mood , on the back of four successive victories , following heavy defeats in the first two matches of the world cup group stage
batting first , after winning the toss , seemed the sub-continental side âs best chance of defeating australia
sarfraz ahmed , pakistan âs centurion in their previous match against ireland , could nât replicate his heroics as he edged starc to a diving shane watson at slip for 10
and hazlewood , brought back at the expense of pat cummins , justified his selection as he sent down a wide ball that moved away from ahmed shehzad and was edged to michael clarke at second slip
wahab can not hide his disappointment as , despite a strong spell , pakistan came up short shane watson ( left ) and steve smith ( right ) steadied the ship as australia eventually made it home safely with both of pakistan âs openers back in shed , the indomitable misbah strode to the crease , in what was to be his final one - day international match
the circumstances , with pakistan 24 - 2 in the sixth over , were nothing new to pakistani captain who has long been called upon to be the saviour of the side â not least in this world cup
but every great sporting saviour needs a bit of luck from time to time and misbah âs came just two balls into his innings
hazlewood steamed in , saw the ball clip the 40 - year - old âs thigh pad and hit leg stump , the bails lit - up but then stayed in place
it was a lifeline both misbah and his side desperately needed and along with haris , pakistan âs innings began to be rebuilt
the pair shared a 73 - run third wicket partnership and just when they looked ready to propel their side to a competitive total , greed became the undoing of their usually risk - free leader misbah
misbah-ul-haq top scored for pakistan with 34 , as they lost wickets at regular intervals against australia umar akmal works the ball away behind square on the offside , as plenty of pakistan batsmen got in and out starc dives to take a catch which ends the pakistan innings in the final over of their 50 equally it took a stroke of genius and bravery from australian captain michael clarke , who brought maxwell back despite misbah having twice previously sending the allrounder clear of the ropes and initially sending him out of the attack
but , it was maxwell who had the last laugh as the right - handed batsman eyed the shortest boundary once more but instead holed - out to aaron finch in the deep for 34
it was a sad end for one of pakistan âs greatest players , who passed 3,000 odi runs as captain during his innings
a typical johnson short ball got rid of the set haris ( 41 ) before maxwell claimed his second scalp of the innings as umar akmal ( 20 ) was dismissed in an identical fashion to his captain
so at 124 - 5 shahid â boom boom â afridi , the only batsman to have hit more sixes than fours in odi âs , was required to clear the ropes a few times
though he did that , smashing three four âs and one six in his innings , he needed to make far more than the 23 of 15 balls that he amassed
pakistan bowled well early on , but did n't take their chances as australia began to exert control australia âs fast bowlers ; hazlewood and starc ( 2 - 40 ) had been on top from the beginning of proceedings and after bowling out their opposition for just 213 , they were the side on top going into the break
the statistics really best summed up pakistan âs batting performance ; eight batsmen made double figures , none of them passed 50 , all 10 were out caught
pace bowlers have dominated the world cup thus far and with both sides boasting some of the best in business it was of little surprise that australia faltered in their chase of their modest target
sohail khan trapped finch plumb in front for just two and although finch reviewed the decision , there was no changing how straight the delivery was
what followed , from the eighth over onwards was a masterclass in brutal but glorious fast bowling from wahab
the 29 - year - old âs first over accounted for the dangerous david warner for 24 as he sent a short and wide delivery down third man âs throat
wahab âs second got rid of michael clarke ( 8 ) as another well - directed short ball was gleefully taken by sohaib maqsood at forward short leg
the left - handed bowler continued to steam in and had shane watson scampering around as if he was holding a bat for the first time
steve smith hit an excellent half century to set australia back on the path to victory at the adelaide oval and for all the world the sensational spell looked to be ending with a third wicket to wahab âs name but for a spectacularly poor drop by rahat ali at fine leg as shane watson sent the ball to him
meanwhile at the other end steve smith , easily australia âs best batsman for the past 12 months , was batting supremely and with great composure as he passed 50 for the third consecutive innings
but having made 65 , the 25 - year - old seemed to momentarily lose concentration and fell lbw to a fuller ehsan adil delivery
the task of seeing australia home then fell on shane watson 's shoulders and despite his troubles at the beginning of his innings , he shared an unbeaten 68 - run partnership with maxwell ( 44 not out ) as australia reached their target with 16 overs to spare
undeniably wahab produced one the greatest world cup bowling spells and deserved so much more then to be on the losing side
australia may have outplayed india , their semi-final opponents , during the tri-series prior to the world cup but the match on thursday will be very different
the 2011 world cup champions have considerably raised their game and australia will face their sternest test yet in sydney as they chase a fifth world cup title .
