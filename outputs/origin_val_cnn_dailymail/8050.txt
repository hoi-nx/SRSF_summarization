when liverpool and united meet at anfield on sunday , there will not be a single local lad starting in this iconic fixture for the first time in the premier league era
april 26 1992 , the final time the two sides met in the old division one , was the last time no player in liverpool 's starting xi was born within 30 miles of anfield or a united player within the same distance from old trafford
in the 53 league and cup meetings since , the likes of steven gerrard - likely to start from the bench on sunday - jamie carragher , steve mcmanaman and fowler have starred for liverpool , while united 's local lads have included paul scholes , gary and phil neville , nicky butt and welbeck
steven gerrard looks dejected in defeat after liverpool were beaten 3 - 0 by united last december local lad james wilson also started that game for united manchester - born welbeck tackled by steven gerrard at anfield last season jamie carragher ( left ) and gary nevill during a game at old trafford in march 2010 wayne rooney , a designated scouser , does n't count ( although he was born less than four miles from anfield ) , while ryan giggs is also excluded as he was born in wales
back in april 1992 , when liverpool won 2 - 0 at home , there were 11 english players on the pitch , but none born within 30 miles of either stadium
in fact , the closest on that day was rob jones , born 31 miles from anfield - but in wales
while lancashire lad mike phelan , born 29 miles from old trafford , came off the bench that day for united
liverpool 's fowler is sent tumbling by united 's nicky butt in march 2001 liverpool players michael owen ( left ) , fowler ( centre ) and steve mcmanaman celebrate after beating newcastle in the league cup in january 1998 ryan giggs of united goes past liverpool 's jonjo shelvey in january 2011 in the most recent encounter between the two sides , a 3 - 0 home win for united in december , both clubs featured a local lad from the start
steven gerrard began the game for liverpool , while james wilson , born in staffordshire 27.5 miles away from old trafford , was selected by louis van gaal
like steven gerrard , there is also a possibility that james wilson and tyler blackett - also born in manchester - could feature on sunday
jon flanagan , meanwhile , will return at some stage from injury to boost the reds ' scouse contingent
but with the departure of welbeck from united last summer , and steven gerrard leaving liverpool at the end of the season , the chances are that the trend of no local lads starting the biggest game in english football will continue for a little while longer .
