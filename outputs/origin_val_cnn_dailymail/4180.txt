' i do nât think it âs irresponsible for people to have pit bulls and children
they âre dogs just like any other dog
' no matter what the breed it is , it is hundred per cent how you raise them
' however , mr grennan acknowledges that a dog the size of the hulk ' could kill someone if it was in the wrong situation at the wrong time ' and ' snap an arm like a toothpick
' the grennan 's dog is almost three - times bigger than a normal u.s. pit bull terrier
he is also still a puppy meaning he could grow even bigger
each day he is fed a protein - rich diet consisting of supplements and 4lbs of ground beef
the grennans believe the bigger the dog , the better
