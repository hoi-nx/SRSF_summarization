phuoc , three , from canada who received a life - saving liver transplant from her father , has had her long - awaited homecoming postponed after contracting norovirus
the toddler , who was possibly going to be released this week , remains in hospital as she recovers from the stomach flu
phuoc and her twin sister binh , adopted from vietnamese , were both in need of liver transplants because they suffer from alagille syndrome , a genetic condition
last month , their father michael wagner was able to give a portion of his liver to phuoc - leaving him with an impossible decision after being a match for both girls , but only able to give the donation to one daughter
following doctors ' suggestions that he give the transplant to phuoc since she needed it the soonest , they underwent surgery in february
the pair were reunited in a heart - warming moment shared by the family after the successful surgery
however in good news , reports last month said the hospital for sick children in toronto had received 400 submissions from people offering to be a living donor for binh
mrs wagner wrote on facebook : ' no homecoming yet - norovirus is keeping phuoc in hospital
and norovirus in my house as well
home front needs to be clear before they can come home
' only a few days ago , she had written of the reunion between the girls , and also her nervous feelings about welcoming phuoc back after her surgery
mr phuoc and daughter phuoc went into surgery on february 10 , and five days after the operation , the family posted a video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in phuoc 's hospital room
mrs wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well , and updated supporters on her husband and daughter 's recovery in the run - up to the surgery , mr phuoc said it has been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls ( above , phuoc pictured right , with her mother , left , holding binh ) ' binh and phuoc will soon be reunited
talks of phuoc 's release from hospital this week
some time spent together before binh 's transplant will be beneficial
both girls keep asking for each other and the family needs to be reunited , ' she wrote
' it is scary though to welcome her back so soon after transplant
a lot of new stuff to assimilate
daily nursing visits for weeks to come to administer iv meds and perform bloodwork
' but most of all , the fear of something going wrong , and quickly
no germs allowed in our household
a lot of quiet time needed to allow for full recovery for both daddy and phu-phu
' mr phuoc and daughter phuoc went into surgery on february 10 , and five days after the operation , the family posted a video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in phuoc 's hospital room
mrs wagner ( above with binh at their family home ) wrote on facebook that the girls keep asking to see each other while phuoc is still in hospital
she confirmed that their search continues for a living donor for binh the mother shared her concerns about welcoming phuoc back after her surgery and having nervous feelings about something going wrong ( above her post on facebook ) ' hey mon belle ! ' mr phuoc says to his little girl , which translates to ' hey my beauty ' in french
he then moves to side of phuoc 's bed and kisses her on the head and asks how she fells in french , as the two share a tender father - daughter moment
mrs wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well , and updated supporters on her husband and daughter 's recovery , as well as their continued search to find a donor for binh
' so hard to believe we are hitting the one week mark : it seems like a blur , ' mrs wagner wrote on facebook
' michael wagner still in hospital , phuoc still on morphine , and mommy holding on on coffee
still a fair amount of discomfort for michael wagner but he managed to visit his little girl two days in a row
' in the run - up to the surgery , mr phuoc said it has been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls
the wagners said the girls â doctor was the one who ultimately decided that phuoc would get her father âs liver based on medical necessity
the hospital for sick children in toronto has received 400 submissions from people wanting to be donors for binh ' the cruel part of the liver is that you can only do it once , ' he told the site yahoo canada
the wagners said the girls â doctor was the one who ultimately decided that phuoc would get her father âs liver based on medical necessity
gary levy , who runs the liver donor program at the toronto general hospital , told the canadian press vial global news that donors can give up to 70 per cent of their liver , which will regrow to its full size , but it can only be done once
the wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take binh and phuoc in
mrs wagner said : ' when we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked , really
' they were nine pounds at 18 months
so we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that 's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they did n't make it
' despite the health problems , mrs wagner does not regret her decision
she said : ' we look back and we have no regrets
' we would travel this path all over again
they have taught us openness , they have taught our children sharing and openness
it 's been nothing but a wonderful mess
' mr phuoc and his wife johanne adopted phuoc and binh when they were 18 months old after seeing they were in poor health at a vietnamese orphanage
