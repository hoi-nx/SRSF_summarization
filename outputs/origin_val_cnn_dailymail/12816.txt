the white - haired woman 's face beams as the camera gets closer to her face
she 's sitting on a couch , with a university of oklahoma shirt draped behind her and a rap song playing in the background
suddenly , the words spew from her pink - painted lips : " ni * * * * , ni * * * * , ni * * * * , ni * * * * , ni * * * * , ni * * * * , ni * * * * * ! " the release of the vine video , featuring the house mother of the campus ' sae chapter , could n't come at a worse time -- just days after video surfaced of frat members singing a racist song
but gilbow , the fraternity 's house mother , insists she 's not racist
and two black alumni of the fraternity house agree with the woman they call " mom b. " " i have been made aware that a video of me that is circulating on social media and in the news , " gilbow said in a statement
" i am heartbroken by the portrayal that i am in some way racist
i have friends of all race and do not tolerate any form of discrimination in my life
the song in the background was the sound of " all gold everything " from james -- a black , atlanta - based rapper
" i was singing along to a trinidad song , but completely understand how the video must appear in the context of the events that occurred this week
" william bruce james ii , the most recent black member at the fraternity chapter , said no one should use the n - word in any context -- even if it 's just a song
" that word needs to die , " james told cnn tonight
" with that being said , i do n't believe that mom b. has hatred in her heart
i was there with her for four years
she took great care of me ... she cared about me , she cares about my family
she had pictures of me , my wife , my children on the entryway table in that house
mom b means a lot to me
" james said he has reached to mom b. after the oklahoma daily newspaper posted the clip , which was shot in 2013
" i essentially said , ' hey , do n't ever use that word again , even in a song
but from me , you 're forgiven
' " black ou alumnus : ' they are not my brothers ' davis , the first african-american - african-american member of the campus ' sae chapter , also defended " mom b. " " i would n't even hesitate for a split second to say that mom b. is undoubtedly not a racist , " davis said
" i see her as being caught up in the moment
she does like to mix it up socially , and she likes to have fun with the guys and their dates they bring over to the house
and i see this as maybe her getting caught away with the moment
" ou 's sae chapter unraveled this week after video showed frat brothers singing about excluding black students and alluding to lynching
" there will never be a ni * * * * sae , " some chanted
" you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me
there will never be a ni * * * * sae
" two students expelled over racist chant after the fraternity chapter was suspended -- but before her own video was publicized -- gilbow told cnn affiliate koco-tv that she was blindsided by the controversy
" i feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me , " she said
" this has been my life for 15 years
" in the end , the sae chapter was forced to close
two students have been expelled
and it 's not clear what the next chapter is for mom b. opinion : are frats ' a form of african-american apartheid ' ? cnn 's greg botelho contributed to this report .
