after a career spent going head - to - head in the champions league , barcelona captain xavi and former chelsea midfielder frank lampard are about to become team - mates , with the spain international finalising negotiations on a move to new york
the 35 - year - old midfielder , who has played more games than any player in barcelona âs history and won every honour possible , will join manchester city âs mls franchise at the end of this season ready to start playing for them in 2016
xavi ( centre ) celebrates after collecting the second of his three champions league medals in 2009 the veteran midfielder ( left ) has only been a bit - part player under luis enrique this season at barcelona spanish radio station cadena ser reported on wednesday that the player , his father joaquã­n and his agent ivan corretja met with a representative from the club at the l'arrosseria xã tiva restaurant in barcelona just a stone âs throw from the nou camp to negotiate his move to the us
xavi looked set to leave barcelona last summer but decided to stay for one more season after a conversation with coach luis enrique
despite that commitment he has played only a small role this campaign and played no part in barcelona âs 2 - 1 victory over manchester city last week
his departure from barcelona will mark the end of an era
he joined the club as an 11 - year - old and went on to make more than 700 appearances
he has won seven la liga titles and three champions leagues
xavi 's former barcelona team - mate david villa ( above ) is already at new york ex-england midfielder frank lampard is unveiled at the new mls franchise in july 2014 it was pep guardiola who famously said of the young midfielder he saw coming through barcelona âs youth system : â this player will retire me â
he ended up playing alongside him briefly before leaving the club and returning to build a team around the spain star who also played 133 times for his country
xavi 's signing for new york is a major coup and will also reunite him with former spain and barcelona team - mate david villa , who will be expected to thrive on the service offered him by xavi , and frank lampard who also joins the mls new boys after winning 11 major trophies at chelsea in a 13 - year period .
