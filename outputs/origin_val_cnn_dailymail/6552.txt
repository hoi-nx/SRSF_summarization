button fears mclaren will qualify at the very back of the grid for sunday âs australian grand prix
the british driver and his team - mate kevin magnussen , who is deputising for the injured fernando alonso , endured a miserable day during practice for the season opener at the albert park circuit
the mclaren pair , hampered by reliability problems to their new honda engine , managed only 13 laps between them in friday âs opening session and were five seconds down on nico rosberg âs best time for mercedes
button cut a frustrated figure in melbourne on friday as mclaren struggled for pace and reliability button was almost four seconds slower than nico rosberg , who set the pace for mercedes on friday and while button managed to get more running under his belt during the second session , completing 21 laps , he was still almost four seconds down on the front - running mercedes
kevin magnussen posted four laps before losing control of his mclaren at turn six and crashing into the barriers
backmarkers manor , who did nât compete at any of the winter tests , failed to take to the track on friday , and button fears a similar no - show tomorrow will see mclaren bring up the rear for sunday âs curtain raiser in melbourne
kevin magnussen loses control of his mclaren at turn six and runs into the gravel before crashing out the dane did n't take any further part in the session with his car in bits before it was taken back to the garage â i am hoping it wo nât be the last row of the grid , â said button , a three - time winner in melbourne , when asked about his hopes for qualifying
â hopefully 20 cars will run
it wo nât be easy and we all know it
we are working as one and we are not pointing any fingers
we are just solving the problems as we go
hopefully we will be competitive sooner rather than later
â mclaren , powered by honda for the first time since 1992 , had a pre-season to forget as they struggled for pace and reliability
and getting to the chequerd flag on sunday will now be considered a positive result for a team which has nât tasted victory in over two years
â i have no goals in terms of position , â said button
â the important thing is to make sure we maximise everything we have and then look at timesheets in qualifying and the race , see how we fared , and how much work we have to do
â mclaren are powered by honda this year , but face an uphill struggle and may bring up the rear in melbourne
