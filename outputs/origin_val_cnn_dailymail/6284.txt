he 's the internet - savvy modern leader who cuddles up to kittens and hobnobs with film stars on his wildly popular instagram page
but chechen president ramzan kadyrov is also a former warlord accused of running the russian republic ' like a medieval tyrant '
the 38 - year - old came to power in 2007 after a vicious armed struggle with a number of other chechen strongmen and a political battle with the man he succeeded as leader , alkhanov
claims that ramzan kadyrov keeps a ' murder list ' of 300 names of people to be liquidated surfaced in 2008
yet the brutal reality of how ramzan kadyrov maintains his grip on power has been glossed over by his social media skills and voracious appetite for posting on instagram
the austin powers star was in grozny to shoot thriller turquoise when the snap was taken in may 2013 ramzan kadyrov in medieval garb
he has posted on his instagram account kadyrov_95 more than 4,800 times and has an incredible 905,000 followers the former chechen warlord lies down for a snooze with a pet tiger
ramzan kadyrov is a fan of the big cats the father - of - eight has uploaded more than 4,800 posts and has around 905,000 followers to his kadyrov_95 account on the photo - sharing site
he has shown a particular fondness for snaps of himself with cute fluffy kittens , baby birds , lambs and even tigers
in may 2013 he posted snaps of himself with liz hurley and a white kitten on instagram after meeting the actress when she arrived in chechen to film thriller turquoise with france actor gerard depardieu
the pair were seen apparently bonding over the tiny animal having been introduced by ramzan kadyrov 's friend gerard depardieu
in another shot the chechen strongman leans across the austin powers star and runs his finger over the smartphone she is holding as the two appear perfectly at ease with each other
gerard depardieu met the chechen leader at his birthday celebrations two years previously and later controversially accepted russian citizenship after quitting france to avoid a planned 75 per cent tax on millionaires

things get weirder as he shows a fondness for medieval costume in another shot and poses with yet more fluffy cats perching on his shoulder and reclining in his arms
the burly enforcer has a go at playing the world 's biggest softy as he lovingly cups a baby chick in his enormous hands
and the shots of him with a tiger are probably the most bizarre of all , as he pillows his head on the young big cat on top of an ornate rug and has it on his lap with a lead around its neck as he sits between two associates
and yet this is the man whose widely feared ' kadyrovtsy ' militia several thousand - strong , are accused by human rights groups of involvement in kidnappings , assassinations and torture throughout their patron 's rise to power
they were formed during the first chechen war for independence between 1994 and 1995 when ramzan kadyrov 's father , chechen 's grand mufti or highest islamic official , declared jihad against russian
the former warlord ( centre ) and another bizarre snap of him with a tiger which even has lead round its neck his may have his own ' kadyrovtsy ' militia but the chechen leader is happy to pose with yet more kittens ramzan kadyrov cuddles up to a lamb on a chechen farm
he rules the once restive russian republic with an iron fist chechen 's president with a baby chick
he also posted this kitten on his wildly popular instagram account but the ramzan kadyrov clan switched their allegiance to moscow at the beginning of the second chechen war in 1999 , since when continued insurgents against the kremlin have been ruthlessly dealt with by the militia
the paramilitary clashed with forces loyal to fellow warlord yamadayev in march 2008 and a year later ramzan kadyrov 's rival was dead , assassinated in dubai in a hit reputedly ordered by one of ramzan kadyrov 's cousins
the son of assassinated former chechen president kadyrov also prevailed in his fight with paramilitary leader said-magomed kakiyev , while ramzan kadyrov successfully angled for russian president vladimir putin to dismiss alkhanov and appoint him leader instead
since then it is widely accepted that vladimir putin has given kadyrov carte blanche to run chechen as his own personal fiefdom , provided he keeps the separatist forces which temporarily ripped the republic from the kremlin 's grasp in the 1990s are kept in check
aside from yamadayev a string of other kadryov opponents have wound up dead in locations stretching from moscow to istanbul and vienna , though the man himself has always denied involvement in any of their killings
ramzan kadyrov hugs a man in a bear suit in front of the neon backdrop of the chechen capital grozny 's skyline the former warlord posted this viral video of a panda rolling down a snow covered hill on his instagram page this short film of pandas on a slide at the chengdu panda base in china was another posted by ramzan kadyrov the video has more than 9million times on youtube , and likely picked up some of those thanks to ramzan kadyrov russian investigative journalist anna politkovskaya was shot dead in the capital in october 2006 while she was reportedly working on a story about torture and human rights abuses in chechen
some observers laid the blame for the killing at ramzan kadyrov 's door
a month later movladi baisarov , a former commander of the chechen presidential security services turned ramzan kadyrov opponent , was also shot dead in moscow
he had branded kadyrov ' a medieval tyrant ' , adding : ' if someone tells the truth about what is going on , it 's like signing one 's own death warrant
' ramzan kadyrov is a law unto himself
he can do anything he likes
he can take any woman and do whatever he pleases with her
' ramzan acts with total impunity
i know of many people executed on his express orders and i know exactly where they were buried
' and in a remarkable statement posted on instagram , ramzan kadyrov praised one of the men charged with the murder of russian opposition leader boris nemtsov in moscow as a ' fearless and brave ' ' patriot of russian ' who was ' ready to give his life for the motherland ' .
