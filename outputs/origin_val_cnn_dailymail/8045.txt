' the failure to detect a fracture on an x-ray is the most common diagnostic error made in a&e , ' says kelly , an orthopaedic trauma surgeon shirley johnstone had mixed feelings when the a&e doctor said the x-ray of her elbow showed no sign of a fracture
â it was a relief there was no serious damage
but i was in agony â i could nât move or straighten my arm , and felt i needed more than just paracetamol and a few days off work , â recalls shirley johnstone , 60 , a chef from great wakering in essex
the pain had begun suddenly when she stretched up to adjust a showerhead
â at first i thought i âd slept on my arm badly , â she says
â but it was so painful , my partner advised me to get it checked
â six days after she was seen at a&e , shirley johnstone received a phone call from the hospital
doctors had reviewed the x-ray and there was a fracture after all , in the olecranon , the protruding bone that forms the tip of the elbow
it was a mistake that , four years on , is still affecting shirley johnstone âs life
for a second x-ray showed that the fractured bone fragments had moved 4mm in the intervening days
her arm was put in a cast , then a week later she had surgery to pin the bone in place
but a year after the operation she developed a painful infection because fluid had built up around the fracture
and three years later she still gets pain in the joint , especially in cold weather
â i had to have so much time off work , i was demoted and put on a lower wage , â she says
â i âve never got back on track
â shirley johnstone has never had a proper explanation for the delay in spotting the fracture
â one doctor told me , â i âm afraid sometimes these things get missed â , â she says
every year one person in 100 in the uk breaks a bone , and about half the 20 million or so visits to a&e involve having an x-ray , mostly to check for bone injury
but research suggests that thousands of patients walk out of a&e with doctors having failed to spot their fracture
â numerous studies have shown that failure to detect a fracture on an x-ray is the most common diagnostic error made in a&e , â says kelly , consultant orthopaedic trauma surgeon at north bristol nhs trust
and if a broken bone is not stabilised quickly , the impact can be devastating
â at the very least , people suffer prolonged pain and inconvenience , â says mr kelly , â but it can also lead to â chronic functional limitation with long - term pain , early symptoms of osteoarthritis or a stiff joint
â the bone may also fail to fuse and need complex surgery later
so why does it happen ? ordering the correct x-ray , then detecting an abnormality on the image takes skill and experience
yet a&e patients are most likely to be seen by junior doctors , with new doctors â fresh from medical school being the most senior staff working at evenings and weekends in one in five a&e departments â , according to a study by the college of emergency medicine
â you can identify a major fracture of a large long bone across the room , â says mr kelly
â but more subtle injuries require a systematic approach that comes with experience
â about half the 20 million or so visits to a&e involve having an x-ray , mostly to check for bone injury a study published in the british medical journal in 2002 showed that junior doctors in a&e miss up to 39 per cent of â clinically significant abnormalities â on x-rays
this is why many , but not all , hospitals have introduced a safety net : all x-rays should be reviewed by a specialist â either a radiologist ( a clinician specialising in interpreting scan images ) or a specially trained radiographer , whose main job is taking x-rays
this can make a big difference
a study at north tyneside general found that people whose fractures were reviewed only by an a&e doctor were ten times more likely to be wrongly given the all - clear
and patients whose x-rays were checked by a specialist before they left a&e were three times less likely to have a missed fracture , according to a 2013 study by the university of bradford school of health studies
however , there is currently no time - based target for specialist reviews , which can be postponed for weeks
a recent audit of missed fractures and abnormalities at one london hospital revealed that , at worst , it took 48 days before x-rays were reviewed
meanwhile , a survey of a quarter of nhs radiology departments last year revealed it had taken more than 30 days before over 80,000 x-rays were reviewed by a radiologist
â this suggests that nationally about 300,000 patients are waiting more than a month for their x-rays to be analysed , â says dr giles maskell , president of the royal college of radiologists
this means the nhs also picks up a substantial bill for surgery and other treatments that would have been avoided if fractures were detected earlier
yet observers have noted an increase in missed fractures
rebecca campbell , a clinical negligence solicitor at slater and gordon , says the firm has seen a rise in cases of patients misdiagnosed with sprains and soft - tissue injuries , only to be later diagnosed with fractures that could be clearly seen in the first radiology images
â as a result , the patients have had a delay in treatment , often resulting in the fractures becoming worse , â she says
certain types of fractures are more susceptible to being missed in x-rays certain types of fractures are more susceptible to being missed
â hairline fractures , where the bone is broken but not misaligned , appear as a fine line on an x-ray which can be overlooked , â says dr adrian boyle , emergency medicine consultant at addenbrooke âs hospital , in cambridge
â or the bone may be hidden â this commonly happens with fractures to the scaphoid bone , one of the smallest in the wrist and the one most likely to break
â guidelines issued by the college of emergency medicine recommend that patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture and tenderness in the wrist area should be offered a mri ( mri ) scan even if the x-ray comes back clear
this year , the national institute for health and care excellence is due to issue wider guidelines on the diagnosis of fractures in emergency departments
like shirley johnstone , jacqui hunt suffered after a fracture was missed in a&e
the former nurse , now 57 , broke her wrist after tripping on the steps of her london home in august 2013
at a&e she was told that the x-ray showed a broken bone in her right wrist , and her arm was put in a cast
â i went home expecting it to gradually get better but it did nât , â she says
â i was in such agony i could nât even brush my hair
â two months later , when the cast was removed , a further x-ray showed a second fracture â she had also broken the ulna bone ( which enables the wrist to rotate ) , but it had been missed
she needed specialist surgery and she was put on a waiting list for several months
while she was still recovering , jacqui lost her job
people who walk out of surgery with an undiagnosed fracture may not seem obvious victims , but their lives can still be blighted , says richard evans , chief executive of the society of radiographers
â we should be working towards a system where every patient has his or her x-ray reviewed before being discharged from a&e
the evidence shows how powerful this would be
â if a medication had the kind of impact this simple change in procedure has , every hospital in the country would have to provide it
