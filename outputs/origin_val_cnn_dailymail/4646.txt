we 've divided the premier league into teams from the north and south of england - with welsh side swansea included in the south
rob draper had the choice to pick any players from the south teams , in any formation , with no limit on the number of players from each club
here 's how we split the clubs : north vs south arsenal , aston villa , chelsea , crystal palace , leicester city , qpr , southampton , swansea , tottenham , west brom , west ham united north vs south burnley , everton , hull city , liverpool , manchester city , manchester united , newcastle united , stoke city , sunderland north vs south
it is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of england
but without dipping into the political allegiances , property prices and weather , we 're sticking to the ultimate debating point â football
this week we are starting a new north vs south debate - who would you pick and who would win ? in the nba , each season they stage an all - star match that pits the best from the west against the cream of the east
and would n't it be fascinating if the premier league adopted a similar event ? kicking off today , rob draper selects his xi - plus seven subs
a full explanation of the criteria is below
tomorrow , joe bernstein will reveal his north xi. then on wednesday , we 'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at football manager
and , as always , we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team ... chelsea are top of the premier league , and they provide the back - bone of our south xi to face the north goalkeeper : courtois ( chelsea ) not much to say â either him or david de gea as goalkeeper of the season , so he âs a natural for the southern no 1 slot
right back : clyne ( southampton ) you can wrestle this one back and forth with ivanovic who has been superb
but i want a little more pace from my full backs and also am looking to the future by giving clyne the nod
centre back : fonte ( southampton ) everyone thought dejan lovren was the mainstay of the southampton defence â but quietly getting on with his job and holding together the best back four in the country has been fonte
courtois has proven himself to be a genuine premier league star in his first season in england clyne ( left ) has earned himself an england spot , and keeps ivanovic out of our side despite losing his centre back partner last summer , fonte has marshalled the best defence in the league centre back : terry ( captain ) ( chelsea ) would be ridiculous not to pick him â the best defender in the premier league at present
left back : azpilicueta ( chelsea ) outstanding
best left back in the premier league
defensive midfield : matic ( chelsea ) for months he has been the pivotal player for chelsea in providing balance â in the mould of patrick vieira and there is no higher praise
defensive midfield : schneiderlin ( southampton ) the steadying influence in southampton âs rise , all the more remarkable given his disaffection at the start of the season
terry - still the best defender in the premier league - will captain our south xi , as he does chelsea schneiderlin has bounced back from his uncertain summer to be a mainstay for southampton matic , eden hazard and terry have been at the heart of chelsea 's table - topping form this season right wing : alexis sanchez ( arsenal ) better on the left but nevertheless we need to find room for him in this team
the sanchez-cazorla-hazard axis would terrify any team
attacking midfield : santi cazorla ( arsenal ) appears to be at the absolute peak of his career
previously you wondered if he had the authority and character to dominate games - now , in his favoured central role , he is showing that
left wing : eden hazard ( chelsea ) potential player of the year
impish , quick and delightfully skilful
a pleasure to watch â and a much more mature player now after two years in the premier league
alexis sanchez has been superb since signing for arsenal , and is on the right wing for this side eden hazard 's goals have helped take chelsea top of the league , and he is a player of the season contender santi cazorla has shown his best form since returning to a central role , and will operate behind the striker striker : kane ( tottenham ) the easiest pick of all
the south is blessed with the best strikers , so much so that maybe we âll go 4 - 4 - 2 later in the game to get diego costa or olivier giroud on
but there âs no doubt as to who is in best form at present
subs green ( qpr ) petr cech is probably the next best goalkeeper in the south ; but we need a keeper who is sharp and playing regularly and green has been superb
kane has emerged this season as one of the premier league 's leading strikers , and is a must - pick ivanovic is unlucky to miss out on a starting spot , but stays on the bench for our south xi ivanovic ( chelsea ) very hard to leave him out
he has been a monster this season , rarely dipping below a 7/10 performance
koscielny ( arsenal ) i âm a little worried that pace may be an issue for my centre halves â if it is we have koscielny to cover
excellent defender as well , despite arsenal âs frequent debacles
fabian delph ( aston villa ) no doubt he will be outraged at being in a southern team â but we had to draw the line somewhere
just a really good , solid midfielder now
yannick bolasie ( crystal palace ) has come on enormously this season and the africa cup of nations break does n't appear to have affected him at all â causes problems to every team he plays against
olivier giroud ( arsenal ) unfashionably good
his strike rate has been superb and his physicality and ability to hold the ball up is now perhaps the best in the premier league , alongside ... ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : courtois , clyne , fonte , terry , azpilicueta ; matic , schneiderlin ; alexis sanchez , santi cazorla , eden hazard ; kane
subs : green , ivanovic , koscielny , fabian delph , yannick bolasie , diego costa , olivier giroud diego costa ( chelsea ) the season has ebbed and flowed at times but through it all he has remained the striker you want to have on your side
edged out by kane at present but he âll play a part in this game
honourable mentions to gylfi sigurdsson ( swansea ) and charlie austin ( qpr ) who have both been excellent and who will be on the stand - by list
fabian delph - though not particularly southern - has done enough this season to earn a spot on the bench crystal palace winger yannick bolasie has caused problems for every defender he has faced this season olivier giroud , underrated but efficient , celebrates yet another premier league goal for arsenal
