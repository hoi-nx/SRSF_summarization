jeremy clarkson wo n't have his contract renewed as host of " top gear " after he apparently busted his producer 's lip and verbally abused him , the bbc announced wednesday
jeremy clarkson , who hosted one of the most - watched television shows in the world , was suspended on march 10 after what the british broadcaster previously described as a " fracas " with producer oisin tymon on march 4
wednesday , the bbc released the findings of an internal investigation into the incident
macquarrie , who conducted the investigation , said oisin tymon had been " subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack by jeremy clarkson " at a hotel in north yorkshire after a day of filming
" during the physical attack oisin tymon was struck , resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip , " he said
the physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness , macquarrie said , but jeremy clarkson continued to use " derogatory and abusive language " for a sustained period of time
macquarrie said jeremy clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to bbc management
bbc director general hall issued a statement announcing jeremy clarkson was being dropped
" a member of staff -- who is a completely innocent party -- took himself to accident and emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature
for me a line has been crossed , " he said
" i know how popular the program is and i also know that this decision will divide opinion
" " top gear , " fronted by jeremy clarkson , james may and hammond , has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often toes the line and regularly steps over it
jeremy clarkson is determinedly anti-politically correct on the topics he rails about , both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns
in his statement , hall referenced the bbc 's diversity , saying it was " a broad church
" " we need distinctive and different voices but they can not come at any price
common to all at the bbc have to be standards of decency and respect , " he said
north yorkshire police issued a statement wednesday saying they had asked for the bbc 's report on the incident
" the information will be assessed appropriately and action will be taken by north yorkshire police where necessary , " they said
on march 10 , the bbc announced that " top gear 's " march 15 episode had been pulled and this week it canceled four live " top gear " shows scheduled for next week in stavanger , norway
however , it said the programs would be rescheduled and that all other live dates would " run as scheduled
" hall said the bbc would " look to renew ' top gear ' for 2016 " and that he had asked bbc controller kim shillinglaw to " look at how we put out the last programs in the current series
" after his suspension by the bbc , jeremy clarkson changed his twitter profile to " i am probably a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear
" on wednesday , the wording became past tense : " i used to be a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear
" co-host hammond tweeted : " gutted at such a sad end to an era
we 're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it 's been an incredible ride together
" fans had earlier expressed outrage at the bbc decision to suspend jeremy clarkson
even media baron rupert murdoch commented on speculation that jeremy clarkson would be sacked , posting a tweet tuesday night in which he described the presenter as a " funny man with great expertise
" an online petition to have jeremy clarkson reinstated has been signed by more than a million people
fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired
last week , a fan dressed as the " stig " -- the anonymous racing car test - driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the bbc 's london headquarters in an armored tank to present the " bring back clarkson " petition
jeremy clarkson later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times
according to the bbc website , jeremy clarkson is credited with changing the face of modern motoring journalism
it also adds : " terrifyingly , he might just be the most influential man in motoring
" jeremy clarkson has been at the helm of the program since 1998 , and for more than a decade has fronted the relaunched version with hammond and may
the trio 's long - distance challenges in a mix of elite and sometimes barely roadworthy vehicles has earned the program cult status
in 2013 , guinness world records named " top gear " the world 's most widely watched factual program , with an estimated 350 million global viewers
the show is sold to 214 territories worldwide
local versions have been made in the united states , china , russia , australia and south korea
while jeremy clarkson 's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers , his on - and off - air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense
last year , he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n - word in a clip that was n't aired
" i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure
i was mortified by this , horrified
it is a word i loathe , " jeremy clarkson said in video statement posted online
he 's been accused on other occasions of racism , including characterizing mexicans as " lazy and feckless " and using the word " slope " over footage of an asians man crossing a bridge during a " top gear " special in myanmar
producer andy wilman later apologized , calling it a " light - hearted word play joke , " and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to asians
last week , jeremy clarkson launched into an expletive - filled rant at a charity auction in north london , verbally attacking his bbc bosses
a cnn reporter who was at the event said jeremy clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the bbc had " f * * ked themselves " and had ruined a great show
jeremy clarkson later brushed off the incident , saying the rant was meant " in jest " and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the " top gear " race track
