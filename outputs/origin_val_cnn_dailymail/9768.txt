neil jenkins says that wales will be concentrated totally on winning - rather than potential mathematical permutations - when they tackle six nations opponents italy at the stadio olimpico on saturday
wales , courtesy of successive victories over scotland , france and ireland , have put themselves firmly in the six nations title mix alongside england and ireland
although wales ' inferior points difference means they have a mountain to climb in pursuit of silverware , a possible third six nations crown in four years can not be discounted
sam warburton ( left ) and george north ( right ) lead the celebrations after beating ireland last week neil jenkins ( left ) says wales are only thinking about an italy victory , rather than checking other results wales are first into action on so - called super saturday , with ireland then tackling scotland before england host france
' the main objective and focus for us is obviously winning a test match
if other things happen , well , so be it , ' said wales skills coach neil jenkins , speaking at the team 's rome hotel on friday
' i am sure that we will be kicking ourselves if we did n't win and the other games went scotland 's way and france 's way
' the main objective is to win the game , and see where that takes us
' england will know what they have to do when they play last on saturday , but no matter what time you play , the focus is still the same for us
we have to win the game and win another test match
' italy 's preparations have been rocked by the absence of their inspirational captain sergio through injury , which has meant the italy back - row being reshuffled and hooker leonardo ghiraldini taking over as skipper
' sergio is obviously a fantastic rugby player , a world - class number eight , and no matter what side he plays in , if he is not playing they are obviously going to miss him , ' neil jenkins added
' we played them two years ago in rome and sergio did n't play , and they were pretty strong
conditions were n't great that day , but it was a pretty tough test match
' he played pretty well against us in cardiff last year and caused us an awful lot of problems
he is a world - class player , and any team would miss him
' i think italy have played some good rugby in the competition
' it was nip and tuck with ireland early on in that first game , and italy probably just lacked a bit of possession
they played some good rugby against england , and then had a fantastic win in edinburgh
' they will probably say themselves they were disappointed with their performance last week against france
wales , pictured this week in training , have travelled to rome knowing a win could secure six nations glory mike phillips passes the ball during an open session in cardiff on tuesday ' but look , every time we come here it is a very tough game
generally , we have been successful , but not by much , so we are expecting another tough game tomorrow
' key for wales will be to set out their stall and build points , like they did in destroying ireland 's grand slam dream last saturday
' we started incredibly well last week and ticked the scoreboard over , ' neil jenkins said
' up until samson ( lee ) got injured , which was a huge disappointment for us , it had been nigh - on perfect rugby
territory , possession and everything we did was spot - on
' the boys have recovered well
they know how important tomorrow is
it is an opportunity for us to go out and give ourselves a chance to try and win the championship
' wales performed a title - winning feat in 2013 after losing their opening game - then it was against ireland , this time england - by reeling off four successive victories and taking the championship on points difference
while this season 's equation is far more complex , the desire is unchanged
' if you look at the six nations , the unpredictability is what 's great about the tournament , ' wales full - back leigh halfpenny said
' every game is competitive , and that is why it 's a huge achievement to win the six nations
' all we can do is focus on our game in rome
that 's all we can do , before we wait and see what happens
' if we go on to win it , it would give us that confidence and belief ahead of the world cup
' warren gatland will be hoping to get some points on the board early on against the italians
