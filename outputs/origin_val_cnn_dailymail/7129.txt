hodgson wants his fringe players to prove a point to him in turin as he prepares to field an ' experimental ' line - up against italy
england 's confidence is running high after they thumped lithuania 4 - 0 on friday to stretch their post-world cup winning streak to seven matches
they know a much stiffer test lies around the corner though
italy find themselves in the midst of a crisis after coach antonio conte received death threats from angry juventus fans who blame him for causing claudio marchisio to break down with a serious knee injury
england boss hodgson will change up his starting xi for the friendly against italy on tuesday night the italy are also without experienced campaigners andrea pirlo and daniele de rossi , but they are still by far the toughest opposition england have faced since their winless and joyless campaign in brazil
hodgson 's plans have been turned completely upside down after nine squad withdrawals , though
the likes of chris smalling , kieran gibbs , andros townsend , theo walcott and ross barkley are likely to get a chance in turin and with competition for places increasing , particularly in midfield and attack , hodgson wants to see encouraging signs from those who step in
' we 've got a tougher test ahead of us against italy and we will be playing that game with players we would n't normally rely upon , ' the england manager told fa tv
england fringe players will get a chance to impress manager hodgson during a friendly in turin ' there are an awful lot of people in the squad i count on that we 've lost , but what it means is for those who are still with us , many who are relatively untried , there will be a chance for them to show that my faith in selecting them for this squad was justified
' hodgson confirmed on saturday that danny welbeck , raheem sterling , james milner and leighton baines would all return to their clubs
southampton full - back ryan bertrand is the only replacement so hodgson now has 20 players - including three goalkeepers - to choose from
those left are an inexperienced bunch
eight players have 10 caps or less
arsenal forward theo walcott , who was a second - half substitute against lithuania , could start on tuesday england duo wayne rooney ( left ) and danny welbeck ( right ) celebrate their strikes on friday night everton midfielder ross barkley runs with possession during a late cameo on friday in the lithuania match in a bid , perhaps , to dampen expectations running high following harry kane 's impressive debut on friday , hodgson was moved to describe his line - up as ' experimental ' on sunday
the england manager says his team should not be judged on the result of tuesday 's game at the juventus stadium , but later in the season when they are expected to play big friendlies against the likes of spain , holland and france
' the real test against tougher opposition will be when the qualifying campaign is over , ' the 67 - year - old said
' when the qualifying campaign ends - we believe we 'll be qualified in october - then we have two very important friendlies in november , two important friendlies in march , certainly in may
' hopefully we 'll get really quality opposition to play us in those matches which will really put us seriously to the test
harry kane celebrates scoring on debut as england cruise to a 4 - 0 victory over lithunania on friday night ' there are a number of players who quite seriously believe they should be in the team and none of them will be in italy
' italy and ireland ( in june ) will be to some extent experimental and a chance to break in to what we think is our best xi. ' still , a win against the nation that beat them in their world cup opener last summer will do no harm to morale , especially if harry kane puts on another performance like the one that saw him score after just 79 seconds on the pitch on friday
for hodgson it will be the first time he has visited the new juventus stadium
italy striker eder ( left ) celebrates scoring a late equaliser against bulgaria with coach antonio conte he did not enjoy that much success at the juventus 's former ground , the stadio delle alpi , when he was in charge at inter , mainly because he always came up against a team containing the likes of alessandro del piero , didier deschamps and zinedine zidane
hodgson lost twice in the league at juventus , but a 3 - 0 coppa italia win over the turin giants is still remembered fondly by inter fans
' i did n't have many happy moments in turin , ' hodgson said
' juventus were clearly the best team in the country during my time with many , many star players
' apart from one cup victory which we had there , invariably we did n't get the results we wanted
' but i 'm happy to be going back to italy as a country and i 'm happy to be playing italy again
