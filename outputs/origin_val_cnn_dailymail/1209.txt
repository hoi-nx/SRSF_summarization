they could face a firing squad if found guilty
last week tommy schaefer told the trial that he had been attacked by mack and called a racially offensive name
he said that his relationship with heather mack was not endorsed by her mother and he went to bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant
after meeting with mack at the hotel , they discussed how to inform von mack that mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where mack and her mother were staying
speaking through an interpreter , tommy schaefer said mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl , which he hid under his shirt as a ' precaution '
asked by a judge why it was hidden , tommy schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself
according to tommy schaefer , he arrived in the room and found mack weeping
he did not know why , but also saw that mack 's mother was screaming
' she ( von mack ) was angry at me when she knew that heather mack was pregnant , ' tommy schaefer said , while trying to hold back tears
mack , who was sitting beside her lawyer , sobbed at the testimony
he said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man
he said the situation got heated when von wiese-mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby
tommy schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which von mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds
' i was angry , i took the fruit bowl and hit her , ' tommy schaefer said , in tears
he added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim
after acknowledging she was n't breathing , he tried to give her artificial respiration , while mack , who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes , came back and tried to revive her mother
he said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the united states

' von wiese-mack 's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets
the suitcase was later found in a taxi at the posh st. regis hotel in august
in february a health scare saw mack rushed to hospital after she collapsed with stomach pain and started bleeding
she was taken to bali 's sanglah hospital , the main medical centre in denpasar , where tourists and other foreigners are usually treated
hospital officials later said miss heather mack 's baby was safe but she had been taken to hospital for an immediate check - up because she was in pain and had lost blood
in january mack had said she vowed to bring the baby up in the cramped bali prison she shares with six others
she has told fellow prisoners in the wijaya kusuma cell block of her intentions - but that has not gone down well with several of the other women
' make arrangements to get your baby out of here , ' one prisoner is reported to have angrily told her
' we 're fed up with being woken by crying babies
' in an adjoining cell a prisoner in her late 30s is raising a baby which cries through the night , waking other inmates
' this is what your baby is going to be doing - waking us up - and we do n't want that , ' heather mack was told by one woman - according to visitors leaving the prison on friday after delivering food to relatives in the women 's section of the notorious prison
the protests , however , have failed to dampen the resolve of mack
