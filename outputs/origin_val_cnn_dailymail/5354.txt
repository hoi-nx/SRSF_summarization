in japan , she visited buddhist and shinto shrines , and in cambodia she traveled to siem reap , home to the famed angkor wat temple complex
at a high school outside of siem reap , mrs obama greeted students with a traditional cambodia gesture of hands pressed together with a head bow
only 20 percent of cambodia children finish secondary school , but the rates are even lower for young women mrs obama spoke to the girls about the importance of education as part of the let girls learn program , which targets gender equality in developing countries she walked the compound 's dirt paths and then met with ten girls who shared tales of rising early to feed their families and help with farming before heading off on long treks to school and studying late into the night

education brings empowerment , she added , and urged the teens to ' finish your education and then follow your dreams
' ' use your voices to advocate for good things â whether it 's more education , better health care , more freedoms , more equality , ' she said
' not just here in cambodia , not just here in siem reap , but in the world
i hope that you all will feel empowered to do that
' as mrs obama spoke , bun rany smiled and made no comment
however , she expressed cambodia 's ' full support ' for the education initiative , and said the government was giving priority to female students for state scholarships

cambodia first lady bun rany ( right ) remained silent during remarks that could be seen as criticism of her country and husband , though she later said that she supported education for girls the cambodia first lady later said through an interpreter that women , including those in her country , ' do nât just belong in the kitchen ' the first lady 's visit to cambodia ( pictured ) follows a three day trip to japan on a quick asian tour without the president mrs obama also spoke to volunteers of the peace corps program , which is administering the let girls learn schools throughout the world barack obama became the first american president to visit cambodia in 2012 , and pressed prime minister hun sen in private on a variety of human rights and political issues during a meeting that white house officials described as tense
hun sen is one of the world 's longest - serving heads of state , and has been regularly criticized by political opponents and human rights groups for monopolizing power and brutally crushing dissent
his supporters say he has helped stabilize the country , which is still haunted by a 1970s genocide that saw nearly 2 million people die under the ultra-communist khmer rouge regime
during its brutal reign , the khmer rouge closed schools and executed intellectuals among its many victims
foreign aid and investment have helped the economy grow rapidly in the past decade , but the education system and overall development remain stunted
even today , most cambodia children drop out of school
according to 2014 statistics from the education ministry , 95 percent of children enter primary school , but only 20 percent finish secondary school
mrs obama also took a tour of cambodia 's famed angkor wat temple complex in siem reap and took a picture with the pool that reflects the monument the angkor wat temple complex was first built in the 12th century by the khmer empire and has functioned as both a hindu and buddhist house of worship mrs obama wore trainers to walk around on the dusty paths of the temple while accompanied by her guide poverty is the main problem , especially in rural areas , where families ca n't afford the minimal costs of education and keep children home to help support the family , according to unicef
cambodia 's problems with child prostitution , child labor and human trafficking also play a role , and often target girls
after meeting students saturday , mrs obama spoke to a group of american peace corps volunteers who will be running the global project and called on them to share american values with their students
' values like equality , inclusiveness , fairness , openness ... are n't just american values , we know this
they are universal human values , ' she said
' when girls get educated , when they learn to read and write and think , that gives them the tools to speak up and talk about injustice and demand equal treatment
it helps them participate in the political life of their country and hold their leaders accountable
' to wrap up the day , the first lady changed into casual clothes , sneakers and sunglasses and toured angkor wat , cambodia 's grandest monument , built in the 12th century by the khmer empire
a tour guide led her to one of the area 's popular photo stops , where the temple 's iconic towers are mirrored in a reflecting pool
' it 's beautiful , ' mrs obama said
