caracas venezuela president maduro said saturday an unspecified number of americans were arrested " a few days ago " for engaging in espionage and recruitment activities
the president said they included an latin american pilot of latin american origin , arrested in the southwest border state of tã¡chira
he said the pilot was found in possession of " all kinds of documents " and was being interrogated by the authorities , though he did not identify him
the venezuela government has made many similar claims in recent years , without ever substantiating them
maduro also announced saturday a series of measures , including visa requirements for americans citizens and the downsizing of the embassy in caracas , to counteract what he called americans " interference " in his country
venezuela has in recent weeks accused the americans of being behind an alleged coup plot
speaking at an " anti-imperialist " rally in the capital , maduro said visas would now be required for all americans visitors and that the americans embassy in caracas would now need foreign ministry approval for any meetings
the embassy , which he said had more than 100 staff , is to be reduced to a number closer to the 17 venezuela diplomats based in washington
moreover , a group of prominent americans officials , current and retired , will be banned from entering venezuela because of what maduro said was their involvement in " bombing iraq , syria and vietnam " and other " terrorist " actions
the officials include george w. bush , former americans vice president dick cheney , former cia director george tenet and several current members of congress , including ileana ros-lehtinen , bob menendez and diaz-balart
following the maduro 's announcement diaz-balart reacted via twitter , saying he has " always wanted to travel to a corrupt country that is not a free democracy
and now castro 's lap dog wo n't let me ! " the move comes after the americans government last month approved a law under which venezuela officials allegedly involved in human rights violations are to have their visas revoked and their americans assets frozen
a relatively small , but noisy crowd , dressed mostly in revolutionary red , applauded and cheered the measures announced by the president from a platform outside the presidential palace in downtown caracas
four missionaries from bethel evangelical free church in devils lake , north dakota were released by venezuela authorities on saturday , a church official said
pastor dick said the missionaries arrived in venezuela on february 20 and were detained a few days ago
" we love the venezuela people and have served alongside them for over 12 years , " dick said
" we have been praying along with hundreds or thousands of others for their release and for those in venezuela who also have been affected by this
" it is unclear if the detention and release of these americans is connected to maduro 's charges of espionage
