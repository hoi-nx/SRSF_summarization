former new zealand captain crowe , 52 , is suffering from lymphoma , a cancer of the immune system

my friend & tough taskmaster lymphoma is back to teach me
' former new zealand cricketer crowe is suffering with lymphoma , cancer of the immune system crowe says the cricket world cup final between new zealand and australia could be the last game he sees australia captain michael clarke ( left ) poses with new zealand leader brendon mccullum he has since undergone chemotherapy but even as his health fails , he can not contain his excitement about the prospect awaiting his country and its near neighbour
crowe wrote on espn cricinfo : ' on sunday , in front of a packed house at the one and only mcg , australia and new zealand go to war once again
this time not as brothers in arms but as fierce rivals , a rivalry all the more meaningful for our long history together
' we are brothers and will always be
on sunday one sibling will upset the other
as one of those proud brothers , i am stunned by the prospect
' without question , this will be the personal cricketing highlight of my life , and i sense for new zealand too
' my precarious life ahead may not afford me the luxury of many more games to watch and enjoy
so this is likely to be it
the last , maybe , and i can happily live with that
' brendon mccullum 's attacking batting and captaincy has led new zealand to the final , while martin guptill rewrote the world cup record books with his unbeaten 237 against the west indies in the quarter - final , while the bowling attack has also been in form
crowe pictured in action for new zealand in a test match against england in february 1988 crowe praised players such as martin guptill ( left ) as new zealand gear up for the world cup final crowe continued : ' to see the two sons i never had , ross taylor and marty guptill , run out in black , in sync with their close comrades , drawing on all their resolve and resilience , will be mesmerically satisfying
' i will hold back tears all day long
i will gasp for air on occasions
i will feel like a nervous parent
i will , like so many kiwis making the short trek across the tasman , feel this to be the greatest cricketing time of our lives
' four million dare to believe , while 11 ( and back - up ) dare to achieve
whatever happens , march 29 at the mcg will be the most divine fun ever
