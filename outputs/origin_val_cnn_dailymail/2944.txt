between commuting time and work hours , new york residents have the longest work weeks among the country 's 30 biggest cities , city comptroller scott stringer said in a report released tuesday
the report said a typical week for a full - time new york worker adds up to more than 49 hours , including an average of more than six hours of commuting time
that was more than four hours longer than in milwaukee , wisconsin , where the average work week was about 44 1/2 hours
commuting time made up just under 3 1/2 hours of that
the report was based on data from the us census from 1990 and 2000 and the 2013 american community survey
busy schedules : the report said a typical week for a full - time new york worker adds up to more than 49 hours , including an average of more than six hours of commuting time
commuters are seen in new york in 2014 research : new york comptroller scott stringer released the findings in a report on tuesday
scott stringer is seen here in this march 5 , 2015 file photo scott stringer said commuting times were longer for lower - wage workers , who were more likely than higher - wage workers to live in parts of the city that are n't as well - served by public transportation
security guards , for example , on average spent more than eight hours a week commuting
' nursing and home health aides and maids and housekeepers also report long commutes , while chief executives , taxi drivers and physicians and surgeons report the shortest commutes , ' the report said
in a statement , scott stringer said ' new york is us âs hardest working city , but it âs a one - two punch for lower wage workers , who get paid less and travel longer to get to work
' this means employees in the big apple get paid less than it appears on an hourly basis , because their commutes are significantly greater than anyone else in the country
' the report found that ' in new york , workers in the finance sector , on average , work the longest workweeks
with usual work schedules topping 47 hours , new york financial workers spend , on average , almost four hours more per week working than do their counterparts in other large cities
' it also said that workers in advertising , media , computer , legal services , arts and entertainment , food service , and retail trade have longer hours compared to people with jobs in those industries in other major us cities
' but longer workweeks are not characteristic of all new york industries , ' the report said
city workers in manufacturing , real estate , and health care , for example , work fewer hours in a typical week than do workers in those industries in other large cities
' scott stringer said the report showed a need for the city to expand its transit networks , as well as promote flexible work arrangements along with predictable scheduling
' if new york is going to symbolize the american dream , we ca nât be a nightmare when it comes to long work hours and commuting , ' scott stringer said in the statement
' our residents deserve better
