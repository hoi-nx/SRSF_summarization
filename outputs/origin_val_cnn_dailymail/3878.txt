forget walkies , this debonair dog 's more likely to be doing wheelies
video captured by chris hayes at the los gatos creek trail in california shows a white fluffy dog cruising along in a miniature mercedes
the pup does n't appear to have a care in the world as his whizzes along a tarmac path with the breeze blowing in his fur
it seems to have been specially adapted for a small passenger
however , it still has all of the essential features , including a personalized number plate and cup holder
the dog is seen driving along with a can of soda close to his paw
it is not know who the hound belongs too , but judging by his sweet ride he 's likely to have a palatial pad to match
