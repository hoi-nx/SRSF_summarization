all you need is luck , to misquote one of liverpool 's most famous exports , the beatles
but liverpool 's footballers wo n't mind one bit that a fortunate goal sealed a vital win at swansea to set up a pivotal clash with manchester united at the weekend
one of england soccer 's biggest rivalries is renewed on sunday with vital points at stake in the race for a place in next season 's european champions league
jordan henderson knew little about his winner in wales , the ball flying in after amat 's clearance struck him , but it helped make it seven wins out of eight for the reds
a sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home pulled it within two points of manchester united in fourth , with just four points separating liverpool from manchester city in second
" it 's a great result , " jordan henderson told sky sports
" the first half was disappointing but i felt as though we did better in second half , passed the ball and created a few chances
" it was a great pass by daniel , i got a little fortunate with the finish but you 've got to be in the right position to score
" overall we 're delighted with three points and we now look forward to sunday
we ca n't wait for it , we are high on confidence and have great momentum but manchester united played well the other day
" it 'll be a tough one but at anfield we go in confident and hopefully we 'll get the result we need
" in a lackluster start , daniel sturridge dragged a shot wide of post for liverpool before england international adam lallana fired a fierce half - volley right at swansea goalkeeper fabianski
from then on swansea asserted control
martin skrtel had to be alert to clear as swansea 's french striker gomis -- starting for the first time since collapsing on the pitch at tottenham earlier this month -- headed at goal
gomis then played a neat one - two with wayne routledge before forcing liverpool goalkeeper mignolet into a fine low save
next to threaten liverpool 's net was iceland international gylfi sigurdsson , whose effort was arrowing for the top corner before mignolet intervened
just before halftime jonjo shelvey , a former liverpool player , went close with a shot from a right wing corner that was deflected wide by alberto moreno
but having had a chance to regroup , liverpool came out galvanized after the break and were soon on the front foot
first fabianski made a brilliant save to keep out philippe coutinho 's near post effort before the pole was then in action again to deny joe allen
though liverpool were in the ascendency , its opening goal was down to a stroke of luck
as jordan henderson galloped onto a through ball swansea 's spanish defender amat got there first , but his clearance ricocheted off the liverpool player and into the net past fabianski
from then on liverpool did a fine job of squeezing the life out of the game and playing on the counter , striker daniel sturridge hitting the post late on as swansea left gaps at the back
