it says something for the way things have changed in england football that arsene wenger admitted only last week that arsenal have no chance of winning the premier league
the same , of course , could be said of united
it is , we should remind ourselves , only the start of march
given united âs enduring financial capacity , it should not be too long before the most successful club of the premier league era are competing with manchester city and chelsea at the top of the table once more

arsene wenger âs team have been a peripheral concern for quite a while now
whatever the case , on monday night at old trafford , these great modern rivals come together with something more at stake than a place in the last four of the fa cup
with united not involved in europe this season and arsenal staring at likely champions league expulsion in monaco next week â they trail 3 - 1 after the last - 16 home leg â victory tonight would at least keep one of them relevant from a domestic point of view
no wonder united staff have been encouraging supporters to bring flags and banners to old trafford in a bid to bolster tonight âs atmosphere
this may not be a cup final but it may feel a little bit like one
â united and arsenal are placed third and fourth in the premier league so it âs almost like a final , i think , â said united manager louis van gaal
â it is a big event with two good teams
i hope we can give a fantastic match for the fans
united boss louis van gaal is targeting his first piece of silverware since arriving at old trafford last summer wayne during united 's training session at carrington on sunday ahead of the game â i think if we beat them it is a big blow for them but if they beat us it is a big blow for us
it is a very important game , not only for the fa cup but also for the rest of the season
â united have not won the fa cup for 11 years
arsenal are the holders after last season âs victory over hull but , prior to that , their previous success in the competition had come back in 2005
this says much for the manner in which both clubs â focus has been elsewhere for so long
arsenal and united have always valued the fa cup but , during the years they disputed the league title and had grand aspirations in europe , it was occasionally allowed to slide down the priority list
that is no longer the case
van gaal in particular has been respectful towards the game âs most famous cup competition ever since he arrived in manchester last summer and has made no attempt to hide what it would mean to him â and his club â if united could win it
the first trophy van gaal ever won as a coach was holland âs knvb cup with ajax in 1993
he still considers his first dutch championship , which arrived a year later , as the most important trophy of his coaching career
but he admitted he understood jose mourinho âs view that his most crucial success in england was his first â the 2005 league cup triumph

â you want to win something
that is why you play and coach
the players want to win something and also the manager and also the fans
â when you win a title like the fa cup , which in england is very important , and when you fight for something and you get it , you are pleased and that is why jose mourinho is saying what he says about his first one
â when you compare coaches with one another then titles are very important
and when a player wins something , they then have the experience of winning a final so there are a lot of positive things
â van gaal was not hired last summer to win the fa cup
he knows he must get united back into the champions league
no premier league club with aspirations of winning the league can afford to be locked out of money - spinning european competition for more than the odd season
similarly , arsene wenger knows what his true responsibilities are
french centre forward olivier giroud is finally looking capable of scoring consistently for the gunners on monday night , however , the expectation is that this should feel like the most important night of these teams â seasons so far and the contest should benefit from that
arsenal have been playing reasonably well for some time and have won 10 of their last 11 domestic games
with their french centre forward olivier giroud finally looking capable of scoring consistently , the holders will head north knowing they have the capacity to trouble their great rivals
they also have a league defeat from early winter to avenge
arsene wenger 's side are current fa cup champions after their dramatic victory against hull last season united âs football , on the other hand , has been more patchy but van gaal will hope that inspiration can be taken from an away win at newcastle last wednesday that had an important feel about it
he will also hope his captain wayne can use his own rather sketchy fa cup past as a motivating factor
â he has not won the fa cup , â said van gaal
â and that is something that is missing for him
â my first championship with ajax was very important for me , it was also an emotional thing
it will be the same for wayne
