murray would ideally prefer to play davis cup quarter - final opponents france on grass - but he recognises the need for a strong atmosphere after an emotional victory over the united states
proud scotsman murray admitted playing in front of a capacity 7,500 crowd at the emirates arena in glasgow was among his best experiences in tennis after his straight - sets win over john isner helped great britain into an unassailable 3 - 1 lead
the reward for the thrilling world group first - round victory is a last - eight home tie with france on july 17 - 19 , at the end of the grass - court season
murray would prefer great britain 's davis cup tie with france to be played on grass in july great britain received brilliant support at glasgow 's emirates arena as they beat the united states all three days of davis cup action at the emirates arena were sold out in a matter of minutes captain smith will discuss possible venues with both his team and the lawn tennis association and murray would prefer to play on grass
' it 's a surface i really like , it 's a good surface for dom ( inglot ) as well with his serve , ' the 2013 wimbledon champion said
' i would n't say the france players love the grass outside of ( jo-wilfried ) tsonga
he would be their best player on the grass
i do n't think ( monfils ) monfils is as comfortable on that surface , ( gilles ) simon i do n't think is that comfortable on it
( richard ) gasquet i think can play well but i do n't think he has played amazing in davis cup in the past
smith embraces murray after the scot 's straight sets win secured gb 's quarter - final berth murray is the centre of attention after securing a tie against france ' grass might be a good surface but we will have to see because playing in front of a crowd like this makes a difference and it helps
if we ca n't guarantee that at a grass venue then maybe it makes sense to play it at a venue where we can get that
' having the crowd with you makes a big difference
for some reason people think in tennis that playing in front of a home crowd is crippling in a way and makes people incredibly nervous
' it can make you nervous but if you look at the olympics , london was our best olympics ever and there was a reason for that
the crowd makes a big difference
' i do n't have an ideal venue
it 's not up to me
the atmosphere here was the best i have played in , and indoor venues have better noise , but at that time of the year we also have the option of playing outdoors
