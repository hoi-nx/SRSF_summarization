its weight caused the pipe to collapse , and it fell into the living room where the boys were sleeping
autopsies concluded that noah and connor barthe died from asphyxiation
savoie 's son , who was sleeping in a different room , was not harmed
' this was a unique case in canada and required consultation with experts familiar with african rock pythons , ' constable jullie rogers-marsh said in a press release
' in addition , as is common in major investigations , a thorough review was conducted of the evidence and investigational steps

savoie earlier described how he found the boys at 6.30am on august 5 and at first thought the boys were just sleeping
' they were sleeping , ' he said in an interview
but ' they did n't even open their eyes or nothing
i thought they were sleeping until i [ saw ] the hole in the ceiling
i turned the lights on and i [ saw ] this horrific scene
' he explained : ' [ the snake ] went through a ventilation system
i do n't understand how it did it
it went through the ceiling ... and the snake fell into the living room from the ceiling
