secret service director clancy said on thursday that two agents who allegedly ' crashed ' into a white house barrier in early march while driving under the influence merely bumped into a barrel
' previous reports of a crash are inaccurate - there was no crash , ' clancy told a senate subcommittee during testimony on the agency 's budget request
' the video shows the vehicle entering the white house complex at a speed of approximately 1 to 2 mph , and pushing aside a plastic barrel
there was no damage to the vehicle
' clancy also told senators that the secret service was doing everything in its power to ' recreate ' surveillance footage from the night in question that had already been erased by the time he learned of the incident

congress may never know whether two agents who crashed into a white house barrier in early march were driving under the influence because it 's secret service policy to erase tapes after 72 hours , a congressman has revealed house oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz , pictured here at a capitol hill hearing on tuesday , says lawmakers who were present for the secret service director 's explanation of why tapes were destroyed were stunned
' that does n't make any sense to us ' the newly minted secret service director 's testimony follows the chairman of the house oversight committee 's public disclosure on wednesday that it is secret service policy to delete footage of the white house after 72 hours
utah republican jason chaffetz said clancy offered up the policy on tuesday at a closed - door meeting as an explanation for why he could only offer congress video of the incident from two angles
' i do n't think anyone in that room could believe it , ' chafettz told cbs wednesday
' that 's just a stunning revelation that 72 hours after they make a tape they destroy it ? that does n't make any sense to us
' on tuesday at a white house hearing on his appropriations request clancy admitted that he did not know about the alleged drunk driving or crash , which interrupted a suspicious package investigation , until five days after it happened
' the fact that i did not learn of this allegation until five days after it is said to have occurred is unacceptable , ' he said today in his prepared remarks
the lapse in notification means that all evidence of a crime could have been destroyed before the time clancy says he was informed of his agents ' misconduct
' if it 's regular policy to destroy them after 72 hours , why did they have two of the tapes , and where are the rest of the tapes ? ' jason chaffetz had asked on wednesday
a spokesperson for the secret service did not return daily mail online 's request for comment on the matter thursday morning
and the white house 's chief spokesman declined , when asked by daily mail online on thursday , to say whether he or the president felt it was ' appropriate ' for the secret service to delete surveillance footage with such frequency
the spokesman , white house press secretary josh earnest , said he would withhold judgement until clancy had a chance to explain himself to congress that afternoon
clancy later informed senators that secret service kept tapes related to the bomb sweep and that was how it still had video of the agents banging into the barrel
the secret service head allowed congress to view one video on thursday but said he could not make it public ' because it may be evidence ' and a widespread release could ' taint future court hearings
' ' we understand it 's a concern , ' that additional tapes were wiped , clancy said , according to the washington examiner , and ' we 're doing everything we can to retrieve those images and to be as transparent as we can be
' clancy told lawmakers that the agency had contacted the manufacturer of the device it uses to monitor the white house as well as forensics experts
the two agents involved in the march 4 episode were connolly , then the second - in - command on president obama 's protective detail , and george ogilvie , a senior - level agent in the washington field office
they were reportedly driving back in an agency vehicle from departing secret service spokesman ed donovan 's going away party when they rolled through an area outside the white house that was sectioned off by yellow security tape and hit a barricade
jason chaffetz told cbs that the videos he did see showed the agents coming just feet from hitting the suspected bomb , which turned out to be a non-threatening package
the footage did not show what happened afterward
' in terms of were they drunk or inebriated , ca n't tell , ' jason chaffetz said , because the tapes did not show the agents exiting the government vehicle or driving home after the incident
' we want to see other tapes to understand that , ' he said
if they even exist - and they may not , jason chaffetz acknowledged at the time
' at this hour we are calling on the secret service to provide those tapes so we can see a more full and complete picture
' clancy indicated on thursday that he was unsure whether the agents were drunk at the time of the accident
' i do not have the ability to simply terminate employees based solely on allegations of misconduct
this is not because i am being lenient , ' he said
' while i am extremely concerned by the allegations of misconduct and the potential for alcohol involvement , i must reserve judgment
' at the white house hearing on tuesday clancy conceded that some secret service agents turn to alcohol to help them deal with the stress of their jobs
' we âve got to find a way to help some of these people that are going towards alcohol as a coping mechanism , ' he said
secret service director clancy testifies during a house homeland security subcommittee hearing on the secret service budget on tuesday
clancy admitted at that hearing that he did not know about the alleged drunk driving or the crash , which interrupted a suspicious package investigation , until five days after it happened in addition to congress , an an inspector general is conducting an independent review of the of the affair and whether a uniformed division supervisor ignored recommendations that officers undergo field sobriety tests
connolly and oglivie have since been reassigned to desk jobs until the dhs review is concluded
clancy is a veteran of the secret service who president obama pulled out of retirement to take over the dhs agency first on an interim basis and later in perpetuity after the former head of the security arm of the department resigned following a set of serious breaches of the president 's safety
the white house said this week that the president was still ' absolutely ' certain that clancy was the right man to lead the agency , which has struggled to avoid scandal and operate efficiently throughout the second term of obama 's presidency
' this is very difficult work , and going in and reforming an agency like this will be challenging , ' white house spokesman josh earnest said
' but somebody like director clancy , who has the skills and the character to implement these kinds of changes , will be critical to the success of that agency
' and the president has complete confidence in director clancy âs ability to implement those changes in a way that will allow the agency to live up to the high standard that they âve set for themselves , but also to ensure that they âre properly serving the country
