the court heard how the schoolboy , who can not be named for legal reasons , arrived at gregory 's three - bedroomed house in the early hours following an evening out with her daughter and friends
hewertson , prosecuting , told the jury that at about 2am or 3am the boy went to bed in gregory 's room , while his friends went into her young sons ' room
the jury was shown the footage of a police interview with the schoolboy , who said that while gregory 's daughter went to bed in her own room , he went to sleep in the master bedroom
the court heard that the group had been drinking until about 2am and when the boy awoke in the double bed later that morning , gregory , then aged 33 , was in the bed next to him , wearing her pyjamas
the jury was told they then started kissing before having full sex
in the police video , the boy said : ' it was like 3am in the morning and she [ gregory 's daughter ] went to her room
' so then i just went into her [ gregory 's ] bed
' i woke up , i do n't know what time , it was light and she [ gregory ] was there
' we just started kissing and it happened
i pulled down her pyjama bottoms
we was n't ( sic ) speaking
' i stopped kissing her and pulled my shorts down and we had sex
i did n't say anything
' when questioned by mr hewertson , the boy admitted he had been drinking vodka on the night in question , mixed with fizzy drinks
mr hewertson told the jury of five men and seven women : ' the sexual activity takes place at the defendant 's home address
' there is no dispute that the victim was 14 - years - old at the time
he had had his 14th birthday exactly a week before
' clearly alcohol was consumed
' he wakes up close to dawn at which stage he is aware the defendant has got into bed with him
' they roll over and face one another
there is a period of kissing
he , in effect , rolled on top of her
[ it ] led to full sex
' it was full sexual activity , consensual and deliberate between the victim , aged 14 , and defendant , clearly an adult
' mr hewertson told the jury that the question they had to answer was whether the pair actually had sex or not
' he says squarely that they did and she says squarely that they did not , ' he said
' the prosecution says this is not some kind of figment of imagination , made up by him
it is simply his frank position
' she deliberately , and we say significantly , had sex with him underage
' the court heard how gregory allegedly engaged in ' full sexual activity ' with the schoolboy , who is a friend of her daughter
the pair are said to have had sex after he went to her house after drinking vodka with friends the schoolboy denied in cross-examination that he was lying about sleeping with gregory and insisted she had joined him in bed and had sex with him
however , barker , defending , suggested that the boy had arrived at gregory 's three - storey home very drunk
he claimed that the boy had vomited in the back garden before being put to bed in the bedroom of gregory 's two young sons after she and her daughter cleaned up the mess
mr barker said that at some point during the night , the boy went into gregory 's bedroom and told her he felt unwell so she got him a glass of water and allowed him to sleep there
' you were drunk and sick , ' he suggested
' you went to bed and were shown to the boys ' room
shortly after that you got up and went into tammy gregory 's room
' you complained that you were feeling sick and she brought you some water and you stayed there and fell asleep on top of the bed covers
' the boy denied that version of events , claiming he had gone to bed and had awoken to find gregory beside him
mr barker accused the boy of lying about having sex with gregory to his friends
' did you say to them " i slept with tammy gregory " , ' he asked
' is that how all this started ? you lied to your friends ? ' however , the boy denied that he had lied and said : ' why would i lie to them ? ' gregory , 36 , denies one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and insists the teenage boy was drunk and went to her bed and fell asleep
the trial at reading crown court ( pictured ) continues mr barker said gregory 's daughter had persuaded her mother to let the boy stay because he was so unwell
' you were puking and she took pity on you , ' he said
' she persuaded tammy gregory to let you stay
she [ gregory ] put you to bed soon after you arrived
she looked after you , got you a drink , talked to you for hours
' the boy denied that was the case and added : ' if i was lying , how would me telling two of my friends end up with me sitting here two years later ? ' the court heard that the boy 's mother found out about the alleged incident through friends and confronted gregory at her home before reporting it to police
mr hewertson said the boy did not feel like a victim
' he , in many ways , despite being a child , does n't consider himself really a victim in the archetypal sense , ' he said
' it is because he was fairly participating in the act
' gregory denies one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity
she insists that she was in bed on the night in question and that the boy came to her room drunk where she comforted him before he fell asleep
