chopra celebrates after scoring a goal for cardiff in the championship the 31 - year - old started his footballing career as a youngster on former newcastle 's books ' when the chance came up from the chairman , i felt it was a no brainer because of the level he has played at in the game
' he 's played in the premiership down south for many years and then played abroad so he is a very experienced
i know the player through watching him over the years and he is still only 31 so i am sure he still has plenty to offer
' he is still short of some match sharpness , but i am sure his arrival will be a lift for the players and the club as whole
