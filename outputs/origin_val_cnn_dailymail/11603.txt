a toddler has landed a role as elizabeth i in the bbc 's wolf hall - after producers put out a last - minute appeal for a ginger curly - haired child
casting bosses searched through thousands of children on acting registers but could n't find a suitable young actress to play the future queen of england
red - haired abi ward , now three , from cardiff , was recommended by a friend who saw the plea on facebook and within days the tot was on set alongside her on - screen dad damien lewis
the mini-actress had her own trailer and got vip treatment from the cast , including actress claire foy - her tv mum anne boleyn - who read abi ward stories between takes
proud parents debbie and rob , both 35 , had no idea the show would be so successful and ca n't wait to show abi ward recordings of her acting debut when she 's older
' it has been such a lovely experience , ' said debbie , a full time mum
' she tells everyone she was filming with damien lewis and claire foy , but she 's completely oblivious to the fact that she has worked with some of the biggest names in tv
' we could n't be more proud of her
' three - year - old abi ward was playing the part of a very young elizabeth i in the bbc tv series wolf hall the young actress is shown off to the crowd by damien lewis as henry viii in a scene from wolf hall the youngster has a good look around her while playing a young elizabeth i while in the arms of damien lewis show makers initially searched through casting companies in search of a little pale - skinned girl with curly red hair to play elizabeth i , but could n't find anyone suitable
a runner on the show put out a plea on facebook in may last year and it was spotted by a friend of debbie and rob 's who instantly thought of abi ward
the pair sent in photos of their daughter , along with height measurements , and after a meeting , they were called to their first day of filming at montacute house , somerset
abi ward as elizabeth i is pictured with her on - screen mother anne boleyn ( claire foy ) in a scene from wolf hall the property was greenwich palace in wolf hall and abi ward filmed a scene where henry viii - damien lewis - introduces his daughter to various nobility
' it happened very randomly because a friend of a friend was working as a runner on the tv show , ' explained debbie
' they were looking for a ginger - haired girl and abi ward was the right age and hair colour
' she put out an sos to friends for a little ginger haired girl and put abi forward
it was completely out of the blue
' we had to send in some photos and her height and age - but it was mostly about her hair colour and then they asked us to come down to meet them
the youngster even had her own trailer while she was on the set during filming ' within a matter of weeks we had to go to somerset for filming
' it was very surreal
we went down the night before and damien lewis came down to see abi ward , so she could meet him before filming , and the following day she did a bit of filming
' it was with damien lewis and he was holding her and walking around the room , with everyone bowing down to her , introducing her to everyone
he was really , really nice and friendly
' he came down to see her before filming and not in costume so abi ward would n't be scared of him
' abi ward cried a lot to start with
i felt a bit bad about that
she was ok in the end though
it was just quite dark and atmospheric , and i think it gave her a fright
the tot takes a break and relaxes far way from all the fun of filming wolf hall ' but she loved the costume because she 's a typical girl who loves dressing up in long girly dresses
' abi ward 's final day of filming took place at barrington court , somerset , which was dressed as the home of thomas cromwell 's mentor and friend cardinal wolsey , in june
the episode 's opening scene saw abi ward sit on anne boleyn 's knee and took place during a period when the pair 's relationship hit the rocks
' they were talking about some embroidered hats
it was when they were n't getting along so well , ' said debbie
proud parents debbie and rob , an it analyst , watched abi ward 's debut at home with a bottle of champagne , while the little actress slept upstairs , blissfully unaware
she said : ' we did n't realise how big it was going to be
with us just being there for two days , we did n't really know what the whole thing was about
' it was just me and my husband - she was upstairs asleep
' it was quite surreal to see her on tv
we forgot how young she looked
