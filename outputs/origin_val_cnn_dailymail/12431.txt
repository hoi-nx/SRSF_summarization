a federal judge has ordered the department of defense to release photos that allegedly show detainees being abused in detention centers in iraq and afghanistan during the bush administration
the photos wo n't be made public right away
in an order issued friday , american district judge hellerstein of the southern district of new york granted the government 60 days to appeal
the aclu sued the department of defense in 2003 to have the photos made public
it 's not clear how many photos are involved or where the pictures were taken , but in an august opinion hellerstein said the government acknowledged having at least 29 pictures from at least seven different locations in afghanistan and iraq and may have hundreds or thousands more
some of the photos may have come from the notorious abu ghraib in iraq
in 2004 , photos became public that showed american soldiers abusing abu ghraib detainees and putting them into humiliating sexual positions
people in the mideast and american were outraged and shocked by the photos , which added to the national debate on the use of torture in the war on terror
hellerstein said the government failed to prove its argument that releasing the photos would endanger american soldiers or civilians overseas
in july 2011 , the judge blocked release of the photos at the urging of the secretary of defense because american troops were still fighting in iraq
by december 2011 , most american ground troops had withdrawn from iraq , the judge wrote , and he did n't know whether release of the photos would affect military operations
" three years is a long time in war , the news cycle and the international debate over how to respond to terrorism , " he wrote
the judge also said the government failed to convince him a collective review of the photos met the requirements of the protected national security documents act
the aclu argued the department of defense must individually review each photo and explain why its release would put american in danger
jaffer , aclu deputy legal director , said in a statement that the photos are " the best evidence of what took place in the military 's detention centers , and their disclosure would help the public better understand the implications of some of the bush administration 's policies
" a response by the department of defense to the judge 's decision was not immediately available
the department of defense has refused to release the photos requested by the aclu , saying publication could endanger american soldiers and civilians overseas
several american military leaders who saw some of the pictures made that argument in a december 19 filing in the lawsuit
they pointed to public demonstrations in mideast countries that followed reports of quran burnings , the release of the video " innocence of the muslims " and the 2012 release of a video that showed american soldiers urinating on dead enemy combatants
navy rear adm. sinclair harris of the joint chiefs of staff said islamist extremist groups like isis use " imagery associated with american detention practices " as part of their recruiting efforts
the aclu responded by saying the military leaders did n't see all the photos , just a sampling selected by an army lawyer
the aclu also said the leaders did n't explain how the photos were " similarly inflammatory
" their prediction of anti-american violence was only speculation , the aclu said
" to allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone , somewhere , to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents ' misconduct , " jaffer of the aclu said .
