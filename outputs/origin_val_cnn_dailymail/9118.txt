the spread of drug - resistant tuberculosis may result in 75 million deaths by 2050 , experts have declared
it could also cost the global economy a cumulative $ 16.7 trillion ( Â£ 15 trillion ) - the equivalent of the european union 's annual output
the comments have come from a uk parliamentary group which focuses on tb
they follow a warning from the world health organisation which said last year that multidrug - resistant tb was at ' crisis levels ' , with about 480,000 new cases in 2013
x-ray of tuberculosis calcification caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria it is a man - made problem caused by regular tb patients given the wrong medicines or doses , or failing to complete their treatment , which is highly toxic and can take up two years
the fight against tb , the world 's second deadliest infectious disease after hiv , is also hampered by a lack of an effective vaccine , the tb said
the only tb vaccine , bcg , protects some children from severe forms of tb - including one that affects the brain - but is unreliable in preventing tb in the lung , which is the most common form of the disease
tb , which spreads through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person , killed 1.5 million people worldwide in 2013 , according to the world health organisation
yesterday it warned that if left untackled , drug - resistant tb superbugs threaten to shrink the world economy by 0.63 percent annually
as a result , governments must do more to improve research and cooperation , the uk all party parliamentary group on global tuberculosis ( tb ) , said
the problem stems from the fact that bacteria that cause tb can develop resistance to drugs used to cure the disease
multidrug - resistant tb fails to respond to at least isoniazid and rifampicin , the two most powerful anti-tb drugs , according to the world health organisation ( world health organisation )
the world health organisation warned last year that multidrug - resistant tb ( pictured ) was at ' crisis levels ' , with about 480,000 new cases in 2013 the uk parliamentary group 's cost projections are based on a scenario in which an additional 40 per cent of all tb cases are resistant to first - line drugs , leading to a doubling of the infection rate
' the rising global burden of multidrug - resistant tb and other drug - resistant infections will come at a human and economic cost which the global community simply can not afford to ignore ' , economist o'neill said in a statement
mr o'neill , a former chief at investment bank goldman sachs , was appointed last year by uk prime minister david cameron to head a review into antimicrobial resistance
the group urged governments to set up a research and development fund , target investments into basic research and increase support for bilateral tb programs
' we need better tools to deal with this new threat , but since tb primarily affects the poorest and most vulnerable in society , there is little commercial incentive to develop new drugs , ' said nick herbert , co-chairman of the tb .
