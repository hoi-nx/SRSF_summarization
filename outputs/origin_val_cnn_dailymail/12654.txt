real madrid squeezed through to the quarterfinals of the european champions league -- but only just
the 10 - time - winner escaped a humiliating exit from the tournament after going down 4 - 3 at home to german side schalke allowing it to sneak through 5 - 4 on aggregate
had it not been for cristiano ronaldo , who scored twice to ensure his place as the record goalscorer in european football competitions , then it could have been far more embarrassing
as it was , real madrid 's players were met with the waving of handkerchiefs and whistles on an evening which threatened to spiral from disaster into ignominy
real madrid 's malaise has been well documented but this latest chapter , where it was hugely fortunate to escape with its hands still on the trophy , offered yet more questions than answers
ancelotti 's team have endured a difficult few weeks , but if his players had arrived at the bernabeu hoping to silence the sniping critics then they failed miserably
this was a dire display from one of the most expensively assembled teams on the planet , who but for arguably the world 's greatest player , would have succumbed to one of the most embarrassing defeats in the club 's illustrious history
make no bones about it - real madrid was rumbled
schalke , produced a fine performance , full of courage , energy and a zest which their opponent could scarcely match
had it not been for one player on the opposing side then perhaps this would have been one of the most famous nights in schalke 's history
unfortunately , that one player was cristiano ronaldo
as lethargic and lackadaisical as real madrid was throughout the contest , cristiano ronaldo 's two goals , both headers , ensured its place in the next round
nobody has scored more goals than cristiano ronaldo in european club football -- his 77th and 78th taking him to the top of the chart ahead of his nemesis , lionel messi
his latest efforts may not have been the most spectacular , but they were so very precious given the nature of the tie
leading 2 - 0 from the first leg in gelsenkirchen , real madrid was firm favorite to progress
no team in the history of the competition had lost the first leg 2 - 0 at home and managed to progress -- and schalke appeared unlikely to alter that statistic
coached by roberto di matteo , who led chelsea to european champions league glory in 2012 , schalke arrived hoping to give a good account of themselves , according to the italian
fifth in the german league , this was hardly a team which was supposed to send real madrid into a meltdown -- and yet that 's what came to fruition
but , given the recent form of the ancelotti 's side , perhaps this was not so unexpected
last weekend 's league defeat at bilbao brought about a new wave of criticism for ancelotti
toppled from the summit by arch rival barcelona , real madrid has struggled in recent weeks for consistency by its own high standards
its astounding 22 - game winning streak was curtailed by valencia on january 4 and the style and swagger which was so evident during that run soon fell away
a 4 - 0 defeat by champion and city rival atletico in february was difficult to stomach as was the defeat in the basque country to bilbao -- but real madrid 's problems stretch beyond results
real began slowly , in fact , slowly would have been an improvement on what was quite a dreadful opening period
those in white shirts appeared to be running in slow motion as schalke took the contest to its opponent with a zest and spirit which real madrid could not match
having already fired several warning shots , schalke finally made the breakthrough its energy and enterprise deserved when christian fuchs fired home after good work by huntelaar
real , abject in the extreme , appeared bereft of ideas , short on confidence and as if those on the field had merely stumbled upon the stadium 's turf without actually meeting one another
fortunately , in cristiano ronaldo , real madrid has a man who has power beyond those of his fellow mortals
schalke 's lead lasted just five minutes -- cristiano ronaldo finding both time and space inside the penalty area before heading home from close range
that strike , his 40th of the season , should have settled the home side down
yet , what followed , was another example of real madrid 's fragility
first , huntelaar , once a real madrid player , pounced upon raphael varane 's dreadful backpass only for his effort to lack the necessary power
soon after , the dutchman struck the crossbar with a fine volley from 25 - yards which left casillas , the real madrid goalkeeper , clutching at thin air
schalke sensed its opportunity and with four minutes of the first half it finally struck when max meyer , the 19 - year - old , fired home after casillas had fumbled huntelaar 's effort
real madrid was reeling -- and yet it was cristiano ronaldo once again who got it out of trouble
fabio coentrao , the left - back , produced a fine cross and cristiano ronaldo eased away from his marker to head his second of the game
that should have been that for schalke , at least real madrid might have felt that way when karim benzema put his side ahead for the first time on the night
the frenchman danced his way through the defense before coolly netting real madrid 's third of the evening with eight minutes of the second period played
while real madrid continued to threaten in attack , its defense remained suspect
sane , just 19 years of age , was the next beneficiary of the home side 's reluctance to put pressure on the ball
the midfielder was allowed both time and space to take aim and curl a quite sumptuous effort into the far corner past the watching casillas
real , unbeaten at home in the european champions league since april 2011 , remained vulnerable , particularly at the heart of the midfield
it was one of those midfielders , modric , back from injury , whose mistake gave huntelaar the opportunity to set up a pulsating finish
modric 's loose pass allowed the forward to take the ball in his stride before unleashing an unstoppable effort which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar
as the whistles rang out , those in blue poured forward with the impressive sane forcing casillas into a fine stop as the visitors edged closer and closer to an all important fifth goal
with the clock ticking down , schalke threw everyone forward in search of a dramatic winner -- but when the ball broke to benedikt howedes , the defender could only fire his shot straight at casillas
the referee 's whistle brought relief , though the howls of derision from the home supporters gave the players an idea of their recent failings
" getting through to the next round is very important for us , sometimes you have to suffer and this will make us stronger , " said modric
" we have to get back to playing the way we were at the start of the season , we have a lot of quality and i think that we 're going to see a much better real madrid in the next game
" porto power through in the night 's other game , porto trounced swiss side basel 4 - 0 to secure a 5 - 1 aggregate victory
porto , winners in 2004 under jose mourinho , eased home courtesy of goals from yacine brahimi , hector herrera , casemiro and vincent aboubakar
" you have to applaud the entire team for this fantastic performance against a very difficult opponent who came here determined to qualify , " julen lopetegui , the porto coach , told reporters
" we deserve to be in the european champions league quarterfinals even if we came through qualifying
" i am very happy and very proud of my players who showed a lot of character
