rooney captained manchester united to a 3 - 0 victory against tottenham at old trafford on sunday hours after footage emerged appearing to show him being knocked out cold by his former team - mate bardsley in a sparring session in his kitchen
here we assess rooney 's performance in the showdown that took place on the pitch
manchester united captain rooney re-enacted a video of him boxing a former team - mate ashley young laughs as rooney falls backwards as part of his humorous boxing celebration at old trafford ashley young and marouane fellaini arrive on the scene to celebrate with the manchester united captain did he pack a punch ? rooney was having a relatively quiet game until the 34th minute , when he seized upon a misplaced nabil bentaleb pass , burst through a clutch of tottenham players and slotted past hugo lloris - before celebrating by recreating the video , throwing a flurry of air punches boxer - style and then falling backwards to hit the deck
having brought the crowd to their feet in that moment , he showed less potency thereafter in his centre - forward role , sending a few efforts off - target , at least one of which he probably should have done better with
rooney waves to the crowd ; his goal put manchester united 3 - 0 up against tottenham in the first - half combinations very early on , his link - up play was not coming off , a notable example being when he failed to pick out juan mata with an attempted cut - back in the box
he was also not involved in either of the first two goals - but his influence soon grew as he produced several nice touches to help build attacks , as well as getting on the scoresheet himself
lasting the distance went the full 90 minutes , and while not exactly a constant threat during that time , he caused plenty of problems for tottenham in what was a commendable display overall
knock-out moment undoubtedly delivered one with the goal and celebration , nicely showcasing his strength , technique and willingness to poke fun at himself all in the space of a few seconds
