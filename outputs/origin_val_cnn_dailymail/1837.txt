madrid were beaten 1 - 0 by athletic bilbao at san mames on saturday meaning if barcelona beat rayo vallecano sunday lunchtime they will move to the top of la liga
gareth bale hit the post from 50 yards out but it was the closest ancelotti âs team came as an aritz aduriz header in the first half was enough to give athletic bilbao a famous victory that could seriously derail madrid âs title charge
they started brightly enough with benzema swapping passes with marcelo and crossing for ronaldo , only for xabier etxieta âs clearance to stop the ball reaching madrid âs top scorer

att : 51,000 athletic bilbao had been on a good run with two league wins and a cup semi-final victory and they were soon into their stride with forwards williams and aritz aduriz stretching a madrid defence under - protected by a midfield still missing luka modric who will not be back until midweek in the champions league
when athletic bilbao âs goal came it was that midfield weakness that created the opening
mikel rico had all the time and space he wanted to cross for aritz aduriz and the on - form centre - forward rose to head home his 18th goal of the season
isco should have got across to rico more quickly
pepe might also be disappointed he was beaten so easily by aritz aduriz in the air , but the athletic striker , who scored twice in midweek to put athletic bilbao in the cup final , is on such good form that there is talk of a spain call - up despite his 34 years
he hung for a moment in the air having got in front of the madrid defender and powered his header past iker casillas
real looked disjointed all over the pitch
kroos kicked - out at andoni iraola and was booked and illaramendi was yellow carded shortly afterwards for a foul on iker muniain
athletic bilbao also had aritz aduriz and etxeita booked but they were keeping their heads and their shape better than their rivals
madrid raised the tempo in the second half and gareth bale lead the assault on athletic bilbao âs goal
when he tricked his way down the right and pulled the ball back from the byline it looked like producing the equalizer
but before ronaldo could sweep the ball home from three yards out iraizoz got a hand to the cross to divert it to safety
madrid 's marcelo ( right ) drops to his knees in response to chance being passed up by his team in the first half ronaldo cut a frustrated figure , especially in the first half , as his attacking threat was regularly nullified athletic bilbao striker inaki williams ( second left ) tries to keep the ball away from the approaching madrid player asier illaremendi marcelo ( right ) is crowded out by athletic bilbao players as the brazil international tries to create an opening for madrid isco forced a save from iraizoz after taking a pass from ronaldo but athletic bilbao were keeping the european champions at bay
their keeper was making sure of it charging off his line to deny benzema with madrid âs next chance
ancelotti took his time to make his first change and when it came it was a brave one
winger jese replace midfielder illaramendi and madrid went from 4 - 3 - 3 to 4 - 2 - 4 with gareth bale and jese on the flanks and ronaldo and benzema through the middle
ronaldo claimed a penalty when he tumbled over iraizoz but the referee was right to call it athletic bilbao âs way
aritz aduriz then went close with a header at the other end
both kroos and williams were replaced by their respective managers with 15 minutes left
williams had run himself into the ground ; kroos has been running himself into the ground for weeks and desperately needs to be rested
despite the changes threir was still no way through for madrid and ancelotti played his last card replacing benzema with javier hernandez

tired of madrid âs attempts to pass through the defence , gareth bale lifted his head just inside of athletic bilbao 's half and tried to lob iraizoz
the audacious long - distance shot came back off the frame of the goal
even by his high standards it would have been a spectacular goal
it also would have been very hard on athletic bilbao who deserved their three points
