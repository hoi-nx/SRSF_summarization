â conservative mps are plotting a major rebellion next week when the commons debates calls for the uk to honour its commitment to spend at least two per cent of national income on defence
the prime minister lectured other western leaders over the need to hit the target during last year âs nato summit in wales
conservative mps are plotting a rebellion against prime minister cameron next week when the commons debate will call for the uk to honour its commitment to spend at least 2 % of its income on defence but mr cameron has refused to guarantee that the spending pledge will continue after the election , and â to the anger of many mps â tory sources say it will not feature in the party âs manifesto
instead , the prime minister has said only that a future tory government would protect the defence equipment budget and maintain troop numbers
foreign secretary philip hammond was yesterday reported to have warned tory mps there are â no votes in defence â
aides to mr philip hammond , a former defence secretary , said they â did not recognise the comments â , adding that the minister is a staunch supporter of defence spending
but former defence minister sir gerald said the reported comments were symptomatic of the view of the party leadership
sir gerald , mp for aldershot , said : â there is a view at the top of the government â i do nât think the prime minister shares it â that defence is nât a vote winner
foreign secretary philip hammond ( pictured ) was reported to have warned tory mps there are â no votes in defence â â but what they have to understand is that defence is part of the dna of the tory
and that âs true even in constituencies which do nât have a garrison
â conservative voters instinctively believe that defence of the realm is the first priority of government
â â and if people around the country do not see that is the case they will ask themselves what is the tory for ? â â we are following through a lib dem promise to spend 0.7 per cent on aid but we wo nât commit to defence spending
people are asking is this the right order of priorities ? â rory stewart , chairman of the commons defence committee said : â the fundamental point is the world is unfortunately more dangerous now than it has been in the past 20 years at least
â that means major powers like uk have to spend more on defence
â fellow tory gray said it would be a major error for uk to drop its guard at a time of increased russian aggression and the growing threat from islamic state
mr gray said : â the people of the uk want to see strong defence of the realm , and they see the attacks carried out by isis and the russian bear bombers over brighton and they realise the world is an extremely dangerous place
and they want the government to step up and hold to the promise they made at the nato summit
â conservative mps now plan to use a commons debate next thursday to force a vote on the issue
a senior tory mp last night said there was a â determination â to force a vote , despite pressure from downing street to avoid a damaging split in the run - up to the election
although the vote will not be binding on government policy , defeat would be embarrassing for the tory leadership and increase the pressure on ministers to back the spending target

beijing is seeking to assert itself as a growing power and officials say the money is to modernise the people âs liberation army â the world âs largest standing military force
