it did nât take long for us to get used to googling things , instead of looking them up in books
but the process of typing words into a search box could be replaced by using the cameras on our smartphones to find the information we âre looking for
free blippar , the world âs largest image recognition and augmented reality platform , has re-launched its app to change the way we search for things and interact with the world around us
users can ' blipp objects , such as cds and adverts to access information about them online and could soon blipp any object , such as apples ( shown ) users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to â look â at any object and use the image to search for it online in the long - term
but to begin with , they will be able to use it on english-language album covers , fiction books , dvd covers and movie posters
when a user â blipps â one of these items or images , they will be presented with a range of information about it
for example , if they blipp an album cover , they may be presented with access to videos of the band , a source to buy tickets to an upcoming concert , details on what people are saying about them on twitter or photos of the band itself
users have to launch the app on their phone
the new version will be out in april
they will see a view using the phone 's camera , which will show any products that are ' blippable '
when an object is detected , users will see augmented reality content , which could take the form of a video , reviews or related information
the first blippable objects on the new app will be cds , dvds and film posters , but more will be added
however , the app âs plans are more ambitious
free blippar aims to make the entire physical world visually searchable via mobile devices and wearables
in the future , it aims to make everything blippable , from an apple or chocolate bar , to a dog on the street or even the eiffel tower
web - based search as it exists today has dominated the digital experience , both online and mobile
from inputting keywords to digging through pages of links to access information , this search behaviour is limited by vocabulary and literacy
free blippar âs image recognition service aims to go beyond language to allow consumers to pull timely , relevant information directly from the environment around them
â the human imagination , curiosity and the quest for knowledge are all often limited by our capacity to define and assign language to describe and seek answers from the world around us â said blippar founder and ceo mitra
users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to â look â at any object and use the image to search for it , and related information online
the new york and london - based company has already rolled out inority report - style advertising
a still from the film is shown â today marks the beginning of a new era of search , where curious users will be able to visually search the world through the lens of the blippar app. â the technology holds massive potential for enriching real world experiences and delivering genuine value to our users
â the visual search is not replacing text - based search , it âs an alternate behaviour which satisfies people âs spontaneous needs of instant object focused curiosity , therefore introducing the light web
â the company claims that free blippar âs platform allows users to access information faster than using traditional online search methods
it will also use artificial intelligence to refine and personalise the visual search results for each user
the updated app will be available to download for ios and android in april 2015
last year , free blippar unveiled the first image recognition and tracking app for google glass wearers that shows videos , webpages , and more , simply by looking at a picture
it was the first time the technology could be used automatically , and seamlessly , just by looking at an advert
' free blippar has already worked with thousands of the world âs largest brands and publishers to create engaging branded experiences that are triggered by objects , magazine pages , advertisements and more , â blipped â by millions of users around the world , ' mr mitra said
there are many visual search apps competing to win users from google
snap fashion , for example , lets users take a photo of an item of clothing and finds others in exactly the same colour , which they can then buy at the click of a button .
