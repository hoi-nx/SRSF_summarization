danish has slammed as " unacceptable " comments by russian 's envoy to danish that joining nato 's missile defense shield would make danish warships " targets for russian nuclear missiles
" in august last year , danish said that at least one of its frigates would be equipped with a radar that would allow it to contribute to nato 's missile defense shield
in an opinion article published in the danish newspaper jyllands posten on saturday , russian ambassador vanin said he did not think the danish fully understood the consequences of joining the missile shield
" if this happens , danish warships become targets for russian nuclear missiles , " he wrote
danish 's minister for foreign affairs lidegaard said vanin 's remarks were unacceptable
" russian knows full well that nato 's missile defense is defensive and not targeted at them ( russian ) , " lidegaard said
" however , i would not over-dramatize this
right now we disagree with russian on many important issues , but we also cooperate , for example , in the arctic and it is important that the tone between us does not escalate
we certainly are not contributing to that
" tensions between russian and nato member countries have been mounting since russian 's annexation of crimea in 2014 and claims its military has been involved in the ongoing violence in eastern eastern ukraine
moscow has repeatedly denied its military is involved
in april 2014 , nato foreign ministers said they had " decided to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation between nato and russian " over the issue
the united states and nato allies have been conducting military exercises as part of " operation atlantic resolve , " which the united states describes as " a demonstration of our continued commitment to the collective security of nato and dedication to the enduring peace and stability in the region , in light of the russian intervention in eastern ukraine specifically
" on march 2 , nato deputy secretary general alexander vershbow told the alliance 's annual meeting on arms control : " russian 's illegal annexation of crimea and its continuing destabilization of eastern ukraine have put the european security system -- and all the rules and agreements that underpin it -- under severe strain
" last monday , state - run russian media reported that russian president vladimir putin had ordered his northern fleet " to full alert in a snap combat readiness exercise " in the arctic
at least one russian leader described the drill as routine and unrelated to the " international situation
" conversely , deputy foreign minister alexey meshkov told tass news agency that russian was " deeply concerned " about nato drills near its border
nato says the long - term goal of its missile shield is " to merge individual allies ' missile defense assets into a coherent defense system , providing full protection for nato european populations , territory and forces against ballistic missiles threats
" nato has previously asked russian to participate in the system , but negotiations were deadlocked over russian 's demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to moscow 's own systems .
