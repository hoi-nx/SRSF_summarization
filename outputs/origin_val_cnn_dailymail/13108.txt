there 's been plenty of talk lately about how dangerous stereotypes can be when it comes to the empowerment of our girls and young women
for instance , the # likeagirl campaign , which took a hammer to the notion that doing anything " like a girl " should be viewed as an insult , has become an international sensation
less discussed , though , is the reality that our boys face damaging stereotypes too
that was the motivation behind a recent workshop held by sheknows media , a leading women 's lifestyle media company
a group of new york city tween boys ranging in age from 8 to 10 got together as part of the company 's hatch program , which focuses on teaching digital literacy and citizenship to the next generation
the boys were shown dozens of advertisements perpetuating hypermasculine stereotypes , such as images of men all muscled up and not wearing shirts
in one ad for a big truck , the boys heard the tag line " can a truck change how people feel about a guy ? " is the ' be a man ' stereotype hurting boys ? another advertisement , this one for a clothing company , showed a man from the waist down along with the caption " wear the pants
" " that 's a man wearing the pants so that shows that men are in charge , " said one of the boys , who 's 9
what was clear was that this group of boys knew what the advertisers were trying to get them to think , but they were n't exactly buying it
" i play with girl toys and boy toys
i do n't really care which one is meant for boys or for girls
i just play with them
they 're toys , " said another boy , also 9
" man up " might mean toughen up and be unemotional , said another boy , who added that his image of what a man should be is completely different
" if i were to describe the perfect man , the words would be smart , not judgy , and kind , " said the 10 - year - old
' dad ' gets a makeover in super bowl ads these boys certainly ca n't speak for all tween boys , but their comments reflect what appears to be growing attention surrounding the use of gender stereotypes for boys as well as girls
seventy - six percent of men who took part in a recent online survey by sheknows media admitted using phrases like " man up " and " be a man " toward boys
of the more than 1200 men and women surveyed from across the country , 73 % said boys are most often described as " aggressive , " 69 % said " strong " and 53 % said " athletic
" when the men were asked about stereotypes during their teen years , 72 % said they became aware of physical attractiveness and 50 % said they grew more conscious about weight
kids as young as 5 concerned about body image the awareness starts even earlier , according to a recent analysis of existing research on kids and body image by common sense media , a child advocacy group
it found that over a third of boys ages 6 to 8 think their ideal weight should be thinner than their current body weight
" these are problems that are often thought of as problems for girls , but boys are just as impacted and they 're exposed to unrealistic body images , " said pack , vice president of marketing for common sense media , which is partnering with sheknows media to help parents understand the impact that media and technology are having on children
" the proportion of undressed males in advertising has been steadily on the rise since the 1980s , " said pack
" the same kinds of inappropriate messages that we 're giving to our girls , we 're giving to our boys too -- that they do n't measure up , that they 're not adequate
" at the same time , there does appear to be more open - mindedness on what being masculine means to men and boys today , based on the poll 's findings
of the men surveyed by sheknows media , 78 % said it was ok for boys to cry , 65 % thought it was fine for boys to wear pink , and 55 % of men said boys should be able to play dress - up
" you should be able to do your own things and do what you want , " said one of the boys , who is 8
sheryl sandberg teams up with the nba to get men to lean in the takeaway for parents is that they , more than anyone or anything else , influence the stereotypes their boys will encounter and what impact those stereotypes will ultimately have on them
" we found the single most significant driver of their perception of what 's ok for boys was their parents , " said samantha skey , chief marketing officer for sheknows media
" it was n't pop culture or adam levine or usher
it was their parents , " she said
" if their parents think they 're strong and appropriately masculine , then they are
" pack , of common sense media , says parents should be talking about the issue to their boys when they are young , even as young as 5 , and should call out stereotypes when they see them
" do n't just turn your eyes
use it as an opportunity to engage in a conversation with your kids and challenge assumptions , " pack said
" when you are seeing things on tv that you think are unrealistic , point it out
" i , for one , wish we could wipe out " be a man " and " man up " from all of our vocabularies
but , actually , why do we need to remove the language ? we just need to change what it means
the tweens involved in the hatch workshop offer some real - life evidence that that may be already happening
" when you go your own way , it feels good because you feel free and you can do what you want to do , and you do n't have to do what other people say , " one of the boys said
