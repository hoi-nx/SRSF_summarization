crippling cuts to defence spending have left uk unable to defend itself or stand up to russia , according to the former head of the army
general sir peter wall said the ' consequences ' of the squeeze on funding is now ' playing out ' in the uk 's approach to dealing with vladimir putin
he joins a growing chorus of criticism of the refusal by any of the main parties to protect defence spending from cuts after the election , despite a pledge to increase foreign aid budgets being enshrined in law

' we can now see those consequences playing out in our reticence to counter russia expansionism , and her interference in our airspace and offshore waters

' it comes after a report by the rusi ( rusi ) said it was inevitable that uk 's defence spending would drop below the nato target in the face of continuing austerity cuts
