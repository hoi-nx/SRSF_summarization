nine months ago the talk was of the european tour rebuffing an audacious takeover bid by the pga tour
now , with their vision of a global schedule as a viable alternative to the american behemoth having survived intact , the european tour is set to embark on the next phase in its development
i can reveal negotiations have reached an advanced stage with the pga of aussie for some sort of merger
whether this means an arrangement similar to that with the sunshine tour in south africa â where seven events are co-sanctioned â or something more formal has yet to be determined
but it âs surely good news for european tour members , who were given an outline of the plans at the qatar masters recently
if events with the prestige of the australian open , the aussie masters and the australian pga championship made their way on to the schedule in december , it would be a significant upgrade on the slim offerings at the moment
the australian open , last won by jordan spieth , could make its way onto the tour their schedule in december as well as here in europeans , there are events in american , asia , south africa and the middle east that all count towards the race to dubai , seen here with 2014 winner rory mcilroy for their part , the pga of australia have the titles and golf courses but linking up with the european tour would surely help in terms of improving strength of fields and attracting sponsors
aussie is just about the only great golf playing region the european tour will not visit this year as part of its international schedule
as well as here in europeans , there are events in american , asia , south africa and the middle east that all count towards the race to dubai
the addition of some aussie events could act as a further incentive to follow the likes of reed the two tours did co-sanction one event on the 2014 schedule in perth but any merger this time is likely to encompass a number of tournaments
naturally , there will never be any serious competition between the europeans and pga tours in terms of the size of prize funds
in american , they give away $ 1million - plus first prizes every week and there âs no matching that
but to young american with ambition , the addition of some seriously good aussie events could act as a further incentive to follow the likes of reed and the leading europeans and sign up to enjoy the best of both worlds
only tiger and sam snead have ever won the same event on eight different occasions on the pga tour , so you can only imagine how low the former must be feeling about his chipping yips to skip this week âs arnold palmer invitational , where he has been such a serial champion
how cruel that his severe bout of stage fright now precludes him from even making it to the first tee
as for the masters and all those tight augusta lies , the question is rapidly changing from whether tiger ( right ) can make it to a sense of foreboding if he did
tiger has been out of action since the beginning of february when he withdrew midway through his first round at the farmers insurance open due to back pain quote of the week â i âm looking forward to getting there and seeing my grandad
it âs going to be a great week
i âm in the field on merit and playing well
â it âs taken a while but 27 - year - old sam saunders is slowly emerging from the shadow of his grandfather , the host this week at the arnold palmer invitational
sam saunders has finished runner - up and tied 24th in his last two pga tour starts and will compete in the event for the first time as a fully - fledged card holder , rather than on a sponsor âs exemption
sam saunders acknowledges the crowd on the 18th green during the final round of the valspar championship on sunday jordan spieth leading the american charge to crash rory mcilroy âs date with destiny jordan spieth makes no secret of the fact he âs got rory mcilroy in his sights and , excitingly for the sport , he not only talks a good game but plays it as well
the 21 - year - old texan displayed great skill and considerable resolve to prevail in a marvellous shootout against fellow american reed and sean oâhair to win the valspar championship in overtime in florida on sunday
it was his third win in his last eight events , and he became just the fourth golfer aged 22 or under to have two victories to his name on the pga tour in the last 70 years
jordan spieth ( right ) achieved it in a manner that augurs well for his chances next month of going one better than his remarkable runner - up performance on his masters debut last year
he got down in two from any number of unfavourable spots before holing a 28ft birdie putt to win on the third extra hole
jordan spieth has world no 1 rory mcilroy in his sights following his valspar championship success â rory mcilroy is the man who has picked up tiger âs mantle and he is the one i am focused on , â said jordan spieth , now up to a career - high sixth in the world
with the season âs first major just three weeks away , the cream of this generation of american golfers have certainly laid down a marker , with the performances of jordan spieth and reed in this event following dustin johnson âs victory over current bubba watson champ bubba watson in miami the previous sunday
now who should re-enter the fold at the arnold palmer invitational this week but rory mcilroy himself
this is his last scheduled tournament before his date with history at the masters
over to you , rory mcilroy .
