the origins of the word have long been debated , with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy â a notion put forward by countdown star susie dent , of dictionary corner , who on wednesday night tweeted : â nutmegging in football comes from the centuries - old slang â nutmegs â , meaning â testicles â
in case messi is ever interested
â however , the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in cockney rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation , while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between america and england in the 18th century , when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the atlantic
being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster
it later caught on in football , implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked , or , nutmegged
in spanish , the skill is known as â cano â or â tunel â
they âve certainly got plenty of tunel vision at the nou camp thanks to messi .
