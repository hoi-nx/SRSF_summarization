do you know two people who are just perfect for each other ? well , now there 's an app for that
hitch , is being touted as the tinder for matchmakers , as it lets people set up two facebook friends
named after the will smith film about a romantic guru who helps singles find love , the idea for the app was inspired after founder anton gu met a mutual friend one night but felt too bashful to ask his chums for her number
although singles are set up with each other anonymously initially , matchmakers can see how many messages the pair have exchanged once they 've chosen to reveal their identities
the idea for the app all stemmed from a thwarted encounter
founder anton gu , from london , said : ' in february last year i went to a gig with a group of friends
there was a girl in the group that i had nât met before who was a friend of a friend
' she did nât stay for very long and left , so i did nât get a chance to talk to her
' the next day i was sitting at home , thinking how could i get in touch with her
short of asking our mutual friend for her number and being like â hey , i âm that guy at the gig last night , i âd like to take you out â , i had nothing
hitch founder anton gu says the idea behind the app was simple : ' i was single
i made an app. ' and it 's not only been a professional success for anton gu , but a romantic one too to create a hitch , you log in through facebook and select two friends you want to introduce
the pair do not need to have the app installed to be selected - you can invite them later
' i checked online and there was no app that i could use to get an introduction
' and since that night , he 's used his creation to improve his own love life
he said : ' by the time the app was out , that girl from the gig was dating someone
but my friend introduced me to someone else
she is incredible and we are dating now
' hitch is available in 50 countries and around 2,000 hitches are made in the uk each month
anton gu said : ' we grew very quickly in india
matchmaking is popular in their culture , people understand the concept straight away and tell their friends about it
there is also huge potential in markets where online dating is difficult
' he said that because matches are being made through pools of mutual friends , it narrows down choices and feels reliable as friends are making the introductions
mr anton gu says the ' pick - up line ' is always the same
having a mutual friend makes communication very easy , meaning that 85 per cent of hitches result in conversation friends know better : hitch is available to download in 50 countries , and users have increased particularly quickly in india , where matchmaking is a popular culture he added that women are better matchmakers than men
' there âs a lady in texas , she has introduced 14 couples on hitch
she âs really good at this ! recruitment consultant joel holford , 22 , from london , is currently using hitch but needs more friends to download it before he can see it transforming his love life
he said : ' i liked the idea of both setting up my friends and being set up anonymously
i downloaded the app , but the issue is , you have to have a lot of friends on there for it to work
' anton gu says he hopes awareness of hitch will continue to grow
he said : ' we think that people that are successful , will in turn tell their friends how they met and introduce them
' joel holford , 22 , says he likes the idea of hitch , but points to the fact that it relies on many of your friends having the app too
