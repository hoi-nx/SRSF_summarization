a mother who was jointly awarded Â£ 1.5 million damages after an alcoholic nurse swapped her daughter at birth , has spoken of her pain at being trolled for not recognising her daughter
the woman , who wants to remain anonymous , told how she cried herself to sleep over nasty online messages , accusing her of lacking proper maternal feelings
she was one of two mothers and families whose lives were devastated when their babies were accidentally mixed up at a cannes clinic in 1994
trolling victim : the woman , who does not want to be identified and pictured here with her solicitor , has since been abused online for not recognising her own child internet trolls attacked her for failing to notice the complexion of her daughter was wrong when she and her husband were both creoles
' so many mothers were insisting that it was impossible not to recognise your own child , ' she said
' these horrible messages made me suffer more from my own feelings of guilt
' nothing was stopping me from turning off the computer , so i was hurting myself all alone '
both babies were being treated for jaundice when the tragic blunder occurred , the mistake of a nurse who mail online understands is now in a psychiatric hospital
separated at birth : ' stephanie 's ' biological daughter manon was unwittingly given to serrano who thought her darker complexion was due to her own spanish heritage blunder : manon , pictured here with her non-biological mother sophie , who had no idea she was holding another woman 's baby , was placed under a lamp with another baby girl just after birth to cure her jaundice the woman 's biological daughter , manon , now 21 , is still living with the other mother serrano , while she has continued to raise madame serrano 's biological daughter , mathilde
earlier this year , madame serrano told mail online how the unforgivable error had cost her her marriage when her husband refused to accept the daughter she brought home was his
the two families were awarded damages of 1.88 million euros between them by a french civil court after a ten - year fight to prove they were the innocent victims of a hospital mix - up
now the second woman has decided to speak out about the anger and fear that swept over her when tests proved that both had taken the wrong children home
using the alias of stephanie in french newspaper nice matin , she told how she was only 19 when she gave birth and had not long arrived from the indian ocean island of reunion , a french territory
she explained that she and her husband , who met when they were 14 , were creoles and had no family with them on the cote d'azur
she had lost her parents as a child and was brought up by her grandmother
stephanie said she did think her baby had changed when the nurse placed her back in her arms but this was quickly dismissed by staff
teased : manon was subjected to bullying taunts and whispers that she was the daughter of ' the postman ' because her complexion was darker than her mother 's
she is pictured above aged nine , just before she discovered the truth about her parentage and was left deeply traumatised then and now : manon , pictured as a nine - year - old before she discovered she had been given to the wrong mother , left , and today aged 21
she wanted to stay with her non-biological mother but has since met with biological mum ' stephanie ' ' only three little tufts of hair were left on her head ' , she said
' i did smile as i told the nurse so , but there was a deep anxiety within me over an eventual mistake
' she remarked sharply : ' of course it is your baby '
the moment passed very quickly and i was alone
i reasoned that i was quite young and had faith in them
' stephanie said she was devastated to learn the truth a decade later and worried that she would lose mathilde
she was also naturally curious to find out about her biological daughter , manon , and who she was living with
' after learning the truth , i felt so angry , but above all frightened
the fear of people taking my child away after she had lived ten years with us
' then i wanted to know where my biological daughter was , which family she was in and to know her
' sophie , left , described the moment she heard that manon , right , was not her daughter : ' he is not the father , ' the lawyer said , ' but you are not the mother either '
both families have been awarded joint damages of Â£ 1.5 million she was then faced with heartbreaking job of telling mathilde about the mistake
she went on : ' we took her aside in the living room , sat on the settee and explained to her as simply as possible
' she said nothing at first and then , with us either side of her , she asked : ' must i go to the other family ? ' we told her that normally , no , but we did not know anything yet
her reply was : ' in any case , you are my parents '
' i was impressed by her reaction and still am by the manner in which she has handled it , often better than me even if it was very hard for her '
the two families eventually met in an emotional reunion for all involved
the mother continued : ' things happened simply with a lot of tears
mathilde discovered her brothers and sisters
' manon , my biological daughter , was acquainted with my children , who are her brothers and sisters '
both girls , now 21 , have been left so traumatised that neither envisage having children of their own in the future .
