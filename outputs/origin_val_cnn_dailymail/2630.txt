his legacy is everywhere on this glorious island
from roads and agriculture to the design of the local flag , napoleon transformed elba when he was banished here in 1814
famously , he did n't stay for long
it was 200 years ago that he escaped , bound for waterloo and on to a more permanent exile in st helena
but the locals still revere the celebrity prisoner who , for just under a year , was formally recognised as the king of elba
inviting : the pretty harbour of portoferraio in elba , an island which lies just 12 miles off the coast of tuscan in this anniversary year , there are plenty of pageants and parades in his honour
yet , as i sit bobbing on the waters below his villa , i ca n't help thinking that napoleon must have spent his later years wondering why he ever left
for there is something magical , something other about elba
half the size of the isle of wight , this fish - shaped island has 3,000ft peaks , coral reefs , beaches of every complexion and italian 's lowest crime rate
though just 12 miles off the coast of tuscan , it bears little resemblance to the chi - chi tourist trap of chiantishire
the vast majority of visitors who make the one - hour ferry crossing from piombino are ordinary italian ( we do n't meet a briton all week )
with a tiny airport , it has been spared major development , and half of its 85 square miles area is national park
many beaches and bays can be reached only by hiking , biking or , better still , by boat
that is why elba is perfect for a sailing holiday , whether you are a sailor or not
a comfortable six - bed , 40ft yacht can be a lot cheaper than a hotel or villa
you 'd be hard - pushed to find a view to match the one from our deck as we sit back , beer in hand , and watch the sun set behind monte capanne
blissful bobbing : lovely porto azzurro is an ideal place to drop anchor , perfect for pizzas and people - watching kent - based nautilus yachting has yachts all over the med and has been organising charters around elba and the tuscan archipelago for years
we settle on a bavaria 40 , a popular cruising yacht with a flip - down bathing platform at the back
little sailors : robert 's children adored life on board the only question is : who will do the sailing ? nautilus yachting can organise a skipper for Â£ 90 a day
but having been messing around in boats since childhood , i want to take charge
you might almost call it a napoleon complex ( my wife does )
so i have to go back to school
the basic requirement for renting anything larger than a day boat is the royal yachting association 's day skipper certificate , within easy reach of the average dinghy sailor
it involves a five - day practical sailing course plus a detailed theory course
you can do the latter online , but you must live aboard for the practical part
sunsail runs flotillas and courses all over the world , and i join the fleet on the solent
it proves invaluable ; after five days mixing with ferries , container ships and hovercraft in one of europe 's busiest sealanes , i am more than ready to steer a course for elba
and you do n't have to worry about tide in the tyrrhenian sea
we pick up the boat at puntone di scarlino , a mainland marina 90 minutes by car from pisa
cleverly designed , it has three double cabins , two separate shower / loo rooms - plus a shower on deck - and a solar panel for extra power
setting off in napoleon 's wake , we are swimming off elba 's eastern shores three hours later
i had feared that our three children would soon start moaning - or being sick
but they adore life aboard
we keep the sailing to an hour or two each morning before dropping the anchor in a pretty bay , swimming and exploring in the rubber dinghy ( every boat comes with one )
i had hoped to spend a night or two on the quayside in a pretty little fishing town such as marciana marina on elba 's northern coast , but there 's no chance in mid-august ( unless you know the harbour master )
so we anchor off towns like porto azzurro and go ashore for pizzas , ice cream and people - watching , then head back - by torchlight - to our haven , far from the nightlife
favoured spot : the gulf of biodola has a three - mile crescent of sand - as well as elba 's smartest hotel elba 's capital , portoferraio , is well worth a visit
walk through the old town to the ramparts at the top
napoleon lived up here and his villa is now a popular museum
you do n't need to eat on the waterfront ; the best local food is to be found in the back streets
a few miles further along the coast , we find our favourite spot , the gulf of biodola
this three - mile crescent of sand , where the trees come right down to the water , is home to elba 's smartest hotel , the hermitage
when daddy 's attempt at spaghetti al pesto results in a thumbs - down followed by a mutiny , we jump in the dinghy and , five minutes later , are at the poolside buffet
more adventurous sailors would , no doubt , sail right around the island , taking in the wild western shores
some would trek up to the mountain town of capoliveri or strike out for the other islands in the tuscan archipelago - or even reach napoleon 's native island of corsica
pottering along at our child - friendly pace , we only do half of elba
and i never do find the place where napoleon hatched his escape plan
it means that , unlike him , we will have to return
