they are extraordinary treasure troves , stuffed full of some of the greatest works of art that britain has ever produced
but the national trust now wants its stately homes to have fewer exhibits â because they are too demanding on visitors
the charity , which owns 500 historic homes and gardens , is worried that rooms often have â so much stuff â it puts off all but the middle classes
national trust , which owns 500 historic homes and gardens such as cliveden house in buckinghamshire , is worried that exhibitions often have â so much stuff â it puts off all but the middle classes in an attempt to try to broaden the appeal of britain âs grand properties , bosses yesterday launched a ten - year strategy that includes plans to â simplify â some exhibits
dame dame helen , director general of the national trust , said simplifying the exhibits may be necessary
â we are making visitors work too hard in some places , â she said â it âs not surprising given that where we have come from , that the type of places that we own are the places where the middle classes feel more comfortable , that it forms more of their cultural background
â our analysis is that it is nât the entrance fee that is putting people off , it is that they think this is nât â the place for them â so how do we get them in ? â the national trust 's director general dame dame helen , said places like the carrick-a-rede bridge attracts visitors from all social classes dame dame helen , who was permanent secretary of the home office until she was appointed to the national trust in 2012 , said that some properties have a broader appeal
â when you go to somewhere like carrick-a-rede in northern ireland and watch people walking over the rope bridge , they are from every socio - economic background , wearing shorts , flip flops , all of that , â she said
but many of the large stately homes have a far narrower visitor base
the national trust is to experiment with simplifying the exhibits at some of its properties
dame dame helen said : â when it comes to our big grand houses one of the things we have to look at is the sheer number of exhibits
there is so much stuff in there
â let âs not expect our visitors to look at every single picture in a room - let â s pick one lovely thing , put it in the middle of the room and light it really well
â let âs just have six or seven of those things dotted around that anybody would love - it âs not difficult
â we make people work fantastically hard - we could make them work much less hard
â but she denied that the national trust is â dumbing down â its approach in order to boost visitor numbers
â in many ways it is much more intellectually rewarding , â dame helen insisted
â people will learn much more by looking at one object in a lot of detail , than they ever would going round a room getting a vague impression
â parker , chairman of the national trust , added : â every museum and gallery has the middle class problem
â we have serious aspirations to broaden our appeal - but the worst thing we can possibly do is to semi-condescend a group of people in order to a property seem more attractive
â national trust is also putting a renewed emphasis on the great outdoors in the spirit of its founder octavia hill , who campaigned to provide open spaces for the poor
as part of that goal it is working as a consultant body with councils in sheffield , manchester and coventry , to look at new ways to maintain and fund urban parks
the national trust hopes to use its experience in establishing endowments - the funding model that it uses to conserve many of its historic houses - to help set up new funding models for green city spaces
although the national trust is not putting in any money to the schemes , other charities such as the heritage lottery fund and nesta are also involved
mr parker , a businessman who recently took over as chairman from outspoken journalist sir simon jenkins , said outdoor space is a key way to broaden the national trust âs appeal
â the fantastic opportunity for the national trust is that we are not confined to buildings - we have lots of parks - people do nât have to go inside , â he said
â we can do lots of things to make the whole offer that we have appeal not just to people who are in their 50s and 40s but people who are in their 20s and 30s as well
it is an age thing , not just a class thing
