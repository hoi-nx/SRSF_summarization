burnley manager sean dyche has reassured ings that the door is still open to a senior england call - up if his rise to stardom continues
ings has emerged as one of the most exciting young strikers in the country alongside tottenham âs harry kane this season , and has been linked with moves to liverpool and manchester city when his contract at burnley runs out in the summer
but while harry kane was called up for the first time on thursday when roy hodgson named his squad to face lithuania and italy at the end of the month , ings had to be satisfied with a place in the under - 21 party
burnley striker ings was left out of roy hodgson 's england squad despite his recent good form ings ' manager at club level , sean dyche , said he is sure ings is in england 's thoughts and told him to push on the young striker has become a big part of the england under 21 set up and is in gareth southgate 's squad â i âm not surprised , â said sean dyche
â i âd like to think he âs in their thoughts and in and around their thinking
â there are lots of other players out there doing well
obviously the main one is harry kane
â i would certainly promote them to continue monitoring him because i think he âs got a freshness to the way he plays and is different to a lot of centre - forwards who would be considered
â we âve enjoyed what he âs doing here and he âs definitely learning
that âs the big thing when you âre a young player , and particularly playing at this level
are you getting used to it ? are you learning ? overall he has
â there are no guarantees
it âs for roy hodgson and his staff to decide
as long as he keeps progressing , he âll certainly always be in their thinking
â ings ' contract at turf moor expires at the end of the season but sean dyche wants him to push on for burnley the burnley boss was not surprised to see ings left out of the senior set - up considering the depth of forwards ings âs strike partner vokes has been recalled to the wales squad for the first time in more than a year for their euro 2016 qualifier against israel , just a few days after making his first premier league appearance for burnley in last weekend âs surprise win over manchester city
vokes , 25 , missed the first five months of the season with a knee injury and sean dyche admits the player is still getting back to his best
he added : â i âm sure judging by how vokes operated last week that he âs well and truly on his way to full match fitness
i do nât expect it to happen overnight , it âs down to the game time we can give him when we think it âs appropriate
roy hodgson opted for harry kane , wayne rooney , daniel sturridge and danny welbeck as his strikers ings and harry kane ( right ) are key members of the side for gareth southgate ( left ) ahead of the european championships â i spoke to chris ( coleman ) and let him know where he was at
i said it was touch and go whether he started ( against manchester city ) , and i did start him
â i still think there is more to come from him â that true match fitness that can only come from games â so we âll try and be wise with that
â it âs important with a player âs recovery to be given time
that has paid itself back with a reasonable , if not a good performance actually , last week
there is still more to come as he gets used to this level and the sharpness returns
â vokes has been named in wales ' squad for their upcoming games after over a year out of the set - up vokes has been rewarded for his good form with burnley , including playing in the win over manchester city
