in the dream scenario gerrard 's final action in a liverpool shirt will be the lifting of the fa cup at wembley on may 30 , his 35th birthday
for more than 16 years gerrard was anfield 's beating heart
the good times were great
he gave them istanbul , a crazy , glorious night forever etched into the club 's history
a year later , in 2006 , it was his last - minute long - range strike that gave them life against west ham in cardiff
gerrard returned to liverpool training earlier this week after almost a month out with injury the club captain led liverpool to champions league glory against ac milan in 2005 in total there was a champions league , a uefa cup , two fa cups and three league cups
even in the bad times ( and there were plenty as a premier league title remained elusive ) the local boy was a source of scouse inspiration
when roy hodgson wobbled and king kenny came back but could only lead them to eighth , punters in pubs from formby to fazakerley could take solace
' at least we 've got gerrard '
from next season , however , they will not
they appear to be giant boots to fill
imagining a liverpool without gerrard is like imagining the beatles without paul mccartney
but the show must go on and , in henderson , rodgers might just have the ideal replacement
a year later gerrard inspired the reds to an fa cup win against west ham a liverpool team without gerrard will be like the beatles without paul mccartney ( front left ) his goalkeeper certainly thinks so
after wednesday 's 2 - 0 win over burnley simon mignolet cast an early vote for may 's anfield election
' jordan is a massive player for us , ' he said
' he is a very positive character who always works hard and leads by example
' he 's vocal both on the pitch and in the dressing room
he goes in front of us and everyone follows behind
' can henderson lead from the front like gerrard ? can he carry the team on his back ? some would point to the penalty spat with mario as evidence that the 24 - year - old is not cut out for the job
henderson has led the team in gerrard 's absence as liverpool have made a charge for the top four henderson has been in inspired form for liverpool and struck sensational goals in his last two games gerrard , they say , would never have let the italian take the ball
he would have shown him who was boss
the man himself said as much
but they would be wrong to criticise
mario , being mario , was always going to try and take the penalty
and why not ? have you seen his record ? out of 29 penalties he has scored 27
aside from his unpredictability , scoring from the spot is one of few things consistent about madcap mario and henderson , who has never taken a penalty in such a high - stakes environment , will have known that
for the good of the team he made the right call not to make a fuss
surely that is the mark of a good captain ? gerrard , a fine skipper , was the master of responding to adversity and henderson is no stranger to ramming critics ' barbs back from whence they came
since sir alex ferguson 's trial by autobiography he has written promising new chapters in his liverpool career
against burnley he hit a netbuster from distance and then slid to his knees in front of the kop
sound familiar ? henderson celebrates after finding the top corner against manchester city last weekend in the five games hemderson has played since gerrard 's absence liverpool have won all five matches his accent may be more wearside than whiston but henderson is now being talked up as a successor and for good reason
there is a growing clamour to hand the armband to the emre can
the midfielder - turned - defender has been impressive since his backwards switch and was first to pick up dejan lovren following his penalty miss at besiktas
the ' # beast ' is only 21 , however , and his time will come
time will be up for us - bound gerrard at stoke or at wembley
whether it 's in brent or at the britannia , liverpool will bid a painful farewell to their talisman and he will be missed
but if gerrard remained the player that so often dragged his side from the turf rodgers would not have allowed him to leave and that is worth noting when the inevitable tears are shed at his watershed
in the six premier league games that gerrard has missed this season liverpool have won them all it is easy to get sentimental when it comes to such a figure
gerrard deserves to be remembered as a legend because , in this world where the word is bandied about at the drop of the hat , he is one
the fact of the matter , however , is that his impact has lessened considerably in recent times
in the premier league this season liverpool have played 22 games with gerrard in the side
they have won nine of those , drawn six and lost seven at an average of 1.3 goals for , 1.3 against and 1.5 points per game
without gerrard they have played six games and won them all with an average of 2.3 goals for to 0.3 goals against
maybe those boots are not as big as they used to be .
