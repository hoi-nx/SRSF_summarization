parents who â overvalue â their children risk creating arrogant , narcissistic adults , according to scientists they may be your pride and joy â but telling your child they are special gives them an inflated view of themselves
and parents who â overvalue â their children risk creating arrogant , narcissistic adults , according to scientists
a psychological study found that instead of telling children they are better than others , parents should tell them they are as good as anyone else
the research , which tracked participants for 18 months , suggests there is a fine line between self - esteem and narcissism
children who are repeatedly told they are special go on to have an inflated view of themselves , whereas those who are simply told they are loved tend to be confident and well - rounded
the difference is a child who thinks they are as good as others â and one who thinks they are better than others and entitled to special treatment
however , narcissistic children still have lower self - esteem than their more modest playmates
the study of 565 dutch children aged seven to 11 was carried out in a joint project by the university of amsterdam and ohio state university
interviewed four times , parents were asked about their relationship and conversations with their child , and the child was asked how they viewed themselves and others
lead researcher dr brummelman , from the university of amsterdam , said : â rather than raising self - esteem , overvaluing practices may inadvertently raise levels of narcissism
â professor bushman of ohio state university added : â children believe it when their parents tell them that they are more special than others
that may not be good for them or for society
people with high self - esteem think they âre as good as others , whereas narcissists think they âre better than others
â the study , published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences , found that children who were repeatedly told they were special tended to think less of others â but did not necessarily have higher self - esteem
in contrast , children whose parents showed them more emotional warmth had higher levels of self - esteem
professor bushman said : â overvaluation predicted narcissism , not self - esteem , whereas warmth predicted self - esteem , not narcissism
â the research , which tracked participants for 18 months , suggests there is a fine line between self - esteem and narcissism the psychologist , a father of three , said his research had changed his own parenting style
â when i first started doing this research in the 1990s , i used to think my children should be treated like they were extra-special , â he said
â i âm careful not to do that now
â it is important to express warmth to your children because that may promote self - esteem , but overvaluing them may promote higher narcissism
â dr brummelman suggested that parents could be taught to express affection without telling their children they are superior to others
â future studies should test whether this can work , â he said .
