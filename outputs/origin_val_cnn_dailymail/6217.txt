el salvador players and fans were left bemused ahead of their friendly against argentina when , instead of pumping out their national anthem , the stadium 's sound system instead played the anthem of kazakhstan
the central america minnows , ranked 89th in the world by fifa , were facing the world cup runners - up at washington 's fedex field on saturday but their large travelling support were unimpressed as the stadium dj 's mistake became apparent ahead of kick - off
rather than the familiar ' himno nacional de el salvador ' , staff at the stadium which usually hosts the nfl 's washington redskins played out ' menin qazaqstanim '
el salvador players were left bemused when the kazakhstan national anthem was played instead of theirs the players , stood proud with hands on their chests , look confused by the error , glancing around having listened to the kazakhstan anthem , the salvadorans head for the handshakes with their heads down supporters instead the stadium had prepared a huge banner for the anthem but ended up booing it el salvador ( 5 - 4 - 1 ) : carillo ; flores , mendoza , molina , renderos ( ceren 88 ) , larin ; alvarez , ceren , menjivar ( punyed 76 ) , alas ( santamarã­a 67 ) ; bonilla ( burgos 59 ) argentina ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : guzman ; zabaleta , musacchio , funes mori , orban ; pereyra , banega ; di maria ( federico mancuello 73 ) , lavezzi , tevez ( pastore 78 ) ; higuain scorers : renderos og 54 , federico mancuello 88 the players stood out on the pitch , with their hands across their chests looked confused at first , before becoming increasingly frustrated as boos rang out on to the field
the supporters - who had prepared a ' vamos selecta , houston ' flag to be carried over the crowd - reacted furiously
washington is home to one of the largest salvadoran communities outside of central america and their followers outnumbered the argentine support
to make things worse , el salvador fell to an expected defeat against an argentina side who left out lionel messi and sergio aguero
the distance from el salvador to kazakhstan is 7,909 miles , a fairly big mistake for the stadium staff to make argentina players celebrate after federico mancuello ( left ) scored a goal during the international friendly lionel messi was not required by argentina in their 2 - 0 win , and neither was manchester city 's sergio aguero gerardo martino 's side dominated the game and took the lead in the 54th minute thanks to a nestor renderos own goal deflected from ever banega 's shot
substitute federico mancuello then made sure of the win with a free kick from a tight angle on 88 minutes
let us salute , the motherland , proudly , to be its children , called we can , and let us swear our lives spiritedly , without rest to its good , consecrate ! of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness , el salvador always nobly dreamed
to achieve this has been her eternal proposition , to keep it , her greatest glory
with inviolable faith , the path of progress , she strives to follow , to fulfill her great destiny , and conquer a happy future
a stern barrier protects her , against the clash of vile disloyalty , ever since the day when her soaring flag , wrote freedom with it 's blood
translated from spanish golden sun in the skies , golden seed in the steps , legend of courage , take a look at my country ! from the antiquity our heroic glory emerged , they did not give up their honour , my kazakhstan people are strong ! the way was opened to the descendants , by the vast land i have
its unity is proper , i have an independent country , it welcomed the tests of time , like an eternal friend , our country is blessed , our country is such ! translated from kazakhstan
