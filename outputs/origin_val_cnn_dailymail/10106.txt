ufc 's undefeated bantamweight champion ' rousey ' rousey has dismissed claims that mixed martial arts is too dangerous a sport or that it degrades women
the 28 - year - old told good morning america , ' there are so many ridiculous arguments that mma is somehow anti-woman
fighting 's not a man 's thing , it 's a human thing
to say it 's anti-woman , is i think , an anti-feminist statement
in the ufc , i mean , i 'm the biggest draw in the sport and i 'm a woman ! ' rousey , who won a bronze medal for judo at the 2008 olympic games in beijing , also feels that mma is unfairly stigmatized
ufc 's bantamweight champion rousey gives an impassioned interview on good morning america the 28 - year - old fighter believes that mma is an unfairly stigmatized sport that does plenty to help women she said , ' i 'm a two - time olympian , olympic medalist , and when i was doing judo , the exact same things i really apply in mma , i was celebrated as an american hero
somehow , when i do it for money , i 'm a barbarian ? ' rousey also commented on how mma has helped to improve the way women are treated in popular culture
in terms of ufc directly working towards that end , rousey explained , ' just this last weekend , women were introduced walking to the octagon not as women 's bantamweights , they were just bantamweights
they were just introduced as fighters , and that 's it
it 's the first sport in the world to do that
' rousey has recently signed a new long - term contract with ufc
