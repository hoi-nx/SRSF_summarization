and they were soon on the offensive , with visiting goalkeeper rok vodisek pushing away a fierce shot from the leicester striker layton ndukwu , who was chasing his fifth goal in euro qualifying , inside two minutes
slovenia , who had easily beaten romania 3 - 0 in their first game of the qualifying mini-group on saturday night , threatened when timi max semic cut inside and forced england goalkeeper woolston into a low fingertip save
but england took the lead on 20 minutes and it was all the work of young everton winger holland

back came slovenia and newcastle stopper woolston excelled with a one - handed save to keep out jacob novak âs thunderbolt
while the away side failed to take their chances , england were clinical and were in total command by half - time
holland gained a goal that was just reward for his efforts on 36 minutes , playing a one - two with arsenal man chris willock inside the box before drilling the ball into the bottom corner from 10 yards
and holland was involved in the third too , which arrived two minutes later
having advanced into space down the right , his cut - back was sliced by full - back rom into his own net
peacock was allowed the luxury to make changes in the second period and manchester city duo will patching and lukas nmecha were given a run - out , as was tottenham âs marcus edwards
holland celebrates adding england 's second goal of the game in the 36th minute holland celebrates his strike with his international team - mates as england cruised to victory england 's victory meant they qualified with five wins from five and still have a group game remaining and the latter came close to scoring the fourth following some nifty footwork but his shot from a tight angle was blocked at the near post
slovenia deserved something on the balance of play and pulled one back 15 minutes from time when fiorentina man mlakar , the skipper , looped home a back post header
but a comeback never looked likely and england complete their qualifying campaign against romania at burton on thursday knowing their place in the finals is already rubber - stamped .
