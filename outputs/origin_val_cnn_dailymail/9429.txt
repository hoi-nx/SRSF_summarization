strachan has declared scotland and recalled striker jordan rhodes are ready to work together at long last as he prepares to field the nation 's ' best out - and - out goalscorer ' in a competitive fixture for the first time in 18 months
the national manager kept the blackburn rovers hitman in exile as he went about honing a system for the improving scots , saying that jordan rhodes was not a fit for the international game he wished to create
but the striker followed up his surprise return to the squad with a substitute appearance in the midweek friendly win over northern ireland â and strachan last confirmed on saturday that the 25 - year - old will be let loose on minnows gibraltar at some stage of the euro 2016 qualifier on sunday
recalled scotland striker jordan rhodes has been called his country 's ' best out - and - out goalscorer ' scotland manager strachan had left rhodes out of the side while he changed his formation jordan rhodes made his return to the scotland set - up with an appearance against northern ireland on wednesday strachan is set to deviate from his 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation in a bid for goals and that could hand jordan rhodes a start in a two - man strike force against the group d rookies
it would prove a hit with the tartan army , whose favourite jordan rhodes ' last appearance in a qualifying game was as a substitute in a 2 - 0 defeat by belgium in september 2013 , after which strachan said he was committed to a style that ' does n't suit ' the Â£ 8million forward
now jordan rhodes and strachan 's plans are equipped to blend , with the manager explaining : ' i think we 've evolved since he was last in the squad and , although he has not evolved with us , i think he has the intelligence to get better all the time because he can take things in
' but i think he would find it easier playing with us now than it was two years ago
i 'd say we make it easier for a striker to play with us now
' he 's probably the best out - and - out goalscorer we 've got
but that was n't the criteria to get us kick - started back then with where we wanted to go
' jordan rhodes missed 11 scotland fixtures during his omission but is set to earn a 14th cap with a second hampden appearance in five days
' ( his selection ) ca n't be a one - off because we are playing two games , ' said strachan
' he 's already been playing in one and he 's going to play in another one
' we have a few players who could find this the right type of game for them
i picked the squad with that in mind
it 's up to everyone to play well enough to be in the side
' i ca n't say anyone will have a major role in the future
if i said ' he has a major role ' and someone comes into the position and is better , he 'll have a major role
it 's up to you to play well enough to be in there
