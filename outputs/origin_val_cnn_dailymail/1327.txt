the australian marine and rescue organisation ( amwrro ) is the only group in south australia that is licensed to rescue , rehabilitate and release marine wildlife and the only organisation in the country with a purpose - built facility to hold them long term

australian marine , wildlife research and rescue organisation ( amwrro ) could face closure after incurring $ 200,000 worth of legal fees james the seal is pictured being released after several weeks of care the nonprofit group is the only organisation in south australia that is licensed to rescue , rehabilitate and release marine wildlife
a net killed a juvenile fur seal which washed ashore in october they also regularly help native wildlife and continue to treat koalas and kangaroos who were injured in the adelaide brushfires earlier this year ' there would be nothing left in south australia to help these sea creatures
we are the only ones , ' mr machado told daily mail australia
' every day we see seals who have been entangled in fishing tackle , turtles who come up after eating plastic , animals who have been attacked by dogs
sea birds are our biggest clientÃ¨le though
' the nonprofit organisation , which has almost 500 registered volunteers , was sued for defamation by an employee at the dewnr ( dewnr ) three years ago and lost the court battle on january 22 of this year
' i sent an email to minister a few years ago about an animal welfare case outlining my concerns and the individual mentioned in the email believed he was defamed and launched defamation proceedings against me and the organisation , ' mr machado explained
' every day we see seals who have been entangled in fishing tackle , turtles who come up after eating plastic , animals who have been attacked by dogs
sea birds are our biggest clientele though , ' president and founder machado said jeffery the sea bird was caked in fatty grease when he was helped by the organisation , which is facing closure after incurring $ 200,000 in legal fees
the pelican had found his way into an uncovered ' grease trap ' at a waste management depot and underwent a two hour scrub to remove 95 per cent of the fat a young wood duck was treated after being shot with two home - made arrows that narrowly missed her internal organs the group was sued for defaming a state government worker in an email and now could be forced to shut down due to being unable to afford the $ 200,000 fee the loss means that amwrro has to pay damages of $ 59,000 as well as both their opposition 's and their own legal costs on top of the court fees : a total estimated value of $ 200,000
' we are a non-profit organisation that i have funded by mortgaging my house four times in the last 17 years every time we need medical equipment or a boat , ' mr machado said
' we run off membership costs , donations and corporate sponsorship
we are a state wide organisation which works all over south australia without government funding
' it costs $ 50,000 a year to run the organisation and we 'll be lucky to have that in our account let alone the $ 200,000
the money we do get coming in on an annual basis it difficult enough to maintain without having something like this come up
