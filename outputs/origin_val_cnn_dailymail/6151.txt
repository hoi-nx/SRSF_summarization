the number of homes planned for the country âs green belt has increased 38 per cent in less than two years , according to a study by the cpre ( cpre )
nearly 220,000 houses are in the pipeline for green belt land â up 61,000 on cpre âs last count in august 2013 â and the campaigners say the increase is a direct result of the government âs national planning policy framework , which aimed to speed up decisions and boost house building

â this government has safeguarded national green belt protection and increased protection of important green spaces
