she added : ' this was a pre-planned offence involving you taking a chainsaw to your former matrimonial home to wreak revenge upon your wife
it was part of the continuing course of conduct whilst there was a restraining order
' the circumstances of this offence and value of damage caused , means an immediate prison sentence is inevitable
your conduct was towards the mother of your children
' earlier the court heard the couple split up in september 2011 and in may 2014 at the matrimonial court , an order was made transferring ownership of the property to mrs brooks ' name
but mrs brooks was said to have had concerns that her former husband would take steps to reduce the value of the property , which was at the time vacant , in revenge for her being awarded the house
as a result the locks on the door were changed and the keys were deposited at the police station so that entry could only be gained by going to the station
the house insurance was also increased by mrs brooks
days later brooks was seen by a neighbour at the rear of his former address walking around the garden with the chainsaw
he was seen taking the chainsaw in order to remove the panel of the pvc door
he was to say that he had lost his keys and did not want to change the locks before using the chainsaw to gain access into the property
