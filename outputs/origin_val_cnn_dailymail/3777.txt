facebook faced a backlash last year for forcing users to download a separate messenger app for mobile , and it looks like the web version is heading in the same direction
the social network has launched messenger.com - a standalone site that lets users chat to facebook friends privately on a browser in the same way they can on the messenger app. for the time being users can still send , receive and view messages on facebook , and the site has not announced any current plans to remove this feature yet

facebook did n't reveal its future plans for the service , but told mailonline : ' we 're launching messenger for web browsers - a standalone web chat product accessible via messenger.com
' once logged in , people can dive directly into a dedicated desktop messaging experience , keeping their conversations going and picking up where they left off
' to use messenger.com , users log in with facebook credentials and the site will automatically import their contacts and current chats
these conversations are shown full screen , as opposed to the pop - up on facebook or the half screen view on the main facebook messages page
none of the other facebook buttons , including links to the news feed , are visible , but settings can be managed by clicking the gear icon in the top left - hand corner
this menu lets users manage sounds , see desktop notifications and block users
whatsapp first hinted it would let users make free calls to each other early last year
now android users can make voice calls and the feature will come to ios soon
the latest version of the popular messaging app also has a cleaner layout with three tabs for contacts , chats and calls
users simply have to click on the â calls â tab and choose a contact to phone a friend at no cost
however this only works between whatsapp users and it relies on an internet connection

one of these messenger upgrades was designed to connect customers with companies ( example pictured ) , called messenger business
' we 're making messenger a place where you can easily communicate with the businesses you care about in addition to the people you care about , ' mr zuckerberg said at the time , members said they were outraged by the changes and flocked to the respective app stores to complain
they were also concerned about the app âs permissions that gave facebook access to send texts and make calls on the user âs device
facebook was then forced to respond with a blog post explaining why it needed certain permissions
it said : â almost all apps need certain permissions to run on android , and we use these permissions to run features in the app. â keep in mind that android controls the way the permissions are named , and the way they âre named does nât necessarily reflect the way the messenger app and other apps use them
