they were supposed to be presenting a united front before tomorrow 's budget marks the unofficial end of the coalition
but cameron and clegg looked more like the cast of armageddon as they marched through a dark tunnel in bright orange overalls
both men rushed to claim credit for a sharp rise in the minimum wage , but behind the smiles there are deep divisions over which tax cuts will be announced by george osborne tomorrow
but the government hopes to set out a more upbeat picture this week , claiming to have brought the britain economy back from the brink
tomorrow 's budget is expected to include a promise of tax cuts for low and middle earners , extra money for mental health and freedom for pensioners to turn their retirement into a cash lump sum
today mr cameron and mr clegg made a joint announcement on rises in the minimum wage
wearing bright orange overalls on a visit to crossrail , they looked like they were in the cast of the 1998 film starring bruce willis and ben affleck
mr cameron hopes to use the budget to catapult the tories into a poll lead ahead of the election on may 7 the rate for apprentices will rise sharply by 57p from Â£ 2.73 per hour to Â£ 3.30 - 50p more than had been recommended by the independent lpc
ministers said the proposed small hike in the rate for apprentices failed to reflect efforts to boost the status of vocational alternatives as a way into well - paid jobs - and went beyond the recommendation for the second time in three years
mr cameron and mr clegg met apprentices working on a major transport project to promote the change - in one of their last joint appearances as coalition partners before may 's general election
' no - one should earn less than Â£ 3 an hour , ' mr cameron said after touring work beneath london on a station for the capital 's new crossrail link
' it is a good deal , it is right for our country and we can only do it because we have got a strong economy
' i have been talking to apprentices here who after two or three years as an apprentice could be earning Â£ 25 - Â£ 26,000 a year
that 's what i want for our country - a country where if you work hard and do the right thing you get rewarded
' mr cameron and mr clegg both defended a sharp rise in the minimum wage for apprentices to over Â£ 3 an hour mr clegg said the ' vast majority ' of employers already paid apprentices at least that sum but that it was right to significantly increase the minimum
' generally governments do what the lpc says , ' he said
' but on this occasion we felt that ... Â£ 2.80 - that is still pretty low , even for apprentices to get by on
' even though it was right that they earned less than full - time workers ' they do nonetheless need to be paid in a way that allows them to earn and learn , get their qualifications and then move on to full - time employment '
with just two weeks until the start of the election campaign , both men will hope to avoid heading to the exit door cbi director - general john cridland said the overruling on the apprentice rate was ' disappointing '
' the national minimum wage has been one of the most successful policies of recent years , thanks to the independence of the commission - its politicisation is worrying , ' he said
concerns were also raised by federation of small businesses chairman john allan who said the large rise came on top of other increased apprenticeship costs and would have to be ' monitored closely ' , and by british retail consortium director general helen dickinson who warned that any significant departure ' risks upsetting the fine balance struck by the lpc and potentially negatively impacting workers , the economy or both '
but sharon spice , director of student recruitment at the icaew ( icaew ) , said the rise would ' help remove some of the stigma around apprenticeships being a second rate career option , making them more attractive to young people ' though more funding was needed to support small businesses in offering them
tuc general secretary frances o'grady said there should have been a ' much bolder increase ' in the main rate
' with one in five workers getting less than a living wage , this is nowhere near enough to end in - work poverty
britain 's minimum - wage workers should be very fearful of the billions of pounds of cuts to government help for the low - paid that the chancellor is planning if re-elected , ' she said .
