a fallen tree branch became much more frightening when it not only held up traffic , but began to slither
jette petersen and her family had just moved to davidson on the northern beaches and did not expect a welcoming present so large
petersen told daily mail australia she heard a car on the street slam on its brakes and assumed a branch had fallen down from a tree , but then it moved
" i screamed and called out to the whole family that there was a huge snake on the street , " she said
" the 2 metre long giant slithered under the bonnet and took refuge within the pipes before again emerging and stretching along the entire roof of the car
petersen had called an australian wildlife rescue organisation ( wires ) representative who told her volunteers were too busy to respond immediately so they chose to act themselves
" i screamed and called out to the whole family that there was a huge snake on the street , " petersen said the family attempted to hose the python out of the piping , to no avail
with a neighbour 's advice , they then took to spraying it with a small dose of vinegar which irritated the snake enough to slither out of the bonnet
it moved toward another elderly neighbour 's home to whom she warned of the incoming but were not phased as pythons were a regular occurrence in davidson
petersen said her family were very curious about the snake while she was less impressed
the denmark family were fascinated by the python as snakes were not a frequent occurence " at 12 , 14 16 and 19 , the children were fascinated , " she said
" but i hate snakes and it was really really long
" this is petersen 's fourth snake encounter since moving to australia from denmark and she says her friends were amazed by the video
" we do n't have snakes in denmark , " she said
" we used to have two diamond pythons living in our roof in our first house in killarney heights and then not long after i saw a red bellied black snake on my run about narrabeen lakes that was just laying on the path in front of me
