uk 's courts are â seriously weakening â the fight against terrorism by â trotting along â with politically correct rulings from europe judges , a new study claims
uk judges are on an â expansionist binge â which has led them to implementing human rights laws made in strasbourg on crucial national security issues including deporting terror suspects and control orders
by applying and interpreting euro legislation , the unelected judiciary is â meddling â in policy decisions made by parliament which amounts to a â denial of democracy â , according to a report by the influential civitas think - tank
it calls for a shake - up of the human rights act to prevent further â power grabs â by the uk courts encroaching into areas that should be left to the government and mps
battle : muslim cleric abu qatada , described as al qaeda âs spokesman in uk , was finally returned home in 2013 after a 12 - year legal battle which cost taxpayers millions the report , published today fri , blasts uk âs left - leaning judiciary for being â too willing â to apply rulings from the european court of human rights in the uk , rather than simply taking them into account
barrister arnheim , who wrote the study the problem with human rights law , said the situation was hampering the government âs ability to protect our borders by fighting terrorism and illegal immigration â putting innocent lives at risk
in one high - profile case , the court of appeal ruled in 2008 that deporting hate preacher abu qatada would breach his human rights , because evidence to be used against him on trial in jordan may have been obtained through torture
the firebrand muslim cleric , described as al qaeda âs spokesman in uk and who spouted bile on the streets on london , was finally returned home in 2013 after a 12 - year legal battle which cost taxpayers millions of pounds
meanwhile , uk judges have been blasted for weakening now - defunct control orders and the replacement terrorism prevention and investigation measures ( tpims ) which were introduced to impose rigid restrictions on terror suspects who could not be prosecuted or deported
it fuelled concern that the judiciary was chiselling away at measures to protect the uk from jihadists
' too willing ' : uk judges have been accused of being too willing to apply rulings from eu courts in the uk , rather than taking them into account there has also been outrage over cases in which criminals have avoided deportation by pleading that their removal would breach the family life clause of the european convention on human rights
among them was aso mohammed ibrahim , a failed asylum seeker who ran down and killed 12 - year - old amy houston - and fled the scene - while disqualified from driving
a judge subsequently allowed him to remain here because he had two children with a uk woman
in his report , mr arnheim said : â the domestic courts are on an expansionist binge , which has never been checked by the government or parliament
â continued failure to check this development will result not only in a serious weakening of national defences against terrorism and illegal immigration , but will also amount to a denial of democracy
â national security and the public interest actually refer to the human rights of thousands or even millions of individuals
â preventing the government from detaining or deporting potentially dangerous individuals may result in the violation of the individual rights to liberty or even to life of thousands of law - abiding citizens
â the report says that uk domestic courts tend to â trot along â rulings made by the european court of human rights because it is â politically correct â
â more and more english judges are now starting to pooh - pooh the age - old uk constitutional principle of the sovereignty of parliament and the rule that legislation and policy decisions are no - go areas for the courts , â mr arnheim wrote
but he also criticised successive â supine â governments for â lacking the courage â to stand up to the judiciary
demanding reform rather than the scrapping of the human rights act , he said it was imperative that â clear limits â are imposed on the ability of judges to interpret and extend the scope of europe human rights laws
at last year âs conservatives party conference , justice secretary chris grayling has gone further by pledging to scrap labour âs human rights act and replace it with a uk bill of rights if the conservatives win the election
under explosive plans to seize back sovereignty over human rights from europe , this would ignore verdicts by euro judges it does not agree with in a bid to reinstate the primacy of parliament
he said if strasbourg objected , the uk would resign from the european court of human rights and â walk away â
