it is a powerful connection between two mothers , captured on camera
myleene , travelling in nepal with save the children , breaks down after a young nepal mum , soshma , recounts the story of the tragic death of her baby son baby rhythm
the emotionally - charged moment comes when the television presenter learns that baby rhythm could n't be saved because the cost of hospital care for the seriously ill infant was too expensive
after his death , her father burned his body in the mountains when soshma , 20 , asks myleene if she has a family of her own , her thoughts clearly turn to daughters ava , seven , and hero , three and the star begins to weep
many mothers in the country are forced to take expensive loans out to pay for hospital care , or like soshma , face trying to care for desperately ill infants alone , often with tragic consequences
myleene explains : ' soshma gave birth at home but realised rhythm was very unwell so she walked for hours to reach the nearest hospital
' he had pneumonia , but in nepal a day in hospital costs a month âs salary so after eight days soshma had no choice but to take rhythm home
' a few days later , as she was breastfeeding , she looked down and realised he had gone
' soshma 's father then burned the body of the young baby in the hills , leaving soshma to grieve
myleene continues : ' soshma was clearly still in shock and said this was the first time she âd really talked about it
television star myleene , an ambassador for save the children , travelled to maternity units in nepal to raise awareness of the country 's ongoing healthcare crisis myleene met health workers in the mountainous country ; save the children say there is currently only one health professional to every 1,493 people in nepal ' her friends and family told her to delete her photos of the baby or she would nât be able to move on
but she had one tiny photo saved as the contact image next to her mum âs number
so now , every time her mum rings , rhythm âs picture flashes up
' as a mum myself that just broke my heart
i have so many pictures of my girls on my phone but i could nât bring them out and show her
i could nât do it
â the ambassador for the charity said of her experience travelling to the mountainous country , where there is only one health worker to every 1,493 people : ' as a mum , i know how terrifying it is to give birth , even with a trained midwife available to help
but in nepal i heard some harrowing stories
' myleene shot a video diary of her time at trishuli in nepal and is clearly shocked by the conditions that await pregnant women in the maternity ward
she describes ' blood on the floor and blood on the walls ' inside the labour rooms and compares it to her own experience of giving birth in london : ' when i think of where i gave birth , in a sterile hospital
sometimes you can have a water birth , you can have your baby at home ... we have all of these options
' she adds : ' i met mums who had to walk on foot or were carried for up to seven hours in a wicker basket to get to a clinic because there are n't any ambulances ; women who had to give birth by the side of the road without a health worker present ; mothers who could n't afford basic medical care for their children â the result was horrifying , and always the same : children dying needlessly

ayusha 's mother had lost her first two babies to childbirth complications ' as a mum , i know how terrifying it is to give birth , even with a trained midwife available to help
but in nepal i heard some harrowing stories
' myleene visits a delivery room in a hospital in trushuli district looking at the facilities on the maternity ward ... pregnant women can travel for up to a day to reach their nearest hospital with its ' no child born to die ' campaign , save the children are highlighting the plight of children dying from preventable causes and asking for the same awareness that eventually halted the spread of the ebola virus to be applied to nepal 's healthcare tragedy
it is urging the government , via a petition , to ' lead the world towards the goal of ending preventable child deaths by 2030 '
the charity is working to provide vital equipment to health centres across the country as well as equipping health visitors with training and offering life - saving advice to new mothers
