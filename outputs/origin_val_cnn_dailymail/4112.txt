beyonce is set to take the coveted leading role in the latest version of a star is born it 's the leading role that has crowned the career of some of hollywood 's finest actresses
and now beyonce is set to follow in the footsteps of judy garland and barbra streisand by taking the coveted part in the latest version of a star is born
the film would provide beyonce , 33 , with her biggest role yet , playing an unknown who rises to stardom as her famous husband 's career spirals downwards
the movie will be directed by american sniper actor cooper , who is also expected to play the leading man
the female lead was first created by gaynor in the original 1937 version , appearing with fredric march
the movie was remade in 1954 with james mason and judy garland â who , like gaynor , was rewarded with a best actress academy award nomination â and again in 1976 with barbra streisand and kris kristofferson
' beyonce feels this could be her big hollywood breakthrough , ' says a movie insider
' it 's a role she has wanted for years
she 's shown that she can act in austin powers : goldmember , and held her own singing in dreamgirls , but this is her chance to prove her dramatic range and maybe even win an academy award
' hollywood studio warner bros has been trying to remake the film for years , negotiating with potential leading men including leonardo dicaprio , tom cruise , will smith and christian bale
but now cooper , 40 , fresh from his academy award - nominated success in american sniper , has come to the fore
he will first be appearing in the west end in may with his hit broadway production of the elephant man
when that run ends , he will make his directorial debut with a star is born , and he has named beyonce as his first choice for his leading lady
negotiations are under way to finalise the deal
' i was looking forward to the production and the opportunity to work with clint eastwood , ' she said after dropping out
' for months we tried to co-ordinate our schedules to bring this remake to life , but it was just not possible
' a source close to the singer added : ' beyonce wants this role , and she 's going to do everything she can to make it happen , but right now it 's down to her agents and managers to hammer out a deal that works for her and the studio
' the singer 's spokesman said : ' beyonce is looking to get back into films and thinks she can not only take on this role but bring something special to the part
' it has been six years since she appeared on the big screen
however , that film , obsessed , was a disappointment at the box office
