â my wrist had started to get uncomfortable , so i decided to get it checked out , â said lucy norman as she looked at the piece of paper in front of her , lucy norman massaged her fingers and puzzled over the spidery , illegible writing
as a personal assistant , she relied on her ability to take accurate , concise notes and was proud of her neat handwriting
yet the words she âd just written were no better than a scrawl
â i âd start writing as normal , but within just a few words , it would fade into little more than a scribble , â says lucy norman , 42 , who lives in barford st michael , oxfordshire , with her husband angus , 64 , an engineer
â it was as if my hand would just stop working
â i âd also been having trouble typing , hitting the wrong letters â previously , i âd been able to touch type accurately at high speed
â initially , lucy norman blamed the problem on tiredness from long working hours and her commute into central london to work at an energy company
but after six months of suffering these symptoms , she made an appointment to see her gp
â my wrist had started to get uncomfortable , so i decided to get it checked out , â she says
â at the time i was 36 , so i did nât suspect anything sinister , but i could nât ignore something that affected the skills that were so intrinsic to my work
' if i could nât write or type , how could i continue to be a pa ? â her doctor diagnosed repetitive strain injury ( rsi ) in the wrist , caused by typing and writing over 20 years , and told her there was nothing they could do
â i accepted the diagnosis without question , â says lucy norman
â it seemed to make perfect sense given my line of work
â rsi is an umbrella term for pain in the muscles , nerves and tendons caused by repetitive movement and over-use
it is extremely common â research shows as many as 73 per cent of people who use a computer at work experience it , with an estimated 200,000 cases of work - related musculoskeletal complaints in the hand , wrist , arm , elbow , shoulder and neck last year alone , according to official statistics
typical rsi conditions include carpal tunnel syndrome , where a nerve in the wrist becomes compressed
other common causes include tendonitis ( inflammation of a tendon ) or tenosynovitis ( inflammation of a tendon sheath )
lucy norman began to experience tremors in her leg 18 months after being diagnosed with rsi
â i âd also started having difficulty with simple tasks , such as brushing my teeth , so i began to get concerned , â she said since there is no test for rsi , diagnosis is usually made on the basis that the condition developed following a repetitive task and is relieved by resting from it
but experts warn that the term rsi is increasingly being used as a blanket diagnosis , and could mask other more serious conditions , such as rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis ( ms ) , diabetes and even parkinson
that âs because the early signs of each of these conditions are so similar to rsi that doctors often consider it first
for example , with diabetes , long - term poor management of blood sugar levels ( often because the condition has nât been diagnosed ) can lead to tingling , numbness and pain in the fingers â all symptoms of rsi , too
â the term rsi is really very vague , â says professor kochhar , a consultant orthopaedic surgeon
â because it covers such a wide range of ambiguous symptoms , it is easy to see how doctors can attribute them to the condition when they are , in fact , indicative of something else entirely
â the most common are rheumatoid arthritis and ms , but it could be a different neurological condition , such as parkinson âs , or diabetes
â â the consultant seemed to be taking it far more seriously than 18 months previously , ' said lucy norman he says that when rsi is suspected , and particularly where there is pain but no sign of injury , such as inflammation , swelling or problems with nerve function , this should be the starting point of investigations to pin down the root cause
â i do nât think that to simply identify that a patient has pain and accept it as a condition in its own right is helpful , â says professor kochhar , visiting professor of sports science at the university of greenwich
he says that once the specific cause has been worked out , each individual condition that may be put under the umbrella of rsi is â absolutely treatable â
â however , the term â rsi â is so nebulous , treatment is very varied depending on the root cause of the pain
in fact , i think the term should be banned
â the key is getting an accurate diagnosis , with all therapists and doctors working together to treat the problem , rather than just accepting it
â lucy norman âs was a classic case of rsi misdiagnosis
after seeing her gp , she tried her best to ignore her symptoms , typing more slowly to maintain her accuracy and using a ruler to keep her writing straight
but 18 months later , she began to experience tremors in her leg , so returned to her gp
â i âd also started having difficulty with simple tasks , such as brushing my teeth , so i began to get concerned , â she says
after walking and writing tests at the gp surgery , she was immediately referred to a neurologist at the nuffield hospital in warwickshire , near where she lived at the time
â the consultant seemed to be taking it far more seriously than 18 months previously , but they still did nât give me any indication of what it could be , â says lucy norman
she was sent for an mri scan on her brain , which was normal
a week later , she had a dat scan , which determines the level of dopamine in the brain â this chemical plays a vital role in regulating movement
lack of dopamine is characteristic of parkinson , causing tremors , slowed movement and stiff , inflexible muscles
the dat scan confirmed that lucy norman did have parkinson âs , and she was put on medication to slow the progression
but four years since her correct diagnosis , she has had to give up work
â i ca nât write very well or type any more , and i tend to stammer and drop things , but i can honestly say i have a better quality of life , â she says
â before , i was working long hours and felt permanently stressed â now , i can spend time with my husband and relax and enjoy life
â i âm chairman of our village hall committee and run a saturday food market , which keeps me busy
' my symptoms are very mild and progressing very slowly , so i consider myself lucky
â ' my symptoms are very mild and progressing very slowly , so i consider myself lucky , â said lucy norman lucy norman also insists she has no anger or animosity towards the gp who misdiagnosed rsi
â it âs notoriously difficult to diagnose parkinson âs in its early stages â and even if i had been diagnosed earlier , it âs unlikely it would have made any difference to the progression of my illness
it âs an easy mistake to make
â indeed , it can be difficult for any gp to pick up on the wide variety of symptoms of parkinson âs , says professor david burn , a neurologist and clinical director of the charity parkinson âs uk
the problem is that many of its symptoms , such as loss of smell , constipation , a frozen shoulder and spidery writing , can be signs of other conditions
and they can appear up to a decade before motor symptoms , such as a tremor , slowness or rigidity of movement
trishna is another patient whose rsi turned out to be something far more serious
eleven years ago , she went to her gp after her grip inexplicably became weaker â she needed help using a knife and fork to cut up her food
having been diagnosed with rsi , she was referred to a physiotherapist for strengthening exercises
â my job involved working on a computer a lot , so i accepted what i was told , â says trishna , 35 , a translator and media analyst from marlow , buckinghamshire
â but within three years , my symptoms had progressed quite significantly and i âd gradually lost all sensation down my left side , starting in a small area of my leg and then spreading from my toe to my shoulder blades
â she adds : â that lasted for three months
but then i went back to my gp and was referred to a neurologist , who sent me for an mri scan
â after further testing , she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
this affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord , causing a wide range of symptoms , including uncontrolled muscle movement , balance and vision problems and fatigue
â it was nât until that point that my neurologist looked back at my history and said the first episode of â rsi â was likely to have been ms , â says trishna , who volunteers for the ms trust and other charities
â i now know that the symptoms of ms can easily be attributed to other things if you look at them in isolation , so it âs easy to ignore them or accept that it âs something else
