in an unusual turn of events last week , a terror plot suspect 's desire to talk to local media put him at odds with his attorneys and landed a cincinnati television station in federal court
at issue was a taped audio interview with cornell and whether the station could broadcast that interview
cornell is accused of plotting to attack the u.s. u.s. capitol
the 20 - year - old -- who claims in the interview that he is affiliated with isis -- was arrested on january 14 , months after his social media habits and talk of jihad put him on the fbi 's radar , according to court documents obtained by cnn at the time of his arrest
two days after his arrest , a court order was issued barring public contact with cornell , who is being held at the boone county across the river in kentucky
last week , cornell made a collect call to cnn affiliate wxix , said news director roach
that phone call initiated what ended up being an hourlong interview , roach said
cornell 's attorney , smith-monahan , argued that wxix was in contempt of court for violating a january order " directing the detention facility holding the defendant not to permit outside contact by anyone with the defendant without [ defense counsel 's ] express approval
" cornell spoke with reporter macke
in that interview , he refuses to tell macke how or when he first came in contact with isis , but he did give the reporter details on a plot to kill president obama , members of congress , as well as an attack on the israeli embassy in washington
" i would have took my gun , " he said
" i would have put it to obama 's head
i would have pulled the trigger
then i would unleash more bullets on the senate and house of representative members
and i would have attacked the israeli embassy and various other buildings full of kafir who want to wage war against us muslim
" when macke asked him why he would plot such an attack , he said " obama is an enemy of allah , therefore an enemy of us , of islamic state
" he said his plan for an attack on the u.s. u.s. capitol was retaliation for " the continued u.s. aggression against our people and the fact that u.s. , specifically president obama , wants to wage war against islamic state
" cornell told macke he was planning what would have been a " major attack " to take place in washington on september 20 , repeatedly referring to himself as a member of isis
" i 'm with the islamic state , " he said at one point
" i have connections with many brothers over there
we 've been corresponding for quite some time now , actually
the fbi finally caught on this past year
" cornell told macke that he used " encrypted messaging " to communicate with isis members
he said they discussed " how we should wage jihad in u.s.
we should form our own groups and alliances with the islamic state , " he continued
cornell said he was serious about his plans
" i 'm very dedicated , " he told macke
" like i said , i 'm a muslim
i 'm so dedicated that i risked my life
that should say a whole lot
" he also warned that there were others like himself
" we are indeed here in u.s. , " he said
" we 're in each and every state
we 're here in ohio
we 're more organized than you think
" the interview was taped in three 20 - minute segments and was recorded by the jail and wxix
roach said the jail 's taping system only allows for 20 minutes of taping at one time , so each time the recording would stop and the phone call ended , cornell called the station back to tell his side of the story
cnn listened to the audio recording
during the 6:30 p.m. newscast on thursday , the station aired a brief clip of the audio recording , previewing a longer story that was to air later that night , in the 10 p.m. newscast
according to allen , legal analyst and attorney for wxix , a producer from the station called him about 7:30 thursday evening ; cornell 's attorney had filed a " show of cause " order in cincinnati 's federal court and an emergency hearing was scheduled for 8:30 p.m. during that hearing , the judge continued the case for friday morning and wxix agreed to delay broadcasting the interview until friday , pending a decision
in addition to the contempt of court argument , smith - smith-monahan was also asking the court to issue a restraining order against the station , an order that would keep the station from broadcasting the interview with cornell , according to court documents
during the hearing , which lasted five hours , a lieutenant at the boone county facility testified that one of cornell 's attorneys had given him a phone
in that testimony the lieutenant stated that he reminded the attorney that giving cornell a phone meant he would be able to call anyone he wanted to , which seemed at odds with the spirit of the january court order
at the end of friday 's hearing , u.s. district judge sandra beckwith ruled that the order prohibiting cornell from contact with the public was vaguely written and the station was not in violation of the order
additionally , the judge ruled it would be unconstitutional for the news station to be barred from broadcasting the interview , according to allen
the judge also stated in court that while cornell has the right to remain silent , he also has the right to freedom of speech
" at the end of the day , the judge made the right decision , " allen said
cnn on saturday reached out to smith-monahan , cornell 's defense attorney , but so far has received no response
wxix aired a portion of the interview on friday night , and plans to broadcast more this week
