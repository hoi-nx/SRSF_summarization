sir simon ( right ) , whose youngest child with czech mezzo - soprano magdalena koå¾enã¡ ( left ) , 41 , is seven months old , has directed the berlin philharmonic since 2002 he said : â it âs crazy to be someone in their 60s with an extremely young family , but given that that âs the fact i have to think : what does my family most need ? â sir simon , who will join the london symphony orchestra in 2017 , said the move was â a very obvious step â
the announcement follows months of speculation that he would take up the post
last month , chancellor osborne gave his backing to a campaign led by sir simon to build a concert hall , and a feasibility study is now under way
the liverpool - born conductor âs contract with the berlin philharmonic ends in 2018 , the year after his move to london , but he said he would be working with both orchestras during that year
the feasibility study into a new concert hall for london is being led by national theatre artistic director nicholas hytner , and is backed by the chancellor and london mayor boris johnson
the 60 - year - old will be in britain for only four months a year , remaining based in germany for the sake of his wife and three children sir simon said : â the feasibility study has been announced , which is a wonderful thing because what i wanted to do was at least be able to kick - start the conversation about the possibility of a change , of expansion
â â it âs wonderful news that nicholas hytner is the titular head of the feasibility study because i think he has enormous experience with buildings , enormous experience of bringing culture of all types to a wider audience
â the feasibility study is planned to report back its findings this autumn
sir simon said : â we wait with real interest
â mr osborne said in february : â speaking to the likes of sir simon has impressed on me the significant artistic , educational and economic benefits that a modern concert hall would bring not just to london but the whole country
â sir simon made his first appearance with the london symphony orchestra in 1977 , at the age of 22
he conducted the orchestra at the opening ceremony of the london 2012 olympic and paralympic games , performing chariots of fire with actor rowan atkinson as mr bean
he has also performed with the london symphony orchestra earlier this year in the barbican centre
sir simon said of his appointment : â during my work with the london symphony orchestra over the last years , i noticed that , despite the orchestra âs long and illustrious history , they almost never refer to it
â instead , refreshingly , they talk about the future - what can they make anew , what can they improve , how can they reach further into the community ? â in terms of musical excellence , it is clear that the sky âs the limit , but equally important , in terms of philosophy , they constantly strive to be a 21st century orchestra
â we share a dream in which performing , teaching and learning are indivisible , with wider dissemination of art at our centre
â i can not imagine a better or more inspiring way to spend my next years , and feel immensely fortunate to have the london symphony orchestra as my musical family and co-conspirators
