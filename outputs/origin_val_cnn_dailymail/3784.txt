they say google 's ' clandestine ' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and early 2012 led to distress and embarrassment among uk users
they accuse google of collecting private information without their knowledge and consent by the use of ' cookies ' - a small string of text saved on the user 's device
tench , a partner at law firm olswang , which represents the group , is quoted by the times the landmark ruling potentially ' opens the door for litigation by millions of uk apple users '

mr tench added : ' this is the appropriate forum for this case - here in england where the consumers used the internet and where they have a right to privacy
' a group of internet users want to sue google , claiming the internet giant secretly tracked their browsing habits in order to bombard them with targeted adverts
the claimants , known as safari users against google 's secret tracking , all used apple 's safari browser and have accused google of bypassing security settings in order to track their online browsing and target them with adverts
google was accused of misuse of private information , breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws they say that cookies , small tracking files , were installed by google on the apple computers and mobile devices of those using the apple safari internet browser without their knowledge
cookies are used by advertisers , and owners of other websites , to target advertising based on an individual 's internet use
the campaigners also say that google 's ' clandestine ' tracking and collation of internet usage between summer 2011 and spring 2012 led to distress and embarrassment among uk users
the claimants accused google of misuse of private information , breach of confidence and breaking data protection laws
the appeal judges unanimously ruled that misuse of private information was a tort - a civil wrong - for the purposes of the rules governing service out of the jurisdiction , enabling legal action to go ahead
they also clarified the law on the meaning of ' damage ' in section 13 of the data protection act
lord dyson , master of the rolls , and lady justice sharp said in their joint judgment , with which lord justice mcfarlane agreed : ' on the face of it , these claims raise serious issues which merit a trial
' they concern what is alleged to have been the secret and blanket tracking and collation of information , often of an extremely private nature ... about and associated with with the claimants ' internet use , and the subsequent use of that information for about nine months
' the case relates to the anxiety and distress this intrusion upon autonomy has caused
' three judges have dismissed google 's appeal over a high court ruling against it and ruled claims for damages can be brought over allegations of misuse of private information the appeal judges said mr justice tugendhat , who heard the case in the high court , was entitled to come to the view that it was ' clearly arguable ' that article 8 ( right to private life ) of the european convention on human rights was engaged and gave weight to allowing the claims to proceed
the judges also said google had estimated its trial costs at Â£ 1.2million , which seemed ' extremely high ' and they could be controlled by the court 's management powers
they said some of the technical issues in the case may already have been addressed by litigation against google in the us over the apple safari issue
in august 2012 google had agreed to pay a civil penalty of $ 22.5million ( Â£ 15.1million ) to settle charges , brought by the united states federal trade commission that it misrepresented to users of the safari browser that it would not place tracking cookies or serve targeted advertisements to those users
in november 2013 it also agreed to pay $ 17million ( Â£ 11.4million ) to settle us state consumer - based actions brought against it by the attorneys general representing 37 states and the district of colombia
after the latest ruling , a google spokesman is quoted by the times as saying : ' we 're disappointed with the court 's decision and are considering our options
