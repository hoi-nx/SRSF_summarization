it was staggering that louis van gaal did not turn to radamel falcao as united were trailing 2 - 1 against arsenal in the fa cup quarter - final
the poor lad must be thinking : what am i doing here ? i know he is not the player united thought they were getting , but is nât it down to the manager to get the best out of him ? radamel falcao ( second right ) was an unused substitute during united 's defeat to arsenal michael carrick ( right ) was brought on at half - time but colombia forward radamel falcao was left unused goalscorers change games but instead they chased the match with daley blind and michael carrick , two sitting midfielders , on the pitch
surely it would have been better to show greater intent by throwing on radamel falcao ? united never threatened arsenal once danny welbeck put them ahead and it is arsene wenger 's side who have progressed to the semi-final at wembley .
