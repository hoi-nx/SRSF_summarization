as the executions of bali nine masterminds andrew chan and myuran sukuraman loom , fellow convicted drug smuggler stephens loses hope for a second chance at life
stephens was one of the nine australian who were imprisoned in indonesian after trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin from bali to australian
the 39 - year - old has been sentenced to life and was moved from kerobokan prison to malang in east java
mr widodo 's hardline on narcotics has stephens fearing ' it would be better if they took me out the back and put a bullet in the back of my head ' if he had no chance of reducing his sentence
' it is more human to just take me out the back and shoot me like andrew chan and myuran sukuraman , ' stephens said
' is n't 20 years a bad enough penalty ? but life means no hope
it means i will die in prison
can you imagine having to live like that ? ' stephens says the impending executions of andrew chan and myuran sukuraman makes him lose hope that he will never leave prison the married inmate fears he will die in prison and never know what it would be like to live with his wife stephens has a good reason to want his life sentence reduced like renae lawrence , who is eligible for parole next year
in 2011 , stephens married christine puspayanti - a javanese woman - who he met for the first time while at kerobokan prison
she was visiting with a church group while stephens was serving out his sentence in the bali jail
stephens also shares how he has forgiven andrew chan for his hand in getting him involved in the plot , but would never forget where the blame lay
ms christine puspayanti - who has a daughter from a previous relationship - said she was lonely without her husband at home with her
' my daughter and i would at least like to know when stephens might come home , ' she told news corp. in 2011 , stephens ( pictured in 2006 ) married javanese woman christine puspayanti who has a daughter from a previous marriage it comes after the governor of jakarta urged mr widodo to reconsider his stance on the death penalty
mr widodo 's close ally , tjahaja purnama , said he believed drug smugglers who have reformed themselves in prison , like andrew chan and myuran sukuraman , should be handed a life sentence instead of death
' if from inside [ jail ] they 're still controlling drugs , then execute them immediately that day , ' 9news reported mr tjahaja purnama as saying
' but if people want to change , give them a chance to live
' maybe he can make other people more aware instead of punishing him with death
