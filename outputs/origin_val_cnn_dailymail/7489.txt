mark hughes has accused bruce of trying to â defend the indefensible â over figueroa âs tackle on ireland that left the stoke city midfielder with a deep gash in his calf
the hull manager responded to mark hughes â anger at the incident by insisting ireland should already have been sent off following â the worst challenge on the pitch â on david meyler at the britannia stadium

â ireland ( left ) sustained a deep gash on his leg after a challenge from hull 's figueroa referee neil swarbrick did not give a free kick for the challenge that left ireland with a gash in his leg the challenge left a wound on ireland 's leg that stoke city boss mark hughes said needed 12 to 15 stitches that has angered mark hughes , his former manchester united team - mate
â bruce has fallen into the trap of trying to defend the indefensible , â said mark hughes
â everyone has seen the two challenges and i do n't think there is any sort of comparison whatsoever
â the outcome is there for everyone to see so i do n't think bruce did himself too much credit with his observation
â it 's fairly easily to defend things - and i do it too - but on this occasion it was not as if the lad would be suspended
so why did bruce not just say , â it was a terrible tackle â ? ' we 're trying to move on but bruce did not need to do that
he did not need to say that
to defend that is incorrect
â stoke city boss mark hughes has accused hull counterpart bruce of trying to ' defend the indefensible ' hull boss bruce queried why ireland was on the pitch after his challenge on david meyler mark hughes added : â it looks likely ireland is unavailable for two to three weeks
â most people now have seen the picture and he âs had internal stitches as well as external , so it takes a little bit longer than a straightforward gash
â i âm disappointed as he was doing really well , filling the gap for bojan
