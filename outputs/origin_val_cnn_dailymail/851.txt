around 200 mysterious stone structures have mystified experts since they were discovered in the gobi in 2003
known as the â strange stone circles â by locals in turpan , the formations vary in size and shape with one intricate example resembling the sun. and now an expert has suggested they could have been used by primitive nomads to worship the sun , and may have even been a site where sacrifices were made - although the types of sacrifices is not known
the largest structure in this image is known as the sun circle
an expert has suggested they could have been used by nomads to worship the sun , and may have even been a site where sacrifices were made there are similarities between the china stones and stonehenge in wiltshire
this includes the formations being linked with sun worshippers , the shape of the structures including so - called ' exits ' , and the fact the stones were transported to the site from outside the region
the circles are located in the flaming mountain in turpan , north west china and cover more than two - and - a - half square miles ( 6.6 square km )
they have been filmed from above using a drone by a local tourism association , in an attempt to further understand the structures and their origins , people âs daily online reported
experts said that the stone circles are in line with local historical traditions but very little is known about them , including their age
some people had assumed that they were burial sites and attempted to dig them up

if they were used as sacrificial sites , the type of sacrifices is not known the circles are located in the flaming mountain in turpan , north west china , a matter of miles from lianmuqin town ( marked ) and cover more than two - and - a - half square miles ( 6.6 square km ) similar formations were found in burkhan khaldun mountain in north mongolia and archaeologists have even suggested these mongolia rocks could help pinpoint the location of genghis khan 's tomb
this view is shared by dr heyd , an archaeologist at the university of bristol
he told mailonline : ' first of all , they are man - made ; there is no doubt about it
' i have seen similar features in neighbouring mongolia where they are well known too [ and ] they are regarded as ritual features
one particular stone circle is known as the â sun circle â ( pictured ) and is formed by four concentric circles , the largest of which measures 26 ft ( eight metres ) in diameter , with the smallest inner ring destroyed the stone structures are built on high points of the land and some are square , with â exits â to combine certain shapes ( pictured )
a lack of evidence of bodies at the sites has led one expert to rule out that the formations are burial sites , instead claiming they were sacrificial worship sites for ancient nomadic people no - one is sure what the mysterious stone ' walls ' were used for
some people thought they may be ancient burial sites , but no bodies have been found nearby and the soil beneath the circles and squares is said to be undisturbed
the largest of the shapes , which features four concentric circles may have been the focus of sacrifices to a sun god
dr heyd , an archaeologist at the university of bristol said its likely the structures are burial sites
but a local unnamed expert believes they were used for making sacrifices to the sun god thousands of years ago
there is no precise date for the structure , but dr heyd added the first of these gobi stone structures might date back as early as the early bronze age
although the more complex formations are likely ' younger and could have been constructed until the medieval period
' ' some might have served as surface marking of burial places
at least in mongolia , excavations have occasionally found graves in the centre of such features
' others , if not the majority might denote holy places in the landscape , or places with special spiritual properties , or ritual offering / meeting places
' he continued that the first of these gobi stone structures might date back as early as the early bronze age
this could make them up to 4,500 years old
although the more complex formations are likely ' younger and could have been constructed until the medieval period
' however , a local specialist told yahoo this is unlikely because the soil beneath them is undisturbed
the stone formations are built on high points of the land and some are square , with â exits â
one particular stone circle is known as the â sun circle â and is formed by four concentric circles - the largest of which measures 26 ft ( eight metres ) in diameter , with the smallest inner ring destroyed
on the southeast of the sun circle there are a multiple circles of different sizes
because of the shape of this particular circle , and a lack of evidence of bodies at the sites , the unnamed local expert told yahoo the circles were likely to have been sacrificial worship sites for ancient nomadic people - although he did nât elaborate on what may have been sacrificed
the stone circles have been compared to stonehenge in wiltshire ( pictured ) , whose origins and purpose remains largely a mystery , with some experts suggesting it too was used to worship the sun the rocks used in the structures in china ( pictured ) are not from the desert where the circles are located , suggesting that they were brought from afar , much like stonehenge âs famous bluestones ' across central asia these circles are usually sacrificial sites , â he said
â we can image that this was a site for worshipping the god of the sun. ' he explained that the circles are all located on higher ground , which fits the selection conditions for ancient worship ceremonies
the stone circles may be compared to stonehenge in wiltshire , whose origins and purpose remains largely a mystery , with some experts suggesting it too was used to worship the sun. scattered across jordan are 12 giant circular structures that can only be fully seen using aerial and satellite images
known collectively as the big circles , the vast rings - which range from between 720ft and 1,490ft ( 220 metres to 455 metres ) in diameter - were first spotted from the air in the 1920s , and surveys in 1930 , 1953 and 2002 have since revealed more details about their size , shape and locations
archaeologists from western australia have documented 12 of them to try and learn more about their purpose
a total of eight big circles have been recorded in west central jordan , between the wadi el-hasa and the edge of the shara escarpment
there is also a second group , made of four big circles , just north of azraq oasis
pictured is circle j1 , known locally as qasr abu el-inaya
it is located 2.4 miles ( 4km ) west of the hedjaz railway and desert highway there are eight big circles in west central jordan , a second group , made of four big circles just north of azraq oasis
plus , a more recent big circle spotted in 2002 near homs in syria
like the mysterious structures in china , their construction is simple and typically consists of low walls of uncut boulders
however , they are incredibly precise and because they are so large , would have involved teams of workers
professor david kennedy from the university , said an â architect â would have plotted the circles using rope tied to a post in the centre â some show signs of greater care with stones at least roughly shaped and laid in courses â he added
dating is also said to be problematic , but there is often material in or around the circles that originated in the chalcolithic and early bronze age ( between 2,000 to 4,500bc )
a number of the circles contain later material , typically dating to the roman period between 1st and 7th century bc. in another parallel , the rocks at the site in china are not from the desert where the circles are located , suggesting that they were brought from afar , just like stonehenge âs famous bluestones
the sun circle itself is made from over 200 of these mysterious stones
although not identical , due to their much more complex design , geoglyphs in peruvian have equally baffled experts about the practices of ancient groups
more commonly known as the nazca , they were first spotted in 1939 when a pilot flew over the nasca planes of the peruvian coastal highlands
they were designated as a unesco world heritage site in 1994 and the area stretches more than 50 miles ( 80km ) between the towns of nazca and palpa , about 400 km south of lima
experts have said that the stone circles ( pictured ) are in line with local historical traditions , but very little is known about them , including their age the circles and squares ( pictured ) are all located on higher ground , which fits the selection conditions for ancient worship ceremonies contrary to the popular belief that the figures can only be seen from the air , they are actually visible from the surrounding foothills
paul kosok , from long island university , is credited as the first scholar to seriously study the nazca
he discovered that the lines converged at the winter solstice in the southern hemisphere
along with maria reiche , a german mathematician and archaeologist , paul kosok proposed the figures were markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other celestial bodies rose
