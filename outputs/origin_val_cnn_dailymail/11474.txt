rail scam : dr peter barnett faces jail after admitting to six counts of fraud by false representation an international lawyer faces ruin after admitting dodging more than Â£ 23,000 in rail fares
dr peter barnett , 43 , was told he could be jailed after police discovered he spent more than two and a half years cheating the system
he gave himself up after being caught by a ticket inspector travelling from his home in an oxfordshire market town to london âs marylebone station
investigators discovered the oxford graduate and rhodes scholar regularly pretended to have travelled from wembley instead to save himself huge sums
the australian - born lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law , despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an african children âs charity and director of leading think - tank , the legatum institute foundation , aimed at â promoting prosperity â
on friday , he pleaded guilty at westminster magistrates â court to six counts of fraud by false representation , carrying a maximum penalty of ten years in jail
the deception places him among the ranks of britain âs biggest fare dodgers , closely behind a former millionaire fund manager
jonathan burrows was banned from working in the city last year after avoiding Â£ 43,000 in train fares from his home in stonegate , east sussex
the scam began to unravel for peter barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at marylebone last november
he claimed to have travelled from wembley , in london , instead of thame , oxfordshire , where he and his wife live in a Â£ 550,000 five - bedroom detached home
peter barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor

right , how the mail reported the story in august 2014 when he turned his back peter barnett ran away , but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day
an investigation was carried out by british transport police , which found that the lawyer had dodged fares since april 2012
it is understood that he did so by boarding a train at haddenham and thame parkway without a ticket
he then got off at marylebone , tapping out with an oyster card
because there was no start point to his journey , the automated system charged him the maximum transport for london fare , which is currently Â£ 7.60
but this is still far less than the Â£ 19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home
it was the same ruse employed by jonathan burrows , who was caught out when his train company realised he had not bought a season ticket since 2008
peter barnett âs train operator , chiltern railways , claims he now owes them more than Â£ 23,000 , which he has agreed to pay back
on friday , prosecutor zahid hussain told the court : â clearly , the distance between wembley and marylebone , where he was working , is far less than to his true home of oxfordshire , and as such he has gained financially
â the financial loss to chiltern railways because of his fraudulent conduct is in excess of Â£ 23,000
â he said peter barnett had also â altered a photo - card to avoid detection â , adding : â it was planned
â peter barnett gave himself up after being caught by a ticket inspector travelling from his home in an oxfordshire market town to london âs marylebone station ( pictured ) peter barnett is the author of a book on international law and worked for a major london law firm before becoming a senior figure at gerson lehrman group , an investment fund consultancy
the new york - based company said he left three years ago
he blamed â family problems â for his behaviour and his lawyer said he showed â genuine remorse â
saul herman , defending , said the loss to the railway company was â much closer on my calculation to Â£ 7,500 â and asked for the figure to be reviewed
but he said his client was in a position to pay back all the cash , saying â a means form has been completed which shows compensation can be paid in the full amount â
peter barnett was released on unconditional bail while a further assessment of how much he owes is made
he will be sentenced next month .
