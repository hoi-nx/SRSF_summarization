the fight to get to this point only makes the prize on offer more precious
for david marshall , retaining his place against gibraltar would matter every bit as much as facing germany
the cardiff goalkeeper has been gordon strachan âs pick for each of the four euro 2016 qualifiers to date
he has not let his manager down , yet is keenly aware that competition for the jersey continues to intensify
craig gordon and allan mcgregor each played 45 minutes of wednesday night âs 1 - 0 friendly win over northern ireland
if one were reading the runes , it might suggest that david marshall will get the run - out when gibraltar visit hampden tomorrow
scotland 's david marshall admits retaining place against gibraltar is as important as facing germany the 30 - year - old will assume nothing , however , until he has heard gordon strachan read out the 11 names in the morning
if that leads to a 17th cap , there will be no hint of complacency
david marshall went through years of travelling away with the national squad without much hope of playing
on the rare occasions he was selected , he had an unfortunate tendency to end up on the wrong end of a hefty scoreline through no error of his own
it almost seemed the fates were conspiring against him , but david marshall transformed the situation through his outstanding form for cardiff in the premier league last season
having finally leap to the front of the queue , he is determined to stay there
â everyone knows my history with scotland , â david marshall reflected
â i had to wait years and years to get caps , so it makes each one more valuable now as i get older
â i do nât want to give it up , so i âll just continue to do what i can
it does nât matter to me if it is germany or gibraltar
there is a lot of pressure on us to win the game and it puts us in a great position if we manage to do it
gordon strachan has picked david marshall for all four euro 2016 qualifiers to date â years ago , i never thought i should be playing
then allan mcgregor came in at a stage when i was nât playing
so there was never a time when i expected to play
â it âs just in the last couple of years when i have got myself to a level where i can believe in myself to go and play
injuries put allan mcgregor and craig gordon out and i managed to get a chance and play well , so that âs why i was probably in the team
â with the standard of the keepers here , it âs difficult to consider yourself the no 1
i âve waited a long time to get a chance , but the boys are all fit
craig gordon has done great to get playing at celtic and allan mcgregor is playing in the premier league
â i do nât think it would be a massive decision whoever played , but the gaffer has stuck with me since the beginning of the campaign and i hope to keep playing well and stay in the side
â clearly , there is a professional rivalry within the goalkeeping trio , described by no less a judge than andy as scotland âs best - ever crop
but it is distinctly cordial in nature
david marshall has not yet let his manager down , but is aware that competition is rising in the ranks â we âve been together for a long time now , â said david marshall
â i âve been here for over 10 years and craig gordon has been the same , obviously minus a couple of years through injury
â we know each other so well and we are used to the standard
when we are together , it hopefully lifts us to make each other better
â when i was younger , andy and jim leighton were great
that was a great group of goalkeepers , so to hear what andy â a legend for rangers and scotland â said is a great honour
â but we ca nât read too much into that
we just have to keep performing as that is what you are judged on
we need to concentrate and do our best for the rest for the rest of the campaign
â i would definitely consider the other guys friends
i shared a room with craig gordon for five or six years at the start with scotland
â it might be a bit different at club level when there is that one place
but being here is about the country
we have not been at a championship for so long , so there is no room for sticking the knife in each other âs back
â allan mcgregor kept a clean sheet during 45 minutes of action in a friendly against northern ireland whoever is selected tomorrow , they will face a most curious assignment
gibraltar have lost their four group d fixtures by an aggregate score of 21 - 0
unless something very odd happens , the scotland penalty area should verge on a no - go zone
â it âs a difficult game to talk about , â admitted david marshall
â concentration levels have got to be high and football is weird
there could be a deflection , a set - piece , anything
â we need to start the game well as the earlier we can score the better
craig gordon kept a clean sheet in 45 minutes of action in a friendly against northern ireland â this is probably the only time with scotland that you are expected not to have too much to do
â but concentration is a massive thing in goalkeeping
i had it with celtic when i was younger , when you would play a lot of games where there was not a lot to do
you just have to deal with it and train as normal
â would i prefer to be busy ? no , i prefer doing nothing ! but you just do nât know how it is going to play out
you ca nât go into a game relaxed
you treat it like any normal game and hope the boys up front can help you out
