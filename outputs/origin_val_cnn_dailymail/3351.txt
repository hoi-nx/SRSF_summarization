a couple 's adventure touring the beautiful wildlife of africa is set to be documented in a stunning new photobook
kym , 53 , and tonya illman , 47 , from perth , australia , utilised remote controlled camera buggies , hidden cameras and quad - copters among other things , to portray african wildlife in different ways
the couple have managed to join in with packs of cheetahs , wild dogs , elephants and one occasion grabbing the attention of a young lion for a photo mr illman calls the ' lion selfie '
' we carry more photographic gear on safari than almost anyone , except perhaps the bbc , ' said mr illman
' people ( and animals ) are most intrigued by our remote - controlled camera buggy though
' the battery operated 4wd camera buggy was custom made to carry a canon 5d mark 3 camera with a 16 - 35mm lens
the pair use the buggy primarily on private game reserves or conservancies with the approval of the guide or game reserve manager
mr illman said : ' low and wide angle shots of wild animals are rare captures
unlike normal shots taken from the roof of a vehicle , the horizon is low and the animal looks large as it approaches the hidden camera or buggy
people simply are n't used to seeing this perspective
' the photographs , including this cheetah at a lion park in zimbabwe , will be documented in a 204 - page book set to be launched on safari ' kickstarter imminently the battery operated 4wd camera buggy was custom made to carry a canon 5d mark 3 camera with a 16 - 35mm lens the wildlife - loving australia the buggy primarily on private game reserves or conservancies with the approval of the guide or game reserve manager ; here eland run towards the camera the couple have spent more than 22 weeks in africa over the past two years alone , photographing for the book and have got frighteningly close to an array of wildlife
' we put the buggy out with a male lion one day but when it started raining , i drove it back to our safari vehicle , ' said mr illman explaining the day they snapped the ' lion selfie '
' two sub adults saw it and followed it back
not wanting them to damage it , i drove it under the vehicle hoping they 'd depart
they did n't so tonya illman quickly mounted a camera on a monopod and connected a remote shutter
i lowered the monopod through the open window and when the lion came closer and started pawing it gently , tonya illman clicked the remote shutter - my lower hand just 50cm from its paw
' kym , 53 , and tonya illman , 47 , from perth , australia , manage to show their love for africa with their stunning photography skills mobile cameras and video cameras capture the wildlife in their natural habitat ; pictured here are buffalo in zimbabwe a gorilla in rwanda makes the final cut in the australia couple 's beautiful set of wildlife photographs the pair , who immersed themselves in photography four years ago , have also used a quad - copter
' a number of aerial shots feature in the book , shots that many years ago would have been impossible to capture , ' said mr illman
' unfortunately , a couple of countries have limited the use of drones over the past 12 months so these shots will be harder to acquire in the future
' mr illman 's wife had been to africa in the 90 's but it took her two decades to convince him to join her on a second safari
he said : ' tonya illman thought i would love it but for decades i resisted
then one day , she called me at work and said , ' i 've decided we 're taking the boys ( then aged 10 and 12 ) on safari in africa
i 've booked flights for the four of us ; you can book the accommodation '
' a group of lions looking into the camera buggy in tanzania , thankfully the photographer was at a safe distance this photo shows a giraffe from eye level which was shot using the quad - copter in tanzania a leopard makes a move as it appears to hunt its prey , caught on camera very close - up , in tanzania this lion 's intrigue saw him get up close and personal to the camera , but unfortunately for her , it was n't edible resigned to the prospect , mr illman scoured the net and , being a passionate photographer , bought a number of african wildlife photography books
' i quickly became aware of the awe - inspiring photographic opportunities that a safari offered and decided i would embrace the trip , ' said mr illman
since then the illmans have shot more than a quarter of a million images and have settled on 143 of their best to feature in this large format book , africa on safari , to be published by london - based papadakis publisher and released later this year

kym can be a little disorganised and when you have 3,000 images to wade through at day 's end , my organisational skills come to the fore
having two of us shooting also allows one to shoot wide , the other tight , resulting in two different perspectives
' the couple admit that with so many great shots to choose from , it 's hard to leave certain shots out
' we have an abundance of lion photos , we could do a whole world - class book on lions but we 're having to jettison so many of them so it 's not lion - indulgent , ' explains mr illman
