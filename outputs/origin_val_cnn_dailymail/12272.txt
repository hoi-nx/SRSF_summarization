foreign intervention in yemen 's chaos has dramatically raised the stakes in the arabian peninsula , threatening to expand what is already a civil war into a conflict pitting iran against saudi and an arab coalition
the saudi launched operation " decisive storm " last wednesday with dozens of airstrikes in an effort to blunt the advance of houthi militia and allied army units on the port of aden -- and to protect the last bastion of yemen 's internationally - recognized president hadi
there were also strikes in and around the capital , sanaa , which resumed early monday
many analysts were surprised at the speed and scale of the saudi air campaign , which the kingdom said would continue until the houthi -- a shia minority that has swept across the country in the last six months -- retreated and laid down their arms
essentially the saudi are trying to bomb the houthi to the negotiating table
the houthi have responded by threatening a campaign of suicide bomb attacks inside saudi
iran , which has supported the houthi as fellow shia , described the saudi offensive as a " dangerous move that would kill any chance at peaceful resolution of the crisis
" yemen is becoming the latest battleground in a contest for regional superiority between saudi and iran that goes back to the overthrow of the shah during iran 's islamic revolution in 1979
it now resembles syria , or bosnia 20 years ago : a patchwork of shifting fiefdoms where force is the only means of influence
there is a real risk that yemen will collapse as a state , with a revived independence movement in the south , the houthi in the north , and the sunni heartland in between
baron , a visiting fellow at the european council on foreign relations and expert on yemen 's tortured recent history , says , " it 's not difficult to divine saudi and its coalition partners ' motivations for taking this action
" the houthi were on the verge of overrunning aden , a strategic port that overlooks straits through which 20,000 merchant ships pass every year
according to the u.s. energy information agency , 3.8 million barrels of oil a day passed through the bab el mandab straits in 2013
but baron believes the kingdom 's " decision to launch a full - scale military action truly risks inflaming the situation further
it will be seen as an act of aggression by most yemen and risks taking the situation to a place that no - one will be able to control
" as in afghanistan , factions in yemen do not respond well to foreign intervention
in 2009 the saudi took military action against the houthi in support of then president saleh , using airstrikes and special forces , but were unable to subdue them
now the houthi have at least some of the $ 500 million in military equipment provided by the u.s. to yemen since 2010 , and they have proved to be capable fighters
they staged a lightning invasion of the capital , sanaa , last september , taking advantage of popular discontent and an unwillingness among many army units to resist them
since then they have moved on the red sea port of hodeida and surged south toward aden
they have also grafted themselves onto parts of the army in the battle against aqap ( aqap ) that is now raging in central and southern yemen
whether saudi and egyptian ground forces will become involved in the conflict is the big unknown
an arab league summit in egyptian at the weekend agreed to form a joint military force , but that will take months at least to build
in the meantime , saudi tanks and armor have been moved closer to the yemen border , but saudi officials say there are no immediate plans to launch a ground offensive
yemen has history as a graveyard of foreign forces
in the 1960s egyptian intervened in yemen 's civil war on behalf of the anti-royalists -- an operation that sapped the egyptian army and contributed to its failure against the israelis in the 1967 war
the extent of the houthi ' backing from iran is hotly disputed
president hadi said at the weekend that iran was behind yemen 's turmoil and the houthi were no more than its stooges
the houthi deny receiving help from iran , but as the conflict worsens , they may indeed turn to tehran for the sort of military advice that the iranian revolutionary guards are providing in iraq -- and for funding and oil
saudi and iran involvement in yemen threatens to deepen sectarian distrust in a country where sunni and shia have historically not been enemies
this would suit both aqap and isis ( islamic state in syria and iraq ) which announced its sudden and murderous arrival in yemen this month with massive suicide bombings at two houthi mosques in sanaa , killing at least 150 people
as the icg puts it , a " long history of coexistence is beginning to break down " in yemen
baron says one critical question is whether isis and aqap will now go head - to - head in trying to kill as many houthi as possible
for the u.s. , which worked hard to " stand up " the hadi government and encourage its campaign to eradicate aqap , recent events have been a disaster
there will be less actionable intelligence against one of aqap 's most potent affiliates , and its sunni allies in the middle east ( and especially the gulf ) will have even less interest than before in dialogue with iran on issues from its nuclear program to iraq
u.s. options have also diminished with the hurried withdrawal of some 100 military personnel from al-anad airbase in the south of yemen hours before it was seized by the houthi
drone operations from the base had at least blunted aqap 's freedom of action , even if they failed to eradicate the group
the unseen hand in yemen 's collapse is former president saleh , who was badly injured in a bomb attack in 2011 , and eventually ( very eventually ) persuaded to cede office to hadi after 33 years in power
but he was allowed to remain in the country and has not given up his political ambitions
last fall , he was sanctioned by both the u.n. and the u.s. for undermining efforts to forge a new political settlement in yemen
baron believes saleh is biding his time -- waiting for an opportunity to inject his son , ahmed ali , into yemen 's complex political equation
ahmed ali was formerly commander of yemen 's republican guard , and parts of the armed forces are still regarded as loyal to the saleh clan
for now , saleh has a marriage of convenience with the houthi , but few expect it to survive
when he was president , saleh launched a series of brief wars against the houthi between 2004 and 2010
" neither trusts the other ; their recent cooperation notwithstanding , they are competing for political dominance , especially in the northern tribal highlands and the military , " says the icg
for the people of yemen , the brief flash of hope that came with the arab spring is now a distant memory
last week , at least nine protesters were killed in the central city of taiz and more than 100 injured by houthi militia
aden has been rocked by looting and score - settling among rival clans
" human rights in yemen are in free - fall as even peaceful protest becomes a life - threatening activity , " according to said boumedouha of amnesty international
for the past three years , different parties and factions have fought over the state 's few assets while the standard of living of ordinary yemen has continued to plummet
a u.n. - led effort to agree on a new constitution has been mired in squabbling , with all parties failing to honor commitments
" even more damaging , those with most influence -- the saudi and iran in particular -- are taking steps to undercut the negotiations , " says the icg
" this combination of proxy wars , sectarian violence , state collapse and militia rule has become sadly familiar in the region
nobody is likely to win such a fight , " the icg says
but for now , such a fight seems destined to continue .
