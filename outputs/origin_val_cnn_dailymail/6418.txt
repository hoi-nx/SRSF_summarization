facebook has removed the personal account of a 12 - year - old georgia boy who posted a viral video last week in support of rudy giuliani 's comments that president obama ' does n't love america '
gop c.j.pearson found out the price of his new found fame on friday morning when a friend told him it had been deactivated for ' suspicious activity '
fearing his video , which was watched by more than 1.4 million people , may have been the cause , pearson hit out at the social media giant , accusing them of quelling any dissent towards obama
dumped : pearson ( seen here in a picture from his public page on facebook ) had his personal page deactivated after the social media giant became aware of his age the first sign that something had gone awry came on friday morning when pearson informed his followers on his public page he had lost his personal account
' i am having my editor , alan davidson post on my behalf on this page while facebook continues to lock me out , ' wrote the columbia middle school student according to fox & friends sunday
' the 1st amendment is obviously not a big concern to the powers that be at facebook , but we will continue to fight back ! ' demanding a response from facebook , they duly replied and gave him a cast - iron reason why they banned his page - he is 12
indeed , it is explicitly stated in facebook 's terms and conditions that no one under the age of 13 can have an account
drawing attention to yourself : cj pearson , a 12 - year - old from georgia , posted a viral video backing former new york city mayor rudy giuliani 's comments criticizing president obama 's love for america in a statement , facebook said they were alerted to the fact that pearson is 12 by a member of the public and acted accordingly
' you have to be 13 to have a facebook account
this is a requirement , not a suggestion
he was locked out because he lied about his age , not because of the content , ' replied a facebook representative
pearson however , is not having that
' i would consider that complete malarkey , ' said pearson to fox dc. ' because in all honesty , there are many many people younger than me who have a facebook account
' ' i will not stop here , ' he added to fox 5
' you can not silence a voice that deserves to be heard
and i will continue to make as many accounts as possible
' pearson made a number of media appearances over the weekend to draw attention to his plight
' time and time again , facebook has shut down many conservative accounts after they decide to speak up , ' pearson said on fox & friends sunday
defense : rudy giuliani wrote an op - ed in the wall street journal saying that he did n't want to question obama 's motives or heart attacked : former new york city mayor rudy giuliani said that president obama did not love his country like a commander in chief should ' when a person decides to speak up , their voice should nât be hindered because of someone disagreeing
' last week , rudy giuliani may have come under fire for saying that president obama does not love america at a fundraising dinner for governor scott walker , but he found a backer in pearson
he told guests at the event - designed to raise cash for wisconsin governor scott walker - that ' i do not believe , and i know this is a horrible thing to say , but i do not believe that the president loves america
' democrats , the white house , and even members of the gop have condemned his comments and heaped scorn on the retired politician , who was a presidential contender in 2008
after the tide of criticism , middle school student cj pearson made a youtube video agreeing with rudy giuliani , in which he said that the commander in chief had a ' downright hate for the america values our country holds '
the video , posted last saturday on his channel , has garnered more than 1.4m views as of monday night
a ' public figure ' page for the student says he has ' considered himself a conservative since the mere age of 8 , supporting john mccain in his 2008 presidential campaign '
he said in his video that if obama really loved america he would call islamic state ' what it really is , an assault on christianity ' the student added that the president , who has ordered airstrikes on isis and asked for approval to send limited ground troops , was ' not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad '
for his part , rudy giuliani has said that he stands by his controversial comments made last month
however , he wrote an op - ed in the wall street journal saying that he ' did nât intend to question president obama âs motives or the content of his heart ' .
