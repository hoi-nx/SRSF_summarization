schmidt is poised to make just one change to his starting line - up for wales on saturday , fit - again heaslip returning in place of jordi murphy
injured on february 14 against france , heaslip has timed his recovery from the three vertebrae fractured by pascal papã© perfectly
it was anticipated that the problem , treated like a soft tissue injury , could come right in four weeks and the medics have been proved spot on , heaslip taking part in full training all week to put himself in the frame to resume against wales
ireland head coach schmidt is likely to make one change to the side that beat england heaslip ( centre ) is expected to be back after injuring himself against france on february 14 sexton ( left ) has recovered from the hamstring problem that he had for ireland jordi murphy will consider himself unlucky not to have held on , given his impressive show in helping subdue the vaunted english back row , but heaslip has been true to his word after saying last friday that he was â pretty confident â he would be declared fit for the millennium stadium
jordi murphy is now expected to take a place on the bench at the expense of tommy oâdonnell who demonstrated his worth for the second time this spring , coming on as an early replacement against england for the concussed oâbrien and again not looking out of his depth
elsewhere , with sexton shaking off his hamstring problem , and oâbrien and jared payne both coming through concussion protocols , schmidt âs team will be along expected lines as they seek to set up a grand slam trip to murrayfield on saturday week
jordi murphy is expected to make way for the return of heaslip against wales on saturday jack mcgrath is set to keep his place in the ireland team for the six nations game against wales it means schmidt will continue to reward jack mcgrath for his consistently good form , keeping cian healy , who started his first game for leinster in six months last saturday , on the bench for the third test in a row
there was concern about replacement out - half ian madigan âs control of the closing 25 minutes against england , but it is thought he will again be back - up to sexton
felix jones is likely to be given the no 23 shirt once more , despite pressure from in - form munster colleague keith earls .
