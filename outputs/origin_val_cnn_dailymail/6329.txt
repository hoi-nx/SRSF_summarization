a new washington , d.c. abortion clinic will have a ' spa - like feel ' , with fluffy robes , natural wood floors and tea on arrival , in an attempt to help destigmatize the procedure
carafem , which opens this week , has a no - frills attitude when it comes to informing people with what they provide
one of their advertisement 's reads , ' abortion : yeah , we do that '
purdy , the clinic 's president and founder , said he was inspired to start carafem after working more than a decade promoting family planning and hiv prevention in developing countries
carafem president and founder purdy ( pictured with health services vice president melissa s. grant ) has begun a new washington , d.c. abortion clinic that presents itself with a ' spa - like feel ' it was there he realized how much easier it was to get an abortion , sometimes as simple as walking into a pharmacy , in places such as ethiopia
meanwhile , in the united states more than 200 laws have restricted the controversial procedure and forced dozens of clinics to close their doors , according to the washington post
melissa s. grant , carafem 's health services vice president , said it was important for the clinic ' to try and present an upgrade , almost spa - like feel '
the clinic will also only provide pharmaceutical abortions , meaning there will be no vacuum aspiration or surgical procedures available - this means that carafem 's clients can not be more than 10 weeks pregnant
purdy told the washington post that not purchasing surgical equipment allows him to charge $ 400 for the procedure , which is about $ 100 less than the average pharmaceutical abortion
the clinic offers fluffy robes , natural wood floors and tea on arrival , in an attempt to help destigmatize the procedure clients who walk into carafem will receive counseling and go through ' basic tests ' before they take the initial pill at the clinic
the whole appointment is supposed to take about 60 minutes
the second set of pills , which induces the abortion , is then taken at home the next day
on it 's website , carafem says it 's staff provides ' clear , non-judgmental and accurate information so you feel confident '
' we are an experienced team with years of experience in abortion care , ' it states
purdy said the clinic plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically
' we do n't walk to talk in hushed tones , ' he said
' we use the a-word
' anti-abortion activists do n't believe carafem 's bold take is going to work
marjorie dannenfelser , president of anti-abortion lobbying group the susan b. anthony list , believes the approach is too celebratory
she said she believes even people who are pro-choice think of the procedure as ' a necessary evil '
national right to life president carol tobias believes people will find carafem disgusting
' abortion is not pleasant , and trying to put pretty wrappings around the procedure is n't going to make any difference , ' she said
purdy said the clinic , which he described as ' fresh , modern , clean and caring ' , plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically
' we do n't walk to talk in hushed tones , ' he said
' we use the a-word ' carafem 's founders are n't the only people speaking publicly and positively about abortion
a number of female democratic lawmakers have shared their personal experiences to put a human face on the procedure and protest anti-abortion legislation
last week ohio teresa fedor rep. teresa fedor revealed during a debate in the house that she had terminated a pregnancy after being raped while serving in the military and became pregnant
' you do n't respect my reason , my rape , my abortion , ' she said as representatives debated the state 's heartbeat bill , which would make it a felony for doctors to provide abortions if a fetal heartbeat is detected
' i guarantee you there are other woman who should stand up with me and be courageous enough to speak that voice , ' she continued
' i 've sat here long enough
