aston villa face a major fa inquiry , a substantial fine and the threat of a ground closure after west brom players appeared to be assaulted as the fa cup quarter - final at villa park descended into chaos with an unrestrained pitch invasion joined by thousands of aston villa fans
in alarming scenes , which were a throwback to the football hooliganism of the seventies and eighties , west brom players were left defenceless as fans rushed on to the pitch
scorer fabian delph claimed he was bitten , while boaz myhill , dawson and callum mcmanaman all appeared to be barged aggressively , and the latter seemingly struck on the back of the head by one fan as dawson attempted to shepherd him off
on the final whistle , thousands of fans came on and even aston villa players were threatened by the melee
aston villa captain fabian delph , who scored the first goal in the 2 - 0 win , said : ' it was very , very scary
my armband got nicked , some got my boot but i could appreciate the relief the fans are feeling after a result like that
people tried to kiss me , and were biting me
' aston villa seemed to exacerbate the problem by playing the celebratory song ' que sera sera ' over the pa while fans were still streaming on to the pitch , and put a video of fans celebrating on the pitch on their official twitter feed
meagre numbers of police and stewards attempted to deal with the hundreds who invaded the field of play a club statement read : ' the club does not condone supporters invading the field of play under any circumstances
' we are very disappointed that what should have been a very memorable and proud moment for our fans was marred by the actions of those who could not control themselves
' they have let both themselves and their club down
' the club extends its sincere apologies to the fa , the west brom directors , manager tony pulis and all his staff and players
' west brom manager tony pulis said : ' it 's disgraceful
we do n't want to see those scenes
they 've beaten us and for that to happen , that 's just mindless idiots
if you 're aston villa , you need to look at the stewards as they came over to our fans and there was nobody there
' aston villa should look at the stewarding
it 's a quarter - final , it 's a full house and you know it 's going to be tasty
so you should have stewards both ends of the pitch
' supporters were coming on with a few minutes to go
they were congregating at the ends anyway a few minutes from time , so it puts player at danger and you do n't want to see that
we were seeing that in the seventies and eighties and we do n't want to see that
' i 'm sure the fa will look at it without be poking my nose into it
if you ask me from a football point of view , if you had a load of stewards then it would be sorted out
most of the grounds in the premier league are well stewarded
i 'm sure aston villa are disappointed this has happened
' scorer scott sinclair ( second left ) is mobbed by a fan and team - mates ashley westwood and jack grealish aston villa manager tim sherwood admitted he could understand the fans ' emotions after the victory asked whether any west brom players had been assaulted , tony pulis said : ' i do n't know
i did n't ask them
everyone looked as though they had their heads and arms on
they looked ok to me
they got in , intact
i 'm more concerned with trying to stop it before it happens
' west midlands police confirmed on sunday that they had arrested 17 men for various public order offences , including one on suspicion of assaulting an officer , and authorities are also investigating an incident in a nearby pub before the game
a police statement read : ' we carried out a large policing operation for the fa cup yesterday evening ( march 7 ) to ensure supporters could enjoy the game in a safe environment
' during the course of the operation 17 men were arrested for various public order offences
an investigation has been launched to identify people involved in a disturbance before the match at the witton arms pub. ' anyone who saw what happened should contact police on 101 or call crimestoppers , anonymously , on 0800 555 111
' we will also be supporting the fa to identify people involved in pitch invasions that happened at the end of the match
' the fa , who are believed to have had a ' crowd control advisor ' present , will begin investigations tomorrow , asking aston villa for their observations and their plans for stewarding
west midlands police will also submit evidence and the report of referee taylor will be taken into consideration
though aston villa had a significant presence of stewards by the west brom fans , there were far fewer by the villa park where the aston villa fans sit and they were quickly overcome by the scale on the invasion
west brom boss tony pulis believes aston villa need to look at their stewarding following saturday 's incidents fans sing and chant on the pitch following aston villa 's win during what has been a disappointing season the fa can impose a range of sanctions from ground closure to fines , if the club have been considered negligent
there is no prospect of aston villa being thrown out of the tournament but any ground closure or reduction in capacity could affect the team in their fight against relegation
the most likely outcome would seem to be a fine in the region of Â£ 100,000
aston villa manager tim sherwood said : ' i did n't know west brom players had been hit
i can understand the emotions of the fan beating their local rivals twice in a week but you ca n't condone fans coming on the pitch
we do n't condone it , especially if anyone was touched
' what can you do ? the stewards did their best
i saw them rugby tackling a few guys
but when they 're coming in such numbers it 's difficult to stem it
' it has been a good week
i 'd rather talk about the football
the players want to dedicate the victory to the fans because they 've had some hard times here
and we 're going to need those fans
it 's been a very good week but here 's stil a lot of hard work and we need those fans every step of the way
' mark lawrenson , who was co-commentator for bbc1 's coverage added : ' it 's like a scene from the 1980s all over again
' west brom fans also acted irresponsibly , ripping out several seats in the away section and launching them onto the aston villa fans below when scott sinclair scored the second goal
goalscorer fabian delph claims fans nicked his captain 's armband as well as his left boot during the invasion the scene at villa park as hundreds of jubilant fans stormed the pitch shortly after the final whistle one fan swings on the villa park crossbar as tim sherwood 's side booked their place at wembley
