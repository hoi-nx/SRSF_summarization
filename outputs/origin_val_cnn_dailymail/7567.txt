for most people advancing in years , old age is about donning a pair of comfy slippers and taking life at a steadier pace
however , one group of mischievous seventysomethings , the stars of a new series of channel 5 show oaps behaving badly , are determined to rage against the stereotype
among those behaving badly is former popstar lee
the 75 - year - old , who had a smash hit in 1968 with ' little arrows ' under his stage name ' lee ' , is refusing to put his carousing days to bed
the couple make it clear in the show that they are still very much full of life , with danish bettina at one point presenting her lover with a penis pump after visiting a sex shop
lee said : ' tina is a very sexually active young lady , she is quite fit and she 's quite a big girl
she 's just a very healthy young lady and i 'm delighted to have her
' i suppose you could meet ladies of your own age but 75 year old ladies are a lot different to 50 year old ladies
' lee admits to creaking bones but says his new lover has given him a fresh take on life
singing to a different tune : lee and bettina argue over who has the most energy
she says her 75 - year - old boyfriend is ' never tired ' having fun ! lee entertains locals in mallorca with his old tunes and says : ' i think the game is to just , just make the most of it really ' he said : ' as far as age is concerned - i know that old clichÃ© " it 's just a number " - but it is just a number is n't it really ? ' after meeting bettina and everything it 's like a bit of a new lease of life
' it seems that there 's life in the old dog yet
bettina admits to often having trouble keeping up with her pension - age lover
she said : ' i 'm tired all the time he 's not
he 's almost never tired
' lee keeps busy by belting out his tunes to the ageing party animals in spain and still has plenty of female admirers - something which turns bettina green with envy
he said : ' over the years i suppose i 've played to hundreds and hundreds and thousands of people , because i have been here thirty odd years
' ' i think as far as the future is concerned when you get to my age what 's behind you gets longer and what 's in front of you gets shorter
' i think the game is to just , just make the most of it really
' and with bettina 's help who knows
' the series also follows the fortunes of other outrageous pensioners including swinging professor colin and ' spiritual healer ' raimondo , who is on the hunt for a younger lover
oaps behaving badly is on channel 5 at 9pm on wednesday march 25
