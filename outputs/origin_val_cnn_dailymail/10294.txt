from old television sets with only two channels , to salt and pepper shakers found inside an abandoned tb hospital , these images document the slow but steady decline of rural britain
this incredible set of photographs , taken across 15,000 miles of norfolk 's most rugged terrain , brings home the reality of that disappearing lifestyle like never before
from rotting farmhouses to rusting cars and even a set of abandoned petrol pumps , photographer brian wells , 43 , has sought to bring the decline of the countryside to life
decay : a rusting pick - up truck is pictured on the old site of medlars vehicle dismantler 's , near stratton strawless in the norfolk countryside forgotten : petrol pumps covered with old , peeling red paint , were discovered by photographer brian wells , 43 , close to the village of seething rotting : paradise farm , a grade ii listed 17th century farmhouse situated on private land in stradsett , which is now being renovated ancient : an old aga is seen at bessingham manor house , which has now been fully restored
legend has it that one of the former owners , edmund spurrell , used to entertain the guests at dinner parties with a dancing bear which is buried in the grounds relics : medicine bottles found in a large derelict house in the village of methwold , know locally as ' the pickelman 's house ' , due the fact that there are a multitude of pickle jars in the pantry he said ' my photographs highlight the beauty in the broken that we usually overlook
i am drawn to the history held within the abandoned buildings and rusting rustic objects , and marvels at the possibilities that each alludes to
' ruins capture the viewer âs imagination with their ability to tell stories
they are a window into human histories , silent rooms with dust covered furniture , discarded objects that are left behind and a smell of mustiness lingering in the air echoing a past long gone
' i feel that one of the most powerful aspects of a ruin is the subject that 's missing in the photograph - the people who once worked and lived in these places
their presence can still be felt
' time gone by : an old container of cadbury 's marvel dried milk power and a glass jar prop up a copy of parade magazine on a rotting shelf at this unknown location lost choice : dials on this television set show it dates from a time when there were only two channels , almost unthinkable to those born today gone bust : while the numbers on these tiles may appear to be random , they are in fact prices , found inside the old yallops shoes store on st. augustines street , norwich spooky : this shot was taken inside an old prefabricated bungalow named ' regina ' , in felthorpe
a swathe of prefab homes were built to house those whose homes were destroyed after the second world war packed up : this suitcase was found in a forlorn cottage on the side of the busy a47 towards kings lynn in the village of east winch
a luggage tag still attached to it reads ' albert ' brian wells said he uses ordinance survey maps , and an ancient kelly 's dictionary , the victorian equivalent of the yellow pages , in order to track down the long forgotten sites
he added : ' checking out the auction pages in local newspapers is useful and ' urban exploration ' websites also come in handy
â i always seek permission where possible to photograph the property , especially if it is not isolated
most of the time i get a positive reply
' empty : these old salt and pepper shakers were found inside a former night porters ' cabin , at an abandoned tb hospital in mundesley fancy a sit down ? this tatty armchair , discovered in an abandoned house in an unknown location , has not been used in decades not in use : a rusting plug socket for a cooker is seen on a mouldy wall in derelict cottage on the outskirts of the toftrees estate , norfolk peeling : sixties - style wallpaper is seen falling from the damp walls inside a derelict cottage located along doles lane , in bradwell stuck in the past : an out - dated doll figure is seen standing in front of three mirrors inside an abandoned house at an unknown location
