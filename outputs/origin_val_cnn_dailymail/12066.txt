independent senator lambie has rubbished claims of a canberra makeover , and confessed she arrived in parliament with a wardrobe made up entirely of op - shop purchases
ms lambie said her thrift was the result of more than $ 20,000 of debt , which meant she was not able to splash out on her clothing
however , the fiery politician said she has splashed out on at least one luxury , admitting to getting botox injections in her back and face , according to the daily telegraph
senator lambie in the colours of her then - party in october , 2013 , speaking at a palmer united party press conference ' i have n't had a makeover , ' senator lambie said , when asked if she had undergone a make - over since she arrived in canberra
' this is how it works
when i first came in , because i had sold my house and used every last bit of money i had , clive palmer in the end helped me get over the line , i had nothing left
' it took a couple of months to get back on my feet and the only things in my wardrobe i pretty much got from vinnies over the last two years
it would have only been $ 3 to $ 4 apiece
bright yellow scarves were a staple for ms lambie in 2013 ( pictured : left ) , but she gradually toned down the colout in 2014 ( pictured : middle ) and 2015 ( pictured : right ) ' i have n't had a makeover , ' senator lambie said , when asked if she had undergone a make - over since she arrived in canberra ' you know , if you want to look nice and you 're in the public spotlight , that 's just part of the job , ' ms lambie said ' so i 've just basically gone out and bought some new clothes
one of them owns the shop in davenport
i try to keep it local
so i thought , ' bugger it , i will just do it at christmas time when they 've got all their sales and stuff '
' i have a heap of botox in my back , right , so every now and again i put some in my crow 's feet
' ' you know , if you want to look nice and you 're in the public spotlight , that 's just part of the job
' ms lambie was no stranger to colourful accessories during her early parliamentary days , with bright scarves and jackets a staple of her wardrobe when she first stepped foot in the senate .
