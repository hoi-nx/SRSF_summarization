abidal has insisted real 's most important player is not cristiano ronaldo ( pictured ) former barcelona defender abidal would rather have karim ( pictured ) in his team real 's cristiano ronaldo , gareth bale and karim celebrate a goal during their la liga match against levante ' if you take karim away from real then they would continue scoring goals but not as many as they do with karim in the team
' he 's a very complete player and other players [ play ] well in real when karim is there
' so yes , if i have to sign one person it would be him , and not just because he is my friend and my compatriot but because of his qualities
' abidal left barcelona in 2013 and feels his former club will prove too strong for their real rivals
he continued : ' i think it will finish 3 - 1 to barcelona
i think neymar , lionel messi and luis suarez will each score , though i 'd like javier mascherano to get a goal for the club
' barcelona are doing much better than at the start of the season , when they struggled a little bit
now , in 2015 , everything 's looking impressive and hopefully that continues until the end of the season
