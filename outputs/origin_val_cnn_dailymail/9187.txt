our ability to answer questions currently separates us from machines in the world of artificial intelligence
but researchers are working on algorithms to give computers this skill too
now , scientists at facebook have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer , if they can ever match human brainpower â but some of them are a bit tricky , meaning some people may fail them too
scientists at facebook ( logo shown ) have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer if they can ever match human brainpower â but some of them are a bit tricky , meaning some people may fail them too the team from the social media firm âs ai in new york have come up with a list of 20 questions to separate humans from robots , because they say â many existing learning systems can currently not solve them
â they test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language
1 ) the first question of the 20 listed in the research paper was the simplest for a computer to answer
it is : john is in the playground bob is in the office where is john ? 2 ) a harder example for a computer to answer is a question that requires it to differentiate three separate arguments , such as : mary gave the cake to fred
fred gave the cake to bill
jeff was given the milk by fred
who gave the cake to fred ? who did fred give the cake to ? what did jeff receive ? who gave the milk ? 3 ) another task tested a machine 's ability to perform simple counting operations by asking about the number of objects
for example : daniel picked up the football
how many objects is daniel holding ? 4 ) basic deduction skills were tested by questions such as : sheep are afraid of wolves
cats are afraid of dogs
mice are afraid of cats
what is gertrude afraid of ? 5 ) and reasoning about size was tested by this question : the football fits in the suitcase
the suitcase fits in the cupboard
the box of chocolates is smaller than the football
will the box of chocolates sit in the suitcase ? the intelligent computers were tested on 20 questions in total , but none of them got a perfect score
the answers to the five examples listed , are shown above the sometimes tricky questions test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language
a stock image of a perplexed person is shown some of the questions require machines to recall facts , while others need reasoning , or to count the number of objects , expressed in a written passage
the researchers say that humans should be able to score full marks
while you may have got one answer wrong , none of the seven computer learning programmes that facebook tested got all 20 questions right
the experiment was designed to test whether a machine can answer questions â via chaining facts , simple induction , deduction and many more , â the study published on arxiv says
scientists are keen to create this ability so that humans can talk fluently with machines , which could lead to robots looking after the elderly and more intelligent websites , for example
the paper says : â one long - term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to reasoning and natural language , in particular building an intelligent dialogue agent
â the experts aim to â classify these tasks into skill sets , so that researchers can identify ( and then rectify ) the failings of their systems
â the results of the test show that humans are still ahead of the game when it comes to interpreting the world âs subtleties and language
the questions are written in very clear and simple terms so there is still a way to go before computers catch us up .
