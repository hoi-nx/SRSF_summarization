a homeless person has written a funny apology note after they broke into a man 's car and stole his blanket
bert palin , 82 , from east gosford on the nsw central coast , discovered the letter after returning home from a trip to sydney 's redfern to visit family
when he opened the boot of the car he found his blanket folded neatly with the note placed on top
' hi , i borrowed your blanket for a little while because i was cold and did n't have anywhere to go , ' the note read
' i hope you accept my apology for taking your stuff without asking
' the person signed the note ' blankt [ sic ] thief ' with a smiley face , before adding : ' p.s. the blank [ sic ] is really itchy
' mr bert palin told the nt news that he had accepted the apology but warned the thief to ' keep out of my car ' in future
' it was obviously a male or female of some education to have written it the way they did and to break into my car then say " thank you " and " p.s. your blanket was itchy " ... it was breathtaking , ' he said
' i washed the blanket after that because i was concerned about it being itchy
