when we learn how to write , our brain does not learn the individual lettering of words - instead it is tuned to remember how the word appears as a whole
that 's the finding of a new study that has shown how neurons respond differently to real words compared to so - called ' nonsense ' words
during tests , brain scans revealed the new words appear as shapes rather than a group of letters in what researchers behind the study have dubbed a ' visual dictionary
' when we learn how to write , our brain does n't learn individual letters , instead it is tuned to remember how the word appears as a whole , according to new research
brain scans revealed neurons respond differently to real words compared to so - called ' nonsense ' words in what 's been dubbed ' visual dictionary ' the study , carried out at georgetown university medical centre , suggests brain is ' holistically tuned ' to recognise complete words , according to the researchers
lead author dr riesenhuber from the laboratory for computational cognitive neuroscience said : ' we are not recognising words by quickly spelling them out or identifying parts of words , as some researchers have suggested
' instead , neurons in a small brain area remember how the whole word looks - using what could be called a visual dictionary
' the small area in the brain called the visual word form area is found in the left side of the visual cortex , opposite the fusiform face area on the right side , which remembers how faces look
the study published in the journal of neuroscience looked at the brain activity of 25 adults who had learn a set of 150 nonsense words
for the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) , before and after participants learnt the new words
using the fmri - rapid adaptation , the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the nonsense words
before learning the words , neurons responded as though the training words were nonsense words
however over time , the neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words
the researchers said this shows the brain is ' holistically tuned ' to recognise complete words , and may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities
dr riesenhuber added : ' one area is selective for a whole face , allowing us to quickly recognise people , and the other is selective for a whole word , which helps us read quickly
' the study , published in the journal of neuroscience , looked at the brain activity of 25 adults who had learn a set of 150 nonsense words
for the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri )
images of the brain were taken before and after participants learnt the new words
from this , the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the ' nonsense ' words
before learning the words , neurons responded as though the training words were nonsense words
but over time , the neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words
co-author dr laurie glezer said : ' this study is the first of its kind to show how neurons change their tuning with learning words , demonstrating the brain 's plasticity
' the researchers said the study shows how the brain processes words , but may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities
dr riesenhuber said : ' for people who can not learn words by phonetically spelling them out - which is the usual method for teaching reading - learning the whole word as a visual object may be a good strategy
' in particular , the team found the visual word form area in the fusiform gyrus ( shown in purple ) changed as the participants learned the ' nonsense ' words
the neurons began by responding to the training words as if they were nonsense , but over time , these neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words following a previous study carried out by the team published in 2009 , the researchers were contacted by a number of people who had experienced reading difficulties and teachers helping people with reading difficulties , all saying that learning word as visual objects had helped a great deal
that study showed the existence of a neural representation for whole written real words - also known as an orthographic lexicon
the latest research now shows how novel words can become incorporated after learning into this lexicon
dr riesenhuber said : ' the visual word form area does not care how the word sounds , just how the letters of the word look together
' the fact that this kind of learning only happens in one very small part of the brain is a nice example of selective plasticity in the brain
