from iphones to the latest apple , most people find it difficult to accurately recall what the ' most recognizable ' brand 's logo looks like when tested , according to a new study
the reason for this is because people are constantly hounded with logos which makes it difficult to remember them , researchers from the university of california , la found
when asked to draw the apple logo , only one in 85 participants were able to recreate it correctly in terms of shape , bite size and leaf shape and orientation
however , less than half of participants were able to identify it from a set of 12 similar apple logos with altered features , according to the study which was published last month
less than half of participants were able to identify the logo correctly from a set of 12 similar apple logos with altered features ( to find out which is the correct logo , scroll down to the bottom of this article ) during the first stage of the selection quiz , the participant is asked how confident they are from a rating of one to five ; one being the most confident and five the least confident
most people who participated felt the apple logo was highly memorable before attempting to recall the details of the logo , according to researchers
the second part is actually spotting the logo out of a set of 12 apples which are separated into three columns of four
when asked to draw the apple logo , only one in 85 participants were able to recreate it correctly ( pictured above ) in terms of shape , bite size and leaf shape and orientation while it might initially be thought of as an easy task , when faced with all of the varying logos , it becomes increasingly difficult
considering the fact that people are exposed to the apple logo on products from mobile phones , computers and laptops , it could be expected that good memory would hold strong when correctly recognizing the logo
the reason for this is because people are constantly hounded with logos which makes it difficult to remember them , researchers from the university of california , la found
while people are often exposed to the logo , they stop paying attention to the details of it which could be due to the fact that it is so simple and widely available ( above left , an apple iphone 5c and right , the new apple watch that was displayed on monday ) however , ' memory is often tuned towards remembering gist - based schematic information ' researchers said , which means details can be quickly forgotten
' the ubiquitous apple logo is a simple design and is often referred to as one of the most recognizable logos in the world , ' wrote researchers
the apple logo , which has had seven different versions over the years , has kept the same silhouette of an apple since first designed in 1977 ( above the first apple logo by co-founder ronald wayne in 1976 depicting sir isaac newton ) ' participants showed surprisingly poor memory for the details of the logo as measured through recall [ drawings ] and forced - choice recognition
' the findings provided support for theories of attentional saturation , in attentional amnesia and reconstructive memory , as well as how availability can lead to overconfidence when it comes to memory
the results in the study also did not differ between apple and pc users
the apple logo , which has had seven different versions over the years , has kept the same silhouette of an apple since first designed in 1977 , which has remained the same ever since , according to adweek
while people are often exposed to the logo , they stop paying attention to the details of it which could be due to the fact that it is so simple and widely available , said researchers
similarly , when it comes to other logos such as the google letters , many people have difficulty remembering the correct colors
researchers said this is because attention and memory are not always tuned to recalling what we consider memorable
' increased exposure increases familiarity and confidence , but does not reliably affect memory , ' they wrote
' despite frequent exposure to a simple and visually pleasing logo , attention and memory are not always tuned to remembering what we may think is memorable
' did you spot the correct logo ? the apple logo is pictured at the bottom of the third column
the apple logo , which has had seven different versions in total over the years , has always kept the same silhouette of an apple since it was first developed by designer rob janoff in 1977
the first and original logo was a woodcut by co-founder ronald wayne in 1976 featuring sir isaac newton , but was later changed to the apple silhouette , which has remained the same to present day
