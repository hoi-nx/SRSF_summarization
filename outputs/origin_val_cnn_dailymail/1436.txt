jihadi jihadi john told mi5 he was a moderate muslim as he desperately tried explain why he had been picked up in terror - plagued east african , new tapes reveal
cage , the campaign group criticised for blamed the isis killer 's actions on british , today released a recording of a 2009 interview they carried out with emwazi - unmasked as jihadi john last week
in the recording , emwazi tells how he was questioned by british security services after he was flown home from tanzania suspected of trying to join somalia terror group al-shabaab
the isis killer complained that he was being ' threatened ' by mi5 and moaned that agents were ' putting words in his mouth '
three years after his claims he was n't an extremist , emwazi appeared in syria beheading western hostages in isis videos
emwazi ( pictured , left , in 2009 and , right , while a student university of westminster ) - known as jihadi john - was recorded by campaign group cage complaining about his treatment by mi5 in the years before he went to syria to join terror group isis in the new tapes , emwazi said he spoke to an mi5 officer following his return from tanzania and was questioned over his views on islam and terrorism
in a recording released today , he told cage : ' [ the mi5 agent ] said : " emwazi , what do you think of 7/7 ? " i said : " innocent people have died
" ' he added : ' he started telling me : " what do you think of 9/11 ? " i told him : " this is a wrong thing
what do you want me to say ? "
' if i had the opportunity for those lives to come back then i would make those lives come back
i do nât think ... i think what happened is wrong
' but the mi5 agent did not believe his views were moderate and replied : ' i still believe you are going to somalia to train
' emwazi moaned : ' he said : ' we are going to keep a close eye on you , emwazi
we already have been and we are going to keep a close eye on you ' - threatening me
' cage have released the tape as part of their widely - criticised claims that emwazi was ' harassed ' by security services
they were slammed after releasing a statement entitled ' jihadi john : ' radicalised ' by british ' last week and tried to blame authorities for his actions
cage 's statement claimed that emwazi ' desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation , but the system ultimately rejected him '
the reported interview with mi5 took place after emwazi was refused entry to tanzania because authorities suspected he was trying to get to somalia , where terrorist organisation al-shabaab have been known to train british militants
in the recordings , emwazi ( pictured in the isis beheading videos which earned him the nickname ' jihadi john ' ) claims he condemned previous attacks such as 9/11 and 7/7 when he was questioned by an agent the recordings were released by human rights group cage , who have been widely criticised for trying to blame british authorities for emwazi 's actions lee rigby 's killer michael adebolajo was picked up by the sas and mi5 in similar fashion as he tried to enter the east african country in november 2010
extremist samantha lewthwaite - known as the ' samantha lewthwaite ' after her bomber husband germaine lindsay took part in the 7/7 london attacks - is also believed to be part of the al-shabaab
the year after his recorded conversation with cage , emwazi contacted mail on sunday security editor verkaik in december 2010
he told mr verkaik he feared mi5 were following him and wrote in an email : ' sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking , not fearing they may kill me
' mr verkaik recalled : ' like many young muslim men at the time who i had interviewed , he appeared to have a grievance against the police and mi5
but this man was different â in him was a warped sense of injustice that could never justify the barbaric acts of murder that he has gone on to carry out in syria
' after foiled attempts to go to his father 's home country , kuwait , and to get a teaching job in saudi arabia , emwazi slipped out of british and later appeared in syria
he has since gained global notoriety as the masked killer of western hostages including british aid workers alan henning and david haines in isis beheading videos which have shocked the world
emwazi was interviewed after he was picked up by authorities in tanzania in 2009 , suspected of trying to get into somalia to join islamist group al-shabaab ( pictured ) other british extremists have also been linked to al-shabaab - including lee rigby killer michael adebolajo and ' samantha lewthwaite ' samantha lewthwaite cage has been widely criticised for its defence of emwazi after he was unmasked as jihadi john last week
asim qureshi , leader of campaign group , caused outrage by saying the murderer was ' beautiful ' adding that he ' would n't hurt a fly '
reg henning , brother of british aid worker alan henning who died at jihadi john 's hands , replied saying : ' if he 's a " beautiful , kind man " , why is he killing innocent civilians ? ' he 's a monster
everyone should be doing everything they can to capture him and bring him to justice - not stick up for him like he 's been hard done by
' amnesty international yesterday distanced itself from cage , saying : ' we do not support all of cage 's views or agree with how it expresses them
' charities who fund cage are also under investigation by the charity commission , which said the group 's public statement ' raises questions for a charity considering funding its activity
the moaning voice of emwazi in recordings of him complaining to cage appears to sound different from that in the speeches against the west made by jihadi john in isis 's horrific beheading videos last year
the whining tone of emwazi recorded in 2009 was more nasal and higher - pitched than the deeper voice that speaks over the gruesome films posted online from syria
the difference suggests isis either used another militant to voice over the films or may have doctored or slowed down emwazi 's voice to make him appear more fearsome in the propaganda films
it would not be the first time the militant group have been suspected of digitally - enhancing videos to increase the appeal to their followers
a recent sickening film showing 21 coptic christians being beheaded on a beach in libya is widely thought to have been photoshopped
experts say the jihadists in the footage were altered to look much taller than their captives and a scene showing sea water stained with blood was created using special effects
jihadi john in his own words : full transcript of how emwazi tried to get off the hook amid suspicions he wanted to train with terrorists emwazi went to campaign group cage in 2009 after he was questioned by mi5 over his suspected links to terrorism
describing the interview he said : ' [ the mi5 agent ] said ; " i want to ask you some serious questions now " and while i 'm packing my bag , while i 'm packing some of my stuff , i said yeah , go on , ask
' he said : " no i 'd like you to sit , face to face while i ask you some questions
' i said , these must be some serious questions
let âs get down to it , i sat and looked at him face to face now
' he looked at men and said mohammed , what do you think about 7/7 ? " ' i said , innocent people have died
what do you think , i think this is extremism
emwazi said he was asked on his views of the 7/7 bombings when interview and told them they were ' wrong ' ' he said : " ok , what do you think of the war in afghanistan ? " ' i said what do i think , we see the news
innocent people are getting killed
' and he starts telling me what do you think about 9/11 ? " ' i told him this is a wrong thing , what happened was wrong
what do you want me to say ? ' if i had an opportunity for those brother 's lives to come back then i 'd make those lives come back
' he said " what do i think of jews ? " they 're a religion
everyone has a right to their own beliefs
i do n't force no - one
' he wanted to know about my background , about my creed
' i told him this is how islam is , we do n't force anyone to come into our religion
everyone has their own right
he is said to have been questioned by intelligence officers at amsterdam 's schiphol airport , where he was flown after being refused entry to tanzania ' i told him everything that was happened , all bombs or whatever that happened was from extremists
' after all this he came back and looked at me and said i still think you 're going to somalia to train
' i said after what i just told you , after i told you that what happening is extremism you 're still suggesting i 'm an extremist ? ' he said yeah and started going on , trying to put words in my mouth
' and we 're going to keep a close eye on you emwazi , we already have been , and we 're going to keep a close eye on you
