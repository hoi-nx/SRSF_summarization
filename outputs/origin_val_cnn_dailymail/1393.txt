the scotland boss , though , seemed to suggest the pair were simply carrying on at the same level they had been performing at while at tannadice , asking : â have they kicked on ? or are they the same players they were five or six months ago ? â but celtic assistant manager john collins admitted he thought they had done enough to earn a place in the squad , saying : â i have got to be honest , i am surprised that they were not called up
â they have done very well for us but the their time will come
they are young players and i have no doubt they will get themselves into scotland squads of the future

â they have lots of talent and are only going to get better with age
â gordon has got lots of good players to pick from and it âs a tough job
but their time will come
