when man relies on machine , there is always something that can go wrong
and there is no more unforgiving environment than the high - stakes world of formula one
" racing is one of those ... probably a crueler sport in that there 's so many other variables , " says red bull 's no.1 driver ricciardo , ahead of sunday 's season - opening australian grand prix
" unfortunately it 's not like tennis where all the racquets are pretty much the same and you ca n't blame anyone but yourself
" ricciardo experienced the full extent of formula one 's cruelty at last year 's melbourne race
the australian crossed the line in second place -- seemingly becoming the first australian to finish on the podium at albert park -- but jubilation soon turned to despair
he was disqualified hours after the race when officials ruled his car had exceeded the maximum fuel flow rate , a rule which states each car is limited to 100 kilograms of fuel per race and was introduced to make the sport more fuel efficient
" it 's frustrating , i mean it 's a part of the sport which will always be frustrating , " said the 25 - year - old , reflecting on what was his red bull debut
" i 'm sure even lewis ( hamilton ) and nico ( rosberg ) last year were frustrated at the times because you never have the perfect car , " he added , referring to the two mercedes drivers , who finished first and second last season
" but it is what it is , i signed up for that a long time ago , and you just learn to accept it
" it 's a sport where even driving ability often fails to overcome mechanical failures -- eventual world champion hamilton was forced to retire from last year 's race at albert park
but technical blunders do n't always end in disaster -- hamilton won the italian grand prix after experiencing mechanical faults early in the race , and finnish driver valterri bottas lost a wheel in 2014 's opener before roaring to a fifth - place finish
despite ricciardo 's previous disappointment , he 's ca n't wait to race on his home turf again next sunday
" i definitely feel privileged to have a home race ... it just increases all the hype and all the excitement " said ricciardo , adding that he would use " all the australian flags and all the cheers to my advantage
" after last year 's disaster ricciardo is looking to make things right , " there 's a little bit of redemption , i 'm confident we can get it back
