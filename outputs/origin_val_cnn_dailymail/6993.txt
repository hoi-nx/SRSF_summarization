gatland has hit out at the six nations fixture scheduling and claimed that wales and england have consistently been given a difficult opening round tie
the wales coach claims the draw in dublin has played into the hands of ireland over the last decade , with their celtic rivals being given a favourable round one tie against italy in seven of the last 14 competitions
â who is doing it ? â said gatland
â the last 15 years have been very tough on england and wales in terms of the draw we have both received
who is making that draw ? wales coaches robert howley and gatland chat at training ahead of saturday 's match against italy wales scrum half gareth davies and wing george north share a joke during the wales open session ' you look at one team who has had a pretty easy run in the last 10 or 15 years and for the next two or three years
whether that is the broadcasters having an influence , i do n't know
â it âs a tough tournament to win : win your first game and you get a bit of momentum and put yourself in contention
i do nât know if there should be a rota : i do n't make the draw
i have just looked at the last 10 or 15 years and seen who has played who first in the competition
some teams have obviously had easier starts on a regular basis than others
