as one of the youngest and most successful entrepreneurs in the world , any career advice from zuckerberg should probably taken fairly serious , or at the very least written down
speaking at the mobile world congress this week - the world 's biggest wireless phone fair in barcelona - the 30 - year - old facebook founder was asked the main thing he looks for in a potential employee
and his answer was as simple as it was significant
' i will only hire someone to work directly for me if i would work for that person , ' zuckerberg told the gathering at a town hall meeting
' it 's a pretty good test
he was confronted with tensions between internet giants such as facebook and google and telecom firms present at the mobile world congress , the world 's biggest wireless phone fair , in barcelona
executives have complained that some internet services ' smartphone applications generate revenue while it is the telephone companies that are forced to invest in the networks that host them
the wall street journal on sunday quoted denis o'brien , chairman of international wireless firm digicel group , as saying : ' zuckerberg is like the guy who comes to your party and drinks your champagne , and kisses your girls , and does n't bring anything
' zuckerberg later defended himself in an appearance at the congress alongside the heads of several telecom companies with which he is working to launch smartphone internet access in developing countries in latin america , africa and asia
' we have these services that people love and that are drivers of data usage ... and we want to work this out so that way it 's a profitable model for our partners , ' zuckerberg said
keynote : the annual mobile world congress hosts some of the wold 's largest communication companies , with many unveiling their latest phones and wearables gadgets the head of norwegian company telenor , baksaas , said it was a ' point of tension ' that facebook and the whatsapp service that it owns offer free messaging which bypasses the phone companies ' own paid services
telenor is one of the companies working to launch free access to facebook 's phone application in developing countries
in those deals , facebook is serving as an incentive to draw new customers since it is one of the most in - demand services for smartphone users in emerging markets
' we need to find a balance because we are the ones that deploy resources locally , we work locally , we create a lot of employment locally , we pay government taxes locally , ' baksaas said
' there is a financial formula that needs to be balanced in the long run
