david cotterill has revealed the first battle for him and wales captain ashley williams ahead of their crunch euro 2016 qualifier in israel will just be getting off the ground
both the birmingham winger and the swansea captain have a fear of flying so will look to each other for support when the welsh squad head to the skies on thursday
belgium âs match in israel originally scheduled for last september was postponed until this month because of the gaza conflict
but simply being 30,000 feet high will be of concern to david cotterill
swansea and wales defender ashley williams has a fear of flying he laughed : â i âm a nervous wreck on every flight i go on , it does nât matter where it âs to
normally when i âm flying i grab my two children âs hands
â when i âm on my own , ashley williams is across from me and he âs a nervous flier too , we just look at each other like we âre having a panic attack
â he âs a warrior on the pitch but when it comes to flying he âs a little baby
â david cotterill has played an important part in wales travelling to the middle east with designs on topping their euro 2016 qualifying group on departure
the 27 - year - old came off the bench in the win over cyprus earlier in the campaign to score a long - range free - kick , before starting the goalless draw in belgium
â it was an amazing result for us
in previous years we would probably have gone over there and got beaten three or four nil , â he told sportsmail
swansea defender ashley williams regarded as a fearless competitor on the pitch â i think the squad has improved so much , and we have great confidence
hopefully we can do something special by qualifying
â wales have not made a major tournament since the 1958 world cup but sit second in group b on eight points , one behind israel having played a game more
belgium are fourth on five points with a game in hand on wales
david cotterill made his debut a decade ago as a 17 - year - old , coming on to replace ryan giggs , so is well placed to chart the strides taken by this wales team and how bale has grown in dressing room stature
â we have great experience , he said
â baley , rambo ( aaron ramsey ) and ( chris ) gunter have a lot of caps for their age , obviously brought through from the days of ( john ) toshack and ( gary ) speed
â a lot of us have been together for many years and that âs only benefitting us now
the group is a lot closer now than in previous years and it âs showing on the pitch
â he added : â baley âs signed for real and he is one of our leaders
he does speak a lot more than he used to
whatever he says he âs talking sense because he âs playing for one of the best managers in the world
â bale âs presence , despite his difficult spell at real , encourages david cotterill to believe wales can beat israel , who have a perfect record so far
birmingham winger david cotterill ( centre ) will be part of the wales squad flying to israel â we âve got one of the best players in the world , if that does nât give you a lift nothing will
most of our starting xi are in the premier league playing week in week out
we show respect but we have nothing to fear
â david cotterill has enjoyed a bright season at birmingham , revived under gary rowett , having moved from doncaster last summer
he has eight goals from the right wing and seven assists , numbers that compete with any players in is position in the championship
â i âm happy the way the season has gone , i âm hoping to score more goals and get to the double figure mark , hopeful add a few more assists , â he said
â then i could look back at a successful season
