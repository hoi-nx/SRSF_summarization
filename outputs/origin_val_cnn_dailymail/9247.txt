for desperate china families whose children suffer from debilitating brain conditions such as cerebral palsy , there is only one place to go
those who have little or no money to pay for treatment flock to a ramshackle village in changsha , one of china 's fastest - growing cities , which has sprung up in the shadow of a specialist hospital
the community has become known as the ' brain paralysis village ' , as families from around the country set up home there in the hope of receiving crucial treatment than can improve the quality of life for their children , according to a report on people 's daily
father and daughters : village resident zhu dongwen ( middle ) and his twin daughters , who were born in 2011 hundreds have moved there - spending upwards of Â¥ 100 ( Â£ 10.6 ) per month on rent - because the treatment at the nearby xiangya bo'ai rehabilitation hospital is completely free , as it is funded by a government scheme
roughly 10 kilometres from the changsha railway station , the village has formed spontaneously , as desperate families arrive to seek medical advice from the largest rehabilitation hospital in central china
the free service is only open to parents who have run out of money and no longer have any other way of getting help for children who suffer from serious brain problems
zhu dongwen , 43 , is one of the many parents living in this village
both of his twin daughters , born in 2011 , suffer from brain paralysis
' i never found out what that really meant , or why it happened , although i spent all my savings looking for an answer and looking for a cure , ' said mr zhu dongwen
' in the end we were turned out on the street and in desperation in april last year i managed to get taken in here
i had almost run out of hope , but the community gave me back my hope
' mr zhu dongwen came to the village with Â¥ 1,000 ( Â£ 106 ) in his pocket in april 2013
although the treatment is free - of - charge , the families still need money to live off
now a full - time carer for daughters zhu sihui and zhu siying ( not their real names ) without any stable income , mr zhu dongwen is spending around Â¥ 3,000 ( Â£ 318 ) to support the family 's life in the village
he took out a loan of more than Â¥ 250,000 ( Â£ 26,422 ) from various sources , which was spent on seeking care for his daughters , according to another report onchina daily
road to recovery : both of mr zhu dongwen 's daughters are recovering slowly
in the picture , mr zhu dongwen is dressing his zhu siying while zhu sihui is warming up her hands near the fire inside hospital : mother wang qun is helping her daughter xiang liping with rehabilitation under the intense treatment being carried out at the centre , the first of his daughters recovered enough control over her body to be able to walk
a month later his second daughter followed suit , and now they are able to interact with him and carry out many tasks that would have been impossible a year ago
mr zhu dongwen said : ' i am finally starting to believe that my girls will now be able to live relatively normal lives and even if something should happen to me they will be able to look after themselves one day
it is an impossible dream come true and all thanks to the chance i had to come here
' the project is unique to the area and it is not clear where the funding comes from , but children get rooms and care on - site
and with his daughters ' care in hand , zhu dongwen is even able to do some work locally to start to save again and build a future for them all outside of the village once they are well enough to leave
he said : ' i have hope again and it is this place that has given us that hope
' treatment in demand : a governmental report suggested that there are around 20,000 children with some form of ' brain paralysis ' in hunan province in southern china the village : housing around 100 families , the neighbourhood is located close to a major hospital offering a scheme which gives free treatment to children with brain paralysis
according to people 's daily , the scheme plans to help 9,000 such children under seven years old in hunan province
all of the children are classified as critical when they arrive , and most of them are unable to do anything for themselves
a government report suggested there are around 20,000 children in hunan province who are diagnosed with some form of ' brain paralysis ' , but only a small portion of them can afford to be treated properly .
