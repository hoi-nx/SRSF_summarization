farah fled the civil war in syrian with her husband in the middle of the night , hitching rides on trucks until they finally crossed into jordan
two days later , she gave birth to a girl in a country where they hold no status
like 70,000 other refugees from syrian , iraqi , sudan and the palestinian territories , farah ( her name and the others in this article have been changed to protect their anonymity ) now lives with her family in zarqa , a poor jordan city teeming with factories and crumbling apartment blocks
men dominate public spaces , and many women stay at home , isolated
two years ago , farah was a nurse and her husband a lawyer
here , he found work tiling construction sites , but was arrested three times for working illegally
" now my husband stays at home , depressed and afraid of being sent to the camps , " farah said
she is now the family breadwinner , working at a local organization providing educational programs to syrian and jordan children
every day she navigates the dangers of zarqa 's crime - ridden streets and ignores sexual advances from men
yet zarqa is also a pocket of hope
some 384 female refugees working with the near east foundation have been able to re-establish savings , restore dignity , strengthen their capacity to bounce back and rebuild their lives
many of them choose to become earners for the first time
they belong to a network of jordan and refugee women -- coaches , mentors and peers -- who lean on each other and offer business and social support , exchange tips and build friendships
some 80 % of the refugees in this network have chosen to invest in building a small home - based business
fatiya , who escaped iraqi during the 2003 invasion , was surviving on charity until six months ago
now she runs her own leather goods home - based business , making belts , wallets and key chains for tourists from the safety of her home
these days , fatiya is busy rebuilding her life
" i make my own way , " she says
zainab , also an iraqi refugee , is now a hairdresser in zarqa
on the side , she teaches the art of hairdressing to young women , walking alongside them in their first steps to become economically independent
on march 8 , we celebrate international women 's day and the empowerment of women globally -- including the nearly 6 million refugee women and girls who , like farah , fatiya and zainab , continue to adapt to life in their new surroundings with determination , creativity and skill , despite increasingly limited options
aid agencies must match the strength of these women 's resilience
to truly assist them , we must empower them with opportunities and choices
of the 10.5 million refugees registered with unhcr , the un 's refugee agency , less than 1 % are eventually resettled
the rest remain in limbo , forced to forge new lives in places where they often have no right to work
refugees are displaced for an average of 20 years , and more than half disappear into urban sprawls where they struggle to integrate and start their lives over
humanitarian assistance and media attention tend to fixate on " immediate " aid -- distribution of cash , food and subsistence items
unhcr provides critical cash assistance to refugees in jordan -- but this can be as little as $ 71 a month , 16 times below the country 's poverty line
refugees need to supplement their allowances , yet they can not legally find employment , and working in the informal sector can be dangerous
farah , fatiya and zainab are among hundreds of women who are finding a world of options as they build their vocational skills and financial literacy
but their increased role as earners challenges cultural norms , exposing them to heightened abuse and violence
women 's ability to generate income does not guarantee economic independence
to help this network of women control the income they earn , the near east foundation facilitates discussions with male family members about their wives ' and daughters ' newfound roles
" in the beginning , these women were tremendously shy -- they did n't talk , " says hamdan eliemat , who heads the bani hasan islamic society , a community organization supporting the women
" and now they wo n't stop talking
and we men , now we have to listen
" the international community must advocate for refugees ' right to survive
we must ensure that beyond immediate aid , women have access to skill - building , financial resources , social networks and protection from violence and harassment , so they have the chance to build their own futures .
