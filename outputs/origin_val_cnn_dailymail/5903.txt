although the are dressed in head - to - toe black and wear balaclavas that cover most of their faces , it is clear that the majority of the graduates are teenagers who have been brainwashed into thinking they are holy warriors , when the reality is they will be used as little more than cannon fodder

while hardened militants with experience of warfare and knowledge of battlefield strategy may be of use to isis , the vast majority of new recruits - especially teenagers and foreign fighters - are used as little more than cannon fodder during an assault or for suicide bomb attacks
others are kept far from the frontline and given mundane jobs such as guards or toilet cleaners that are a far cry from propaganda images portraying isis membership as a life of glory and honour
the images emerged as thousands of syria fled idlib province over the weekend , fearing government reprisals a day after opposition fighters and a powerful local al qaeda affiliate captured the northwestern town , activists said
idlib , with a population of around 165,000 people , is the second provincial capital to fall to the opposition after raqqa , which is now a stronghold of the islamic state group
its capture by several factions led by the al qaeda - linked nusra front underscores the growing power of extremist groups in syria , who now control about half the country

not content with the rape and massacre of the estimated four million brutally oppressed people living under the terror group 's control in syria and iraq , isis jihadis are now victimising the dead
claiming gravestones and tombs are a form of veneration of the dead and only distract from the worship of allah , the heavily - armed , camouflage - wearing militants are seen happily reducing the hilltop cemetery to piles of rubble
the chilling images are believed to have been taken in the syria province of raqqa and shows a hilltop cemetery overlooking what appears to be farmland
having parked their motorcycles at the gates of the graveyard , the militants are seen inside pulling over tombstones while sympathisers stand alongside them taking photographs
the nusra front and syria rebels have controlled the countryside and towns across idlib province since 2012 , but assad 's forces had maintained their grip on idlib city , near the border with turkey , throughout the conflict
now that the city is in the hands of rebels , who stormed government buildings and tore down posters of assad , many residents fear that troops will retaliate harshly
muayad zurayk , an activist based in idlib province , said via skype that ' residents are fleeing the city to nearby villages and towns
' he added that the situation was relatively quiet in the city yesterday despite some government shelling
rami abdurrahman , who heads the britain - based observatory , confirmed some people were fleeing the city
also in idlib , activists said members of a syria security agency killed more than a dozen detainees before withdrawing from a detention center in the city
the activists said the killings were conducted shortly before rebels took the so - called security compound in idlib on saturday
the idlib media center showed a video of what it said were at least 12 bloodied bodies inside a room at the military intelligence directorate
the observatory said 15 men were found shot dead inside the compound
the group said 53 other detainees , including two women , were freed by the rebels in the compound
more than 220,000 people have been killed in syria 's conflict , which began with an arab spring uprising in march 2011 and turned into an insurgency following a military crackdown .
