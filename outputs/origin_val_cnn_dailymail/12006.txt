a teenager 's first drive alone can be tough for any parent
the crash rate per mile driven for 16 - to 19 - year - olds is nearly three times the rate for drivers aged 20 and over
now , chevrolet has come up with a solution that will allow parents to spy on their children 's driving remotely , as well as prevent them from speeding
features include automatic muting the radio or paired devices when seatbelts are unfastened
it also gives audible and visual warnings when the vehicle is traveling faster than a speed set by parents
' we developed this system so parents could use it as a teaching tool with their kids â they can discuss and reinforce safe driving habits , ' said general motors safety engineer maryann beebe
' as a mother of two , i know anything that has the potential of keeping one 's family safer is of great value to parents
' parents can view maximum speed reached , distance driven and number of times active safety features were used
to use teen driver , a parent needs to enable the feature by creating a pin in the settings menu of their available mylink system , which then allows them to register their teen 's key fob
pictured is the system be tested in a early chevrolet malibu
the 2016 chevrolet malibu debuts at the new york auto show in early april and is expected to go on sale at the end of 2015 with prices starting at around $ 24,000 the feature can mute the audio of the radio or any device paired with the vehicle when front seat occupants are nât wearing their safety belts , and it gives audible and visual warnings when the vehicle is traveling over preset speeds when active , the radio system 's maximum volume can also be set to a lower level
if the vehicle is equipped with active safety features like forward collision alert , they are automatically turned on
parents can also manually turn those safety features off when teen driver is used
this means that things like traction control and blind zone warning are disabled so that new drivers learn good habits rather than relying on technology
