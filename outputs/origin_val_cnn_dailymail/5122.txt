spacewalking astronauts ventured out for the third time in just over a week on sunday to complete a tricky cable job at the international space station in one stunning shot , terry virts revealed the enormity of the station against the darkness of space as his fellow astronaut , butch wilmore , floated almost unseen
' can you spot the space walker in this picture ? ' terry virts tweeted
' he 's very small compared to the enormous starboard truss of the # iss '
' can you spot the space walker in this picture ? ' terry virts tweeted
' he 's very small compared to the enormous starboard truss of the # iss ' virts also posted a space selfie and commented : ' mission accomplished - three # spacewalks , 800 ' of cable , four antennas , three laser reflectors , one greased robotic arm
' but not everything went to plan
dramatically , right before sunday 's spacewalk , engineers spotted problems with us astronaut butch wilmore 's suit
while it had functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks , on sunday morning , a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out
a mechanical gauge , however , was operating fine
mission control told butch wilmore that he would need to pay extra attention to how his suit was feeling throughout the seven - hour excursion

the astronauts completed installing 400 feet of cable and several antennas associated with the common communications for visiting vehicles system known as c2v2 terry virts took a space selfie , moments after completing the job
he wrote on twitter : ' mission accomplished - three # spacewalks , 800 ' of cable , four antennas , three laser reflectors , one greased robotic arm ' the beautiful shot was taken on sunday during a spacewalk in which astronaut 's laid cables in preparation for future space taxis on the international space station terry virts wrote : ' the camera does n't do it justice - floating in space , looking down on creation , seeing new colour shades ' meanwhile , nasa said a small amount of water got into us astronaut terry virts helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurised on wednesday
they were forced to spend two days analysing his suit after the water leak occurred at the end of an outing earlier this week
engineers concluded it was the result of condensation , and a safe and well understood circumstance that had occurred several times before with the same spacesuit
terry virts was never in danger , according to nasa , so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks , friday , to install cable
but in 2013 , another astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet
italian astronaut , luca parmitano , barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk
the water escaped from his suit 's cooling system and nasa spent months investigating the mishap , before clearing the way for more spacewalks
on wednesday , the amount of water seepage in virts ' helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when terry virts was already inside
' they 're very different occurrences , ' said alex kanelakos , a spacewalk officer in mission control
the advance work , involving nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks was carried out to create new crew capsules commissioned by nasa
the work , done by us astronauts virts and wilmore , meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed , as well as two antennas installed on sunday
a pair of docking ports will fly up later this year , followed by the capsules themselves , with astronauts aboard , in 2017

nasa has n't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days , and the amount of cable work is unprecedented construction of the international space station began on 20 november 1998
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house
it completes an orbit of earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of earth , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years
the astronauts successfully routed 364 feet on their first two excursions , on february 21 and last wednesday
they carried out complicated work sunday , yet the astronauts completed their task an hour early making it a five and a half - hour spacewalk
they spent 20 hours altogether on three outings
neither virts nor butch wilmore experienced any more suit trouble during their task
mission control joked by radio : ' you guys have done an outstanding job even for two shuttle pilots
' the 260 - mile ( 418 - kilometre ) spacewalk unfolded 50 years to the month of the world 's first spacewalk by soviet cosmonaut alexei leonov on march 18 , 1965
nasa has n't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days , and the amount of cable work is unprecedented
even more spacewalks will be needed once new docking ports start arriving in june
butch wilmore is due to return to earth next week following a five and a half - month mission
virts is midway through his expedition
a russian soyuz spacecraft carried them both up , with nasa paying for the multimillion dollar tickets
to save money and stop being so reliant on the russian space agency , nasa has hired boeing and spacex to develop spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the space station
the two contracts are worth nearly $ 7 billion
spacex already is delivering cargo under a separate agreement with nasa
