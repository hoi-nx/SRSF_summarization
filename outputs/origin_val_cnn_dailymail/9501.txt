girls are being over-praised and given higher marks at school for their good behaviour â not for their ability â according to a major study girls are being over-praised and given higher marks at school for their good behaviour â not for their ability â according to a major study
and this is making life more difficult for them when they enter the jobs market , where rewards are primarily based on what they know , says the organisation for economic co-operation and development
it said girls are much more likely than boys to be model pupils
their diligence and obedience in the classroom is often â rewarded â with higher marks , while many boys are â punished â with poor marks for being disruptive
it may mean marks reflect good or bad attitudes to studying , but not necessarily aptitude
the organisation for economic co-operation and development warned that girls who may do better in the short run at school could be â penalised â in the labour market later on
it called on teachers to review their own â gender biases â and consider whether marking girls up was really helping them
andreas schleicher , the organisation for economic co-operation and development âs director for education and skills , said that even when girls and boys do similarly well in reading and maths tests , girls get better marks
teenagers with a strong belief in their abilities are more likely to be successful in uk than in any other country , the study also showed
those youngsters who were self confident scored higher in maths and science tests , according to analysis by the organisation for economic co-operation and development
and although the pattern is replicated across the world , the effect is more marked in the uk compared to any other country
meanwhile the research also showed that even though girls outperform boys overall in schools , they are still lagging behing when it comes to maths and science
the report warned : ' what emerges from these anayses is particularly worrying
' even many high - achieving girls have low levels of confidnece in their ability to solve science and mathematics problems and express high levels of anxiety towards mathematics
' â maybe in the short run , you get a better school certificate , â he said
â in the long run , the world is going to penalise you because the labour market does nât pay you for your school marks , it pays you for what you can do
â teachers consistently give better results to girls than boys , even when they perform similarly in the international pisa tests , which are run by the organisation for economic co-operation and development
the study , based on data from tests taken by 15 - year - olds in maths , reading and science , looked at gender differences in education
it said : â girls â better marks may reflect that they tend to be â better students â than boys : they tend to do what is expected of them , thanks to better self - regulation skills , and they are more driven to excel in school
â children who play computer games regularly do better than their peers at school , the organisation for economic co-operation and development research also suggests
it found that those who played one - player games in moderation performed better in core subjects than those who never played
it said many games â incorporate good learning principles â and â hone problem - solving skills â
girls who may do better in the short run at school could be â penalised â in the labour market later on , a study has found ( file picture )
