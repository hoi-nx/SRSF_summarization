mystery surrounds the legacy of cubs ' legend banks who apparently only left $ 16,000 worth of assets when he died in january aged 83
the news emerged as the star player 's estranged fourth wife elizabeth banks and glamorous caretaker regina rice pursue a bitter court battle to seize the estate
rice has been accused of coercing the baseball great into signing a will that left everything to her , without his family 's knowledge
meanwhile , the cubs has agreed to settle the allegedly unpaid bill - totalling $ 35,000 - for banks ' burial service after a funeral home sued the family for all costs plus legal fees
missing millions ? banks , one of the greats of baseball , reportedly only left $ 16,000 when he died at 83 bitter battle : his widow elizabeth banks ( left ) and his caregiver regina rice ( right ) are fighting for the estate and rice maintains that banks had wanted to be cremated , with his ashes scattered over wrigley field
lawyers for banks ' widow , elizabeth , have called for a review of the player 's accounts including vehicles and baseball memorabilia after rice 's lawyers estimated him to be worth $ 16,000
last month , cook county court heard banks was never paid more than $ 75,000 a year throughout his lengthy and high - flying career
however , rice 's attorney linda chatman said the estimate was just preliminary , and she noted that the true value of the estate was in the rights to his name and likeness
that means that the estate could be worth far more , given banks ' place in the history of major league baseball and in chicago , where he was a beloved sports figure for his 19 years on the field and decades after
rice has been barred from selling anything that belonged to banks as his widow and two sons contest the latest will
heightening tensions , a law suit filed this week by donnellan family funeral services claims the banks family did not pay $ 11,000 for the cost of the casket , $ 6,755 for flowers , more than $ 3,000 in car services and $ 2,700 in staff fees
' i find it quite interesting that she did not tell anyone that she had an attorney write up a new will , ' one of banks ' twin sons , jerry banks , said
a court heard banks was never paid more than $ 75,000 a year for his lengthy and stellar career with the cubs rice responded in a statement that banks trusted her to carry out his wishes , some of which were during his lifetime and others after his life , and made her promise to adhere to them
joey banks said the family thought rice was helping and watching over ' mr banks ' while he was in chicago
family attorney bogen said that only after the funeral did the banks family became aware he had signed a new will during his illness
a provision of the will , signed and dated on october 17 , said : ' i am making no provisions under this will for wife or my children , not for a lack of love and affection for them and for reasons best known to them
' bogen said the family will vigorously fight the will
' it is understandable that banks 's family is concerned at this very sad time , ' rice said in her statement
' however , the record , and those closest to banks , will dispel any iota of concern regarding my relationship with banks and his trust in me to carry out his wishes
' contention : banks ' twin sons , joey and jerry banks , pictured at their father 's memorial service , are also contending the will that leaves the estate to rice
they accuse rice of coercing banks to sign the document rice went on to say she will not participate in any verbal jousting with banks ' family or do anything to tarnish his legacy
before banks ' death , family members frequently spoke to rice because she made it difficult for them to speak directly to him , jerry banks said
' at the funeral of my father , i went out of my way to praise ms regina rice and her son for helping my father , ' joey banks said
' what i did not know at that time is that for at least six months prior to my father 's death , in my opinion , she was using him , manipulating him and controlled him
' the brothers ' comments were their first in a dispute that first centered on what should be done with banks ' remains
estranged wife elizabeth banks went to court to prevent rice from having banks ' remains cremated
rice wanted banks ' remains to be cremated after his death last month at the age of 83 , according to documents filed by elizabeth banks ' attorneys on february 2
he was buried later last month at graceland cemetery .
