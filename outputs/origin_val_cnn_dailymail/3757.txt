we think it provides them with a warm and cosy sanctuary â but apparently horses hate being saddled with stables
the beasts find them a miserable and stressful experience , research reveals
as a herd animal , horses prefer to be in groups and stables prevent them interacting with their neighbours , according to a study by nottingham trent university
stable condition : scientists found the animals â stress levels - measured by the hormone corticosterone - rose and they became difficult to manage as they became increasingly isolated scientists found animals that were isolated had higher levels of stress hormones and became difficult to manage
the findings , published in the journal physiology , showed that horses are at their happiest in a paddock

these stress levels could also lead to sickness and disease , the study published in the journal physiology and behaviour found
research : the study by nottingham trent university ( above ) found that as a herd animal , horses prefer to be in groups and stables prevent them interacting with their neighbours equine welfare expert kelly yarnell told the daily telegraph : â to the human eye , the stable appears safe and inviting and is based on the belief of what the horse finds comfortable
â however , for a social animal that spends most of its time in close contact with other horses , the isolation brought about by single housing could activate an equine stress response
â she said equine welfare would be improved by shared housing
in the wild , horses live in herds that move over up to 30 sq miles while domestic horses often spend most of the day inside
lee hackett , director of equine policy at the british horse society , said the study should change the way we keep horses
he said : â it is fairly obvious that keeping any animal in a domestic setting could potentially compromise it , whether that be a hamster in a cage or a lion in a zoo
