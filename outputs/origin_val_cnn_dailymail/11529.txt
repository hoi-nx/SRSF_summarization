humans , sea lions and seals alike are sharing in the bounty of the columbia river
flying over the desdemona sands during a telemetry survey , the washington department of fish and wildlife caught a photo of what looked like fish washed up at low tide
but it was actually more than 6,400 regionally based harbor seals
it 's not unusual , wdfw biologist steve jeffriessaid , to see 4,000 to 5,000 of them hauled out on desdemona , between the astoria and hammond in the columbia river , a fraction of the 15,000 regional population from netarts north to grays river , washington
' they 've been moving seasonally into the columbia river in response to smelt runs forever , ' he said
during a feb. 11 aerial survey , the washington department of fish and wildlife counted more than 1,200 california sea lions at the mooring basin , along with nearly 600 steller and california sea lions on the south jetty all - time high : the odfw agency counted 2,340 california sea lions at the mooring basin mooring basin during a feb. 11 aerial survey , wdfw also counted more than 1,200 california sea lions at the east end mooring basin , along with nearly 600 steller and california sea lions on the south jetty
on friday , spokeswoman sall of the odfw said , her agency counted 2,340 california sea lions at the east end mooring basin
increasing numbers of pinnipeds , driven by starvation in california to the healthy smelt and salmon runs in the columbia river , have put a strain on the astoria 's infrastructure and created enmity between fishers , conservationists and fishery agencies
in 2010 , pacific smelt , known as eulachon , were marked threatened under the federal endangered species act
the past two years have marked the first time since the designation that they 've been allowed for commercial and recreational harvest
fisheries managers estimated 200 million smelt returning to the columbia river in 2014 and a similarly strong run this year
and sea lions reserved their spot at the dinner table
their seats are largely at the astoria 's east end mooring basin , which has two docks for boats , and two unofficially for sea lions , that also cover the rock breakwaters surrounding the marina
fisheries agencies counted 1,256 california sea lions there feb. 11 ; 1,649 feb. 20 ; 1,211 march 2 ; and 2,340 on friday , which sall said was an all - time high
' i think that will be telling once the smelt run is done , how many sea lions leave , ' sall said
' they 're already tapering off
' beating them back : orange ribbon is shown placed along a dock of the east end mooring basin in astoria , oregon
the port of astoria has successfully used the ribbon to deter sea lions from jumping onto the dock but even when the smelt are gone , an estimated 312,600 adult spring chinook salmon are expected to provide a continuing food source
a noaa report in october showed a decrease in chinook salmon survival from 90 percent in 2010 to 55 percent in 2014
it compared the decrease in survival with a more than 670 percent increase in sea lion populations counted by odfw in astoria between march 15 and may 15 over the same years
amid the issues of sea lion predation , the astoria has maintained it only wants to keep sea lions from damaging its docks , estimating more than $ 100,000 in damage to utilities and the docks themselves from sea lions
it has removed docks , disconnected utilities from the two that the sea lions inhabit and strung brightly colored surveying tape , which has effectively dissuaded the animals from jumping onto the two docks with boats still tied to them
' there 's a public health issue , ' said permit and project manager evert about fecal coliform in the water and the mounds of feces with the ringworm fungus that astoria staff clean up off docks
the astoria has looked into galvanized steel railings â for years now â to keep sea lions from jumping up on docks
there is 5,000 feet to cover on the astoria 's three docks at the basin , operations manager matt mcgrath said at a march 17 port commission meeting
the railings have worked in san diego , but would cost $ 50,000
evert added the astoria will be meeting with smith - root fisheries technology next week , which creates a low - voltage matting for docks that is uncomfortable for sea lions
starving : increasing numbers of pinnipeds , driven by starvation in california to the healthy smelt and salmon runs in the columbia river , have put a strain on the astoria 's infrastructure and created enmity between fishers , conservationists and fishery agencies
for several years , the sea lion defense brigade has kept a regular presence at the basin , monitoring odfw 's trapping and branding and reporting on its facebook page
members snap photos of visitors who drop by to see sea lions and regularly attend astoria meetings to testify on behalf of pinnipeds
' i want to talk about sharing on the second biggest river in north america , ' ninette jones , brigade member , told the port commission march 17 , after being told she could n't comment a second time on sea lions
brigade members see sea lions as a scapegoat for larger issues , such as pollution , climate change , overfishing and thousands of miles of blocked fish passages
they 've claimed that sea shepherd conservation society once offered to pay for a sea lion haul - out , although the astoria has previously denied being offered funding
regardless of whether they 're hauling out on astoria docks or their own haul - out , evert said , letting them on docks is akin to domesticating a wild animal
the astoria started shutting down the causeway to the east end mooring basin when odfw is trapping and branding sea lions to track them , a practice authorized in 2012 by noaa and not as deadly as the euthanizations at bonneville dam , but nonetheless controversial
tensions over the practice came to a near boiling point feb. 18 , according to odfw
sall said a visitor to the basin had been approached by a branding protester
the visitor then approached and harassed the odfw employee , she said , before threatening to grab a shotgun and shoot her
sall said odfw reported the incident to the oregon state police , which could n't be reached for comment by press time
