kenny mcdowall would welcome ally mccoist back into the rangers dug - out were he to make a surprise return from gardening leave
the question of who leads the squad for the remainder of a flagging promotion campaign is high on the agenda for dave king and the new ibrox directors
kenny mcdowall became caretaker manager when ally mccoist left under the previous regime before christmas , but began working his own notice period in january
kenny mcdowall and ally mccoist ( right ) worked together before the latter left rangers on gardening leave interim chairman paul murray has stated that new board â which has already been approached by number of managerial candidates as they weigh up a longer - term appointment â will have to speak to both men to â ask what they want to do â given that they remain employees
a financial agreement over ally mccoist âs remaining contract may well be the more likely outcome , but kenny mcdowall would be happy to see his old colleague back for the championship run - in were that to transpire
â i was working with ally , so obviously that would appeal to me , â said kenny mcdowall
â but it âs a difficult one to answer because the board will obviously have their own ideas
â kenny mcdowall said it was n't for him to decide but that he would welcome walter back to the club too another former ibrox boss , walter , refused at the weekend to completely rule out what would be a third stint in charge , but stressed that he was nât looking for it â in any way , shape or form
â kenny mcdowall was first - team coach during walter âs hugely successful second spell and admitted his presence would provide a guaranteed boost
â it âs not for me to decide , â said kenny mcdowall , who is keen for coach ian durrant to return to first - team duties after being demoted by the old board
â it âs for walter to discuss with the board , if that âs the case
â but walter going anywhere would absolutely give the place a lift
he is a great man and has done so much in the game
why would you not , at the end of the day ? but , as i say , it âs not my call
ally mccoist left the ibrox club before christmas on gardening leave and stuart mccall later did the same â we had a very successful time when he was here but times are different
it âs been a tough , tough time we âve had since he left
â ally did a fantastic job without getting a whole lot of credit
but that will come eventually
â the new directors are likely to speak with kenny mcdowall about his own future once tonight âs game against queen of the south is out of the way
they met yesterday with former fulham boss felix magath , who is a rangers shareholder and has ideas on how the footballing department could move forward
but he is not thought to be an immediate candidate to replace kenny mcdowall
felix magath is not thought to be an immediate candidate to replace kenny mcdowall despite a meeting with the club â every day , there is someone else being quoted â walter , felix magath , billy davies , stuart mccall , terry butcher , â said kenny mcdowall
â all of those guys are out there and it âs the board âs right to talk to whoever they want
it does nât really affect me , because talk about replacing me has been there since i took the job as caretaker manager
â i âm here and ready to meet the new board whenever they want to meet me
i âm working my notice
if they want to keep me , they can keep me
if they want me to go then i âll go
â there is nothing tricky about it
i âm here and i âm doing my best to try and get the team through a difficult period
