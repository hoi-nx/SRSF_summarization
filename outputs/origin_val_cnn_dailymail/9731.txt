professional ski and mountain bike photogragher reuben krabbe , 24 , said : ' we all wanted to make the trip happen , and tobin seagel and i had talked about trying to capture the single photograph of the northern lights and a skier
' we spent a total of six days on the slopes , from leaving our truck to arriving back at it
' the moment was very unusual and mesmerising
' it was difficult to concentrate on a specific task when such a beautiful thing is happening above you
' the photographer has been skiing since his parents taught him at the age of four , and it has since become a massive part of his life

the mysterious show also occurs in the southern hemisphere , the aurora australis , its main audience being the penguins
