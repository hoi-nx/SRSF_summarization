a plan to keep david cameron as conservatives leader even if he loses the election to ed miliband , is being drawn up by senior allies
cabinet colleagues , including george osborne and michael gove , will attempt to form a protective ring around mr david cameron if he falls short in may â provided mr ed miliband does not secure a decisive victory
they believe that continuity at the top will be essential if there is a prospect of a second general election
senior tories have hatched a plan to keep david cameron as conservatives leader even if he loses the election to ed miliband conservatives high command is even preparing to declare a â moral victory â if â as some polls suggest - mr david cameron secures more votes than labour but emerges with fewer seats
mr david cameron will come under intense pressure to step down if he loses to mr ed miliband , who many tories rate as the worst labour leader since michael foot
the last leader of a major party to cling on after defeat was neil kinnock in 1987
one conservatives mp said mr david cameron â wo nât last five minutes â unless he manages to retain the keys to downing street in may
â he either wins , or he goes , â the mp said
â he has said himself that if he ca nât beat ed miliband he does nât deserve to be in this game , and he âs right
â but some senior ministers believe mr david cameron should stay on if mr ed miliband is only able to cobble together a fragile coalition
in this scenario , they fear the party could be plunged into a destabilising leadership battle in the run - up to a second election that could take place as early as the autumn
chancellor george osborne ( left ) will attempt to form a protective ring around mr david cameron if he falls short in may â provided ed miliband ( right ) does not secure a decisive victor mr george osborne is reported to have held talks with conservatives whips last week to draw up a â save dave â strategy for protecting mr david cameron from an internal challenge , although a source close to the chancellor insisted the conservatives were still â playing to win â
current polls suggest that neither labour nor the conservatives will secure an outright majority in may â raising the prospect of either another coalition or a period of minority government
senior tories are urging mr david cameron to govern alone if the conservatives emerge as the largest party but do not have an overall majority
they argue that ditching the lib dems would allow the party to govern properly , and free up 23 ministerial jobs to aid party management
one david cameron ally said : â if there is an opportunity to govern without going into coalition , we would seize it
