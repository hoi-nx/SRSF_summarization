the new tips from former smokers ad by the cdc highlights two smoking - related conditions macular degeneration , a blinding eye disease , and colorectal cancer
the campaign which originally launched in 2012 will begin running on march 30 featuring five former smokers in a bid to stop people from smoking
marlene , 68 , started smoking when she was 15 years old and now has to have treatments involving shots to her eyeballs marlene , 68 , of new york began smoking in high school when she was 15 , and started losing her vision due to macular degeneration when she was 56 years old
' please do n't end up like me
do n't sit in a doctor 's chair , have a clamp put on your eye , and have needles stuck in your eyeballs
it 's horrible , ' marlene told nbc
apart from quitting smoking , her best chance to slow down her vision loss is a drug that has to be injected through a needle into her eyes
marlene must get the shots every month which is a stomach - churning process to watch in the video , the stomach - churning treatment she undergoes every month is revealed just before the needle goes into her eye
so far , she has had more than 100 shots in each eye
' this will probably go on for the rest of my life , ' she said
' if i 'd had a crystal ball many years ago , i would never have put that first cigarette in my mouth
' she added : ' i want to see the sun. i want to see the water
i 'm so sorry that i started smoking
' the new tips from former smokers ad by the cdc highlights colon cancer , which julia suffers from the campaign also features former smokers mark , 47 , of california an air force veteran who developed rectal cancer when he was 42
he also has to use an ostomy bag
julia , 58 , of mississippi smoked for more than 20 years before she developed colon cancer at 49 years old and requires an ostomy bag , while kristy , 35 , of tennesee smoked until her lung collapsed and was later diagnosed with early copd , a lung disease

mark , 47 , an air force veteran who developed rectal cancer when he was 42 and is required to use an ostomy bag tiffany , 35 , whose mother died from lung cancer when she was 16 , decided to stop smoking when her own daughter turned 16 years old
smoking is the leading cause of preventable illness and death in the americans
it 's responsible for the majority of the nation 's lung cancer deaths and is a deadly factor in heart attacks and a variety of other illnesses
in 2012 , the agency 's $ 54 million campaign was its first and largest national advertising effort
the government deemed it a success : that campaign triggered an increase of 200,000 calls to quit lines
the cdc believes that likely prompted tens of thousands of smokers to quit based on calculations that a certain percentage of callers do actually stop
like last year , the 20 - week campaign spotlights real people who were hurt and disfigured by smoking
she made the decision so that she could be around for the important milestones of her daughter 's life
her ad will run as a public service announcement
' all the tips ad participants are heroes , ' said dr. tim mcafee , director of cdc 's office on smoking and health
' by courageously sharing their painful personal stories , they 're inspiring millions of americans to make the life - saving decision to quit smoking
' the cdc said its campaign has helped prompt millions of smokers to try to quit , and that in 2014 when ads were on air , nearly 80 per cent more contacted the national quitline , 1 - 800 - quit - now
the campaign in 2013 featured terrie , a north carolina woman who lost her voice box , and later died from throat and oral cancer
' over a million and a half smokers made a quit attempt because of our 12 week campaign â just a 12 - week campaign created this effect , ' mcafee told nbc
' over a hundred thousand people quit successfully and permanently because of the campaign
' kristy , 35 , smoked cigarettes until her lung collapsed and was diagnosed with early copd , a lung disease
