changes to pension rules could result in a flood of spam texts and calls from fraudsters to savers , the privacy watchdog warned last night
the ico warned that pension scams could be the ' next ppi ' with rogue firms bombarding the public with messages in an effort to get them to sign up to dubious schemes
yesterday pensions minister steve webb , architect of the reforms , said anyone cold called by a firm offering them a free pensions review should ' put the phone down '
there is already growing evidence that scammers are gearing up for the april 6 pension ' liberation day ' in three weeks britain will undergo a pensions revolution allowing older workers to cash in their pension pots and spend the money as they wish , rather than having to buy an annuity ' you can spend years saving into a pension only to find yourself tricked out of your money in the blink of an eye , ' he warned
in three weeks britain will undergo a pensions revolution allowing older workers to cash in their pension pots and spend the money as they wish , rather than having to buy an annuity
but the ico fears it could be a bonanza for sharks and ' snake oil salesmen ' targeting older people with texts and cold calls to try to get their hands on their pension pots
anyone who hands over their investment as a result of scam messages could be left penniless â and still facing a huge tax bill
criminals are urging pension savers to invest in scams ranging from dubious wealth funds to overseas homes that do not even exist
there is already growing evidence that scammers are gearing up for the april 6 pension ' liberation day '
tricks include luring pensioners with the promise of impartial advice
the number of spam calls and texts related to pensions reported to the watchdog rose by 66 per cent in february
pensions minister mr steve webb has in recent months admitted he himself was cold called and sent spam texts about pensions
yesterday pensions minister steve webb , architect of the reforms , said anyone cold called by a firm offering them a free pensions review should ' put the phone down ' last month he told a conference he had received a text saying : ' if you have a frozen pension prior to 55 you are entitled to a free review
' yesterday the ico served a legal notice on a company in swansea , uk , for sending nearly 190,000 spam texts including many thousands about pensions
one message said : ' as you have over 10k in your pension , your pension has lost Â£ 3,219.43 over the last few years , to get back & find out your payout reply review
' the message was identified by the ico as being both deeply misleading and sent to those who had not signed up for direct marketing , as the law requires
they fear claims farmers are using the promise of free advice or a windfall investment to gather thousands of pensioner details to sell on in the wake of the reforms
the ico said help direct uk told a ' web of lies ' about how it obtained the recipients ' contact details
the enforcement notice requires the firm to stop its activities or it could face court action
new rules which come into force on the same day as the pensions reforms will allow the ico to impose fines of up to half a million pounds on cold call and nuisance text firms
andy curry of the ico said : ' there is clearly the potential for a huge spike in the number of these scam texts and calls
it has the potential to be the next ppi
' the pensions regulator added its voice to the warnings
chief executive lesley titcomb said : ' the people behind pension scams are often agile , sophisticated and organised
we expect the scams to continue to evolve
' martin wheatley , chief executive of another regulator , the financial conduct authority , said he was seeing an ' accelerating trend ' in activity by fraudsters
the reforms were widely welcomed last year as a response to concerns that annuities had become poor value for money
retirement pots can be used like a bank account , with many restrictions abolished
there have been concerns , however , that some pensioners might squander their savings on cars or holidays
how crooks will target you promised pension freedoms herald a bright new dawn for millions of savers
unfortunately , they will also act as a clarion call for crooks to target millions of pounds about to be unlocked by the trusting and the unwary
the danger lies in scammers ' ability to contact you by phone , text or email â and their persistence to wear you down
their first approach is usually the most enticing
a text might typically offer a ' free pension review ' , ' one - off investment opportunity ' or promise of ' upfront cash '
but the minute you respond to the cold - caller , they 'll begin to crank up the pressure
their prize is your pension pot â and they need you to agree to sign a funds transfer form to get their hands on it
so the promises will come thick and fast
they might suggest juicy returns of 8 per cent or more , talk authoritatively about locking away cash in overseas investments or dangle cashback payments
to soothe fears , they may also claim to be a government adviser or say they 've been endorsed by officials
and while there will be talk of you , at 55 , having plenty of time to lock your money away , there will be no mention of the imminent tax bill you 'll need to pay
the fee they 'll charge , perhaps as high as 30 per cent , will be glossed over
it might take a dozen or so emails and phone calls â or even ten times that â but once you 're hooked , they 'll then push you to sign a transfer form as soon as possible
this may be sent to you by email as a form to fill in online or even couriered over to your front door
you 'll be convinced it 's a simple final matter of filling in the details of your existing pension scheme â usually its name and number
legally , your original pension provider â usually an insurer â can only agree to transfer the money on the condition it will go straight to another registered pension plan.however , the scammers â acting as the broker â do no such thing
they 'll take the money and then release only a chunk of it to you as a loan or cash sum
and once your funds are released from your insurer and into a new account â often overseas and outside uk jurisdiction or the arm of the regulator â then your chances of ever seeing the cash again will vanish
you may find the scammer picks up the phone the first time you call to check up on your investment â but they wo n't be there the next time
as well as the hefty fee , hmrc will then slap you with a tax charge of up to 55 per cent because you 've taken out an ' unauthorised payment ' from your pension
always check the credentials of the company and any advisers , who should be registered with the financial conduct authority at fca.org.uk
