the formation of such a force is not a cause for concern according to former sas soldier andy mcnab who described the footage as a ' very funny ' pr film
the man who uses the name as a pseudonym to protect his identity told mailonline : ' just looking at the guys as they handle weapons ... it is clear that not even regular soldiers have much to worry about from these guys

' previous footage from islamic state 's training camps believed to be in iraqi showed recruits disguised as bushes
other drills involved the extremists performing unnecessary forward rolls over mounds which would leave them far more exposed to enemy fire than keeping low with a commando crawl
while in some scenes , the recruits have a crack at martial arts by taking it turns to smash wall tiles over their own heads
