speaking in a video interview with kjersti flaa for tv2 about criticism that christian âs treatment of her character is abusive , dakota johnson , who plays christian grey , said : ' i think that is an uneducated opinion
' maybe because i know more about the bdsm world , so it makes sense to me , but everything that these characters do , they make the decision to do it
the national center on sexual exploitation launched a campaign titled fifty shades is abuse , which urged people to donate to local women 's shelters instead of buying movie tickets
in london , feminist campaigners , fifty shades is domestic abuse , said the novel dangerously romanticises the idea that women can fix broken men
dakota , left , with jamie dornan in the film , and , right , at the academy awards , said : ' maybe because i know more about the bdsm world , so it makes sense to me , but everything that these characters do , they make the decision to do it ' a handful of men and women stood outside the central london premiere in leicester square when it was released on valentine 's day , unfurling a banner calling christian grey ' a rapist ' as stars made their way along the red carpet
defending the film , she added : ' christian does nât abuse ana
she âs not a victim
she âs not a sad , weak - minded , passive person
' she âs strong and confident and is exploring her body and her sexuality in a private environment with somebody that she loves
and , you know , it âs a movie
' ahead of the release of the controversial film , activists called on the public to consider whether they should endorse the movie
defending the film , dakota added : ' christian does n't abuse ana
she 's not a victim
she âs not a sad , weak - minded , passive person ' in london , feminist campaigners , fifty shades is domestic abuse , said the novel dangerously romanticises the idea that women can fix broken men and protested at the premier collins , who runs campaign group fifty shades is domestic abuse , said the story portrays an abusive relationship
she said that if readers consider christian grey 's behaviour out of context , it would appear extremely alarming rather than alluring
she said : ' is it romantic when somebody tracks your phone , when somebody knows where you live before you tell them , sells your only means of transport , or buys the company you work for ? ' how can you marry that with being romantic ? ' ms collins , who is a consultant working to end the abuse of women , said that after reading all three books , she was left ' deeply concerned about the amount of domestic violence that was being romanticised and celebrated '
she added : ' the thing that i would say to people who are reading the books , who are going to see it , is , if he was n't rich and very attractive , would this behaviour be normal ? ' domestic violence campaigners in america and the uk called for a boycott of the film when it was released last month because they believed it ' glorified ' and ' romanticised ' abuse against women the books , written by el james , follow the sado - masochistic sexual relationship between the two protagonists , seattle billionaire christian grey and demure student christian grey
ms collins said the campaign group were not against the sexual nature of the book but there were other far more worrying themes in the novel ' we are not against bdsm ( bondage , discipline , sadism and masochism ) , it is the other issues in the books and films which we say glamorise domestic violence
' i have spoken to people who have said that he ( christian grey ) was abused as a child and that is why he is the way he is
' it is also very dangerous to suggest that people abuse because of their childhood and that women can fix broken men with enough love
