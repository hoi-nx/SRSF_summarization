lululemon athletica inc. is hoping to boost sales among men with a new genital - friendly range of pants
lululemon athletica inc. told bloomberg on thursday that its abc pants - referring to their ' anti-ball crushing ' design - have given the company a 16 per cent sales hike in the men 's sector of the business last quarter
the canada - based company 's website describes the pants as ' abc ( anti-ball crushing ) engineering gives you and the family jewels room to breathe '
' the vancouver - based company made its mark on the sports retail market with yoga clothing consumers were divided over the abcs
one man wrote : ' despite the waist , the fabric is amazing however the legs were so tight and the fabric so thin
if i wore these out everyone would know what underwear i have on by being able to see the lines , that 's how tight the thighs are
' but a happy customer posted : ' i love these pants
i wear them as casual , for work ( i am a financial advisor ) and i wore them to yoga once just to see how flexible they are and they were excellent
' they are great as travel pants , very comfortable on the plane or driving the car
' another added : ' got the grey initially and was pretty satisfied
i would say there was reduced ball crushing , but they are still pretty snug in the thighs and crotch
' the company , which is headquartered in vancouver , british columbia , offers a range of athletic wear for men along with smarter clothing
there are ' sweat , post-sweat and no sweat categories '
the athletic brand , set up by dennis ' chip ' wilson in vancouver in 1998 , opened its first men 's store in the soho neighborhood of manhattan on black friday last year
and the company is taking advantage of a boost in sales from men 's attire and expanding the ranges in stores
according to the company 's 2013 annual report , lululemon athletica inc. had 211 locations
however despite the launch of the abc pants , shares in lululemon athletica inc. slumped almost 6 per cent on thursday
even though the company raised its expectations for 2015 , wall street has been looking for even more and its first - quarter outlook disappointed as well
lululemon athletica inc. earned $ 110.9 million , or 78 cents per share , for the period ended february 1
that compares with $ 109.7 million , or 75 cents per share , a year earlier
sales at stores open for at least a year climbed 5 per cent in the quarter , but declined 1 per cent for the year
for the year , the canada company reported an adjusted profit of $ 1.89 per share on revenue of $ 1.8 billion
shares of lululemon athletica inc. fell $ 3.38 to $ 57.58 before the market had opened
chip wilson , the founder of lululemon athletica inc. , stepped down from the company board last month
he had resigned as chairman last year after controversy about comments he made about customers ' body types
in march 2013 , the retailer had to issue a massive recall of its black yoga pants after women discovered they were transparent
the recall , of around 17 per cent of pants sold , had a financial impact on the company .
