even if all it amounts to is a handful of visits to england 's training camp to spend a few hours observing the players and offering some pointers , the prospect of wilkinson being involved with the national team is an enticing one
nothing is certain at this stage , but it is not out of the question that the iconic fly - half will agree to give his input as lancaster 's squad prepare for the world cup
if the 35 - year - old hero of the 2003 triumph does take on a role of sorts â and that would appear to be a big if â it would n't be as a coach and it might not even amount to a consultancy , certainly not on a regular basis
wilkinson could lend his expertise to england 's 2015 world cup preperations wilkinson , who was a fly - half , kicked the winning drop goal to lead england to world cup glory in 2003 wilkinson has been getting involved with rugby coaching and could aid england 's world cup preparations england coach lancaster would not ignore the opportunity to use wilkinson 's know - how but most england supporters would settle for wilkinson popping into the hq in surrey on his way to the supermarket , if there was any chance of some of that stardust and winner 's mentality rubbing off on the class of 2015
it is all about the aura
here is a man who was once the nation 's sporting darling , while in rugby circles he is treated with a mixture of respect and awe
in the south of france , where he worked wonders for toulon in the closing years of his career , he is adored
when false rumours surfaced at the start of the year that he was destined for a knighthood , they were assumed to be correct
such an honour would have surprised no one
the current generation of england players grew up admiring his epic deeds
the fly - halves in particular â george ford , owen farrell and danny cipriani â could learn so much from the maestro
lancaster has an established coaching group and there are no plans to expand it , for now
at present , mike catt works with the kickers in camp , while another rfu coach , jon callard , has also spent time with them , though less so recently
ford has private sessions with wilkinson 's kicking mentor , the renowned dave alred , who has not had a role in the national set - up since the last world cup
but any chance to tap into the know - how of one of the country 's all - time greats , with his legendary work ethic and meticulous approach , would not be casually ignored by lancaster
wilkinson has spoken of his interest in the option of working as a specialist coach or tutor , and has done so part - time with toulon this season
wilkinson ( centre ) is revered in toulon , where he spent the final years of his career as a player lancaster already has one 2003 world cup winner in his coaching ranks in mike catt ( centre ) wilkinson 's input could help england 's current fly - halfs such as george ford danny cipriani ( left ) and owen farrell are england 's other alternatives at fly - half for all his personal accomplishments , he is wise enough to accept that playing pedigree does not necessarily translate into coaching credentials
talking last autumn , after being invited into england 's camp , he said : ' if there is anything i can add , then we can have a little chat , but more importantly i need to learn my trade
i was a player , but just because i knew how to play does n't mean i 've earned the right to tell other people how to do it
' i 'm coaching one week every month in toulon , learning my way around it
i 'm coaching individual skills , mentoring some of the young guys on how to cope with the emotional and mental side of things
i 'm really enjoying it , but the biggest mistake you can make is thinking just because you played the game , you already know it
' as a recent retiree who keeps himself supremely fit , wilkinson could comfortably take on an active role , demonstrating the points he makes
in fact , it would not be a leap of the mind to imagine him matching england 's current kickers shot for shot in extended practice sessions
while there is scope to improve the kicking game , both at goal and tactical , wilkinson is a big admirer of the men currently country 's vying for his old shirt
wilkinson ( left ) acknowledges that success as a player offers no guarantees to becoming a skilled coach lancaster ( left ) and his england side narrowly missed out on rbs 6 nations glory on saturday wilkinson speaks highly of the abilities of england 's current fly - halfs , especially ford and owen farrell ' george ford is a fabulous player who produces some amazing touches and is an absolute natural in the way he reads the game , ' he said
' he works hard , wants to improve and as a young guy he is happy to take on responsibility and shows he can deal with it
that makes him a great person to have in that position
' owen farrell is immensely mentally tough and deserves a hell of a lot more credit than he has been getting for what he has done in the last few years
as a young guy , he has said , ' here is pressure , i will deal with it
not only that , i will kick your goals for you and stand up in defence and bring this team together '
' that talented pair would speak highly of their acclaimed predecessor too
it could be a perfect fit
england have the biggest representation on a 12 - strong list for the rbs 6 nations player of the tournament
jonathan joseph , george ford , ben youngs and billy vunipola feature alongside ireland 's paul o'connell , robbie henshaw and conor murray , welshmen alun wyn jones and dan biggar , scots stuart hogg and jonny gray , and italy captain sergio parisse .
