change of heart : washington post columnist jonathan capehart wrote a piece this week , criticizing the labeling of brown as a symbol of the black lives matter movement when brown was shot in the st louis , missouri suburb of ferguson last summer , like many other african - americans , jonathan capehart was incensed by the seemingly senseless death of another young black teen
but in a new column for the washington post , jonathan capehart says he no longer believes brown is an appropriate symbol for the renewed civil rights movement in the u.s. and that white police officer darren wilson was justified in the shooting
when brown was shot dead on august 9 , 2014 , early reports said he was holding his hands in the air , surrendering , and asking darren wilson not to shoot
in the mass outrage that swept through the predominantly - black community following his death , many used ' hands up , do n't shoot ' as a rallying cry
jonathan capehart says the release of federal investigations into the shooting , and the ferguson police department in general , this month have forced him to re-evaluate brown as a victim
the investigation revealed that brown had not in fact had his arms up when he was shot , based on witness testimonies and autopsy results
that story line mainly stems from brown 's friend dorian johnson , who was walking with him the day he was shot
in his interview with the press , dorian johnson 's details of the shooting continued to change
' the doj report notes on page 44 that dorian johnson â made multiple statements to the media immediately following the incident that spawned the popular narrative that darren wilson shot brown execution - style as he held up his hands in surrender " ' in one of those interviews , dorian johnson said that brown was shot in the back by darren wilson
it was then that dorian johnson said brown stopped , turned around with his hands up and said , â i do nât have a gun , stop shooting ! â and , like that , â hands up , do nât shoot â became the mantra of a movement
' but it was wrong , built on a lie , ' jonathan capehart wrote
new evidence : jonathan capehart said the new federal investigation results show that white police officer darren wilson ( right ) was justified in killing brown ( left ) ' based on a lie ' : in the aftermath of the shooting , brown 's friend and witness dorian johnson ( center ) , said his hands were up in surrender when he was shot
but those statements were refuted in the official investigation , which reported that brown was running towards darren wilson when he was shot based on the investigation 's damning results , jonathan capehart says brown is now an ' inappropriate symbol ' for the black lives matter movement
however , he says that the new information should not ' diminish the importance of the real issues ' sparked by his death
in fact , jonathan capehart said , the investigation into the ferguson police department showed law enforcement in the community had been blatantly ' trampling ' on the constitutional rights of residents who are mostly african american , which explains why the community ' exploded the moment brown was killed
' jonathan capehart said it 's ' imperative that we continue marching for and giving voice to those killed in racially charged incidents at the hands of police and others
' real issues : jonathan capehart says that though brown in an ' inappropriate symbol ' of the black lives matter movement , it should n't distract from the the very real issues that were sparked by his death ' but we must never allow ourselves to march under the banner of a false narrative on behalf of someone who would otherwise offend our sense of right and wrong
and when we discover that we have , we must acknowledge it , admit our error and keep on marching
that âs what i âve done here , ' jonathan capehart said
in the aftermath of the column , jonathan capehart elicited a slew of negative comments from readers on twitter , but he was also lauded by others for his bravery in reversing his opinion on the ferguson shooting
fox news anchor megyn kelly said on her show that she supported the column and jonathan capehart for being ' brave enough to admit he was wrong '
on twitter , jonathan capehart described the column as ' the hardest piece i 've ever had to write ' .
