unveiled with great and solemn self - importance , after a teaser shot of a pair of scissors and a comb on instagram , here is the essential haircut for 2015
cheryl â pop starlet turned x factor judge â yesterday revealed she has had her image - defining mane of long extensions snipped off
â long overdue ! â she sighed on twitter
we imagine people will be frantically calling up salons and asking for a new hairdo on a scale not seen since the nineties phenomenon that was ' the rachel ' ... but we would n't be surprised if the singer and x factor judge took such drastic action just so she could show off the back of this dress in all its glory ! she was filming for the graham norton show and even though her stylist anna hughes-chamberlain only gave us a sneak peak of the back of the dress , they do n't call us fashion finder for nothing you know ! a bit of investigative work revealed that this dress is by proenza schouler and we love the woven texture , high neck and button detailing
the front is super chic , but of course thanks to that cut out it 's even better from the back ! and the best news is that this dress is now hugely reduced at outnet , so click ( right ) to get your hands on it

considering that she is the face of beauty giant lâoreal , who pay her around Â£ 250,000 a year to promote their hair products , the restyle is a bold move
and you can bet that the new look will have an influence on the high street , as cheryl , now 31 , is idolised by thousands
they may not buy her albums ( her last release only managed to reach no. 7 in the charts before dropping back down ) , but they do buy her image
however , if imitation really is the sincerest form of flattery , then cheryl must have a serious crush herself â on one victoria beckham

whether it is a bob , a side - plait or a bun , it seems that cheryl likes to borrow , or revisit , looks from her style mentor
of course victoria beckham , now 40 , did it all first â from a career in a world - beating all - girl band to marriage to an england footballer
the two women were even friends once , particularly during the 2006 world cup football finals in germany , when cheryl travelled to watch her then fiance ashley and victoria beckham was there , too , with becks
however , relations between the two women became frosty after ashley was accused of cheating in 2008 , just two years after their wedding , and victoria beckham did nât even call
cheryl said she âd expected rather more from her fellow wag
in an interview in 2009 , cheryl said that victoria beckham âs clothes were for â older women â , and victoria beckham retaliated by saying that cheryl âs range of shoes for fashion website stylist pick were â just a pr stunt â

so what does cheryl âs new hair mean ? it seems to be a part of a complete make - under , embarked upon following her whirlwind second marriage to french restaurateur jean-bernard fernandez-versini in july last year , which has taken her from tanned , blonde wag to sophisticated fashionista â a path trodden by victoria beckham herself
cheryl has hired a new make - up artist and new stylist in order to embrace a more subtle , more high - fashion look
her new image was played to great effect during her much - heralded return as a judge on x factor last year , and sources close to the show indicate she will be asked to come back again this year â with a Â£ 1.5 million fee dangled as an incentive
but will she do so , though , with a baby on board ? some fans firmly believe cheryl is now pregnant , hence the less high - maintenance hair cut , and her relative lack of postings on twitter and instagram in recent weeks
if that âs true , she can look forward to a whole new range of copycat cuts â after all , there are four victoria beckham pregnancies to turn to
