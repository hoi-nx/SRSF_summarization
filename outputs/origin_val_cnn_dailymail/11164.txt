the fast bowler , fielding at mid on , had to back - pedal considerably but made up enough ground before diving and snaffling a two - handed catch a mere inches from the ground

umar akmal ( 13 ) was undone by the bounce of morne morkel , top - edging to mid-wicket , to restrict pakistan for 175 for five before rain delayed play for half an hour or so

shahid afridi edged steyn to deep - backward square - leg to depart for 22 in the 42nd over and , three balls later , they were seven down when wahab was pinned leg before by imran

pakistan wicketkeeper ahmed picked up his and pakistan 's third dismissal in the very next over when wahab forced hashim amla into a leading edge to depart for 38 from 27 deliveries
wahab accounted for rossouw ( six ) in the 13th over to leave south africa four down with just 74 runs on the board and things went from bad to worse when they lost david miller ( nought ) moments later

de villiers celebrated his half - century after claiming his third maximum from 45 balls which also included four boundaries as he continued battling on with some big hits before kyle abbott ( 12 ) was caught by younus at second slip off ali as south africa continued to collapse
khan finally claimed the big wicket of de villiers for 77 in the 33rd over after he was caught behind by ahmed and imran soon followed to leave his side with 202 and handing pakistan a 29 - run victory .
