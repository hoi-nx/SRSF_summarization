the u.s. army has begun the process of destroying the nation 's last supplies of chemical weapons which are contained in almost 800,000 artillery shells
the terrifying arsenal is contained at the pueblo chemical depot in southern colorado
the first batch of the mustard agent was destroyed after scientists used explosives to open up a sealed container and flooded it with a second chemical to neutralise the liquid
bruce huenefeld , who is managing the destruction process said : ' everybody 's really excited , but we 're being cautious , making sure all the procedures are followed exactly
' mustard agent can maim or kill by damaging skin , the eyes and airways
it 's being destroyed under a 1997 international treaty banning all chemical weapons
it will take four years to destroy the pueblo chemical depot stockpile
another 523 tons of mustard and deadly nerve agents are stored at blue grass army depot in kentucky
blue grass is n't expected to start destroying its weapons until 2016 or 2017 , finishing in 2023
the destruction process is safe , officials said
most of pueblo chemical depot 's stockpile will be dismantled and neutralised in a highly automated $ 4.5 billion plant built at the depot
the pueblo chemical depot in southern colorado has a method of destroying damaged chemical shells the united states said it never used mustard agent in any conflict and agreed to destroy their stockpile about 1,400 damaged shells and a dozen metal bottles of mustard agent are considered unsuitable for that plant
they 'll be opened with explosives and neutralised in the sealed chamber , which sits inside an airtight structure near the larger automated plant
the metal bottles contain mustard that was extracted from the shells for testing
a single bottle was the first container to be opened and neutralised wednesday
crews were waiting for the neutralisation to finish before draining the chamber , rinsing it and then removing the remains of the bottle
once all the bottles are destroyed , crews will start work on the damaged shells , depot spokesman thomas schultz said
the automated plant is n't expected to begin work until december or january
design and construction have taken years , and final testing and training are underway
mustard agent is a thick liquid , not a gas as commonly believed
it has no color and almost no odor , but it got its name because impurities made early versions smell like mustard
the united states acquired 30,600 tons of mustard and nerve agents , but it never used them in war
nearly 90 per cent of its original stockpile has already been destroyed , mostly by incineration
the depots in colorado and kentucky are using chemical neutralisation because residents and officials expressed concerns about the vapor from incineration .
