suarez is 90 minutes from his first final with barcelona but his coach luis enrique could leave him out of the copa del rey semi-final second leg against villarreal because he is one booking away from suspension

barcelona 's all - star front three could be broken up in the copa del rey semi-final second leg on wednesday suarez ( centre ) has been in great goalscoring form but is one yellow card away from suspension villarreal have never made it to a big final and supporters were preparing for what will be one of the greatest nights in their history with yellow balloons placed on all the seats of the 20,000 el madrigal stadium
the last time they came close to reaching a final was 2005 when manuel pellegrini was in charge
they lost 1 - 0 to arsenal in their champions league semi-final first leg and won a last - gasp penalty in the second game only for jens lehman to save juan roman riquelme âs spot - kick and prevent the game going into extra time
they reached the europa league semi-final in 2010 but were beaten 5 - 1 in the first leg , with radamel falcao scoring four and making the second game an irrelevance
