but jun tang forced the issue by throwing herself into the river - and rong tsao quickly followed suit
the incident echoed a common china custom that revolves around men being asked who they would rescue if their mother and their lover both jumped in a river
wu said : ' i was sick of being nagged from both sides
' rong tsao was moaning about jun tang and jun was moaning about her and it all go too much
' ultimatum : jun tang had jumped in the river in the hope her ex-boyfriend would save her muddy : but he chose his current girlfriend , leaving jun tang to be rescued by his brother and fire services but when they got to the river , the situation went from bad to worse
a police spokesman said : ' the girls began arguing and the man 's ex-girlfriend felt insulted by a comment made by the new girlfriend , and so she jumped into the river calling for her former lover to save her
' the new girlfriend , fearing that he might indeed jump in to save his ex-lover , then jumped in as well and both of them within calling for him to rescue them from drowning
' wu settled the matter by jumping in the water to save his current girlfriend , ringing his brother to ask for help in pulling out the ex. according to a firefighter who attended the incident , jun tang - stuck up to her waist in mud - calmly rang a friend at this point to tell her she was stuck in the river
the friend then rang emergency services
the fireman said : ' we found a woman mired to her chest in mud - about 20 meters away from the riverbank
' rescuers were forced to tie a rope round jun tang to haul her out of the mud
judging by the brief conversation wu and his ex had after the rescue , his problems may not be over
according to the fireman , wu said to her : ' we broke up 4 months ago
why you still bother me ? ' she replied : ' i want to bother you
' current girlfriend rong tsao required hospital treatment for minor injuries after hitting a boat as she jumped into the river
the story quickly went viral in china , where there is a chronic shortage of single women because the country 's one - child policy meant parents preferred male babies
as a result there is a surplus of millions of single men who will never marry as , normally , they can not find partners .
