despite employing sheryl sandberg , one of the nation 's leading advocates for working mothers , chia hong claims she was belittled by her boss for taking time off to volunteer at her children 's school , forced to served drinks to male co-workers and told she should have just stayed home to take care of her child
hong filed a lawsuit with the san mateo county superior court monday against the social networking giant claiming that her former boss , anil wilson , harassed and ' belittled ' her for being a woman and for being taiwanese
in the lawsuit , hong claims that anil wilson regularly ' ignored ' and ' belittled ' her opinions and input during group meetings where she was one of few women present
anil wilson once allegedly asked hong why she did n't ' just stay home and take care of her child instead of having a career ' and scolded her for taking one day off each month to volunteer at her child 's school -- a practice permitted by the company
a facebook spokesperson denied the allegations and told recode that the company has made progress in matters related to gender , diversity , and equality
' in this case we have substantive disagreements on the facts , ' the spokesperson said ' and we believe the record shows the employee was treated fairly
' hong alleges that she was told she was not part of ' the team ' because ' she looks different and talks differently than other team members
' as of 2014 , 69 percent of facebook 's employees world - wide are male and 31 percent are female , according to tech republic
fair treatment : a facebook spokesperson denied the allegations and said that hong was treated fairly a diversity report showed that more than half of the company 's employees identify as white
she claims she was ordered to ' organize parties and serve drinks to her male colleagues ' -- actions neither part of her job description nor requested of males at the company
the mother says she experienced much harassment and , after she filed a complaint , the company fired her in october 2013 replacing her with an indian male who , she claims , is ' less qualified ' and ' less experienced , ' fox reports
the suit states that hong , who began working for the company in 2010 , received good performance reviews , pay raises , and even a promotion
but once she filed the harassment complaint , she received a negative performance evaluation and was fired
