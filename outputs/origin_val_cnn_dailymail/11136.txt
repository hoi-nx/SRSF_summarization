michael vaughan believes cook is ' clearly bitter ' , and must set aside his own world cup disappointment for the good of his england team at the start of their ashes year
cook claimed on wednesday that england 's decision to replace him as captain with eoin morgan , at the 11th hour before the global tournament in australia and new zealand , was proved ' probably wrong ' by subsequent events
england made an embarrassing early exit at the hands of bangladesh , before the knockout stages were under way
cook was replaced as engtland 's one - day captain before this year 's world cup former captain michael vaughan interprets cook 's remarks as a sign that he is still struggling to come to terms with what happened after losing his 50 - over role because of his continued poor batting form
cook will nonetheless lead england in three tests against the west indies , on a tour starting early next month , before returning home to face first new zealand and then australia this summer
bbc pundit michael vaughan said : ' he 's clearly bitter
' i think that 's a bad mentality to have , when you think he 's going to be back leading the team in a couple of weeks ' time
' cook led england to a champions trophy final on home soil two years ago , and the top of the world rankings , but their recent one - day international record under him deteriorated
michael vaughan added : ' cook 's last six captaincy jobs in ( odi ) series for england , he lost every single one
' the only series they 've won was away in the west indies , when he was n't the captain
' michael vaughan claims cook is ' bitter ' about the decision to replace him as captain cook could only watch from afar as england beat only scotland and afghanistan in their world cup campaign under eoin morgan , but he sensed they were ' shell - shocked ' and in need of ' real leadership '
michael vaughan argues cook must move on , and start scoring prolifically again - as he has for the vast majority of his record - breaking career
' i do n't think it 's great that the captain comes out and criticises the leadership of the captain that takes over - but he 's clearly bitter
' he 's got to clear that out of his head , because it 's so important that by the time he gets to the west indies england need him scoring runs
' he has to score runs in the caribbean ; he has to get runs against new zealand - so by the time the ashes arrive in july , no one is talking about cook 's position in the test team
' he has n't scored a hundred in any format of the game for two years
that has to change in the west indies
