â i thought i âd wait a few more days but when i finally got to her on thursday , she had a snare wrapped around her body and she looked really sick and poorly infected
â the rescuer was forced to put the youngster down because she had endured too much pain from the metal wire , which had cut through her body cavity and ribs after being tangled as she tried to release herself from the trap
â i âve been rescuing animals for a long time and have seen many horrendous things but it was nothing horrendous like this â it 's the worst i âve ever seen , â ms hinton said
â she was ripped apart and you could see into her chest
there were maggots crawling out of her â she had been fly - blown
â it made me feel physically ill , disbelieving and horrified that people could do that and think it âs ok
the rescuer was forced to put the roo down because she had endured too much pain from the metal wire the snare was wrapped around her neck and back as she struggled to release herself from the metal wire ms hinton said she does n't know where the snare was set up but believes it could be just kilometres away ms hinton said it was difficult to know where the snare had come from but believed there was a small possibility it was an â accidental capture â
â it âs obvious someone had set it up to specifically trap wildlife animals , â ms hinton said
â it âs inhumane for someone to do that and it makes me feel fearful because if someone could do that to an animal â what makes it any different to take out a farmer âs life ? â we âve also heard stories about people chasing them [ kangaroos ] around in their cars until they get exhausted and collapse , then people would run or reverse over them until they die
â there 's been times where i âve stopped to rescue animals on the side of the road and then i see cars and motorbikes go out of their way to run them down â it âs horrible and it needs to stop
