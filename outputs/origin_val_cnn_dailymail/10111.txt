' the pups have been in the den to date and we have been monitoring them via a video camera , to ensure they are growing and developing well
' keepers will name two of the otters , while they have enlisted the help of the public to name the third the birth of this litter comes off the success of last year 's first litter as part of the zoo 's breeding program
' the older siblings born in 2014 have been assisting their parents with the daily care of the pups including grooming and babysitting the new arrivals , ' mr anderson said
' oriental small - clawed otters are a social species and live in large families so it is anticipated that the family will remain together for the near future
