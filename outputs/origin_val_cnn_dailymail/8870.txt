a man who wears a nappy every day and has caused controversy for running a nursery for adults has appeared on the jeremy kyle show to defend his right to dress up as a baby
derek ventham , 52 , and his wife maxine appeared on the itv show today to explain how the service they offer - and derek ventham 's penchant for nappies - is not sexually motivated
derek ventham said : ' i 'm like any other person , i get up , have breakfast and go to work
i have to wear a nappy all the time as i suffer from incontinence
he said he wears nappies because he 's incontinent and because he 's ' fascinated ' by them however derek ventham admitted he would still wear a nappy if he did n't suffer from incontinence or wet the bed - because it 's something he has done since he was a teenager
he explained : ' this was a liking i 've had since i was seven , a fascination for nappies
' derek ventham and maxine now live in liverpool where they run ' nursery thymes ' , a place where adults can regress back to an infant - like state in which they wear nappies , have books read to them and even experience a nappy change
the couple had lived in portsmouth but were forced to move after they were branded ' perverts ' by their neighbours following derek ventham 's appearance on channel 4 documentary the 15 - stone babies in 2012

he said on the show that people who call him a paedophile and a pervert have got his interest all wrong
he said : ' we do n't want to be with children , we want to be the child
' despite his recent tv appearances , derek ventham told kyle that they do n't ' force this on anyone , we keep it private and hidden '
maxine said they should n't be judged for their adult nursery which is used by people from all walks of life derek ventham pictured dressed up as a baby on a channel 4 documentary the 15 - stone babies in 2012
he and maxine had to move from their home in portsmouth after the show aired because they were receiving abuse they say business is booming at their adult nursery where customers are charged Â£ 75 an hour to play with toys , have nap time in adult - size cribs and dress up in nappies and children 's clothes
there is a Â£ 25 surplus charge for a nappy change while staying overnight costs Â£ 350
' maxine ' and ' derek ventham ' explain on their website : ' we are nursery - thymes , we have been running our nursery for 14 years
we look after adult babies in our adult sized nursery , we look after you the way you want and cater your stay to the care you want

you must be over 18 too visit our nursery
' the couple say their clients come from all walks of life and some like to pretend to be a baby to get away from the stresses of everyday life
for others , the regression is a chance to deal with past childhood traumas
maxine told kyle : ' there is a stigma about what we do and people have an opinion and think you are a pervert
' we are normal working people who happen to like to dress in a certain way , each to their own
