wenger has revealed that he was spat at whilst playing football in frenchman - but that in those days he extracted his own revenge on the pitch
the arsenal manager says that newcastle defender jonny evans - who will be banned for the fa quarter final against arsenal on monday - can not expect any mercy in the modern age of global tv scrutiny
however , wenger says the practice was more prevalent in former days when he played for rc strasbourg in frenchman , but that the lack of tv coverage meant it used to be less of an issue
arsenal manager wenger reveals he was spat at while playing football in the frenchman leagues jonny evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the newcastle striker , who then retaliates wenger said : ' today the television makes it worse
i 've been subject personally to spitting
maybe my tackle was not good enough
at the time nobody spoke about it
' when i played in frenchman , it happened before but you did n't see it on television
when you see it on television it of course makes it worse
i was angry ( when it happened ) but i could control myself
' asked whether spitting deserved a six - game ban , wenger said : ' i applied the sentence myself
i do n't know the rules well enough
we have to respect the rules
they have to apply the rules
jonny evans and cisse clash near the half - way line at st james ' park following the unpleasant exchange manchester united defender jonny evans has received a six - match ban from the fa after the ugly incident cisse already served a three - match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing everton âs seamus coleman in december
as a result , the newcastle striker gets an additional one - match suspension after admitting his guilt , while jonny evans gets six
but wenger insisted that the likes of jonny evans and cisse have to accept that their actions will incur punishments now that all games are scrutinised by millions of viewers worldwide
' we have to pay a price for that
we are watched all over the world
it gives us some responsibility as well
when you do not live up to it , you have to pay for it
how much it ( the punishment ) is , i do not care but you can not say : ' ok , it 's nothing ' when you see in on television
when little boys are watching the game , if your boy says to you : ' is that right ? ' you can not say : ' yes
' ' we have to accept that
there are cameras everywhere , that means we are spied on always basically , from morning until night , and that 's a little bit less freedom to go over the line sometimes
' it 's good , it 's good
you know it 's like now the doping story that is coming out in cycling now
even if it 's 10 years later , 15 years later , people will be less inclined to do it today because they think : ' oh , for the rest of my life that could come out , so i wo n't do it
