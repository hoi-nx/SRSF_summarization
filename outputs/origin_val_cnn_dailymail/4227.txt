a colombian artist is suing d&g after claiming they stole her idea when they created what was billed as the world 's swankiest headphones
colombian artist adriana , 46 , said she was shocked when she spotted pictures of the d&g headphones being advertised on the side of a taxi
the headphones had caused a sensation when they were unveiled during the fashion house 's recent autumn / winter 2015 show during milan fashion week
the headphones worn by the models are made of leather and are fully covered in the brand âs signature jewellery , embellished with materials like pearls , gold chains , swarovski crystals and velvet across the earpieces and bridge
the headphones were supposed to be just for the catwalk , but were so popular they are now available after the d&g collaborated with tech brand frends
frends confirmed that two of the original catwalk versions have officially landed on american online retailer moda operandi and are ready to pre-order for expected delivery between july and october
the d&g headphones featuring gems and jewellery created a stir at the milan fashion week since frends was founded in 2006 by a young group of pro-snowboarders , the brand 's minimalist designs have become a favourite in the fashion world
now by collaborating with the king of bling , the company has taken it 's fashion designs to a whole new level
but the artist , from the colombian capital bogota , claims that the designs are clearly based on a series of photographs entitled ' icons ' and ' icons ii ' that she had taken , where kids and women are pictured wearing headphones made with precious stones
a side view of the d&g headphones ( left ) and adriana 's on the right she said : ' i looked at the designs that were on display on the catwalk and realised they were uncannily similar to my own from the pictures i took in 2011
' according to the artist âs lawyer , in an interview with the newspaper el tiempo , the work of adriana inspired d&g , and the firm is guilty of copyright theft
adriana said : ' it is one thing to be inspired by the work of others , but it is another thing to simply copy someone else 's work and then not to admit it because this is plagiarism and can not be accepted
' d&g declined to comment about the issue
it is has been a busy week for the fashion brand after one of its designers , d&g , attracted worldwide criticism after saying babies born through ivf were ' synthetic '
the colombian designer 's photographs featured children in historic outfits a child model displays another of adriana 's pieces , a pair of gold headphones
