single people may have a list of attributes they are looking for in a partner when they embark on the dating game , from that elusive â spark â to a hot body
now a new study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a long - term partner
experts say that a sense of fun is more important to many people than whether someone has a degree or is religious
play to win hearts : a new study has revealed that playfulness comes high on the list of desirable attributes in a partner ( illustrated with a stock image ) - just behind friendliness , intelligence and a sense of humour research by the university of zurich revealed that playfulness is important to both sexes â just behind friendliness , intelligence and a sense of humour
they also found that naturally playful people deem humour , a laid back attitude and creativity more important in partners than their more serious peers
they described playful adults as those having a love of wordplay who enjoy teasing , people who are spontaneous and will take on a challenge lightheartedly and those who play the fool , for example
while playfulness comes in many forms , little research has been conducted into the trait and how desirable it is to others
study found playful people deem humour , a laid back attitude and creativity more important in partners than their more serious peers ( stock image ) the new study builds on the research of anthropologist garry chick from pennsylvania state university , who developed a theory that playfulness in adults is a desirable trait in sexual selection
this is because it indicates to women , a low level of aggression in men and to men , vitality in the fairer sex
proyer and lisa wagner from the department of psychology at the university of zurich , have shown that playfulness also plays an important role in the choice of a partner in the european culture
they asked 327 young adults from germany , switzerland and austria to examine a list of 16 characteristics and indicate whether or not they found them desirable in a potential long - term partner
the results showed that men and women largely agreed in their orders of preference , although there were differences in individual ratings , according to the american journal of play
for example , women found a sense of humour more important than men and men found an exciting personality more important than women
friendliness , intelligence , humour and a fun tendency came at the top of the list
playfulness ranked mid-table , although not all that far behind the favourites
â therefore , this personality trait also seems important for the choice of partner â at least more so that the partner having a degree , good genes or being religious , â said dr proyer
they also found that participants who described themselves as playful also valued playfulness , humour , a laid - back attitude , a fun tendency and creativity among potential partners themselves
study volunteers who were in relationships assessed themselves as more playful than those who were currently single
â although we should be cautious while interpreting the data , this could be an indication that playful people are actually perceived as more attractive partners or that playfulness increasingly develops in the relationship , â dr proyer added
keeping your online dating profile humble is the key to success , researchers have revealed keeping your online dating profile humble is the key to success , researchers have revealed
they found that people who are looking for love online are less apt to trust a person with a flashy profile
instead , they prefer a potential partner who appears not only successful , but humble and real as well
andy high of the university of iowa said : ' we found people want to contact a person who appears to be accurate in what they are saying about themselves online
' it 's tough when it comes to dating profiles because we want someone who seems like an amazing person , but we also hopefully will have a relationship with this individual , so we want them to exist
' the team found most people in their study were drawn to individuals whose profiles were positive but not over-the - top glowing
more importantly , participants preferred people whose online persona could be clearly traced to a real person
that means people want details , not broad generalities , especially about where a prospective love interest works and what he or she does for a living .
