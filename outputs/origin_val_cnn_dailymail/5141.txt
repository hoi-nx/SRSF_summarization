woodman has been warned by newcastle legend alan shearer
he has been warned not to drift into obscurity
woodman â the england under-19 goalkeeper who is currently tim krul 's no.2 at st james ' park â was presented with the jack hixon trophy by alan shearer earlier this week
hixon was the tyneside scout who spotted the future england under-19 captain and the prize in his name recognises the best talent in the city

he won the european championships last summer , has been a regular on the newcastle bench this season - despite his tender years - and starred in newcastle 's run to the last eight of the fa youth cup
alan shearer , though , has told woodman all of that will count for nothing if he fails to come good on his undoubted potential
' it 's been a brilliant 12 months , ' the stopper told sportsmail
' i have seen things around the first - team that i would n't have otherwise done this early in my career
' to win the award was an honour
alan shearer said to me that some of the names who have won it have not gone on to achieve what they should have done
he said hopefully i would
' woodman 's chances of making it big will undoubtedly be aided by the presence of tim krul
the young custodian was newcastle 's penalty - shootout hero during last month 's victory at sunderland in the fa youth cup , mimicking the world cup antics of the dutchman
tim krul made headlines around the world when he saved two spot - kicks in holland 's shootout win over costa rica in brazil
and woodman , whose dad andy is magpies goalkeeping coach , said : ' every time we do penalties i think of tim. ' the shootout at sunderland was one of my best moments in football , up there with the euros
alan shearer has told woodman to make use of his potential and prove that he can be a great goalkeeper newcastle 's no 2 keeper woodman was presented with the jack hixon trophy by alan shearer earlier this week ' the feeling of saving the penalty and the fans singing my name was a moment i ' ll remember for a long time
it was like the kid coming out of me
for that five minutes i was on top of the world
' but i 've to give credit to tim. i remember being at home watching that game against costa rica and when he came on and did what he did i could n't have been happier
' earlier in the tournament , when holland played australia , he rang me up and invited me out to brazil , courtesy of him
a lot of people might think tim krul does n't have time for the young keepers , but he 's absolutely top class
' he works with me and teaches me
he 'll say when i 'm rubbish and say when i 'm good
that 's been massive for me
' he 's really taken me under his wing and has said i can take the same path as him
tim krul ( right ) has taken woodman under his wing at newcastle and is teaching him the tricks woodman says newcastle 's no 1 goalkeeper tim krul will ' say when i 'm rubbish and say when i 'm good ' ' i would love to do that
he 's up there as one of the best â and that 's what i want to be
' london - born woodman followed his dad to the north-east three years ago and , given his position on alan pardew 's backroom team , he admits it was n't easy to be accepted by his peers
' it 's brilliant having my dad as coach , but it 's been hard as well , ' he said
' when i first came there as a lot of , " you 're only here because of your dad "
and i got that a lot
' i felt i had to work 10 times harder than everyone else
i stayed back after training just to prove that i 'm not just here because of my old man
' but he 's great with it
my dad played , it was n't at the best level and he made mistakes
we talk about them to make sure i do n't make those same mistakes
i have to take the right path professionally
' woodman was on the bench at spurs earlier in the season when jak alnwick needed lengthy treatment
it looked as though he was about to make his premier league debut at just 17
woodman is looking to get a first team opportunity from newcastle manager carver this season woodman says he feels like he 's ' having a kickabout with my mates ' but will hope to get carver 's attention ' when the gaffer turned around and said , " fred , get warmed up " , you do get a feeling where you think , " woah , this is big " , ' he said
' you get a burning feeling inside , but deep down i wanted to get on the pitch and show people that i 'm ready , no matter how young i am
' as soon as you 're on the pitch though you forget everything and it feels like you 're in the park
i feel like i 'm having a kickabout with my mates because i love playing , hopefully i will keep that feeling for the rest of my career
i 'm loving every minute right now
' let 's hope he continues to enjoy it , for if not , alan shearer might have something to say .
