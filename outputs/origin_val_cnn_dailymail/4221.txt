when you lose it 's out of bounds to continue as normal in the evening
when you play for chelsea you must not accept losing
' jose mourinho puts pressure on all his players
he is very demanding and wants perfection
' in defence , he asks me to move tactically and to be well placed to listen to john ( john terry ) and cahill around me
initially , i was obsessed with the ball and did not watch players behind me enough , but it 's something i 've been working on
' cahill joins zouma in celebrating a goal , and the frenchman has been told to stick close to cahill jose mourinho has told zouma to work closely to cahill and john terry in order to listen and learn from them jose mourinho has asked zouma to ' move tactically ' and to focus on the runs players make rather than just the ball zouma played in midfield for chelsea against tottenham in the capital one cup final and was then deployed there again by jose mourinho against west ham and paris saint-germain

' i 'll work hard
they ( the other centre backs ) are really strong and they have the experience
but when you have a goal , you should not look at who is in front of you , you should fight
