border officials refused a canada woman the right to stay in the britain claiming she does n't have a ' genuine relationship ' with her britain husband - despite them having been married for 45 years
david , 70 , and his wife maria , 66 , have been happily married since 1970 , and have a 42 - year - old son , derick , who holds a britain passport
the couple lived in ontario , canada , until september 2013 , when they moved back to the britain to care for mr david 's sick mother
but border officials have now refused retired optician mrs summers 's application for a permanent britain visa because they do n't believe the pensioners have a real ' affectionate relationship '
border officials have questioned david and summers ' relationship and denied her a visa - despite them having been happily married for 45 years
pictured , right : the couple on their wedding day in 1970 the decision was appealed and it is currently being considered by the uk border agency , who have told the couple that no final ruling will be made until the end of may
the couple , who own a house in hereford , are meanwhile desperately trying to prove that their marriage is genuine for fear mrs summers could be permanently excluded from the britain when her temporary tourist visa expires
mrs summers said : ' it 's ridiculous , we are quite willing to give the border people what they want but they are adamant
i do n't know what they want us to prove
' anyone who has ever spoken to us can clearly see that we are best friends and have been since the day we met
' we 've got almost half a century 's worth of birthday cards , 45 years of holiday snaps from all ove the world
' we 've got pictures of us with our son just after he was born , growing up , right up to his wedding day
if they 'd asked us to send us all of those photos , we could have done
' mr david , a retired retailer and published author , added : ' why pick on us ? we 've been married for 45 years and we are completely devoted to one another , what do they want us to do ? ' we could show them pictures , e-mails , texts , everything from our marriage , but they have not asked us for anything
they are doing this based on no evidence at all
' the couple say they have five decades ' worth of pictures to prove their long - running marriage is genuine - but were not asked to provide any evidence when applying for the visa mr david said : ' we love each other very much , it 's hurtful for them to suggest our marriage is not real ' mr david added : ' they have n't even given us a chance to prove that our marriage is real
we 've got a marriage certificate and a son , what more do they want ? ' we love each other very much , it 's really hurtful for them to suggest that our marriage is not real
' mrs summers 's application for a permanent britain visa was rejected by britain authorities , with a letter citing the reason for rejection stating : ' you have not provided any evidence that your relationship is still subsisting
' it is reasonable to expect that in a genuine subsisting , supportive and affectionate relationship , there would be evidence of regular contact , signs of companionship , emotional support , affection , and abiding interest in each other 's welfare and well - being throughout the entire duration of your relationship ...
i am therefore not satisfied that your relationship is not genuine
' the pair met at a dance in kingston , ontario in 1966 while mr david was in the country working in retail and soon fell in love
mr and mrs summers lived in canada after they married in 1970
they want to move to the house they own in hereford so they can look after mr david 's mother they say the decision has been made all the more extraordinary by the fact that they have grown - up son they married in 1970 and lived in kingston until 1981 , when they moved to ottawa
the couple made frequent visits back to the britain and bought their house in hereford in 1995 for mr david 's elderly mother doris to live in
they made the trip back in september 2013 and intended to retire in hereford and care for doris , who had fallen ill. david said : ' we filled in a load of forms when we had derick which meant we could come back and forth as much as we wanted , but for us to retire here permanently , we found out maria needed to have this pemanent visa
' if maria 's second visa application fails , we would have no choice but to move back to canada
' we would have to sell our home and move my mother into a care home
we have family here but they can not look after her
' i find it utterly extraordinary , i ca n't really contemplate life without my wife
' the home office , which runs the uk border agency , has yet to comment on the case
mrs summers now has to wait until may for her appeal to be finalised , but she fears she and her husband may have to move back to canada if she is not allowed to stay
