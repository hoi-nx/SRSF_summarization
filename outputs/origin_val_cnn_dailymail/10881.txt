only the quick thinking of a pilot averted a similar tragedy last year when a sister plane of the germanwings jet suddenly lost altitude and nose - dived
a lufthansa â a longer version of the airbus a320 â unexpectedly descended 3,000ft while cruising over pamplona , spain , last november
the jet , with 109 passengers and crew aboard , was at an altitude of 31,000ft when it started to lose height
the flight crew managed to regain control at 28,000ft
in that incident , the problem was corrected by the pilot according to the easa , a safety system designed to protect the jet reacted to incorrect data due to a faulty sensor
the safety warning related to all airbus a318 , airbus a320 , airbus a320 and a321 â including the airbus a320 involved in today âs disaster
in response , airbus created a â temporary revision â to all of the aircraft 's flight manuals
the easa determined that the lufthansa aircraft 's angle of attack probes got blocked while flying between bilbao and munich
the easa warned that in such a situation ' the flight control laws order a continuous nose down pitch rate that , in a worst case scenario , can not be stopped with backward sidestick inputs , even in the full backward position
' the agency added : ' this condition , if not corrected , could result in loss of control of the aeroplane
' a similar airbus plane to that involved in today 's crash was put down in the hudson river , new york in 2009 in that incident , the pilot managed to crash land in the river and the passengers were saved after a bird strike the lufthansa involved in the previous incident is a slightly longer version of the plane involved in today 's crash , carrying an extra 40 passengers
germanwings today confirmed that today 's downed aircraft underwent a major inspection at lufthansa in summer 2013 while it was last checked yesterday
the plane that crashed was called ' mannheim ' and made its first test flight in november 1990
it was then purchased by lufthansa and had its first commercial flight in february 1991
experts said the aircraft would have been nearing the end of its commercial life after more than 24 years of service
since the first version of the airbus a320 was released in 1987 , around 4,000 have been built and the company say one takes off or lands somewhere in the world every 2.5 seconds
the airbus a320 plane is a workhorse of modern aviation
worldwide , 3,606 airbus a320s are in operation , according to airbus
the a320 family has a good safety record , with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million take - offs , according to a boeing safety analysis
the safest part of a flight is when the plane is at cruise elevation
just 10 per cent of fatal accidents occur at that point
in contrast , take - off and the initial climb accounts for 14 per cent of crashes , while final approach and landing accounts for 47 per cent
the airbus a320 is certified to fly up to 39,000ft , its maximum altitude before its rate of climb begins to erode
however , the widely - used airbus a320 family of aircraft have been involved in a number of crashes in the three decades they have been used , resulting in scores of deaths
in december an airbus a320 crashed into the java sea killing all 162 people on board in an as - yet unexplained incident
the plane operated by airasia â owned by qpr chairman tony fernandes â vanished from radar screens in bad weather with initial reports suggesting it climbed so fast into a storm that it lost lift and plunged into the sea
one the first accident to involve one of the planes happened in the north east of france , not far from the current crash site , when an air inter flight came down in the vosges mountains in 1992
the airbus a320 was on its approach to strasbourg airport when it hit la bloss mountain , killing 87 of the 96 people on board
safe : aviation experts tweeted this graphic showing just how many airbus a320s are in the air at any time the best - known recent incident involving the plane was when a domestic flight in the us had to put down in the hudson river in new york
the us airways flight from the city 's laguardia airport heading for charlotte , north carolina when it is believed to have flown into a flock of geese
the airbus a320 like that involved in today 's accident is a short - haul , narrow - body airliner assembled in france , germany and china
around 4,000 of the single - aisle aircraft have been built and airbus says the plane ' sets industry standards for comfort and operating economy on short - to medium - haul routes '
it typical seats around 150 passengers depending on the layout of the plane and has a cruising speed of 511mph and a range of up to 7,500 miles
it was ranked as the world 's fastest selling aircraft bewteen 2005 and 2007 when it became popular with low - cost airlines
captain chesley sullenberger was widely praised for landing the plane on the river , meaning none of the 155 people on board were seriously injured
one of the deadliest accidents involving one of the planes was in may 2006 , when armavia flight 967 crashed into the sea near sochi , russia
all 113 passengers and crew on the a320-211 died after it flew into terrible weather while approaching the southern russia city after taking off from yerevan , armenia
six years earlier , 143 people , including two britons , lost their lives when a gulf air airbus a320-212 went down in the gulf of bahrain after a three - long flight from cairo
a number of factors were blamed for the night - time crash , including pilot error and poor training of staff
an airbus a320 was involved in a crash near sochi , russia in 2006 which killed 113 passengers and crew
