nbc anchor williams had pitched to nbc and cbs about making him the next late - night show host before he was busted for falsifying stories
williams , 55 , is currently suspended from nbc without pay as a team investigates claims he lied in reports about the iraq war and hurricane katrina , among others
but prior to the suspension he had agreed to a five - year anchor deal with nbc after being persuaded into it with a gift of veteran broadcaster murrow 's old desk
williams agreed to a five - year contract after being persuaded by nbc news president deborah turness , who gifted him with veteran broadcaster murrow 's old writing desk and few years ago , williams told nbc universal ceo burke that he wanted to take over the tonight show from jay leno
burke turned down williams 's idea and instead offered him a weekly program called rock center , which williams hoped could evolve into a variety show
instead , the show ended up mirroring 60 minutes and it was canceled after two seasons , according to new york magazine
williams pushed on , however , and went to cbs ceo moonves to suggest succeeding david letterman
moonves was n't interested , sources told new york magazine
williams then had to be convinced through lengthy negotiations to become a news anchor by nbc news president deborah turness
though they first clashed - because williams was used to having the final say over a show 's content - the pair eventually warmed to one another
williams suggested succeeding both jay leno ( left ) and david letterman ( right )
ceos from nbc and cbs turned down his offers williams sent deborah turness a note over the holidays that read , ' 2015 is going to be our year together ' , according to new york magazine
he went on to agree to a new five - year anchor deal , during the same dinner deborah turness presented him with murrow 's old writing desk
she had found the 1940s desk through a los angeles - based antique dealer
and less than two months later , williams was publicly shamed for a backlog of fictional stories and executives struggled with how to deal with the situation
this comes just after speculations that katie couric might be is in talks nbc 's incoming chairman lack to make a return by replacing williams on the nbc
' it makes sense ( that she could come back ) because she is so closely associated with the brand , ' a source told the new york daily news
lack ' has not made up his mind ' as to whether or not williams will return when his six - month suspension is up , according to new york magazine 's sources
a ' close friend ' of williams said the the magazine , however , that the anchor ' ca n't wait until he can speak ' , which he ca n't do publicly until his suspension ends .
