a teenager has claimed her high school banned her from carrying out an on - campus ' prom - posal ' to her girlfriend because they are lesbians
akers , 16 , from keller , texas said she often sees students ask others to be their dates to prom while at school yet when she was going to ask a female friend , they told her it was ' not appropriate '
speaking to nbc , the teenager said she believes it is because both she and her friend are gay
the school has denied the claim ' i gave them all the details before
they say it 's fine
they find out who i am asking , then say it 's not fine , ' akers told the channel
her mother , who helped akers prepare for her promposal , said she does not know why the school is stopping her from asking someone they know is her friend
after being told she could not ' prompose ' , akers sent a private message to a friend on twitter about what had happened and , with akers 's permission , the friend shared it publicly
' i asked the administrators if i could do a promposal , not mentioning it was for a girl , ' akers wrote in the now - widely - circulated message
' i had a box with flowers on it , cookies and a poster that said " out of all these cookies , you 're my favorite one
prom ? " the girls name is cookie and that 's where the idea came from
' plan : her mom helped her decorate this box with paper flowers so she could jump out and surprise her date date : 16 - year - old akers , left , poses with a girl , right , she identifies as her girlfriend online
she said that despite the school 's ban on her promposal , she will be taking her girlfriend to the prom anyway but as she walked to lunch , staff members approached her and told her it was ' not appropriate ' to ask her friend , adding : ' you know why
' within hours of the friend sharing the message , the hashtag # letcaseypromposal started trending on twitter and hundreds of youngsters began messaging the teenager to show their support
' regulating who your students ask to prom is disgusting # letcaseypromposal , ' one wrote
akers said she still intends to go to the prom with her friend
the school district released a statement saying they did not allow any student - regardless of their sexual orientation - to carry out promposals on campus
