organisers of an electronic music festival in country victoria last weekend were disgusted to find mountains of trash left behind by party - goers
the maitreya festival , a weekend of ' psytrance ' , techno and art , attracted thousands of revellers to the picturesque wooroonooka lakes camping ground , 245 km north - west of melbourne
but festival - goers left much more than their dancing shoes behind
" we 're all here cleaning this up because a percentage of you have made a hell of a mess and left it all behind - and you really obviously do n't give a toss , ' says tim , a member of the charlton football club and one of the clean - up volunteers in a video of the aftermath
' fair 's fair - you would n't do this at your mum and dad 's place , do n't do it at our lake
' if they 're organised enough to bring couches , surely they can be organised enough to take them home , it 's just simple courtesy , ' says tim as he loads a truck with garbage bags and old cushions
' fair 's fair - you would n't do this at your mum and dad 's place , do n't do it at our lake , ' says tim , one of the volunteers with the charlton football club the maitreya event prides itself on being environmentally conscious and before the party , urged festival goers , as ' friends of the eartth , ' to leave no trace
' if we can become responsible caretakers of the land , as is our heritage , we can continue to gather here for many moons to come â¦
if we ca n't ... sadly with the indictment on our shoulders we will have to leave â¦ , ' stated the festival website
the maitreya festival was held here on the wooroonooka lakes , near charlton in country victoria the picturesque camp site before the maitreya music festival last weekend the beautiful wooroonooka lake is a popular camping spot for nature lovers and recreational fishers according to the charlton football club , it took four solid days and a team of fifty plus volunteers to get the site back to how it was
a bush doof is an outdoor dance party , usually held in a remote area , or in bush or rainforests outside big cities in australian or new zealand
' doof doof ' is an australian term for loud , heavy bass electronic music
in most cases , bush doofs are small and secret , promoted by word - of - mouth or social media
sometimes they last for days
last year , a central coast teenager survived an 80 - metre cliff fall after trying to avoid the cover charge for a ' bush doof ' in the watagan state forest , north of sydney
another 21 - year - old man went missing for more than 48 hours in forest south - east of perth after attending a remote rave
bush doofs usually involve live techno or trance djs and are notorious for illicit drug use
' people were disappointed by the rubbish , but i was out there yesterday and i 'd say 90 per cent of the camp ground was restored to it 's natural state , ' charlton football club secretary , mcgeown , told daily mail australia
some festival goers have criticised event organisers for a lack of available bins and recycling options in comments to social media
' unlike rainbow and others where you are provided with a garbage bag at the gate they did not even mention to us anything about rubbish disposal , ' wrote one you tube user who attended the festival
' we were never told that there were any bins on site and did not even see one until we drove out the gate on the last day
perhaps if they want people to be more responsible they need to take responsibility for informing festival patrons about how to properly dispose of their rubbish and provide adequate bins ! ' but maitreya organisers have scolded festival goers on their official facebook page , posting ' maitreya festival patrons got a lot to learn ! take some responsibilty ! ' take some responsibilty : ' festival organisers say maitreya patrons have a lot to learn ' you obviously do n't give a toss ' : volunteers were frustrated at cleaning up the mess taking out the trash : it took volunteers more than four days to clean up the campsite mcgeown says the charlton club provided bins and a rubbish crew for the event and its members were out in force for the clean - up afterwards
' you 've got to remember this is a huge area and a lot of people , so it was a big job , but not a mammoth one considering , ' mcgeown said
' overall it was a positive event and the town and local businesses have been extremely supportive
' mcgeown does n't believe the trash will spell the end of the maitreya festival but says to future revellers : ' enjoy yourselves , respect the environment
' leave no trace : ' there is nothing i hate more than walking around and seeing thousands of those empty nos bulbs scattered around what was originally a beautiful clean space ' , says one instagram user who found a better use for the rubbish
some festival goers have criticised event organisers for a lack of available bins and recycling options victoria 's maitreya festival in full swing last weekend : ' disgusting its left up to the local community that was kind enough to let us on their beautiful land , ' wrote one festival - goer on social media .
