hull defender michael dawson will lead his side into sunday 's premier league clash with chelsea insisting confidence levels have not been hit by a fortnight of frustration which has plunged them deeper into the relegation dogfight
missed opportunities against sunderland and leicester have left the tigers hovering three points above the drop zone while their hopes have also been hit by the news that striker nikica jelavic faces six weeks on the sidelines after knee surgery
on the face of it a clash with jose mourinho 's champions elect is the last thing the struggling hosts might wish for but former tottenham star michael dawson is adamant his team can once again rise to the occasion this weekend
michael dawson ( centre ) says his side are not low in confidence and have a great fighting spirit michael dawson said : ' we have got a spirit and a fight about us and we have certainly shown that in recent weeks
it 's all about fine margins and at the end of the day we picked up points that might be valuable at the end of the season
' it is a massive challenge playing against all the top teams but we have been away to anfield and city and arsenal and picked points up and we could quite easily have picked up all three against city
' the tigers ' survival hopes took another hit last week when fellow strugglers burnley upset manuel pellegrini 's men at turf moor but michael dawson says that upset can provide inspiration for his own side on sunday
the hull captain remonstrates with referee jonathan moss following tom huddlestone 's sending off ' you do look at other results , there 's no hiding that , and seeing that kind of result definitely gives us that belief , ' added michael dawson
' on paper it was n't one you would look at but credit to burnley who showed what the premier league is about
' nikica jelavic 's untimely absence will mean another chance for either record signing abel hernandez or sone aluko in attack , but the game is likely to come too early for long - term injured trio mohamed diame , robbie brady and liam rosenior
however despite nikica jelavic 's grim immediate prognosis , boss bruce is determined not to completely write the croatian striker off and believes he could yet return to play a part in the potentially crucial end - of - season run - in
bruce said : ' being realistic we think it 's going to be at least six weeks
it could force him out for the rest of the season , but knowing jela the way i do i am sure he is going to give it a good shot
' nikica jelavic faces up to six weeks out and is all but ruled out of their premier league survival bid
