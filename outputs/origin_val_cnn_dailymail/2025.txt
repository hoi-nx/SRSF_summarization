in the boy band 's heyday , the take that star was famously the least attractive member , something he himself admitted to - and trailed in the wake of his more athletically - blessed peers when it came to fan mail

following a strict diet , the songwriter has shed the pounds that once dogged him and managed to keep the weight off
a smart haircut , light beard and personal stylist have seen his popularity soar
after the weight loss , he said : ' i âve just not got the sort of body where i can pick and choose what i eat
i âve got to go for one thing and stick by it
so i âve tried not to have sugar and caffeine , etc , and it âs boring , it âs really boring
' but it works for me
the result is that i feel good

right , the actor in his more familiar guise at the press call for new james bond film spectre in december last year he 's not the only male celebrity to have improved with age however
universal heartthrob george clooney 's legion of adoring fans will mostly agree that the hollywood actor / director has matured like a fine wine , suiting a smattering of grey hair much more than the more bouffant look that he sported in the eighties
other stars offering hope to mere mortals fearing their middle years include hugh laurie , who became an unlikely desirable as the front man of us television hit house
