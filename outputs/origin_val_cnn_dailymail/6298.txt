youngsters who get themselves saturday jobs like brooklyn beckham or jamie oliver 's kids may end up harming their grades , a report has found
while it may do celebrity children â like david and victoria beckham âs son , who grabbed a few weekend shifts at a coffee shop â the world of good to get some work experience , research suggests it could come at a cost to young people âs education
celebrity chef jamie oliver recently revealed he intends to keep his daughters â real â by having them work in his pub on the weekends
youngsters who get themselves saturday jobs may end up harming their grades , a report has found
jamie oliver ( pictured with his wife and children ) says he will encourage his kids to work in his pub on weekends but a new study by the institute for social and economic at the university of essex found teenagers who take on part - time jobs experience a slip in their gcse results
this is because earning extra cash makes it more likely for youngsters to spend it unwisely â including on alcohol , cigarettes and and cannabis
and the effect was found to be more drastic for girls
despite having millionaires for parents , brooklyn beckham took on weekend shifts at a coffee shop results showed an extra hour of work per week in year 10 saw their results drop around one grade in one subject the following year
the study analysed the hours these young people spent working and the impact of this on time spent on study time , other activities and their grades at gcse level
dr holford , who wrote the report called youth employment and academic performance , says approximately a quarter of 13 to 16 - year - olds take on some form of formal paid employment during term time
â this can be a good thing â they earn their own money and can pick up useful skills , which might help them find full - time work in the future , â he said , according to the observer
â however , they may spend that hard - earned money on less than useful things , or fall in with a different group of people
â we did find that schoolchildren who worked became more likely to drink alcohol regularly , smoke or consume cannabis
â he added the long - term effect of employment would be particularly damaging for â borderline students â â those who are at risk of not achieving the targets needed ( five a *-c grades , including english and mathematics ) to progression into further education
dr holford added that as academic results at 16 have such a great influence over future careers , the results of his study should come as a warning to parents who want children to achieve their full potential .
