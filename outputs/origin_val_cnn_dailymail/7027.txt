it says : ' we will examine flexible parking charges and the innovative use of technology e.g. introduce significantly cheaper charges in winter , on rainy summer days etc. ' it is bizarre that summer parking rates begin on 1 march.under the conservatives summer parking charges will only apply in summer
' but critics have hailed it as an early april fools ' day joke , given the fickle british summertime weather
conservative transport spokesman graham cox , told the telegraph the economy relied on the weather and they had to look at ways of attracting people when it was bad
' if it 's a lovely , hot , summer day in june , july or august , the queues in brighton will stretch up the a23 and every space in town is taken
if it 's wet , it 's a very different situation , ' he said
every cloud : conservative councillors in brighton and hove are promising to halve the cost of parking on rainy days in summer in a bid to boost tourist numbers in 2013 , business leaders blamed parking charges and poor weather for the plummeting number of visitors to the region during a particularly wet summer
figures from the brighton business improvement district ( bid ) showed footfall in the city had dropped by 14 per cent year - on - year
costly sunshine : visitors would be charged twice as much to park on sunny days under new proposals by councillors in brighton the parking proposal would be based on weather forecasts so if heavy downpours were predicted for a particular weekend , the parking tariffs would be reduced
motoring organisations said it would confuse drivers and said both tariffs and clear instructions would need putting on street parking signs .
