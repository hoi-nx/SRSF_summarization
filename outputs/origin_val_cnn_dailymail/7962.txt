testimony : rothschild , now 67 , took the stand for the defense representing hernandez ( pictured ) , who confessed to police that he killed the boy
his attorneys say the confession was a delusion and their client is mentally ill never found : etan patz vanished on his way to school in 1979
his disappearance helped galvanize the modern - day missing children 's movement , with his picture one of the first to appear on a milk carton hernandez was a teenage stock clerk at the convenience store where etan was headed the morning of may 25 , 1979
in hours of a videotaped confession , hernandez calmly recounts choking the boy , putting his body in a bag and putting the bag in a box , then walking it down the street
prosecutors point to admissions he made over decades where he told a prayer circle , his ex-wife and a friend that he 'd killed a child in new york
hernandez 's lawyers , however , suggest that another longtime suspect , convicted pedophile ramos , is the real killer
argument : hernandez 's lawyers have suggested that another longtime suspect , convicted pedophile ramos ( pictured ) , is the real killer rothschild said ramos admitted molesting the boy while the men were roommates in prison
ramos was never charged in etan 's disappearance , but he was considered the prime suspect for decades
rothschild said ramos recounted in horrifying detail how he molested etan and many other boys
' i 've never been the same since that day , ' rothschild said
' i thought my life was just a total wreck and a complete and total mess , but there are other people deeper or darker than me
' ramos never admitted killing etan
rothschild met ramos when they were both at a prison in otisville , and rothschild agreed to help prosecutors by trying to get a confession
rothschild , a self - proclaimed con man , had been in and out of prison for various scams when he crossed paths with ramos
he said ramos told him he ' loved ' etan and ' honored him every day
' when rothschild asked if the boy was dead , ramos spat : ' of course he 's dead
but there is no proof
' ramos told then - assistant u.s. attorney stuart grabois that he picked up etan at washington square park and took him back to his apartment to molest him
but the boy refused , and he put him on the subway
rothschild recounted how ramos told him he lied about saying he picked up the boy in the park and drew him a map of the neighborhood that included ' x ' marks where he actually grabbed the boy
prosecutor joan illuzzi-orbon sought to show that rothschild was a career con man who would do anything to get what he wanted , even make up stories for law enforcement
ramos could have known etan because his girlfriend , susan harrington , had been hired to walk etan and other neighborhood kids home from school during a bus strike
ramos spent more than 20 years in prison for molesting two boys in separate incidents in pennsylvania and remains jailed on a megan 's law violation .
