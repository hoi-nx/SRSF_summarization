if you 're of the opinion that text speak and emojis are making us lazy and ruining language , you may want to look away now
a developer has created the ultimate predictive text app called lazyboard that provides a list of just ten commonly used words , and 11 emoticons
users can combine these prepopulated words to create messages quickly and simply without having to type a single letter
lazyboard was created by reddit user sir-zeph and it lets people communicate using a list of just ten commonly used words ( pictured ) including ' cool ' , ' nice ' , ' damn ' , ' oh ' , ' thks ' ' lol ' and ' lel ' the free app is available for phones running android 4.2 and above , and words include ' cool ' , ' nice ' , ' damn ' , ' oh ' , ' thks ' ' lol ' and ' lel '
lazyboard was uploaded to the google play store by developer prem adithya , listed as reddit user zeph
its description says : ' feeling lazy ? not in the mood for a proper conversation ? well the only thing you need is the lazyboard
' it is a minimalistic keyboard that has the important keys required to have a lazy conversation
' the lazyboard comes with two themes - dark and light - that can be configured in the app settings menu , and sir - zeph wrote on reddit that a pro version is ' coming soon ' that will have more themes

last month , for example , developers created a keyboard cover that turns every key of a apple board into an emoji
once installed , the caps lock key lets users switch between regular and emoji keys meaning people can easily add images to facebook posts , tweets and even official documents
the emoji keyboard and its custom software were developed by a team of designers at california - based disk cactus
the emoji keyboard and its custom software were recently developed by a team of designers at california - based disk cactus
once installed , the caps lock key lets users switch between regular and the emoji keys meaning people can easily add the small images to facebook posts , tweets and even official documents each of the covers are made of silicone and act like standard covers to block out dust and dirt
they come in two sizes - one for standard macs , which includes the 13 - inch and 15 - inch macbook pro , the macbook air 13 and the apple keyboard ( pictured ) , and one for the 11 - inch macbook air the team has set up a kickstarter campaign to fund production of at least 1,000 covers , but hopes to be able to mass produce them by the end of the year
and last year a pair of london - based developers created the emojli app that only let users communicate using the popular miniature images
even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons
and with the release of ios 8 apple allowed app developers to create emoji - based keyboards for iphones , ipads and iphones
a study in april last year found that the top trending word , at that time , was emoji
there are now apps dedicated to the small images
emojli , for example , ( pictured ) only lets users communicate using the popular pictures , and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons emoji were originally popular in japan , and widely used online
however , in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere
originally meaning pictograph , the word emoji literally means ' picture ' ( e ) + ' letter ' ( moji )
icons are standardised and include some specific to japanese culture , such as a bowing ( apologising ) businessman , a face wearing a face mask , a white flower used to denote ' brilliant homework ' or a group of emoji representing popular foods : ramen noodles , dango , onigiri , japanese curry , and sushi
some emoji character sets have been incorporated into unicode , allowing them to be used elsewhere including websites and apps such as facebook and twitter .
