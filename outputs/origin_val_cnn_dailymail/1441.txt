with just six weeks to go until the birth of her second child , you âd expect all eyes to be on the royal bump
but it was the duchess of cambridge âs gleaming hair that was the star when she went to westminster abbey this week
the secret behind her glossy chestnut locks is said to be an organic vegetable - based salon treatment to boost colour and shine
but can you get the look at home ? from rinsing with fizzy water to a home - made strawberry and mayonnaise mask , we tried the diy tricks to boost dry locks
can we recreate the glossy effect at home using diy remedies ? add fizz to your rinse with sparkling water perrier sparkling water why ? apparently used by hollywood actress demi moore , this is highly recommended by paolo lai , at neville hair & beauty in london âs mayfair
â fizzy water is excellent at creating shine as the low ph level â or high acidity â combats frizz by smoothing the hair âs cuticle
perrier is one of the most acidic , so i suggest trying that , â he says
test : i wash my hair as usual before braving the perrier rinse , which is actually refreshing
i drench my hair thoroughly , but only use a third of the bottle
though i have few expectations , the finish is almost that of a professional blow dry
expert : â this sounds like an urban myth , but the cold , acidic water will flatten the cuticle of the hair , smoothing down the surface and allowing light to bounce off , â says consultant trichologist iain
gloss rating : 6/10 golden oil to slick down frazzled locks nuxe gold multi-purpose dry oil for body and hair nuxe gold multi-purpose dry oil for body and hair , Â£ 14 , escentual.com why ? containing borage , sweet almond , hazelnut , st john âs wort , camellia and macadamia plus vitamin e , this dry oil leaves skin feeling soft , supple and hydrated , but , according to the blurb on the bottle , works just as well on hair
test : it looks as though a child has mixed olive oil with glitter and shaken it up
i use sparingly on washed and dried hair , nervous i âll look greasy rather than groomed
the slightly cloying sweet - smelling oil smooths on well and the golden particles catch the light and make my hair look expensively shiny
expert : â a dry oil forms very small molecules , which are better absorbed by the hair than a wetter product , â says iain
gloss rating : 7/10 mask made in your kitchen hellmann 's mayonaise and fresh strawberries strawberry and mayonnaise mask why ? home - made hair treatments using strawberries are the talk of many beauty websites
the soft fruit is acidic and good at regulating oil production in the scalp , say converts
the best and simplest recipes involve mashing a few fruit with a moisturising ingredient like mayonnaise
test : the smell of mayonnaise and strawberries makes me feel faintly nauseous
i âll be honest , keeping mayo - coated lumps of strawberry on your head for ten minutes is nât pleasant
thankfully , it âs not too hard to wash off
there are chunks of strawberry in the shower , but the mayonnaise does nât leave my locks greasy
my hair is a bit softer , but it âs a lot of effort for little gain
expert : â the acidity of the strawberries will seal the cuticle , but you âd be better off just using a professional product , â says iain
gloss rating : 5/10 wake up hair with a caffeine shot recoffee hair care range recoffee range , from Â£ 17.25 for the shampoo , o - right.co.uk why ? it âs claimed the coffee oil in this haircare range â each bottle of shampoo contains oil extracted from 16 cups of recycled coffee grounds â treats dry ends
the caffeine is said to stimulate hair growth
there âs also organic silicone for a glossy finish
the bottle , made of recycled coffee waste , can be planted as there âs a coffee bean in the base
test : i âm all for a latte , but using a shampoo and conditioner smelling of coffee beans is a first
afterwards , i apply the transparent oil
it âs a leave - in treatment , applied before drying
i use the oil sparingly but after a rapid blow dry , my hair looks almost polished
it holds this sleek look all day , without greasiness ( though my hair is flatter than usual ) and friends say how groomed i look
expert : â this range could be great for dull , frizzy hair as coffee is mildly acidic , which means it will smooth the hair cuticle , â says iain
â but the effects will be temporary
â gloss rating : 9/10 brilliant boar bristle blow dry rock & ruddle boar - bristle brush rock & ruddle boar - bristle brush , Â£ 20 , rockandruddle.co.uk why ? â boar bristles are strong and resilient , with microscopic scales running along them , â says rock & ruddle co-founder alexandra rock
â these drag the hair âs natural sebum [ oil ] down the shaft so that it looks shiny and healthy
â why ? i blow dry my hair with my usual ceramic brush until almost dry , then use the boar bristle brush to smooth it down
i never thought i âd feel strongly about a hairbrush , but this is excellent
it cuts through tangles with ease and leaves my hair shiny
a blow dry in a brush
expert : â boar bristles are similar in structure to our own hair , and the cuticles will interlock with our own cuticles and push them down into place , â says iain
gloss rating : 9/10 home - made glitter goddess papermania embossing powder in tinsel gold papermania embossing powder in tinsel gold , Â£ 4 , hobbycraft.co.uk and hairspray why ? the rumour is that lovelace star amanda seyfried âs shiny hair is down to her hairdresser using a ultra-fine glitter powder mixed with hairspray
test : a stylist friend suggests mixing gold glitter ( the sort used for christmas cards ) with hairspray
i sprinkle some on my hair , follow with a blast of elnett spray then add another sprinkle of glitter
the resulting effect catches the light pretty well ( quite a lot falls off onto the kitchen floor too )
a good party look and it washes out pretty well
expert : â more fancy dress than enhancing hair health , â says iain
gloss rating : 5/10 ice your do home - made glycerine spray , wilton glycerine , Â£ 2.59 , lakeland.co.uk why ? i am told about making your own glycerine and water spray by a friend who swears blind that it will make my hair photo - shop shiny
test : glycerine , added to hair products to add moisture , is also used in royal icing , and i have some in the cupboard
i shake up four parts water to one part glycerine then spray it on my hair
here âs the surprising thing â it gives a groomed finish
a bit more and the final look is over-greasy for everyday glamour , but i can see it would work well for photos
expert : â be very wary â hair can go from shiny to greasy in the blink of an eye if this is over-used , â says iain
