you begin to believe tim sherwood after a night like this
aston villa âs first win since december 7 came in the 94th minute through their first penalty award of the season
it was late , it was a little lucky , but it was deserved
a roar rose out of villa park louder than any heard in a long while
tim sherwood , hugged and lifted by goalkeeping coach tony parks , looked like he was emitting the most decibels
in the instant christian benteke rolled the ball beyond foster from 12 yards the mood in this stadium lifted
christian benteke sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to score a dramatic late penalty and seal the win for aston villa christian benteke celebrates his goal with aston villa team - mates jack grealish and weimann aston villa manager tim sherwood celebrates the winning goal that gave him his first win in charge at the club agbonlahor threads the ball through foster 's legs to open the scoring for aston villa in the first half agbonlahor salutes the crowd in celebration after opening the scoring at villa park brad guzan looks on in horror as saido berahino nods home from close range after a knock - down from lescott west brom 's top scorer for the season saido berahino wheels away in celebration after equalising for the visitors hutton was lucky not to be sent off after this dangerous high tackle on saido berahino - both players were booked for the melee aston villa ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : brad guzan 6 ; hutton 6.5 , okore 7 , ciaran clark 6.5 , matt lowton 6 ; cleverley 6.5 ( bacuna 77 ) , westwood 6.5 , delph 7.5 ; nâzogbia 7 ( grealish 59 6 ) ; christian benteke 7.5 , agbonlahor 8 ( weimann 82 )

seven consecutive defeats punctuated by one mighty win
how momentous it proves remains to be seen , the battle will present many turns , but this felt seismic
tim sherwood owes a large dose of gratitude to foster , mind you
in the third minute of added time the west brom goalkeeper launched into a calamitous dive after fumbling a bouncing ball , bringing down matt lowton in the process
referee jonathan moss pointed to the penalty spot
christian benteke was the calmest man in the ground , placing the ball the other side of foster
no longer do aston villa hold the unwanted tag of only side in england âs top four divisions without a league win in 2015
it was earned based on a display of vigour , purpose and creativity
agbonlahor , scorer of aston villa âs first , played his best game in recent memory
west brom boss pulis conceded foster had a â poor night â but refused to blame his no 1
foster looked shaky throughout and played a part earlier in the decisive goal by only palming delph âs shot from long range
he saved leandro bacuna âs rebound but hutton collected the ball and delivered the cross that ultimately led to the penalty award
hutton âs involvement at this stage was moot
he should have been dismissed earlier for a nasty lunge on saido berahino , who received studs into his midriff
lescott appeared to offer hutton down the tunnel in a ruckus
moss booked saido berahino and hutton , meaning retrospective action from the fa on the scottish right - back is unlikely
before christian benteke struck , it had seemed saido berahino âs equaliser would crush aston villa
in the 66th minute the west brom striker applied a simple header from two yards out after lescott had headed back chris brunt âs corner
his 12th premier league goal of the season is only three behind aston villa âs total â an example of their struggles as much as his fine form
foster capped a terrible performance by bringing down matt lowton in the third minute of added time for a penalty saido berahino celebrates while being chased by his team - mates , it was his 18th goal of the season in all competitions aston villa manager tim sherwood ran down the touchline and celebrated vigorously after agbonlahor 's goal agbonlahor beat foster again shortly after but lescott raced back to clear the ball off the line foster saves himself from a howler during the first half after the ball slipped out of his hands and almost ended up in his own net foster initially caught the shot from agbonlahor but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly agbonlahor reacts after west brom keeper foster almost dropped the ball over his own goal line in the first half tim sherwood , who had seen his team lose to an injury time penalty to stoke in his first home match in charge , was in no mood to downplay his first win as aston villa manager
â it was the best feeling in the world , â he said
â when i left home my missus said she had done the euromillions
but i said i would rather have three points all day
â it was massive , huge for us
we deserved to win the game but it was nice to get a slice of luck
i thought we started really well and inspired the fans
the boys in the dressing room want to give them a lot of confidence
â at the end he checked his pulse by pressing fingers to neck
â i was just checking i was still alive , â he laughed
â but we âre alive and kicking
â coming against the club that elected to employ pulis rather than him in their own relegation fight must have offer pleasure
foster almost gifted aston villa the lead in the 14th minute
he can thank goalline technology that parity was maintained
delph sent over a cross that was headed back into danger by christian benteke
agbonlahor spun and hit a tame shot that foster looked like he had collected until the ball squirmed through his legs and apparently over the line before the keeper reclaimed it
replays showed there was an inch in it
in the 23rd minute the home roar was released
brad guzan fired a clearance high and long , christian benteke leapt to win the flick - on and release agbonlahor , whose pace left lescott in the dust
the aston villa striker raced into the box and delivered a finish through the legs of foster , ahead of gareth mcauley âs dive
as villa park erupted , agbonlahor ran in front of the west brom supporters cupping his ear
tim sherwood jigged down the touchline towards the villa park , his hands gripped in fists of delight
it was a similar scene at the final whistle and later a disappointed foster tweeted his apologies
â i love you all , â he said
unfortunately for him , those feeling will be reciprocated by aston villa and their fans
