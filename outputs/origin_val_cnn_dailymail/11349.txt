uefa have announced ticket details for the champions league final in berlin - with each finalist receiving just a 20,000 allocation and prices ranging between Â£ 50 and Â£ 280
the show - piece final of uefa 's premier competition takes place later than usual this year , with 16 clubs still fighting it out for a place in berlin on june 6
tickets for the general public via uefa 's ballot go on sale on thursday at 11am uk time , with 6,000 available to fans worldwide
this season 's champions league final is on june 6 at the 70,500 - capacity olympic stadium in berlin tickets for the show - piece event at the olympic stadium will cost between Â£ 50 and Â£ 280 chelsea , city and arsenal will all hope to be playing in the vast arena come june 6 each club competing in the final will be allocated 20,000 tickets
that would be bad news for season - ticket holders from chelsea ( 24,000 ) , city ( 36,000 ) and arsenal ( 45,000 ) , of whom a significant number would miss out
the ticket prices , split across four categories , represent a price - freeze compared to last year 's final won by real madrid against local rivals atletico madrid in lisbon
but supporters of any english club with their eyes on berlin 's olympic stadium in june could be disappointed with their allocation as chelsea , city and arsenal all have more season - ticket holders than that figure would accommodate
however , the 20,000 figure is more than chelsea were given for their two most recent european finals in munich ( 17,500 ) for the champion league and amsterdam ( 9,800 ) in the europa league
arsenal and chelsea received allocations of 21,000 for their previous finals in paris and moscow respectively
the remaining 24,500 tickets - more than one third of the 70,500 capacity - have been shoehorned for uefa to impress sponsors , corporate partners and their members
season ticket holders from city ( left ) , arsenal ( centre ) and chelsea ( right ) could miss out while city and arsenal face an uphill task to even reach the quarter - final stage after home first - leg defeats to barcelona and monaco respectively , chelsea will hope their 1 - 1 draw away at psg will be enough to help them through in the return leg at stamford bridge next wednesday

those lucky enough to secure themselves a ticket through the ballot will be informed by april 10
