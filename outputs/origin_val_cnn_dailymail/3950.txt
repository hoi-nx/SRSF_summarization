alaska wildlife officials are preparing to release north america 's largest land mammal into its native american habitat for the first time in more than a century
the alaska department of fish and game plans to begin moving wood bison , which can weigh up to 2,000 pounds and stand six - feet - tall at the shoulder , from a conservation center near anchorage to the village of shageluk
a hundred wood bison will be released into the innoko flats about 350 miles southwest of fairbanks in a few weeks after they 're acclimated
two containers will be trucked sunday to anchorage and flown by commercial carrier for the hour flight to shageluk
a c-130 from lynden air cargo , one of the multiple corporate sponsors involved , can carry two containers each flight
half the initial herd moved will be adult cows
the rest of the herd will be juveniles two years old or younger
bulls will be barged to the area in summer
wood bison feed on grasses , sedges and forbs and wider variety of other plants like the state 's abundant willow biologist harms said : ' this has been an incredibly long project - 23 years in the making , ' to say we 're excited is an understatement
' the state hopes to complete the flights by tuesday but will proceed slowly if there are snags
wood bison are very large , very powerful wild animals , harms said
she added : ' we 're making them do something they do n't want to do / ' once in shageluk , the bison will be kept in pens several acres large before being released in two or three week after ' they 're in good shape '
wood bison are the larger of two subspecies of american bison but did not roam in lower 48 states
the smaller subspecies are plains bison , which were not native to alaska but were introduced to the state in 1928 , where they have thrived
wood bison flourished for thousands of years in alaska but disappeared in the 1800s or early 1900s
they feed on grasses , sedges and forbs and wider variety of other plants , including alaska 's abundant willow
the state had a strong interest in reintroduction as a source of food for subsistence hunters and as a game animal for sport hunting , but plans ran into a political snag
wood bison flourished for thousands of years in alaska but disappeared in the 1800s or early 1900s in 2008 , the state imported 53 wood bison from a national park in canada , adding to a smaller herd that was held at the alaska wildlife conservation center in portage
however , wood bison are a threatened species and state officials worried that the federal government would designate their new home in the wild as critical habitat , requiring consultation with federal agencies before oil and gas drilling or other development could occur
the problems were worked out
the us fish and wildlife service in 2013 declared that wood bison reintroduced in alaska would be considered an experimental population not essential to the continued existence of the species
the wood bison will be managed by state wildlife officials and exempt from certain restrictions in the endangered species act
the fish and game department does not expect predators to be a problem
biologist harms said : ' wolves do n't seem to know what to do with them
' alaska did not record a bear or a wolf killing a plains bison until nearly 30 years after they were introduced 87 years ago .
