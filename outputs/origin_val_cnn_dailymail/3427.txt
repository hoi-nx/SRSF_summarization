the boss of the bbc is on a collision course with mps after he insisted the licence fee will work for at least another ten years
last week , the culture , media and sport select committee said the Â£ 145.50 - a - year charge was â anachronistic â and should be scrapped within the next decade in favour of a flat - rate broadcast levy on all households
but lord hall , the the corporation âs director - general , insisted yesterday that the licence fee â has got at least another ten years in it â , adding : â i think it could go well beyond that
â not dead yet : bbc director - general lord lord hall has said he believes the licence fee â has got at least another ten years in it â even if the fee is axed , he said it should be replaced by an equivalent charge
despite mps painting a damning picture of the bbc â which they said had blown billions of pounds of licence fee payers â money trying to be â all things to all people â â lord hall was optimistic
' i think the committee âs report should really be commended because they have raised something which says , you know what , the licence fee is nât dead , â he said
â the bbc ai nât dead
actually , it âs got a real future
â bbc is watching : the bbc has unveiled plans to ask users of its news app and iplayer catch - up service to sign up to â mybbc â , so it can learn about individuals â viewing habits mps said last week that a blanket levy on all households â not just those with televisions â should replace the licence fee which has funded the bbc for the past 69 years
yesterday , lord hall backed the proposal , but said it was simply â another way of the licence fee being modernised â
but he also warned that the bbc risks â sleepwalking into decay â unless it reinvents itself for the internet age by collecting users â data
lord hall said the corporation is in danger of becoming â irrelevant â if it does not gather information about viewers to tailor its services , in a similar way to amazon and netflix
his remarks came as the bbc unveiled plans to ask users of its news app and iplayer catch - up service to sign up to â mybbc â , so it can learn about individuals â viewing habits and send them recommendations for other programmes and articles .
