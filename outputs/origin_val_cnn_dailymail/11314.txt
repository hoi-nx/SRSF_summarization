nazis fled to argentina , paraguay , brazil , uruguay , chilean and bolivia
argentina was earmarked as a prime haven for the nazi 's elite - such as auschwitz medic dr josef mengele and holocaust organiser eichmann - to get to when nazism collapsed in 1945
locals believe that a house in the forest belonged to hitler 's right - hand man martin bormann , but mr daniel schavelzon dismissed this as ' an urban myth '
instead , archaeologists suspect that the ruins of three buildings in the teyu cuare park in the north of the country were part of a nazi hideout built by supporters while the war in europe still raged , the clarin newspaper reported
the cluster of three buildings are obscured from view by thick undergrowth and are only accessible with a machete

at least 180 nazi war criminals were known to have fled to argentina coins bearing nazi insignia and dated from 1938 were found amid the rubble ' apparently , halfway through the second world war , the nazis had a secret project of building shelters for top leaders in the event of defeat inaccessible sites , in the middle of deserts , in the mountains , on a cliff or in the middle of the jungle like this , ' said archaeologist mr daniel schavelzon
the researchers believe , however , that , the nazis never ended up using the hideout
by the time they landed , with europe in ruins , they had smuggled out enough gold and money to live comfortable lives under the radar in cities or on ranches out on the sprawling pampas

' there seems to be no other explanation , other than that these structures were meant to serve as a hide out for nazis , because it would have been expensive to build them in such an inaccessible place , ' said daniel schavelzon
eichmann , who was responsible for getting millions of jewish victims on board trains to take them to extermination camps in nazi occupied poland , was found living in a buenos aires suburb and kidnapped by israel mossad commandos in 1961
