scientists have discovered a frog in ecuador that can rapidly change its skin patterns to mimic the texture it sits on
spotted in the western andean cloud forest , the creature is believed to be the first known amphibian to have this shape - shifting capability
researchers claim the ability to change skin texture to reflect its surroundings may enable the frog to camouflage itself from birds and other predators â but say this has yet to be proven
krynak spotted the spiny frog , which nearly the width of a marble , sitting on a moss - covered leaf
the krynaks captured the frog , and nicknamed it ' punk rocker ' because of the thorn - like spines covering its body
the next day , ms krynak pulled the frog from the cup and set it on a smooth white sheet of plastic
it was n't ' punk ' - it was smooth - skinned
the new species , called pristimantis mutabilis - or mutable rainfrog - was discovered by a case western reserve university phd student and her husband at reserva las gralarias
this image shows how the frog changes from spiky to almost smooth in just over 300 seconds they assumed that , much to her dismay , she must have picked up the wrong frog
' i then put the frog back in the cup and added some moss , ' she said
' the spines came back ... we simply could n't believe our eyes , our frog changed skin texture
' i put the frog back on the smooth white background
' ' the spines and colouration help them blend into mossy habitats , making it hard for us to see them , ' she said
' but whether the texture really helps them elude predators still needs to be tested
' in this image , one of the frogs can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs , where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside this is the astonishing ' glass ' frog which manages to elude its predators with its see through skin - rendering it almost invisible
the fleischmann 's glass frog looks as if it is changing colour as it moves , as the background shows through its transparent flesh
the bizarre camouflage means you can still see its heart , intestines , and red blood vessels
photographer thomas marent snapped the frogs - with bulging yellow eyes - underneath leaves at a nature reserve in choco , colombia
in this image , one of the frogs can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs , where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside
during the next three years , a team of fellow biologists studied the frogs
they found the animals shift skin texture in a little more than three minutes
a separate research them at universidad tecnolã³gica indoamã©rica , ecuador , discovered that primates sobetes , a relative with similar markings but about twice the size of p. mutabilis , has the same trait
because the appearance of animals has long been one of the keys to identifying them as a certain species , the researchers believe could mean many species have been missed .
