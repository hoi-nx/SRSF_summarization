jerusalem netanyahu appears poised to keep his job as israeli 's prime minister , declaring victory wednesday following a bitter campaign punctuated by his last - minute appeals to right - wing voters
for weeks , netanyahu 's likud party trailed in opinion polls to the zionist union alliance that characterized him as a divisive leader not up to the task of making the lives of ordinary israeli better
those polls turned out to be wrong
instead , the likud party grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the knesset , israeli 's parliament , according to unofficial numbers from the israeli election committee , based on 99 % of the vote
its leaders will have the first chance at forming a coalition government
the zionist union came in second , with at least 24 seats
" against all odds , against all odds , we achieved this huge victory for likud , " netanyahu told jubilant supporters not long after the polls closed tuesday
" we achieved the huge victory for our people
and i am proud , i am proud for the people of israeli that in the moment of truth , knew to make the right decision and to choose the real material things over immaterial things
" rather than courting voters in the middle , netanyahu pivoted more to the right with appeals concerning israeli 's security
two weeks ago , he made a controversial speech to the u.s. congress warning of any deal with iran on its nuclear program
then , a few days ago , he declared there would be no palestinian state so long as he 's prime minister -- reversing an earlier position and putting him at odds again with the obama administration 's support for a two - state solution
on tuesday , he released a video on facebook claiming leftists were bringing " huge amounts " of arab by bus to vote against likud
arab make up about 20 % of israeli 's population
" the right regime is in danger , " netanyahu said
" we have an urgent wake - up call
bring your friends , bring your family , vote for likud
" those appeals appear " to have energized that right - wing base , " according to cnn 's elise labott
netanyahu still has to form a new government , a process that president reuven rivlin said he hopes will start sunday
if the likud leader does so -- as expected -- it will leave israeli not much different than it was before the election , with a conservative netanyahu still the dominant force facing a dug - in opposition
5 questions about netanyahu 's apparent victory herzog , who led the zionist union , called netanyahu to concede defeat
but he and fellow opposition leader tzipi livni wo n't go away , with herzog insisting that " nothing has changed
" " this is not the time for coalitions and governments , " herzog said , apparently ruling out joining forces with netanyahu as the labor party has done before
" i think what israeli is most in need of is an alternative voice that continues to say the truth
" and i 'm telling everyone , ' believe , a change will come
' " official results will not be released until next week , with the process of building coalitions expected to take much longer
no party has ever won a majority of seats in the knesset , meaning coalition governments are as old as the modern state of israeli
the victory goes to the party leader most suited to put together a 61 - seat majority
miller , an ex-adviser to the united states government on arab - israeli negotiations now with the wilson center , predicts former israeli communications minister moshe kahlon will be the " kingmaker " in any coalition government deal based on the support his kulanu party got tuesday
how does israeli 's parliament work ? there 's no guarantee netanyahu will form such a coalition and stay as prime minister
but he 's got a better chance than anyone , and overnight he vowed to work " quickly and responsibly to form a new government
" " our country 's everyday reality does n't give us the luxury for delay , " netanyahu said
if he does lead the next government , he will soon go down in history as the prime minister with the longest continuous tenure in israeli -- thanks to his back - to - back - to - back election wins
many woke up wednesday questioning all those polls suggesting that netanyahu 's latest six - year term could be coming to an end
israeli media outlets released surveys suggesting that either the zionist union would win the vote or , at least , finish in a dead heat with likud
exit polls from israeli 's three major broadcasters showed the two parties neck and neck , not the apparent five - seat advantage that likud appears to have secured
so what happened ? pollster degani , who predicted a likud win all along , said other pollsters relied too heavily on internet technology and should have done more surveying by phone
" the internet does not represent the state of israeli and the people of israeli , " degani said , referring to modern statistical methods
" it represents panels , and the panels are biased strongly to the center
" as netanyahu 's win reverberates , one question remains : did he gain extra seats because of an 11th - hour surge , or were the major polls skewed from the beginning ? why were the election polls so wrong ? netanyahu maintained hard - line positions on settlements and negotiations with palestinian , but his opposition appeared more open to talks and more focused on economic , social and other issues within israeli
erakat , the palestinian chief negotiator with israeli , said , " the results of the israeli elections show the success of a campaign platform based on settlements , racism , apartheid and the denial of fundamental human rights of the palestinian people
" such a result would not have been possible had the international community held israeli to account for its systematic violations of international law , " said erakat , who works under palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas
opinion : will netanyahu win seal iran deal ? the post-election view from hamas , the islamist political and militant movement that controls gaza and is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union , appeared more resigned
" hamas does n't see any difference between the israeli parties because they all share the denial of our people 's rights and keeps assaulting them ( people ) , " said sami abu zuhri , a hamas spokesman , suggesting that it did n't matter much who prevailed tuesday
" we assure that the palestinian resistance is strong and can impose the facts
" miller , the wilson center scholar , says he does n't think that netanyahu will necessarily hold his hard campaign line on the palestinian forming their own state if and when he starts his next term
but that does n't mean an elusive peace deal is coming anytime soon
" i think the two - state solution , sadly , is in a bermuda triangle , sandwiched between a situation that 's too hard for it to be implemented and too important for all of the parties -- including the prime minister , despite what he said , " miller said
