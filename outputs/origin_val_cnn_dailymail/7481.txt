after 30 years of silence , 71 - year - old causley has finally opened up about the murder of packman , who disappeared from her family home in bournemouth in june 1985
for 11 years , causley had concocted a false story about his wife 's whereabouts
but , after being investigated by police for a separate insurance scam , causley was convicted of her murder in 1996 , despite ms packman 's body never being found
a daughter is urging her father causley , 71 ( left ) to reveal where he has hidden the body of her murdered mother packman ( right ) now samantha gillingham , 46 , is begging for her depraved father to reveal the whereabouts of her mother 's body , as the 30th anniversary of her disappearance approaches
the former aircraft engineer had suggested meeting with the family so he could finally reveal what had happened - but he cancelled the confrontation , just days before it was due to go ahead
mrs samantha gillingham said : ' it is my father who approached us to speak , we responded to listen to what he has to say , only for him to cancel four days before
' i am asking for help ; i need to ask once again if there is anything that someone knows , who has not previously come forward for whatever reason - please rethink on your silence
' ms packman , 40 , and causley - both wealthy , middle - class aircraft engineers - had been having several marital problems when she went missing
mrs samantha gillingham , then 16 , later discovered a scrawled note from her mother saying she had left and wanted no further contact with the family
it came 12 months after causley had moved his mistress patricia - a colleague - into the family ; s ipswich road home , under the pretence that she needed somewhere to stay
following ms packman 's disappearance , causley changed his name by deed poll from packman to causley , the surname of his lover
samantha gillingham ( left ) , who was 16 when her mother ( right ) disappeared , said she needs to know where her mother 's body is so she can gain closure on the horrific incident the family lived a respectable , middle - class life in bournemouth , dorset , until causley ( centre ) moved his mistress patricia into the family home , 12 months before ms packman ( left ) disappeared he then created a cover story about ms packman 's disappearance , to convince friends and family she was still alive
mrs samantha gillingham believed her mother had abandoned the family
but 11 years later , causley was jailed for two years after he tried to fake his own death in a boating accident in a million - pound insurance scam
ms causley was also handed a 12 - month suspended sentence for conspiring to defraud
but , more importantly , the investigation led detectives to reopen the case into ms packman 's disappearance
causley was then charged with her murder before being convicted in 1996 at winchester crown court
it was one of the first uk cases where a murder conviction was secured without a body being found
causley 's conviction was quashed on appeal in 2003 but he was found guilty again at a retrial the following year
he then concoted an elaborate story about where ms packman had gone , to convince friends and family she was still alive
pictured : ms packman ( left ) , causley ( centre ) and mrs samantha gillingham as a child ( right ) while in prison , causley confessed to three inmates that he had killed his wife
he is also said to have told one that he gassed her before dissolving her body in acid
he then made further admissions in august last year , at which time mrs samantha gillingham and her family were given hope that he would tell them everything , in exchange for being moved to a lower - category prison
but six months later , that promise has still come to nothing
mrs samantha gillingham added : ' for the first time i am asking if there is anyone with legal or forensic ability who would be able to offer their professional services or who would be able to finance such services
' i feel acutely embarrassed to ask for something where i am unable to pay
i need to find my mother
my mother did not deserve this
' mrs samantha gillingham ( pictured with her father during a family holiday in the 80s ) wants those with legal or forensic skills to be able to help in the search meanwhile , mrs samantha gillingham 's 26 - year - old son neil called his grandfather ' scum ' and said he continues to ' rip the family apart with his malicious poison '
he said : ' he has n't engaged , he continues to take the same arrogant , obnoxious stance and although he admits his guilt i feel this is a ploy to gain early release without giving closure
' he continues to rip our family apart with his malicious poison
my grandfather is a dangerous man , this has now been confirmed
' i want answers fast , i need support and i want to ask for support from those who can make a change
' he added : ' i want to appeal for anyone with forensic experience to assist me in finding the missing pieces in that jigsaw - those with technical knowledge , lawyers , politicians , anyone who may have known something - to come forward
mrs samantha gillingham 's son neil , 26 , ( right ) said his grandfather was ' scum ' and has ' ripped the family apart ' ' i am determined to make a change , this is unacceptable that a convicted murderer can continue to torment and systematically destroy my family with such disregard from behind prison doors
' he is scum and we should be supported to ensure that we put a stop on this from continuing
he should die behind bars
' detective inspector mark samuel from dorset police said : ' i ca n't begin to imagine the frustration felt by the family
since the parole hearing we 've re-interviewed causley in prison and revisited the address at ipswich road and we 're grateful for the co-operation of the current owners and neighbours
' i would like to emphasise how determined we are to find closure and get to the truth in this matter
' only one person holds the key to this , causley holds all of the information and we too appeal to him to invite us to come and speak to him
' there are powers in place that allow us to meet with him , but it needs his willingness to physically talk
' causley is at hmp littlehey in cambridgeshire and is due to face the parole board again this summer .
