somers ' exit leaves the ibrox club with just two directors , chief executive derek llambias and finance director barry leach
both can now expect to be swept out of the club when shareholders meet at ibrox to vote
james easdale resigned his directorship last week in the face of growing fan opposition and the signs are now clear that king is on the verge of grabbing control of the glasgow giants
now the rst have told derek llambias and barry leach to accept defeat
in a statement containing derogatory comments about somers , barry leach and derek llambias , the fans group said : ' we are delighted that somers has finally resigned as chairman of rangers
we note that his parting comments are entirely in keeping with his behaviour during his time at the club
somers , pictured here in the stands at ibrox , was a deeply divisive figure amongst supporters ' he will be remembered as one of the most inept and embarrassing chairmen of our wonderful sporting institution
' our focus now turns to the remaining directors
they should do the right thing , appoint the nominee directors and then follow mr somers out of the door
mr barry leach should have resigned when he made disparaging comments about major shareholders in a meeting with fans
he should be suspended and subject to disciplinary procedures after the general meeting
' the statement also criticised the process which led to derek llambias ' appointment as chief executive and the board 's threats of legal action against the outgoing representatives of the rangers fans board
the statement described derek llambias ' position as ' untenable '
somers sits on a number of company boards - including zenith bank , europe arab bank and the fujitsu technologies international pension plan - and it is understood he did not want to risk his reputation by being forcibly removed from the ibrox boardroom
supporters want fiace director barry leach ( second from the right ) to resign as well in his resignation statement , he said : ' i have resigned as chairman of rangers international football club plc. i have worked in the city of london , the world 's greatest financial centre for decades and enjoyed considerable success
' when i was approached about the chairmanship of rangers , friends warned me that the world of football has different rules and codes of behaviour
i now know that is a gross understatement
' i am a non-confrontational man and have always tried to bring harmony to boardrooms and with stakeholders
' at the risk of antagonising my army of critics i would point out that rangers managed to pay its bills and avoid going under during my tenure
' these critics might not agree with how we achieved this
i look forward to alternative solutions from whoever is running the club in the future
' despite the personal attacks on me from various sources i genuinely wish the club the very best in the future and i am confident that with such a passionate and vociferous fan base they will be restored to their former glories
' the chartered accountant was appointed to his light blues role just weeks ahead of the club 's annual general meeting in december 2013
but it was his performance in front of last year 's shareholder summit which saw him heckled by furious shareholders
king has won his battle for control of rangers and wants to rid the club of derek llambias and barry leach responding to the flak coming from the ibrox stands , he said : ' when you are chairman of rangers , you can do it your way
' somers also took over executive duties for a short spell at the end of october after graham wallace quit as chief executive in protest at mike ashley 's growing influence at the club
but he caused further outrage when a leaked email appeared to show him threatening to sink the newcastle owner 's planned loan deal if his place on the board was put in jeopardy by a rival Â£ 16million bid lodged by king
the south africa - based former oldco director was rebuffed at that point but the stage has now been set for him to return to glasgow and claim the chairmanship from somers
he needs to win a majority vote on friday to oust mike ashley 's boardroom appointments derek llambias and barry leach from the club , and if successful plans to replace them with former blue knight paul murray , ex-glasgow brewery boss john gilligan and himself
the castlemilk - born millionaire already holds 14.57 per cent of the club 's shares , while the three bears - douglas park , george letham and george taylor - are in control of another combined 19.49 per cent
the rst has been collecting shares and proxies from minor shareholders - with former manager walter smith the latest to gift control of his stake - along with fellow fans group rangers first but with somers and easdale both making a run for it , victory appears inevitable
