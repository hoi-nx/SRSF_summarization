in seven years as monaco boss arsene wenger was never once distracted by the lure of its famous casino
' i spent a lot of time on the football pitches , i do n't think anyone saw me in there , ' said arsene wenger , as he arrived at the stade louis ii on monday night , aware that on his first competitive return to monte carlo he will be expected to gamble
arsenal paid the price for taking risks in the first leg and lost 3 - 1
as a result history is stacked against them
in the champions league era , no team has overturned a deficit of two or more goals having played at home first
arsene wenger knows he will be expected to gamble when he returns to monaco for tuesday night 's match arsenal manager arsene wenger walks on the pitch at the stade louis ii on monday night ahead of their match arsenal will have to shine if they are to reverse the 3 - 1 deficit to reach the champions league quarter - finals gabriel paulista , tomas rosicky , mertesacker , santi cazorla , alexis sanchez , theo walcott and mesut ozil ( from left to right ) pictured during training on monday delve back into the champions league and ajax were the last to manage it , when they needed a play - off to beat benfica in 1969
arsene wenger was still playing for mutzig in the france third division back then , and monaco manager jardim was not yet born
' the statistics are against us , we are conscious of that , ' said the arsenal boss
' we have to give absolutely everything to make the stats lie
we believe we can do it and i 'm confident we will
if we did n't believe we would n't be here
' we totally missed the first leg , which was surprising
we did not play well
sometimes in life if you miss a chance , you do not have a second chance , but we do , so we will play it fully
' but he would not commit to a gung - ho charge from the outset
' early goals or late goals but we need full power and must not forget the organisation and structure of the team , ' he added
disturbing stats lay behind the headline stat. monaco have not lost a european tie at the stade louis ii for 10 years
and they have not lost one at home by a score which would knock them out since leeds won 3 - 0 here , nearly 20 years ago
arsenal must score three and hope to keep jardim 's team at bay , something they were unable to do in london
arsene wenger has no shortage of creative flair at his disposal and backed france striker olivier giroud , who has scored six in seven , to make amends for chances missed at the emirates
it might be easier if monaco were not so miserly
but this team is built on a stern defence
they have conceded only once in the last 12 home games and did not let in a goal in three home champions league group games
despite all this , arsenal captain mertesacker echoed the idea that belief in the camp is strong , and has been improved by a team meeting in the aftermath of the first - leg defeat , three weeks ago
monaco coach jardim speaks during his champions league press conference on monday jardim feels arsenal still pose a threat even if monaco carry a 3 - 1 lead from their first leg win at the emirates monaco striker dimitar berbatov stretches as he joins the rest of his team - mates for a training session monaco train at their base in la turbie in france as they prepare for the second leg against arsenal ' we have a second leg in this competition , thank god , ' said mertesacker
' a lot of things went not so well in the first game , especially a few decisions which did not go for us
' we know in the first leg we were n't up for it mentally
from the start you could feel that there was a bit of pressure and we could n't cope
' we feel like after that game we moved on and improved a lot
that is why we are confident that even away from home , we can beat any team in the world
' obviously we did something wrong to get that result but we can learn
we need a good performance
it is not going to be easy , but we would like to show a different face

vice-president vadim vasilyev met arsene wenger on his return to stade louis ii and presented him with a framed collection of photographs to mark his time at the club
arsene wenger seemed more concerned about the state of the pitch and went out to inspect , even though his players had trained in english , earlier in the day
he came back with a positive pitch report
arsenal 's support in the 18,000 - capacity stadium is expected to be boosted by their france fan - base , which is another by - product of the arsene wenger years , and they can cling to one positive statistic : the londoners have not lost in 10 games in france
even then , it might not be enough
' paris saint-germain knocked out chelsea and showed the quality of work being done here in france , ' monaco boss jardim warned
' who knows , this might be the year when france beat the english
