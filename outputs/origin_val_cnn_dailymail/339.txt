at least one lab employee has tested positive for a deadly bacteria used to make bioweapons that mysteriously escaped a louisiana research center in november
additionally , the number of monkey 's infected by the bioterror bacterium at the tulane prime research center has increased from eight to nine and are expected to continue rising , officials say
three of the monkeys have already been euthanized after showing signs of burkholderia pseudomallei , which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500 - acre facility
the test results showed the employee was ' just at the threshold for a verified positive result ' and has not shown any symptoms of the diseases the bacteria can bring on , such as tuberculosis , according to nola.com
despite thorough investigations by bothb federal and state authorities , including the cdc , the cause of the contamination is still unknown
concerns : monkeys at the tulane national primate research center in louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened reach : worryingly , the center is close to a river ( top left ) , homes and a school
although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria , further tests are required the name of the employee has not been released
questions also remain over how far the bacteria , which is primarily found in southeast asia and northeast australia , has spread around the complex and surrounding areas
animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas
the bacteria may not cause an illness until days or years after the exposure , but the illness can be fatal in humans and animals , according to usa today
the monkeys , rhesus macaques , had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages , where around 4,000 macaques are kept
it is not yet known if the bacteria have colonized in the cages
worryingly , the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes
and only yards behind the facility , there is a river that leads to a lake surrounded by wildlife refuges
the contaminated primates were all at the center 's veterinary hospital at the same time last fall , leading to speculation that they could have been exposed there
infected : at least seven rhesus macaques ( file picture ) have shown signs of exposure and three have died potentially deadly : burkholderia pseudomallei the bacteria , burkholderia pseudomallei , can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis
melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a range of symptoms including fever , headache , appetite loss , muscle and joint pain
the illness may not develop for days to years
it is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis , and if left untreated , it is fatal
several countries have looked into using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics
the overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in thailand , where the bacteria is endemic , it is up to 50 per cent
the bacteria , which is primarily found in southeast asia and northeast australia , has never been found in nature in the u.s. last week , tests by the cdc determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria , bring the number of infected monkeys to seven
the cdc will now be looking at safety and health practices at the veterinary hospital , the agency said
richard ebright , a biosafety expert from rutgers university in new jersey , previously told usa today that the release was worrying
' the fact that they ca n't identify how this release occurred is very concerning , ' he said
' human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident
' the easiest way to transfer something from one place where it 's supposed to be , to another where it is n't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other
' state officials are planning to test wildlife and domestic animals around the facility to see if they have been exposed
the u.s. department of agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners , veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed
authorities have previously said they are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk
only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds and 13 from water - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in thailand
those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area , suggesting there was no public health risk .
