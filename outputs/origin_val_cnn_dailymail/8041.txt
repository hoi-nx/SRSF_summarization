if a column in honor of heart health suggests a can of coke as a snack , you might want to read the fine print
the world 's biggest beverage maker , which struggles with declining soda consumption in the u.s. , is working with fitness and nutrition experts who suggest its cola as a healthy treat
in february , for instance , several wrote online pieces for american heart month , with each including a mini-can of coke or small soda as a snack idea
the mentions â which appeared on nutrition blogs and other sites including those of major newspapers â show the many ways food companies work behind the scenes to cast their products in a positive light , often with the help of third parties who are seen as trusted authorities
challenges : coke , which struggles with declining soda consumption in the u.s. , is working with fitness and nutrition experts who suggest its cola as a healthy treat ( file photo ) ben sheidler , a coke spokesman , compared the february posts to product placement deals a company might have with tv shows
' we have a network of dietitians we work with , ' said ben sheidler , who declined to say how much the company pays experts
' every big brand works with bloggers or has paid talent
' other companies including kellogg and general mills have used strategies like providing continuing education classes for dietitians , funding studies that burnish the nutritional images of their products and offering newsletters for health experts
pepsico inc. has also worked with dietitians who suggest its frito-lay and tostito chips in local tv segments on healthy eating
others use nutrition experts in sponsored content ; the american pistachio growers has quoted a dietitian for the new england patriots in a piece on healthy snacks and recipes and nestle has quoted its own executive in a post about infant nutrition
for coca-cola co. , the public relations strategy with health experts in february focused on the theme of ' heart health & black history month
' the effort yielded a radio segment and multiple online pieces
one post refers to a ' refreshing beverage option such as a mini can of coke
' another suggests ' portion - controlled versions of your favorites , like coke mini cans , packs of almonds or pre-portioned desserts for a meal
' the focus on the smaller cans is n't surprising
sugary drinks have come under fire for fueling obesity rates and related ills , and the last time coke 's annual u.s. soda volume increased was in 2002 , according to the industry tracker beverage digest
more recently , the company is pushing its mini-cans as a guilt - free way to enjoy cola
the cans also fetch higher prices on a per ounce basis , so even if people are drinking less soda , coke says it can grow sales
in a statement , coke said it wants to ' help people make decisions that are right for them ' and that like others in the industry , it works with health experts ' to help bring context to the latest facts and science around our products and ingredients
' it said any communications by the experts it works with contain the appropriate disclosures
most of the pieces suggesting mini-cokes say in the bios that the author is a ' consultant ' for food companies , including coke
some add that the ideas expressed are their own
one column is marked at the bottom as a ' sponsored article , ' which is an ad designed to look like a regular story
it ran on more than 1,000 sites , including those of major news outlets around the country
the other posts were not marked as sponsored content , but follow a similar format
ben sheidler , a coke spokesman , has compared the february posts - which mentioned a mini-can of coke or small soda as a snack idea - to product placement deals a company might have with tv shows ( file ) mcbride , who teaches media ethics at the poynter institute , said the phrasing of the disclosure that the author is a ' consultant ' for food companies , including coke , does n't make it clear the author was specifically paid by coke for the column
' this is an example of opaque sponsored content , ' mcbride said
the academy of nutrition and dietetics , a professional group for dietitians , says in its code of ethics that practitioners promote and endorse products ' only in a manner that is not false and misleading
' a spokesman for the academy did not respond when asked if the posts on mini-cokes meet those guidelines
meanwhile , a group called dietitians for professional integrity has called for sharper lines to be drawn between dietitians and companies
andy bellatti , one of its founders , said companies court dietitians because they help validate corporate messages
the message that coke can be a healthy snack is debatable
alice lichtenstein , a professor of nutrition science and policy at tufts university and a member of the nutrition committee at the american heart association , said a smaller can of soda might be a ' move in the right direction ' for someone who regularly drinks soda
still , she would n't recommend soda as a snack
the health experts who wrote the pieces mentioning coke stand by their recommendations
flipse , the dietitian who wrote the sponsored article for coke , said she would suggest mini-cans of coke even if she was n't being paid
although she does n't drink soda herself , she said the smaller cans are a way for people who like soda to enjoy it sensibly
' i absolutely think that i provided valuable information , ' she said
flipse said the idea to mention mini-cans of coke in the post was hers and came about after a public relations agency for coke suggested a piece on heart health and asked what she might ' work in
' flipse has worked with coke and the american beverage association for years ; her roles have included sending out messages on social media refuting the idea that sugary drinks are to blame for obesity and making herself available as an expert for news outlets
if a story says something negative about artificial sweeteners , flipse said she might contact the pr agency and ask , ' do you want me to do something about that ? ' sylvia melendez-klinger , a dietitian who wrote another piece mentioning mini- cans of soda , said it 's important that health professionals share their expertise with companies and that her work reflects her own views
she said she could not recall if she was paid for her article mentioning mini-sodas .
