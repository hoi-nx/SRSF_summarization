guests at a wedding service saw triple when three identical sisters tied the knot together at the same ceremony
triplets rafaela , rochele and tagiane bini share the same birthday , the same looks and tastes , and now - after marrying men who look strikingly similar - the same wedding anniversary too
the 29 - year - old sisters , from passo fundo , southern brazil , even wore the same wedding dress , as well as hair style and make up , for their big day on saturday
even the grooms - rafael , gabriel and eduardo - admitted they had worried they might mix up their wives - to - be when it came to exchanging vows
rafael , who married rafaela , told how the girls sometimes deliberately confused their fiances
he remembered : ' there was a time when we were all in the kitchen making dinner
so rochele , who is gabriel 's , was doing stuff at the sink , and rafaela was at the stove
' we were there chatting and they changed places
i went behind to hug her , and said " oops " when i realised i 'd got the wrong girl
' on the day , though , the men insisted they did n't have a problem recognising the loves of their lives
' oh yes , i knew which one was mine , for sure
i knew as soon as she entered the church , she was the most beautiful , ' said eduardo , who married tagiane bini
the sisters told how , like other identical siblings , they have always been close and shared the same tastes and interests since they were babies
bond : like many identical siblings , the sisters told how they have always been close and shared the same tastes and interests since they were babies together : it was parents pedro and salete who suggested the girls all get married together after tagiane bini also got engaged to eduardo their parents , pedro and salete , already had one daughter , liziele , when they decided to increase the family - but never imagined three more girls would come at once
mother salete fainted when she was told she was expecting triplets , according to the girls
rafaela was the first to find her future husband , rafael , ten years ago while studying at university
a year later , rochele got together with gabriel
it was parents pedro and salete who suggested the girls all get married together after tagiane bini also got engaged to eduardo
the only dilemma for pedro , a farmer , was how he would walk all three daughters down the aisle at once
he said : ' we decided that we would all walk down the aisle until half way down the church
from there , i would take one at a time
' the pews at the nossa senhora aparecida catholic cathedral in passo fundo were moved apart to allow more space for the three brides to walk down the aisle together
they were followed by 18 bridesmaids and page boys , each using the chosen colour of the bride they were representing , yellow for rafaela , blue for rochele and red for tagiane bini
the first to be taken to the altar by their father was tagiane bini , who was the first to be born
she remembered : ' i tried to hold back my emotion , but i could n't
to see my dad there , at that moment , was a feeling i ca n't explain
' event : the pews at the nossa senhora aparecida catholic cathedral in passo fundo were moved apart to allow more space for the three brides to walk down the aisle together lookalike : the girls explained how they all went together to get their hair and make - up done with the intention of looking different - but they all ended up liking the same style the girls explained how they all went together to get their hair and make - up done with the intention of looking different
but , said rochele , ' we tried a number of styles , but we all liked the same one
it 's not even worth trying , it always ends up like that
' after the ceremony , the fact that there were three bouquets to be caught was not lost on the female guests , according to the sisters
and for eduardo , the fact that triplets run in their wives family has n't put the husbands off
he said : ' we 're going to think about starting our family
if we have triplets , it wo n't be easy , but they will be a blessing and we'lll raise them with love
