stuart lancaster has urged twickenham to will england to victory on saturday evening as he prepares to order his rbs 6 nations title hopefuls to carry the game to france
stuart lancaster believes the noisy support of a sold - out 82,000 home crowd will have a critical role to play in edging rivals ireland and wales for championship glory on a nerve - jangling final day of staggered kick - offs
england are favourites to lift a first piece of silverware under stuart lancaster and their head coach refuses to view the match through the prism of the looming world cup on these shores
england scrum half ben youngs fires out a pass as courtney lawes and joe marler ( left ) watch on ' it will be hugely important that the crowd get behind the team , ' stuart lancaster said
' if there 's ever a day when we need the crowd to push us over the line and give us the momentum we need then it 's saturday
' whether we just need to get the win or win by 10 points or whatever it might take , the crowd will have a huge part to play
' this game is not about the world cup , it 's about winning the championship
and that 's all it 's about
it 's about saturday night only
' our mindset is to go and win the game
we ca n't play just to hang in there
we have to have a front foot mentality and have an intensity and tempo to our game from the first minute
' england fly half george ford winds up a pass in training at his side 's team base at pennyhill park england head coach start lancaster has backed his side to handle the pressure of their final day shoot - out england enter the final round of matches with a points cushion of plus four and having digested earlier results from wales ' trip to italy and ireland 's visit to edinburgh , their victory target against france will be made clear
the scheduling appears to have favoured england , but stuart lancaster insists providing the climax to the tournament creates its own challenges
' i do n't think we can be seen as favourites
i do n't think anyone can
it will play out on the day , ' stuart lancaster said
' whether the staggered kick - offs help us depends on what the other scores are
' if we have to win by 20 , psychologically if you concede seven points in the first five minutes and then a penalty , you then have to score 30
' psychologically it 's an interesting dynamic for the players to manage
the danger is that sometimes you can want to chase the game too early rather than build the score
' it 's an 80 - minute game
knowing that is one thing , but dealing with everything that 's around it puts incredible pressure on the players
the england squad gather for a huddle at the end of their training session as lancaster looks on from afar former france no 8 imanol harinordoquy insists all the pressure will be on england on saturday ' on the staggered kick - off times , we all know the rules when we start
' stuart lancaster has made one change to the starting xv , promoting lock geoff at the expense of dave , who drops out of the 23 altogether , with nick recalled to the bench
dave has started all four matches of the tournament but misses out on the final instalment with stuart lancaster believing the street-wise easter is a better option to reinforce the final push for silverware
' when you boil it down , it 's the experience that geoff brings
he did n't go on the lions tour by accident , he 's a high quality player , ' stuart lancaster said
' dave is a very good player who has lots of qualities , but nick will make a stronger impact from the bench and that 's why the decision was made
' dave understood the decision
there were performance reasons as well
it was n't just done because of geoff
there are areas of dave 's game we 've been asking him to improve on
' it was a difficult conversation but ultimately done on a performance point of view
dave accepted it and knows the areas he has to work on
' england have finished runners = up for the last three years running with points difference alone deciding the 2013 and 2014 tournaments
when asked if he was fed up at finishing second , stuart lancaster said : ' yes ! it would be nice to win this time
