peso and squaddle , two - year - old humboldt penguins living at folly farm and zoo in pembrokeshire , coupled up a year ago after shunning females looking to mate
while their fellow penguins prepare for breeding season , the pair only have eyes for each other as they get ready to celebrate their first anniversary this month
happy anniversary ! peso ( right ) and squaddle ( left ) got together after shunning females looking to mate two 's company ! zoo staff had given the couple a false egg during breeding season , but they threw it away staff at folly farm say the young lovers have no interest in procreating
they had been given a false egg , so that they would n't feel left out during breeding season - but they threw it out of their love nest
penguin keeper catrin thomas said : ' we 're approaching breeding season and at around two years old , penguins become sexually mature , so we thought this year they may show some interest but they have n't as yet
' all the other penguins are busy making nests at the top of the penguin beach , scrambling around hurriedly and gathering twigs , but peso and squaddle stay by the pool preening each other
' penguin posers : the humboldts , who live at folly farm , pembrokeshire , are celebrating their first anniversary they only have eyes for each other ! the pair have no interest in procreating and threw the egg of their nest she added : ' peso and squaddle do n't seem to be interested in anything else but each other , and certainly not procreating
' they 're just enjoying each other 's company
' tim morphew , folly farm 's zoo manager , said : ' we wanted to mark the occasion and the year anniversary of peso and squaddle getting together
' everybody who comes to folly farm says theirs is a really sweet love story and we wanted to celebrate the fact they were still going strong a year on
' humboltd penguins , who are monogamous and mate for life , can take a partner aged between two and eight - years - old
penguins have been observed engaging in homosexual behaviour from as early as 1911
george murray levick documented the sexual behaviour of adã©lie penguins in antarctica , but his notes were considered too indecent to publish at the time
they were rediscovered and published in the journal polar record a century later in 2012
more recently , a pair of chinstrap penguins called roy and silo became a famous ' gay penguin ' couple after the new york times published an article about them in 2004
the penguins , who live in new york 's central park zoo , were noticed performing mating rituals in 1998 , by staff - although they were never seen to perform sex acts
they were then given an egg to hatch and raise as their own - a practice copied by zoos across the world
their chick , named tango , grew up to form a same sex relationship with another female penguin
their story was the basis for a controversial children 's book in 2005 called ' and tango makes three '
but the couple later split , and silo paired with a female penguin
last year , a pair of humboldt penguins , called jumbs and kermit , from wingham wildlife park in kent , adopted the chick of a female called isobel who had to abandon her egg to find food
staff at wingham wildlife park said they were the two â best penguin parents â the zoo has ever had
but a french study in 2010 said penguins only have gay ' flings ' because they are lonely , but ultimately end up in a heterosexual couple .
