david warner and finch 's destructive partnership has only intermittently fired over the past six weeks as australia have nonetheless booked their place in sunday 's mcg final against their fellow tournament co-hosts

david warner thank the crowd after winning the semi final against india but it was at the mcg where he smashed hapless england for 135 on valentine 's day , and he returns in good heart after his hard - earned 81 against the defending champions on thursday
' it was n't my most fluid innings but it was nice to get through that , ' he said
' i was under the pump - i had n't scored any runs for a while
' i felt like i was playing really well
it 's just one of those things - it did n't translate into a hell of a lot of runs lately
' but i hope i 'm past that and there 's some more runs to come

' david warner was caught from a leading edge into the ring field against india , and added : ' it 's not great to have big edges ( on your bat ) sometimes
' but every time i 've come in i 've looked a million dollars , i 've hit every ball in the middle and i 've just got to find a way to get past that ( first ) 10 overs , be clinical and bat deep
' the kiwis need to get their minds right too , of course , to upset the odds
they are being portrayed as outsiders but remain the only unbeaten team in the tournament and scored a narrow victory over australia in an epic , low - scoring group match in auckland at the end of last month

' there will be close to 100,000 people screaming
' it will be interesting to see what it 's like here
