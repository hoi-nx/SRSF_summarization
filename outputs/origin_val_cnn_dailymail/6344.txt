the sim card that helped revolutionise the mobile industry in the early days of bulky car phones is now approaching its 25th birthday
but while the handsets they are used in have developed and evolved significantly during that time , sim still look the same - albeit smaller - and are still lodged inside devices
a university of cambridge computer science experts believes the small microchips ' days are numbered and we should be signing into our phones in the same way we log into online accounts
dr markus kuhn from the university of cambridge said the sim ( stock image ) could have been replaced long ago
he believes alternatives include typing in a user identifier and password directly into a phone ' the fact is , the sim could have been replaced long ago with a simpler alternative : typing in a user identifier and password directly into the phone is an option - just as we do to access wi-fi , ' said dr markus kuhn from the university of cambridge
or qr codes - the square , 3d barcodes - are a more convenient alternative for smartphones with cameras , where an app can read the details encoded in the qr codes straight from the camera
dr markus kuhn continued : ' sim cards were a useful feature when they came onto the market in 1991
' at the time mobile phones were bulky devices , usually mounted in cars [ and ] a sim would help customers quickly and easily transfer their phone number and contacts from one phone to the next , without the need to type in long identifiers and access codes each time
alternatively , qr codes ( example pictured ) are a convenient way to store and access data using a smartphone camera ' but the days of huge or rented car phones are gone , and today smartphones are lightweight , personal devices that we entrust with passwords to many sites and services - access to wi-fi , email , social networks , app stores , and online shopping
' he believes replacing sims with passwords or extra software would make it easier to have multiple several pay - as - you - go contracts from different providers on a single phone
they could subsequently switch to the cheapest rate depending on where they were , and apps that functioned as brokers could even negotiate which network to select based on best price automatically
customers would also not be hindered by the complicated switching process currently used when moving phone numbers across networks
in terms of security , dr markus kuhn explained that sim cards are also vulnerable to attack
gemalto , the dutch sim card manufacturer , was reportedly the victim of an nsa and gchq attack for example
although the firm said that little information was stolen , ' the reality is that sim cards are now more of a drawback than a benefit , ' added dr markus kuhn
the university of cambridge lecturer also believes the time is right to switch from sim cards because modern cryptographic techniques mean passwords no longer have to be very long
a gsm ( gsm ) network was established in the late 1980s to create a communication standard throughout europe
in 1991 , german smart - card maker giesecke & devrient sold the first 300 sim cards to finnish operator radiolinja
in 2014 5.2 billion sim ( different sizes shown ) were sold making them lucrative for manufacturers sim stands for subscriber identity module , which is the name of the integrated circuits found in the chips
phone numbers and other files can be added to these chips too
these modules store data that lets a phone identify who , and which device , it belongs to and connects it to the network
each card has a serial number as well as network information , and users can remove the card from one phone and install it in a new one without registering the device
the first sims were credit card - sized but has become smaller in recent years
in particular , many new handsets take micro-sims and apple devices use nano - sims
the next level is embedded sims that can be attached directly to circuit boards
dr markus kuhn said sim cards were a useful feature when mobile phones were mounted in cars ( pictured ) and customers wanted to transfer contacts from one phone to the next
but as phones have become more mobile , he believes the technology is outdated and should be replaced with a modern alternative password - authenticated key exchange ( pake ) techniques exist that use passwords as a five - digit pin to create highly secure encrypted connections that even the supercomputers of eavesdropping intelligence agencies ca n't break
meanwhile , app stores use modern authentication technique and these could be used to easily transfer all the functionality of a sim into the phone using an app. ' all that âs needed is a new standard interface for mobile operating systems such as android or ios that would allow software to take over the functions of the sim , said dr markus kuhn
' technically , a mobile network login is no more challenging than similar applications such as payment wallets , online banking , digital rights managed content , and so on
' but he recognises that operators prefer the sim model because they can lock customers to their network , preventing easy access to competitors
plus , in 2014 5.2 billion sim cards were sold , making it a lucrative business for manufacturers
' manufacturers are understandably against anything that would eliminate their business
modern sims are tiny , difficult to access , and easy to lose once taken out of the phone
' in fact many users may not even know how to find or remove theirs , because it was inserted for them when they bought the phone
' this inconvenience allows providers to charge high roaming fees when customers use their phone abroad , when using a local operator would be cheaper
