the new f1 season gets underway in the early hours of sunday morning when melbourne plays host to the opening race of the campaign
ahead of the curtain raiser , phil duncan assesses the sport 's hot topics ... so , it looks like hamilton is going to waltz to back - to - back titles â¦ there âs no question that mercedes are set to pick up in 2015 where they left off last year
hamilton and team - mate nico rosberg clocked up more miles than any of their rivals over the winter , and they were the quickest , too
hamilton won 11 of the 19 races last year , and you fancy if he sorts out his performances in qualifying , he âll be tough to beat
hamilton appeared in a relaxed mood as he signed autographs for punters ahead of the season opener hamilton âs popped up at a host of celeb parties over the winter â¦ is there any danger he âs taken his eye off the ball ? the reigning champion has helped to raise sky sports f1 âs profile away from the track after attending a number of showbiz functions during the off - season
from the paris catwalk to the red carpet at the brits , hamilton 's never been far from the limelight
his high - profile split from nicole scherzinger has hit the headlines , too
but the brits , now somewhat of the elder statesman on the grid having celebrated his 30th birthday at the turn of the year , appears to have adopted a new - found maturity in recent times , and his desire to match ayrton senna âs feat of three world titles appears to be his sole focus heading into the new campaign
at least , he 's telling us that anyway
hamilton poses in his mercedes overalls on thursday as he prepares to defend his world championship nico rosberg , posing for pictures with fans on thursday , will renew his title battle with team - mate hamilton so , what can nico rosberg do to stop him ? nico rosberg out - qualified hamilton 12 - 7 last term , but his race displays left much to be desired ; indeed he converted just three of his 11 poles into victories in 2014
if the german sorts out his race pace , he âll give hamilton a run for his money
at 3 - 1 with some bookmakers , he âs certainly worth a punt
and what about the rest of the grid ? williams , powered by mercedes once more , are set to be hamilton and nico rosberg âs nearest challengers
valtteri bottas was one of the stand - out performers last term , and his team - mate felipe massa is among the most experienced out there
ferrari , boosted by the arrival of sebastian vettel from red bull , have seemingly turned a corner in pre-season testing and look primed to bounce back from two years in the doldrums
daniel ricciardo , the only non-mercedes driver to win a race last year , should be confident after a number of impressive displays in 2014 , but his renault - powered red bull still lacks what it takes to challenge hamilton and nico rosberg on a consistent basis
williams driver valtteri bottas was among the stand - out performers in 2014 , and he is set to take the challenge to mercedes once more daniel ricciardo poses with models at the albert park circuit ahead of his home race in melbourne i noticed you have nât mentioned mclaren â¦ i thought they were going to be back at the front after renewing their partnership with honda ? well , that was the plan , but it looks as though it will be some time before either alonso or button get a sniff of the podium let alone win a race
the woking - based outfit , struck by a host of reliability issues managed fewer miles than any other team in testing and they were well off the pace , too
button , retained by mclaren after a surprise u-turn from the team 's hierarchy at the end of last year , has already called for patience , and reckons just getting to the finish on sunday , should be considered a positive result
button is set for his 16th season in f1 , but mclaren are likely to struggle from the offset and alonso , their marque signing , wo n't be there ? no. the spaniard suffered a mysterious crash in testing which left him concussed and in hospital for three days
cctv captured the 134mph smash , but the footage has never been released adding to the mystery surrounding the incident
the former ferrari man is confident he will back for the second race in malaysia , but his participation is yet to be confirmed by mclaren
kevin magnussen , dropped by the british team at the end of last year , gets his chance in melbourne this weekend
alonso waves to the media after he is released from hospital following a crash in testing with a combined age of 68 , alonso and button form the eldest pairing on the grid , but what about this kid verstappen ? he is nât old enough to drive a road car yet is he ? not in his native holland , no. son of jos verstappen , the former benetton driver and team - mate of michael schumacher , max is just 17
he has been partnered at red bull 's junior team toro rosso with rookie carlos sainz jnr , who at the grand old age of 20 is somewhat of a veteran
verstappen will become the youngest driver in f1 history on sunday , and it âs a record which is unlikely to be broken after the fia raised the minimum age limit to 18 in the wake of verstappen âs controversial appointment
max verstappen ( left ) and carlos sainz jnr will form the youngest driver pairing in grand prix history so , what else do i need to look out for this season ? following one of the grandest overhauls of the sport ahead of the last campaign , the rules and regulations are relatively unchanged for 2015
ugly nosecones are thankfully a thing of the past , the grand prix is back on the calendar for the first time in more than two decades , and drivers have been stopped from changing their helmet throughout the season
caterham are gone , but marussia , now in the guise of manor , have survived and after hiring will stevens , three brits will line up down under
we âll also see the introduction of the â safety car â ... under new regulations , hamilton will be forced to stick with the same helmet design ( above ) throughout 2015 what âs that all about then ? in the wake of bianchi 's horror crash at last year 's japan grand prix , a ' safety car ; concept has been introduced
fia race director charlie whiting will deploy the system immediately after any incident which requires double waved yellows , but is not deemed severe enough for the safety car itself
the aim is to neutralise the race track and slow drivers down after bianchi , who remains unconscious in hospital , was adjudged to have been going too fast when he crashed into the back of a tractor sent to recover adrian sutil âs sauber at the rain - lashed race in japan
so , what time shall i set my alarm for on sunday ? nice and early ! another recommendation following bianchi âs crash was to bring forward the start - time of a number of races outside europe
sunday 's australian grand prix gets underway at 5am ( 4pm local time ) , one hour earlier than last year , to avoid any danger of the race ending in darkness
