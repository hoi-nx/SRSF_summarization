when sunderland manager gus poyet lost his temper and took out his anger on a cooler box before picking a fight with hull boss steve bruce , it brought back memories of many a touchline scrap
the technical area of the kc stadium seems to have a way of bringing out the worst in managers - only last year alan pardew attempted a headbutt on hull 's meyler
so , with tuesday night 's flare - up in mind , sportsmail looks back at our top 10 technical area spats
hull boss steve bruce and sunderland 's gus poyet played down their spat and have now shaken hands steve bruce is held back by the assistant referee during his clash with gus poyet on the touchline things turned sour when steve bruce and gus poyet began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart as the pair locked horns steve bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in gus poyet 's direction alan pardew swears at manuel pellegrini , january 11 , 2014 the sight of a 52 - year - old man calling a 60 - year - old a ' f * * * ing old c * * * ' seemed to shock many - and alan pardew later apologised for his ' heat - of - the - moment ' outburst
a newcastle goal disallowed for offside while manuel pellegrini 's manchester city were 1 - 0 up prompted the row between the two bosses and as the fourth official looked to separate them alan pardew had a pop at his opposite number
the football association ' reminded him of his responsibilites ' - a bit of a let - off for the man now in charge of crystal palace
alan pardew ( centre ) and manuel pellegrini clashed over a disallowed goal back in 2014 martin jol and arsene wenger let off steam , april 22 , 2006 for such a usually mild - mannered man , arsene wenger does seem to get into his fair share of rows with other managers - and on this occasion it was spurs 's martin jol
martin jol 's side refused to put the ball out in the build - up to robbie keane scoring an opening goal at highbury while arsenal had a man down
this infuriated arsene wenger , who was challenged on his views by martin jol
they were separated by the fourth official but arsene wenger still had to go back for one last pop at jol - and he perhaps had the last laugh with arsenal equalising and eventually pipping spurs to fourth place in the premier league by two points
arsene wenger ( left ) and martin jol had a disagreement over putting the ball out of play for an injury jose mourinho vs arsene wenger , october 5 , 2014 these two have history dating back 11 years , and they still do n't seem to get on to this day
jose mourinho 's arrival in the premier league back in 2004 , when arsene wenger 's arsenal were champions , heralded the end of the north london club 's annual title hopes - and jose mourinho certainly has a way of getting under his opposite number 's skin
just over 12 months after his return to the premier league in 2013 and he was winding up arsene wenger again
the frenchman took exception to gary cahill 's challenge on alexis sanchez in a 2 - 0 chelsea win at stamford bridge and stepped into jose mourinho 's allocated area
some verbals from the special one saw the pair come face - to - face before arsene wenger pushed the blues boss in the chest
he later said he had ' nothing to apologise for '
arsene wenger pushes chelsea manager jose mourinho during chelsea 's clash with arsenal this season jose mourinho was furious with arsene wenger 's behaviour and even brings up the lack of punishment to this day the pair have history and have consistently rowed since jose mourinho arrived in england back in 2004 dalglish tells arsene wenger to ' f * * * off ' , april 17 , 2011 the third of a arsene wenger trio of incidents - but on this occasion he was remarkably restrained
arsenal looked to have kept their title hopes alive at the emirates stadium with a robin van persie penalty eight minutes into stoppage time but kuyt kept his cool to slot in a 102nd - minute spot - kick to level things and effectively hand the title to manchester united
liverpool manager dalglish was n't too happy with arsene wenger 's touchline protests and at the whistle after kuyt converted he approached the arsenal boss with his arms outstretched and shouted ' it 's a penalty , p * * * off ! ' before adding ' it 's a penalty , f * * * off ! '
it 's fair to say he got his point across
david moyes takes on roberto mancini , march 25 , 2010 david moyes was criticised for his lack of results against big clubs but on this occasion his everton side managed a win at the etihad stadium - and wound up his opposite number at the same time
both managers were sent off following a physical confrontation with roberto mancini trying to barge david moyes out of the way and then seeing the scot square up to him
they were escorted down the tunnel by police such was the animosity
however , the pair shook hands after being told they had to share a lift to watch the rest of the game from the upper tier
roberto mancini pushes david moyes during their spells as manchester city and everton managers referee peter walton saw the stoppage - time clash worthy of sending both managers to the stands ally mccoist and neil lennon square up , march 2 , 2011 old firm clashes always tend to be heated occasions , whether in the stands or on the field , but ally mccoist and neil lennon extended the rowing into the technical area back in 2011
three red cards , 13 cautions and 34 arrests at celtic park told the story of the afternoon and ally mccoist angered the home dugout with something he said at the final whistle
the two squared up and pushed each other before being pulled apart
ally mccoist got a two - match ban for his troubles while neil lennon 's previous record saw him take a four - game suspension , but the northern irishman would have been the happier after a 1 - 0 win
neil lennon makes his point clear to rangers assistant manager ally mccoist on the celtic park touchline pearson 's grip on mcarthur , february 7 , 2015 even a month on , nobody really seems to understand what was going through pearson 's head on the touchline at the king power stadium
what started out as a jokey exchange suddenly became more sinister as the leicester city boss seemed to pin down the crystal palace midfielder by the throat as he looked to resume play with a throw - in
the fact that pearson had failed in a bid to sign mcarthur a few months back added to the confusion
pearson appeared to grab mcarthur around the throat and the floored player was seen mouthing ' get off me '
things got even more strange in the aftermath when pearson dismissed the incident as ' light - hearted ' and told journalists that he could ' look after himself ' and then seemed close to the sack before eventually keeping his job
pearson clashed with mcarthur when leicester city hosted crystal palace last month leicester city boss pearson ( left ) appears to put his hands towards the neck of mcarthur in february jose mourinho 's gouge on vilanova , august 17 , 2011 it 's a rare occasion that the special one admits he was in the wrong , but he did here , which gives you an idea of how shameful his actions were towards pep guardiola 's then - assistant
during a familiar spanish super cup el clasico clash , jose mourinho stole up behind vilanova while a touchline row was already going on and jabbed a finger into his eye
vilanova shoved back and both were handed bans
' i should not have done what i did , obviously not , ' jose mourinho later said
' the person who messed up there was me
' joe jordan rows with gattuso , february 16 , 2011 recognised as two hard - nuts of the game , not many people were keen to get between gattuso and jordan as they rowed at the san siro
having been beaten by spurs at home in the champions league , gattuso seemed to want to distract from the defeat by picking on the spurs bench
a fierce full - time shouting match between the two ended with the italian grabbing the spurs man by the throat before aiming a headbutt at him
gattuso got a four - match ban , but given joe jordan 's record as a player he was probably lucky harry redknapp 's no 2 did n't have a go back - and the spurs manager admitted as much
joe jordan and gattuso come close after spurs 's win over ac milan in the san siro gattuso grabs spurs 's assistant by the throat as spurs manager harry redknapp tries to seperate them alan pardew headbutts meyler , march 1 , 2014 alan pardew , then newcastle boss , was sent to the stands after headbutting hull 's meyler at the kc stadium
with the magpies 3 - 1 up , meyler shoved past alan pardew as he went to retrieve the ball for a throw - in - and the newcastle boss was unimpressed , coming together with the hull player and pushing his head into his face
he received a Â£ 100,000 fine from his club , Â£ 60,000 from the football association , was given a formal warning by newcastle and was slapped with a three - match stadium ban and a touchline ban for a further four games by the football association
alan pardew 's punishment represented the longest ban for a manager in england since 1989 - and he also underwent anger management counselling in the aftermath
alan pardew and hull 's meyler confront each other on the touchline at the kc stadium last season alan pardew appeared to lay a headbutt on meyler in ridiculous scenes while howard webb watched on a steward escorts alan pardew from the pitch and he was later given a hefty fine and ban for his behaviour
