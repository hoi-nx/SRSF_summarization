it was a decade ago that terry , who has captained chelsea 528 times , first learned the tricks of the role under the tutelage of mourinho
after impressing mourinho upon inheriting the armband from marcel desailly , the manager wanted to see terry evolve from a very good centre half into a great captain , using his profile to control games and influence decisions in the way roy keane , patrick vieira and alan shearer did
like them , terry proved quite an expert
it is partly why he has been one of english football âs most successful modern captains and why fabio capello risked â and lost â his job trying to restore him as england skipper
the chelsea players surround referee bjorn kuipers at bridge as he brandishes the red card chelsea captain terry ( left ) reacts after ibrahimovic 's tackle on oscar in the first - half terry ( centre ) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following ibrahimovic 's first - half challenge it is also why mourinho has promised another one - year deal to the defender , who turns 35 this year
terry understands what his manager wants
this includes turning the heat on officials , as he did on wednesday against psg when he led nine excited team - mates in pursuit of referee bjorn kuipers to ensure ibrahimovic was sent off
pep guardiola âs barca knew how to exaggerate fouls , pressure the referee and cultivate their reputation as the team most sinned against
mourinho and psg midfielder thiago motta discovered this when they were at inter milan
no - one can make slight contact appear quite as painful as sergio busquets
chelsea 's players surround referee bjorn kuipers as he sends off ibrahimovic ( second right ) chelsea went close up with barca at times , including the nights when tom henning ovrebo found infamy and terry was sent off for kicking alexis sanchez and banned for the champions league final
everyone is at it , as terry said
everyone always has been , to some degree
but chelsea always manage to offend
even when there is much to admire about them
graeme souness claimed it âs â not the british way â but traditional sporting integrity has faded from view
winning matters more than ever
managers find ways to do it
chelsea defender ivanovic grabs everton 's james mccarthy around the neck last month chelsea striker diego costa ( right ) stamped on liverpool 's emre can during a fiery capital one cup clash wednesday âs snarling exit from europe epitomised chelsea from the first mourinho era : winning ugly and losing badly
this was one of the issues which drove owner roman abramovich and mourinho apart in the first place
there are differences this time but the defining image of the second leg against psg is the latest in a series of skirmishes
last month , ivanovic grabbed everton âs james mccarthy by the throat as chelsea swarmed around referee jon moss in reaction to a tackle by gareth barry , which also led to a red card
both teams were fined Â£ 30,000 by the fa for failing to control their players and chelsea were warned about surrounding the referee
chelsea striker diego costa makes a beeline for ibrahimovic as the referee raises the red card last month , diego costa was banned for stamping on liverpool âs emre can during a physical capital one cup semi-final
there were flashes last season : two red cards at aston villa and touchline eruptions featuring mourinho and rui faria
more recently , nemanja matic was dismissed for pushing barnes over
the tackle by barnes was bad and sparked a furious reaction from those in blue , who rushed martin atkinson
ivanovic grabbed his hand to stop him raising the red card
others deploy such tactics â angel di maria was sent off for pulling the referee âs shirt on monday in a game where wayne rooney seemed joined to michael oliver â but chelsea are perhaps the most committed
the sky sports pundits were scathing of chelsea 's ' pathetic ' behaviour at bridge on wednesday at the slightest contact in the penalty area , they hit the deck and if the appeals are rejected the ensuing mass protest can feature half - a - dozen people fuming on the touchline
if there is a fierce tackle , the victim exaggerates the pain , while the team swarm around the referee
some sprint half the length of the pitch to create panic and cloud the referee âs judgment
get enough around the ref and he has no idea who said what or who to book
call it protection for eden hazard , who has been kicked a lot
call it a protection racket
under premier league rules chelsea would probably have been charged with failing to control their players , who constantly surrounded the referee on wednesday
fortunately for them , no such action exists under europe rules
mourinho , questioning a decision with the officials , saw his chelsea side crash out of europe the chelsea squad are left reflecting what might have been after the costly 2 - 2 draw with psg mourinho muddies it all with his quotability and media strategy , always seeking to gain a small advantage , which can be vital at the rarefied end of european competition where teams are so tightly matched that each big decision is magnified in importance
perhaps it is a by - product of the arrogance the best teams need , because arsenal and manchester united over-stepped the mark when they ruled the roost
mourinho âs first spell at the bridge was littered with on - field confrontations and associated fines
he had been sacked but the tone was still set when , in march 2008 , ashley cole turned his back as he was booked by mike riley and the fa rolled out their respect campaign , intended for the grassroots game , in the premier league too
it might be time to rekindle the spirit of the respect campaign , because seven years is a long time in football and unlike the words of wisdom from mourinho into terry âs shell - like , many of the basic points have been forgotten
