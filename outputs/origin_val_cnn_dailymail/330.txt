it is a problem familiar to anyone whose family day out at a safari park has ended in disaster
just as you âre enjoying the view , a cheeky monkey yanks off your windscreen wipers or decides to have a swing on your aerial
now , a british safari park has become the first to offer visitors protection for their cars â by covering them in bubble wrap
for Â£ 10 , drivers can have their cars completely covered in layers of bubble wrap before driving into the enclosures , leaving even the most inquisitive monkey unable to cause any damage
the wrapping also helps to prevent dents and scratches to the bodywork , although it is not yet guaranteed to be totally rhino - proof
nevertheless , it is estimated that it will save visitors thousands in repairs each year
