as israelis prime minister netanyahu heads to the u.s. , some former security leaders from israelis have come out against his speech to congress , set for tuesday
speaking at a tel aviv press conference , retired maj. gen. reshef , one of the founders of commanders for israel 's security , said the speech -- expected to take a hard line on iran 's nuclear ambitions -- is " a terrible mistake " that will further damage the relationship between the u.s. and israelis
he also said the speech could harm israelis 's security by damaging israelis 's relationship with other countries
on friday , dagan , the former head of israelis 's intelligence agency , mossad , told one of the leading israelis newspapers , yedioth ahronoth : " the person who has caused the greatest strategic damage to israelis on the iran issue is the prime minister
" dagan , who was the director of mossad from 2002 to 2010 , continued , " i 've seen leaders who made decisions and then later admitted that they had erred
nobody is immune from mistakes
the difference between him and others is the willingness to take responsibility
he is strong on talk , not in action
" recent polling by cnn affiliate channel 10 israelis shows israelis split on the speech , with 38 % supporting it and the same percentage opposing it
the remaining 24 % are undecided
but another poll from panels politics , an israelis polling institute , indicates 53 % of israelis believe the speech will have no effect on the negotiations between six world powers and iran over tehran 's nuclear program
another 30 % believe the speech will affect the negotiations
reshef said this year 's elections , which will take place on march 17 , exactly two weeks after netanyahu 's speech , are crucial for the peace process
even after years of failed negotiations , israelis has the opportunity now to restart negotiations with the help of moderate arab states , he said , while warning that going the wrong direction could push peace further out of reach
reshef would not specify which political leaders would be the best for negotiations , but he said he trusts israelis voters to decide for themselves in the upcoming elections
commanders for israelis 's security is a nonpartisan group of nearly 200 veteran senior security members from the israel defense forces ; shin bet , israelis 's internal security agency ; and the police
it is committed to a regional political - security initiative to resolve the israelis - palestinian conflict
the group also seeks to normalize relations with moderate arab states such as egypt , saudi arabia , jordan and the united arab emirates
