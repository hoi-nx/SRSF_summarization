the producer of the new bond thriller spectre denies that the script was changed to get incentives in mexico
earlier , it was reported that leaked emails indicated that mexico made suggestions on the nationality of an actress and the villain , the villain 's intended victim and some film shots
implicitly , mexico 's incentives for the film were at stake , it said
producer michael g wilson said wednesday : ' there is nothing in the script that we had n't had before
the villain was always an italian ... we already shot that in rome
' the film has cast mexico actress stephanie sigman in the role
officials in mexico city have declined to comment on possible incentives offered on the movie , which is scheduled to begin its mexico filming thursday

the film has cast mexico actress stephanie sigman as a character called estrella actor daniel craig as 007 filming an action scene in solden , austria , for new bond film spectre michael g wilson confirmed there are incentives
' everywhere we go we have incentives , ' he said at a news conference
' sometimes they 're taxes ; sometimes they 're other kind of incentives
you can get cooperation , you can get things you would usually pay for for free and all that
' but it was n't just incentives
michael g wilson confirmed that mexico 's ' day of the dead ' traditions will be seen in the film , or at least a bond version - ' where everything is sort of magnified
' mexico remember departed relatives and friends on the day of the dead at the beginning of november with orange flowers , candy skulls and other death - related decorations
' the writers thought the day of the death would be an excellent background in the opening sequence , very colorful , very mysterious , ' michael g wilson said
' you can only do that in mexico
there is no other place that offers that but mexico
