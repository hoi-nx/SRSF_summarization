' hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a condition where the left lower pumping chamber of the heart does not develop properly so is much smaller than usual
the mitral valve between the left ventricle and the upper left filling chamber is often closed or very small
in addition , the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body is also smaller than usual
this means that the heart is unable to pump blood around the body effectively
hypoplastic left heart syndrome left heart syndrome is a form of congenital heart disease - a term used to describe a problem with the heart 's structure and function due to abnormal development before birth
hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a condition in which the left lower pumping chamber of the heart ( left ventricle ) does not develop properly
in children with the condition , the valve between the left ventricle and the upper left filling chamber ( left atrium ) if often closed or small
the main blood vessel that carried blood from the heart to the rest of the body is also smaller than usual
this means the heart is unable to pump blood effectively around the body
most babies with the condition appear healthy immediately after birth but quickly become breathless if not treated
most are diagnosed before birth
it is not possible to cure the condition but most children can have a reasonable quality of life if they have successful surgery to manage it
only about 60 per cent of patients survive all three of the required operations
for those who do , life expectancy is in the teens
