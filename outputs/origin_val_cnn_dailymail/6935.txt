council boss jo stephenson , 59 , who died after jumping from his roof had been ' stressed over plans to introduce new parking charges ' a council boss who died after jumping from his roof had been ' stressed over plans to introduce new parking charges ' , an inquest heard
father - of - two cllr jo stephenson , 59 , who was liberal democrat deputy leader of cumbria county council , died in hospital three weeks later from internal injuries
his wife hilary told the inquest he had been under considerable pressure in the weeks before his death to push through the later - abandoned policy of fresh on - street parking across cumbria
it was initially thought mr jo stephenson had accidentally fallen from his roof while carrying out some diy on his windermere home in july last year
but kendal coroner 's court was told after hitting the ground mr jo stephenson dialled 999 - and admitted to the call handler he had thrown himself off on purpose
he then discussed ending his life with the paramedic at his home , as well as with staff at the royal preston hospital , the inquest heard
the former lakes school teacher was said to have been ' deeply distressed ' by ' personal attacks ' made towards him over the internet
these came as a result of the move to impose a parking tariff in 11 towns including carlisle , penrith , cockermouth and keswick
the plans were not introduced following a consultation that identified concerns about the inadequacy of the enforcement regime
this resulted in him appearing ' distracted ' in the fortnight before the incident
while in hospital the councillor suffered what was described as a ' psychotic episode ' - attacking a pregnant nurse with a butter knife
mental health consultant dr richard morgan confirmed mr jo stephenson ' lashed out ' at the pregnant nurse
he said the councillor also injured his own eye with the arm of his glasses and said he wished the attempt upon his life had been successful
mr jo stephenson 's wife argued he was terrified , sleep - deprived and affected by medication at the time
she added she did not believe mr jo stephenson deliberately tried to end his life
he died on 25 july from a pulmonary embolism and bronchial pneumonia , with a stroke as a secondary factor
giving a narrative verdict , assistant coroner alan sharpe stopped short of ruling mr jo stephenson had intended to take his own life but said the fall was ' no accident '
he discussed ending his life with the paramedic at his home , as well as with staff at the royal preston hospital ( pictured ) , the inquest heard the cumbria deputy coroner stressed that while mr jo stephenson had told medics he had intended to take his own life , it was not certain he was thinking clearly at the time of his fall
he added : ' it 's quite clear jo stephenson was very well - loved and liked and had lived a very successful life
' it 's quite clear from the transcript of the 999 call and from the evidence given by the paramedic that it was not an accident when he fell from the roof
' whatever his state of mind - he did jump
' his widow hilary told the hearing despite the attacks he received in the months before his death , she had no regrets about him entering politics
