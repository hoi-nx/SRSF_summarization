first - time parents kate and david ogg were heartbroken when they were told one of their twins - born two minutes apart at just 26 weeks - had stopped breathing and had just moments to live
thinking it was the only time they would have with the tiny boy they had already decided to name jamie , kate asked to be able to hold the lifeless child , and told david ogg to climb into the hospital bed for a tender embrace
what happened next was nothing short of a miracle
hospital staff rushed back to his aid and together brought the baby back to life
five years on , jamie ogg is a healthy , happy kid whose biggest problem regarding his troubled entry in the world is having a little brother who tells anyone who 'll listen that he used to be dead but now he 's alive
after years of trying to fall pregnant , the queensland couple were delighted to find out they were having twins - the ' pigeon pair ' of a boy and girl
but just six months into the pregnancy they found themselves in the delivery room and facing premature births
jamie was born first on march 25 , 2010 and his sister emily followed two minutes later
' they were both born in their sac but jamie did n't make a noise when they tore it open
emily let out a big wail , ' ms ogg told daily mail australia
' we looked over and everyone was crowding around jamie - there was about 20 people in the room
the vibe was n't very good
when they were told the devastating news , kate ordered her husband to take off his shirt and get into the bed to provide extra warmth - and miraculously he gasped for air and opened his eyes doctors worked on jamie for 20 minutes before they stopped and informed his heartbroken parents the doctor sat on the end of ms ogg 's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out after birth , skin - to - skin contact is recognised as a simple step mothers can take to welcome their baby into the world
for kate and david ogg the point is all the more pertinent
the birth process is a stressful and exhausting time for the baby
unicef advises mothers to hold their child in skin - to - skin contact to help their baby ' adapt to their new environment '
it means their ' heartbeat and breathing will be better controlled ' and there is a wealth of evidence that suggests babies held in skin - to - skin contact are less stressed by the birth process
unicef 's advice states : ' we know that babies who have spent an hour in skin contact are significantly less stressed after the birth experience - this means their breathing and heart rate are more stable , they cry less , and when they start to feed , they digest their food better
' a mother 's chest area is significantly warmer than other parts of her body - ready to welcome her new baby and prevent them from cooling down - which is a significant risk
' your baby has been lovely and warm in your uterus - at around 37 degrees , whereas the labour room will be significantly cooler , and he is wet â it âs like getting out of the swimming baths , you need to get dry and warm quickly
' meanwhile davey , chief executive of the premature baby charity , bliss , echoed the importance of skin - to - skin contact
she said it is ' an essential part of family - centred care and should be part of the care that all babies receive '
ms davey added : ' evidence shows that it can help to regulate the baby âs heartbeat , lower their stress levels and can play an important role in improving the positive outcomes for premature babies
â ' he stopped breathing and his heartbeat was nearly gone
after 20 minutes they stopped working on him
' the doctor sat on the end of ms ogg 's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out
he then informed them that there was nothing more they could do to save jamie
' i saw him gasp but the doctor said it was no use
i took jamie off the doctor , asked everyone to leave
he was cold and i just wanted him to be warm , ' she said
' we had tried for years to have kids and i felt so guilty
i just wanted to cuddle him
i unwrapped him and ordered my husband to take his shirt off and climb into the bed
' i know it sounds stupid , but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so i was n't going to give up easily
' i know it sounds stupid , but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so i was n't going to give up easily , ' mrs ogg said ' we were trying to entice him to stay
we explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him , ' mrs ogg said ' he suddenly gasped ... then he opened his eyes
he was breathing and grabbing dave 's finger , ' mrs ogg said ' we were trying to entice him to stay
we explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him
' he suddenly gasped ... then he opened his eyes
he was breathing and grabbing dave 's finger
' if we had let the doctor walk out of the room with him , jamie would have been dead
' jamie and emily are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story
' emily burst into tears , she was really upset and she kept hugging jamie , ' ms ogg said
' they love to talk about when they were babies
' they have a little brother charlie who loves telling anyone who listens
he 'll say : " when i was born i was fat and the twins were skinny
jamie was also dead but now he is alive "
' emily and jamie also have a little brother charlie , 4 , and regularly talk about their miracle birth story remarkably , jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth when the twins were first told of their miracle birth , emily burst into tears and would n't stop hugging jamie the david ogg family have set up an online community called jamie 's gift to regularly raise funds for the miracle babies foundation - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns remarkably , jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth
' he is absolutely fine ... the biggest concern they had was cerebral palsy because of the lack of oxygen but there 's been nothing , ' ms ogg said
' it 's absolutely astounding
this whole experience makes you cherish them more
