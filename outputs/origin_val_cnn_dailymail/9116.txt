few people expect manchester city to go to barcelona and overturn a 2 - 1 deficit from the first leg and reach the quarter - finals of the champions league
but here 's 10 good reasons pellegrini 's men should travel in hope ... 1 - chelsea proved miracles can happen chelsea were 2 - 1 down on aggregate to barcelona and down to only 10 men in their second leg at the nou camp in 2012 â and still went through
goals from sergio busquets and andres iniesta put video barca in control even before john terry was sent off
then , incredibly , ramires scored on the stroke of half - time and after surviving immense pressure , fernando torres scored to book chelsea 's place in the final , which they went on to win
chelsea sealed a place in the 2012 champions league final by drawing 2 - 2 with barcelona at the nou camp 2 - pellegrini can tap into malaga barcelona lost their last game at the nou camp on february 21 to malaga , the team that pellegrini managed between 2010 and 2013
pellegrini will be able to get all the inside info on how they did it and also used to work with the winning goalscorer , juanmi
if juanmi can slay barcelona , there 's not reason why aguero ca n't follow suit
3 - no reason to fear manchester city captain vincent kompany knows what it feels like to score at the nou camp , joe hart saved a penalty from messi three weeks ago and yaya toure won the champions league with video barca alongside the likes of xavi , andres iniesta , sergio busquets , messi and gerard pique
while the rest of the world regard video barca 's players as demi - gods , manchester city have been up against them before and shown they are human , or played with them
joe hart saved a late messi penalty to keep his side in with a chance of progressing to the next round 4 - el clasico awaits coach enrique wo n't be thanking la liga for the way they 've worked out their fixture list because an even bigger match lies in store on sunday when video barca meet real madrid in a potential title decider
the temptation not to play at 100 per cent against manchester city will be there particularly as they already hold a 2 - 1 advantage from the first leg
it will be up to pellegrini 's side to take advantage if the video barca players have half an eye on the weekend
barcelona boss enrique will have one eye on his side 's upcoming match against real madrid 5 - city best in adversity if there is one thing manchester city have proved in recent times it 's that they should never be written off
they were eight points behind manchester united with six games to play in 2012 â and won the title
in 2014 , they were three points behind liverpool with three to play , and again came out on top
most significantly , they have shown ' bouncebackability ' in europe too
they qualified from the group stages despite taking two points from their opening four matches and trailing 2 - 1 against bayern in their fifth match
manchester city showed on the final day of the 2011 - 12 season that they are capable of springing a surprise 6 - prolific aguero aguero has scored six goals in six champions league ties this season , at a ratio of a goal every 76 minutes
if he scores again in the nou camp , manchester city will be halfway there to overturning the first - leg deficit
pellegrini believes aguero has the ability to be considered the third - best player in the world behind messi and cristiano ronaldo
a match - winning performance to rank alongside his hat - trick against bayern earlier in the tournament would go a long way to making that come true
manchester city forward aguero ( he 's at the bottom ) has scored six goals in the champions league this season 7 - history on the side of english clubs it 's not impossible for english clubs not to be represented in the last eight of the champions league â but history shows it 's very rare
only once since 1996 have the quarter - finals taken place without a premier league team
with liverpool , chelsea and arsenal gone , all hopes rest on manchester city now
they have n't always been the most popular team since sheik mansour 's takeover but the club might thrive on the need to restore some national pride
manchester city are england 's last hope following arsenal 's exit from the champions league on tuesday 8 - all roads lead to rome pellegrini has been criticised for rigidly sticking to 4 - 4 - 2 in europe and being outplayed in midfield , as he was against video barca in the first leg
but when aguero was injured for the critical final group game away to roma , he played dzeko as a lone striker and manchester city comfortably won 2 - 0
if pellegrini repeats the tactics â but with aguero replacing dzeko â and city crowd video barca in the middle of the park , there 's no reason they should n't threaten the catalans with the talent they 've got in the team like david silva
spanish playmaker david silva ( centre ) may be given the licence to roam if he plays behind aguero 9 - managerial mis - match barcelona boss enrique is a champions league novice as a manager â this is his first campaign in the tournament and he 's never experienced a knockout second leg
in contrast pellegrini has guided villarreal to the semi-final , malaga to the quarters and took manchester city the nou camp last season where they lost 2 - 1 with 10 men
the chilean knows what to expect â enrique does n't
enrique is a novice when it comes to managing a side in the champions league knockout stages video barca will attack - enrique 10 - yaya motivation yaya toure is available for manchester city are serving a three - match european ban and could n't be more motivated
for all the stealth of barcelona 's midfield with ivan rakitic , busquets and andres iniesta , they have n't got the power to live with yaya toure if he is allowed to run at them
the ivory coast international has proved he 's a big - match player â remember his incredible goal at wembley in last season 's capital one cup final â and this could be his defining match in a manchester city shirt
yaya toure is available for selection after missing the first leg against his former side through suspension ps here 's three reasons why manchester city should be fearful of barcelona
