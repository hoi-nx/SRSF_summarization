a first trophy as celtic manager was a huge , significant step for ronny deila
he took the old cup from rod stewart , skipped down the hampden park steps and refused to let go until the â ronny roar â â his ceremonial bonding session with the club âs supporters
but this was a day when sobriety was the parkhead watchword
sober reflection , followed by a sober celebration
celtic âs first league cup since 2009 is the platform for ronny deila to become only the third celtic boss to win a domestic treble
a piece in the jigsaw , no more
the celtic players celebrate on the podium with the scottish league cup after beating dundee united 2 - 0 at hampden park celtic manager ronny deila gets ready to lift the scottish league cup with his players as celtic kicked off their celebrations a scottish cup replay against dundee united â who else ? â beckons on wednesday and that ensured there was no prospect of glasgow âs fast - food outlets cashing in on a celtic team session last night
the players , captain scott brown included , were under orders to be in bed by midnight
â we should enjoy the moment , â said a relieved ronny deila after an eventful , if unremarkable , final
â but there is not going to be any nightlife
â we should have known scott brown would be a key figure here again
the celtic skipper escaped punishment for the tackle which triggered two red cards â both rescinded â when these teams met at tannadice last week
his manager then overlooked the front - page pictures of a night of rabble - rousing in edinburgh before the final
yet the greatest let - off of all might have been here when referee madden denied dundee united â who ended the game with 10 men and a strong sense of injustice - a penalty kick

celtic were ahead at the time
they had exploited their opponents being down to 10 men when skipper sean dillon collided with virgil van dijk and left the pitch in 23 minutes to receive stitches
he was gone for fully eight minutes
â i was about to make a change because it seemed to be taking too long , â said manager mcnamara afterwards
â it proved costly for us
â i had blair spittal ready to come on and i was going to put ryan mcgowan to right - back
unfortunately , i do nât have a magic wand for those circumstances
â sean dillon would eventually leave the pitch on a permanent basis in the second half for a reckless challenge on emilio izaguirre in 56 minutes
thereafter , celtic dominated , scoring again through james forrest and emphasising why the tayside club were so willing to wait for their captain when he left the pitch for lengthy treatment
he was nât to blame for the insipid paul dixon free - kick which allowed craig gordon to gather and trigger a celtic counter
but it was from his position that stokes â who had a fine game - chipped a left - foot cross that was prodded towards goal by kris commons , changing direction as it came off the inner thigh of jaroslaw fojut
somehow cierzniak in the dundee united goal clawed it brilliantly on to the post , but tiring commons would not be denied , thumping the rebound emphatically into the net with his right foot for 1 - 0
â hindsight is a wonderful thing , â pondered mcnamara
â if we had scored from that paul dixon free - kick , everyone would be saying it was a great decision not to substitute him and give him a little more time
â there was more cause for dundee united regret in 36 minutes when ryan dow , chasing a through ball into the area was pushed in the back by scott brown , a villainous figure through tannadice eyes
referee madden had a good , long look then decided to turn the other way
scott brown had ducked sfa punishment last weekend and here was the cause of another tannadice gripe against authority
not without justification , it should be said
james forrest curls in the second goal for ronny deila 's side as the scottish premiership leaders proved their superiority at hampden park guidetti ( left ) , on loan from manchester city , celebrates james forrest 's strike for celtic as they beat dundee united celtic manager ronny deila urges his side to remain focused as they continue to chase a domestic treble james forrest roars in celebration with the celtic fans at hampden park erupting after ronny deila 's team prevailed 2 - 0 in the scottish league cup final predictably , ronny deila â perhaps seeing it through green and white shades â saw things differently
â it was hard to say , but , from what i have been told , it was a good decision , â he claimed
â i think the referee was very good
we are after him whenever he does something wrong , but you have to give them credit when they do a good job
â in contrast , dundee united foamed with frustration and knew they were done for when they went down to 10 men in 56 minutes
last sunday , paton and paul dixon were sent packing
paton âs proved to be a nonsense , but sean dillon âs here was inarguable
the defender lunged into a dangerous challenge on emilio izaguirre
the honduran was fortunate to escape serious injury
on the dundee united touchline mcnamara raged with the perceived injustice of it all
his side had lost the scottish cup final against st johnstone last may and they knew , now , another showpiece occasion was slipping away
celtic âs extra man was telling
dundee united captain sean dillon ( right ) is sent off for this late challenge on celtic defender emilio izaguirre sean dillon ca n't hide his devastation after the dundee united captain was sent for an early shower having been sent off at hampden park in stokes , johansen and nir bitton , they had the best players on the pitch
in 67 minutes , johansen got across fojut to jab a leigh griffiths cross towards goal , the ball shaving the post en route to a narrow dundee united escape
it was the last act for leigh griffiths before he made way for guidetti
james forrest replaced the tiring commons and the substitutes would make quite an impact
james forrest and guidetti started brightly enough , the winger sweeping the critical second goal into the net from 16 yards in 78 minutes after the swede teed up a johansen cut - back
their manager was less impressed with the very public falling out as the two haggled over a penalty kick five minutes from time
kris commons managed to fire celtic ahead from an acute angle during the first - half , as ronny deila ( right ) roars in celebration commons put the celtic ahead on the half hour mark with his 11th goal of the season in all competitions with celtic commons is congratulated by his team - mates having put the scottish premiership leaders in front during the league cup final referee madden showed no hesitation when james forrest was pulled back by paul dixon
â he was very quick to point to the spot that time , â said a caustic mcnamara afterwards
james forrest grabbed the ball , resisting guidetti âs determined and very vocal efforts to do the same
the winger placed the ball down , then placed a weak effort too close to cierzniak , the dundee united keeper preventing a third goal
an unimpressed ronny deila explained afterwards : â both of the players who were going to take a penalty , leigh griffiths and kris commons , were off the park
it looks like it was the first to the ball , but i do nât like that they argue about that
james forrest earned celtic a penalty late on under this challenge from dundee united 's paul dixon in the closing stages several celtic players wanted guidetti to take the spot - kick but james forrest insisted and eventually missed his penalty â it is stupid
that is not the team spirit i want
â as the final whistle signalled a significant day for the norwegian , guidetti marched straight down the tunnel in a huff , clearly furious
he was retrieved by mikael lustig , possibly on ronny deila âs orders
â there is a lot of emotion in these situations and strikers , especially , want to score goals , â he continued
â again , we have to put the team in front of ourselves
it is something we have work on all the time and learn from through experience
this is not team spirit
it is individual thinking - and i do nât want anything to do with that
â collectively , celtic have much to excite them
a treble hovers on the horizon
the late night celebrations can wait
