a los angeles - based artist claims versace has ripped off one of her designs
kesshia ' kesh ' kumari , who has more than 80,000 instagram followers , used the social networking site to express her views about the luxury fashion house
she uploaded a picture of one of the t - shirts she created with american apparel inspired by her artwork in 2013 next to versace 's offering , which she captioned : ' at least make it better than the $ 30 ( Â£ 20 ) original @ versace_official
this looks like a first draft
' she also uploaded a snap of versace 's Â£ 440 medusa cotton jersey t - shirt and wrote : ' this.hurts
sold out in 3 sizes
what is this madness ? from huge designer labels to small boutiques to giant pop stars to fame hungry former friends
what is this ? ' why ca n't these companies
these people create their own work ? what happened ? why do these people think that everything that they lay their eyes on instantly belongs to them ? ( sic ) '
mailonline has contacted kesshia kumari for comment
in an interview with the cut , the london - born designer said : ' i have always had a deep admiration for versace
it âs an iconic brand that has stood the test of time
i am deeply disappointed in this
' this is not only artwork from a show that took me two years to develop and create
it is not only artwork from a collection that i created for american apparel to provide something affordable and accessible to supporters of my work
' but this is also my face ! i ca nât understand how something like this could happen
' kesshia kumari , who is of malaysian and trinidadian heritage , began designing her graphic creations 17 years ago and began selling them on myspace
the versace t - shirt 's description on selfridges website reads : ' versace âs flair for contemporary prints can be seen with this statement t - shirt
crafted from cotton - jersey and featuring medusa âs head printed on the front , simply team with jeans for a luxe off - duty look

speaking to mailonline , jim dennis , an intellectual property partner at law firm gordon dadds , the english member firm at globalaw , said : ' kesh âs design is certainly distinctive and the versace design is strikingly similar
provided kesh âs design is original , then under uk law it will attract copyright as a graphic work
' it is for the court to decide whether versace has copied kesh âs design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the court may readily infer that copying has taken place
if so , versace would infringe kesh âs copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to kesh âs
if they are found to infringe then they may be liable for damages to kesh or have to hand over their profits from sales of the offending t - shirts
' carissa kendall-palmer , associate solicitor , eip in london , added : ' in short , kesh should be filing a law suit right away
the versace t - shirt is clearly very similar to the t - shirt she developed for the american apparel range in 2013
on the face of it , kesh has a good case , but will need to gather evidence to support it
' the design could be protected by both design rights and copyright , and it certainly looks like a bit of a rip - off
many fashion brands rely heavily on these unregistered rights and at times , it can be complicated and expensive to prove their case
she is not on her own here
copying is very common in the industry
' there is always the possibility that versace has a good excuse but it will take some explaining
copyright infringement is criminal , and if kesh registered her design , copying that is also a criminal offence under the new 2014 laws
if kesh has a registered design , she will find it easier to assert her legal rights now
