he revolutionised how we clean our homes but now sir dyson is hoping to boost the battery life of our smartphones , cars and - of course - our vacuum cleaners
the 67 - year - old inventor and entrepreneur has invested $ 15 million ( Â£ 10 million ) in michigan - based battery experts sakti3
the company has developed a range of ' solid - state ' batteries ( ssbs ) that store 50 per cent more energy than current models and will make our favourite gadgets smaller and safer
the firm has developed a solid - state battery capable of storing double the amount of power as traditional lithium - ion models
the batteries could feature in dyson 's cordless cleaners as well as phones and other gadgets it is the first investment sir dyson has made outside of his bagless vacuum business
batteries have three main components - the anode , cathode and electrolyte
this electrolyte is typically a chemical that separates the anode and cathode and moves the flow of electrical charge between the two
the majority of batteries found in phones , electric cars and sir dyson ' range of cordless vacuums use lithium - ion ( li-ion batteries ) battery technology
lithium - ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte and because lithium is a highly - reactive element it stores a large amount of energy
but this liquid electrolyte is often flammable and has been blamed for batteries bursting into flames when overheated , for example
due to the safety implications of placing flammable liquids in electric cars , too , many of these auto - based batteries have added safety features making them expensive to run
lithium - ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte but this liquid electrolyte is flammable
sakti3 's ssbs are based on the same li - ion technology but replace the liquid electrolyte with a coating of non-flammable metal
this makes them safer , smaller , ( pictured ) more robust and mean they can be used at higher temperatures in particular the battery has to be cooled down and can never fully charge or discharge resulting in wasted capacity

this not only makes them safer for both the consumer and the environment , but they are also more robust - liquid electrolytes can be easily damaged - and can be used at higher temperatures

this not only makes them safer for both the consumer and the environment , they are more robust - liquid electrolytes can be easily damaged - and can be used at higher temperatures
li-ion batteries are extremely sensitive to high temperatures and it can cause them to degrade faster , for instance
sakti3 has already designed an ssbs with an energy density rating - the amount of energy stored it can store - of 1,100 watt hours per litre
this is said to be 50 per cent higher than than current lithium - ion batteries
the firm has also demonstrated its prototype can survive more charge - discharge cycles than traditional li-ion batteries which typically last two or three years - whether they are used or not
other companies including toyota are also working on developing similar technology
sir dyson ' investment in sakti3 is part of a larger $ 20miillion ( Â£ 13 million ) round of investment that will see the technology sold commercially and added to dyson products
this would include the firm 's latest cordless v6 fluffy designed to work with wooden floorboards , ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring
sir dyson said : ' sakti3 has achieved leaps in performance which current battery technology simply ca n't
it 's these fundamental technologies - batteries , motors - that allow machines to work properly
' the sakti3 team has amazing ambitions , and their platform offers the potential for exponential performance gains that will supercharge the dyson machines we know today
