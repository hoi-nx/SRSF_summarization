in the words of robin williams : â your mother knows how to push your buttons because she installed them
â the relationship between a mother and daughter is a complex one â some hate each other and can barely spend a christmas lunch in their company , while others go on spa trips , talk daily and even share clothes
according to a new book called daughterhood there are nine different types of daughter , ranging from the busy daughter and the daughter of narcissism to the dependent daughter
according to a new book called daughterhood there are nine different types of daughter ( file photo ) irish author natasha fennel decided to write the book after her mother came down with with a serious illness
sat outside the hospital after visiting one day , natasha fennel wondered how she would cope when her mother was gone
had she been a good enough daughter ? would she have enough time to do all the things she wanted to do with her mother before she died ? natasha fennel knew she could n't be the only one feeling this way
she began her research and quickly learned that other daughters had similar fears and had never spoken about them before
she put out a request in journalist roisin ingle âs newspaper column in the irish times for other women who had difficult relationships with their mother and got hundreds of responses
after whittling the group down to nine women , who natasha fennel believed best portrayed all of the main tribes of daughters , they started to regularly meet in the kitchen of natasha fennel âs home in dublin
eventually , their stories formed the basis of daughterhood - nine daughters coming together to talk about their mothers and the joy and despair that this relationship bring , with the aim of improving those relationships
a daughter 's relationship with her mother is one of the most influential of her life ( file photo ) natasha fennel said : ' every daughter still yearns for the approval of her mother , at the end of the day , it is one of the relationships that really matters
' for daughters , the relationship with their mothers is one of the longest of their lives , longer than with our partners and our children
' your mother is your first female role model , so that has profound influence on how you âre shaped and you view the world from an early age - your mother is integral to that
she has a massive influence on you because she brings comfort and joy and she âs the one you turn to when in trouble - she âs your safe haven
when she starts to get older and nears a time that she might pass away , that safety net is pulled out from underneath you and it âs like a juggernaut coming down the road
the daughterhood is about resolving that for yourself
natasha fennel , who wrote the daughterhood so which daughter are you ? read on to find out â¦ the busy daughter you do nât always answer the phone when your mother rings , you make promises you ca nât keep , when she rings the door you hide and you try to get your mother off the phone as quickly as possible when you do pick up
has your mother become the person that you say , â oh do nât worry , it âs only my mother â about when she calls or makes plans that you want to avoid
the daughter of madness when your mother has been diagnosed with a mental illness , but when you âre younger you do nât realise why they are behaving oddly
you might crave a mother who would make you feel secure and cherished and as you get older , you can not rewrite the past
this can make it very difficult when you come to deciding whether you want a daughter of your own
the daughter of narcissism your mother is totally self - absorbed , constantly criticises you and makes you feel like a nuisance
she should nât have been a mother at all
the becoming - my - mother daughter a lot of people have this
you begin to hear phrases , expressions and tones of her voice in things you say that you swore that you âd never say or do
it happens most often when you speak to your partner , children or dog
you âve got to decide how bad that could be though â is it the worst thing in the world that you turn out like your mother ? the grieving - as - she - lives daughter this is the daughters who once had a relationship with their mother and one day that is taken away because of an illness like alzheimer âs and they have no control over it
you have to accept it , you âve lost her and you âre grieving as she is living
the dedicated daughter is a daughter who spends plenty of time with her mother , goes travelling with her , cooks with her and listens to her ( file photo ) the dependent daughter this is â dial m for mother â
you ring your mother at every chance you get
you rely on her for everything from your washing on the weekends to advice on cooking , and when you ca nât cook the dinner yourself , you go over and eat at her house
you always talk about yourself and never ask how your mother is
you she still sees your mother as a mother , not a person in her own right because you have nât made that transition where you see her as a friend
you might even be leaning on her to the point where you âve become a bit of a burden , even though she âll never say that because she âs your mother
the dedicated daughter you cook with her , travel with her want to get to know her more than you already do
you might even have already spoken about what she would like at her funeral
you take her as an individual , ask her what the things are that she wants to do in this chapter of her life and you try your best to accommodate them
you have made the transition from mother and daughter to friends , but are also conscious that there is very little time left
your behaviour sometimes this spills over into dis - empowering your mother though , telling them what they should be doing
the reluctant daughter is a daughter who resents having to visit her mother and spend time with her ( file photo ) the reluctant daughter even though she knows she should do the right thing by her mother , she does nât want to â she has to be dragged kicking and screaming
this particularly happens with an only child â if your mother gets sick , there is only you to look after her , but you are doing it with resentment and bitterness
you do nât like your mother and do nât think she deserves it
you visit them but do nât want to , then feel guilty about feeling that way
it is often the behaviour of a reluctant teenager , not wanting to go home and help out with the house , wanting to hang out with your friends instead
the daughterhood is out now , priced at Â£ 12.99 in this relationship , then the daughter is in her 20s , 30s and 40s it gets much better , but then as her mother gets much older the relationship becomes fractious again
lots of these daughters sell the family home and put their mother into a home
the disappointing daughter you do nât live up to expectation
your mother had an expectation of you that you did nât know about
as you grown up , you start to realise that you are nât meeting these expectations and your mother ca nât help but tell you this
you were always criticised at school â if you got a b , then you should have got an a , if you scored two goals , then you should have won the match
you realise this as an adult when your mother comes to visit and she criticises how you âre raising your children
that âs when a lot of these relationships break down , because you do nât want to allow her to criticise your children
you will always seek her approval even though she will continue to criticise you
