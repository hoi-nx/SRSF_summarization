a decorated british army officer who devoted his retirement to helping troops serving on the frontline shot himself after allegedly feeling â harassed â by a former aide to thatcher , the mail on sunday can reveal
brigadier david martin , 57 , ended his life after receiving phone calls and a â harassing voicemail â over a Â£ 300,000 dispute involving his military charity
brig martin was a director and trustee of uk4u thanks , a charity founded in 2005 which works with the mod ( mod ) to deliver uk4u christmas food parcels to troops in war zones
diane martin - pictured with son will , centre , and her late husband david - says the david martin felt he would be â the sacrificial lamb â in a row between uk4u and a businessman who pr man hugh colver was representing in a letter to friends and family breaking the news , his widow said the brigadier was left agitated after speaking to pr man hugh colver earlier this month , saying he felt he would be â the sacrificial lamb â in a row between uk4u and a businessman who mr hugh colver was representing
in the letter , which was distributed on social media , devastated diane martin , 55 , said : â david received an email on sunday evening [ march 1 ] which made him very agitated , and in his letter to me he said that the final straw was a harassing voicemail during the day from the same man
â it all concerned the uk4u christmas box charity for which he was the chairman of trustees
the founding businessman felt that he had never been properly recompensed for his initial ( very substantial ) outlay â despite formal arbitration and subsequent revisiting of the arbitration by legal teams
â a high - powered pr man started to harass david for some sort of out - of - court settlement
neither the charity nor the mod could legally â pay off â a claim that was unsubstantiated , so he concluded ( again in his letter ) that he would be the sacrificial lamb that would have to be found â guilty â in order that the claims could be settled
â everyone knew that he would have done nothing wrong but he felt powerless to challenge the allegations and did nât have the resilience or energy to go through such a potentially traumatic period
â just hours after speaking to mr hugh colver , a former director of communications for the conservative party , brig martin wrote a suicide note and killed himself in the grounds of his cotswolds family home near avening in gloucestershire
' brought in to mediate ' : hugh colver said he was ' deeply saddened ' by brig martin 's death when questioned by the mail on sunday , mr hugh colver confirmed he had attempted to persuade brig martin to negotiate with businessman briggs , who in 2005 provided uk4u with hundreds of thousands of pounds of start - up cash
when the charity âs trustees refused to pay back mr briggs from uk4u funds , he started legal action
according to the charity âs 2008 annual report , an arbitrator found the businessman was owed funds
the report adds that uk4u accepted the award but that mr brigg âs company â claimed further amounts â
mr hugh colver , from westbury , wiltshire , said : â as far as i know brigadier david martin and i did not know each other previously but he was aware of who i was and my background
i was brought in to mediate
â our conversations were very reasonable and i got the impression he felt i was genuinely trying to help
he even thanked me for my efforts
he was surprised that the issues were still around , he thought it was all sorted by the arbitration and i said , well , unfortunately , it remains a dispute
the way the conclusion was arrived at is regarded , by some people , as invalid
the dispute is over several hundred thousand pounds and is very complicated
â a friend of brig martin claimed that mr hugh colver adopted an â icy tone â in their conversations , but the pr man insisted : â i absolutely refute any suggestion that i was threatening and i was deeply saddened to learn of his death , this is tragic , ghastly
â when approached by the mail on sunday , mr briggs said : â it is a very difficult situation and we are very saddened by the news
hugh colver is our mediator and he knows the true side of the story and i would listen very carefully to him
â brig martin was made a commander of the british empire ( cbe ) during a glittering military career
his funeral was held yesterday
