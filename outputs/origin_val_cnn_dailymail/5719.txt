isolated , labelled as freaks and facing a life of begging and prostitution - meet india 's transgender women who have been ostracised from their communities but cling to the dream of finding love
in india , there are up to 1.2million transgender people , also known as hijras
earlier this year , the country 's first transgender mayor was elected and less than 12 months ago the supreme court granted legal recognition to the community as a third gender
to an outsider , it might be assumed that these hijras - described as ' men minus maleness ' - are able to lead peaceful lives without fear of discrimination , but this could not be further from the truth for some
they are ostracised from their communities change : less than 12 months ago the supreme court granted legal recognition to the community as a third gender hijras live together in houses where a chief or godmother acts as leader
there are no men and they adopt a combination of hindu and muslim cultures hidden : aside from going to work , hijras usually do n't go out in public and most restaurants will not let them dine there her parents had high hopes for their first son , but from a young age saranya was different from other little boys
showing her femininity resulted in severe punishment and by the age of 16 she felt exhausted , suppressed and judged
saranya fled her home in the western city of pune and took refuge with her new transgender family in bangalore in the south of the country
hijras live together in houses where a chief or godmother acts as leader
there are no men and they adopt a combination of hindu and muslim cultures
they refer to each other as mothers , sisters , aunts , grandmothers and great - grandmothers
when saranya was accepted into her transgender family , she underwent her toughest challenge - her physical transformation
the painful operation - known as nivran , or rebirth - involves the removal of the penis and testicles and is carried out at home while the patient is awake
traditional : they have maintained a traditional india style , in contrast to many middle and upper class women who have cut their hair and wear western clothing the hijras wear traditional india clothing and apply makeup in their transgender homes - which are often small , dark and damp religion : they adopt a combination of hindu and muslim cultures and refer to each other as mothers , sisters , aunts , grandmothers and great - grandmothers prostitution : many are encouraged to become prostitutes due to the financial benefits as well as beg in return for blessings now 58 years old , saranya has lost contact with all but one member of her family - her sister
aside from going to work , hijras usually do n't go out in public and most restaurants will not let them dine there
instead , many prefer to stay within the safety of their transgender homes , giving each other companionship and dreaming of finding husbands
even if they do marry , some hijras do not live with their husbands - perhaps seeing them monthly or as little as once a year - and often the marriages have unhappy endings
for work , hijras traditionally beg and give blessings in return , as well as dance and entertain
many are also encouraged to become prostitutes due to the financial benefits
even if they do marry , some hijras do not live with their husbands - perhaps seeing them monthly or as little as once a year - and often the marriages have unhappy endings aside from going to work , hijras usually do n't go out in public and most restaurants will not let them dine there the rights of transgender people may be changing , but even the country 's first mayor has admitted to being a former beggar beauty : they have maintained a traditional india style , in contrast to many middle and upper class women hijras often live in poverty - in damp , dark homes with no beds or furniture
yet , there is an obsession with keeping them clean and neat
they have maintained a traditional india style by wearing saris and bindis , in contrast to many middle and upper class women who have cut their hair and wear western clothing
but saranya 's hands are covered in wounds and scars - each of which has its own painful story
one angry customer attacked her with a knife instead of paying , another scar is the result of abuse from two drunk men
saranya 's story may be painful but it is certainly not unique
the rights of transgender people may be changing , but it seems discrimination is still rife
even the country 's first transgender mayor is a former beggar
friendship : they often prefer to stay within the safety of their transgender homes , giving each other companionship hijras are described as ' men minus maleness ' and face a life of isolation , begging and prostitution new lifes : some hijras flee their homes and find refuge with her new transgender families where they start new lives employment : traditionally , hijras beg and give blessings in return , as well as dance and entertain just months ago she was scratching out a living singing and dancing on trains for a few rupees from commuters
but in january , kinnar began leading her community as india 's first transgender mayor - a dramatic election result that upends cultural mores in the traditionally conservative country
kinnar won the election in raigarh in the central state of chhattisgarh , beating her rival from prime minister narendra modi 's bjp ( bjp ) by more than 4,500 votes
kinnar , centre , has become india 's first - ever transgender mayor after abandoning her life of singing and dancing for change to put herself forward to represent her community television pictures showed the 35 - year - old draped in a saree and with a large red bindi on her forehead , folding her hands and greeting supporters who placed marigold garlands around her neck amid strobing camera flashes
kinnar , a member of the dalit caste previously known as the ' untouchables ' , put herself forward for election when she was asked to represent her community
' people have shown faith in me
i consider this win as love and blessings of people for me
i âll put in my best efforts to accomplish their dreams , ' kinnar said
' it was the public support that encouraged me to enter the poll fray for the first time and because of their support only , i emerged as the winner
' kinnar 's win comes nine months after india 's top court ruled that transgenders be legally recognised as gender - neutral
often known as ' hijras ' in south asia , transgenders are classified as people who have had sex change operations or who regard themselves as the opposite of their born gender
activists say there are hundreds of thousands of transgender people in india , but because they were not legally recognised , they faced ostracism , discrimination , abuse and forced prostitution .
