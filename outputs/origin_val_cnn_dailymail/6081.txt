' but now china has its answer in guo , after students posted pictures online which went viral , saying : ' look at this , we definitely have the prettiest pe instructor in the country

jiang is a resources , environment and urban planning student who has signed up for two semesters of the cheerleading course
when asked why he replied , red faced : ' when i first applied it was because other students said that boys were able to get high final exam scores
' i did n't expect that each lesson will be led from start to finish by the teacher which is very interesting
also the teacher often chooses songs that are nice so i chose this course for two semesters
' guo with her many trophies and awards
she used to run two classes but now takes four because of demand guo said : ' i started artistic gymnastics when i was four years old and have been involved in sports since then
' i am a technical cheerleading national champion , competitive aerobics national champion , miss aerobics national champion so essentially all the courses that i trained in at university i have achieved national champion status in
