the deadlock was broken when sinclair powered his way into the chelsea box in the eighth minute and was fouled by tomori , with wilson scoring the ensuring spot kick
the second goal followed a similar routine - sinclair 's surging pace duped tomori again and the young striker , dancing along the byline before whipping in from a seemingly impossible angle , was able to add to his already impressive scoring tally for the season
