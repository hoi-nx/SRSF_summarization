de freitas , 23 , died on april 4 last year - three days before she was due to stand trial accused of perverting the course of justice the family of a young woman who killed herself days before going on trial for ' inventing a rape claim ' are calling for lessons to be learned
de freitas , 23 , from fulham , west west london , received a private prosecution summons for perverting the course of justice , funded by a man accused of drugging and raping her
but the former durham university student died on april 4 last year - three days before the trial was due to start at southwark crown court in west london
her family said they were ' astonished ' the cps ( cps ) decided to take bipolar sufferer miss de freitas to court
she made a rape allegation to metropolitan police in january 2013 against wealthy financier , alexander economou , 35 , claiming the incident had happened just before christmas 2012
it was investigated but officers closed the case after concluding that gaps in the evidence meant they would not be able to secure a conviction
despite being told he would not face charges , mr alexander economou paid for his own inquiry , assembling emails , text messages , details of phone calls and cctv footage of them together
he then started a private prosecution against miss de freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police
the whole process is said to have cost him Â£ 200,000
the cps took over the case but decided against using its powers to throw it out , leaving her frightened and devastated
the inquest into her death was originally opened in november last year , but was adjourned so the director of public prosecutions alison saunders could personally investigate the cps 's decision to prosecute
west london coroner chinyere inyama also said he needed to know the remit of the cps investigation before deciding on the scope of his hearing
ahead of the resumption tomorrow , her father david de freitas said : ' the most important thing for us is that lessons are learnt from the tragic death of our daughter
' we hope that the inquest will explore the important public interest issues regarding prosecutions of rape complainants and the appropriate protections and care that should be put in place for vulnerable people like de freitas
her father david de freitas ( left ) said that lessons need to be learnt from her ' tragic death '
she had accused alexander economou ( right ) of raping her but the allegations were dropped due to lack of evidence ' in view of the importance of this case and its tragic consequences , we need to make sure that existing guidelines and practices were adhered to and that any shortcomings in these guidelines and practices are identified and remedied so that no other vulnerable young women and their families have to suffer as we and de freitas did
' lawyers for the family said they are hoping the inquest will explore the impact the case had on miss de freitas taking her own life and the wider public interest of prosecuting rape complainants for perverting the course of justice
harriet wistrich , solicitor for the family , said : ' this inquest offers an important opportunity to ensure that lessons are learnt from this needless death and so as to ensure that similar tragic outcomes are avoided in the future
' mr alexander economou paid for his own inquiry , assembling emails , text messages , details of phone calls and cctv footage of him and miss de freitas ( pictured ) together the former durham university student had bipolar disorder
the inquest into her death will resume tomorrow deborah coles , co-director of support charity inquest , said : ' this case raises important issues of public importance regarding the treatment of rape complainants
in addition to the specific vulnerabilities of this particular group , de freitas suffered from a diagnosed serious mental illness
' there must now be a robust and thorough inquest in order to appropriately consider whether de freitas received adequate support under the care of west london mental health care trust and to what extent the prosecution of de freitas impacted on her life
' the hearing is expected to be completed tomorrow
de freitas claimed she was raped by alexander economou just before christmas 2012
but she did not go to the police station to make a formal complaint until january 4 last year
detectives investigated but ruled that there were too many inconsistencies in the evidence to bring a successful prosecution
officers informed miss de freitas on february 21 last year that they would not be bringing any charges
but wanting to clear his name , mr alexander economou used his own money to launch a private prosecution against miss de freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police
she received a court summons on august 13 last year
the cps took over the case , giving it the power either to end it or to pursue it
to the horror of miss de freitas and her family , it decided to continue
miss de freitas killed herself on april 7 , three days before she was due to stand trial .
