when moonlight the cat went missing almost nine years ago , his distraught owners tried everything to find him , before giving him up for dead six months later
but now the beloved pet has been reunited with owner rosie collier , 52 , after turning up at a vet 's surgery two miles away from her house in chediston , suffolk , earlier this week
mrs rosie collier , who lives with husband john , and 17 - year - old daughter melba , says the beloved animal is now back living with them and their other pets
moonlight initially disappeared while staying with mrs rosie collier 's parents , denise and chris , in wenhaston , while mrs rosie collier was on holiday
rosie collier , 52 ( centre ) , and daughter melba ( centre left ) were reunited with pet moonlight after nine years when a member of the public brought him to vet jenny reason ( far right ) who found he was microchipped mrs rosie collier said moonlight went missing nine years ago while she was on holiday , and the family gave him up for dead after a cat matching his description was found in the road , but he miraculously survived when she returned the family spent months looking for moonlight , before a cat matching his description was found dead in the road
mrs rosie collier said the family were ' devastated ' at the loss , and even planted a special memorial tree for moonlight in their back garden
however , unbeknownst to them , the pet was actually alive , and is believed to have survived wild on a nearby heath , hunting and killing his own food
believing he was a neighbour 's cat , a female animal - lover in the village occasionally fed moonlight whenever he stopped by , but took him to the vet after noticing he had lost some fur
when the cat got there , medics discovered he had been microchipped , and were able to track down his owners
mrs rosie collier said : ' i simply could nât believe it - it âs just miraculous ! i was just so surprised , i really did not expect to ever get good old moonlight back
' i was in shock at first but then i had a huge grin from ear to ear for the rest of the day
' the news was particularly exciting for melba , who was just eight at the time the cat went missing , and was distraught over losing him
mrs rosie collier explained : ' there were buckets of tears
melba was very distressed , even her dance teacher can still remember how upset she was - it was that traumatic
' but rather than inform her daughter straight away , mrs rosie collier waited until melba , who celebrated her 17th birthday yesterday , returned from bungay college that evening to break the news
mrs rosie collier believes moonlight was living wild on a nearby heath , eating whatever he could catch
a female animal - lover also fed him scraps , and then took him to the vet when she noticed he had fur missing melba said : ' i was just really shocked
eight years is a really long time and so i was not expecting it at all - it âs just so good to have our moonlight back after all this time
' after a cautious reintroduction to echo , the family âs golden retriever , and two new pets , tilly the black labrador and dusty the cat , moonlight is happier than ever
mrs rosie collier said : ' i was not sure he would remember us after so many years but he came straight home and he has been purring and rubbing himself up against us
' he obviously still knows and remembers who we are - even the dog
' ' we always knew he was a good hunter , so if he was alive he would probably be ok looking after himself
' we think he must have been living wild on the heath near here , killing rabbits and mice , but also taking advantage of people who would feed him
' we are just so happy to have moonlight back - it âs a genuine miracle
' vet jenny reason , who discovered moonlight was microchipped , added : ' when a missing pet turns up , it âs usually a matter of days , sometimes a little longer , but i âve never known a pet to return after over eight and a half years
' it âs a fantastic story - and just goes to show why it âs so absolutely vital to chip your pet
