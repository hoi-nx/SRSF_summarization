former male model elo used to make a living from his good looks
but after modeling for 10 years the self - confessed car nut had earned enough money to indulge his passion
he started by buying several cars , as well as customizing them for clients across the world , and in 2001 he founded the london motor museum
today is has nearly 250 automobiles
" when i was modeling , the best part of my modeling career was ( that ) i was expressing what my client wanted me to do , " he says
" i still express what ( clients ) want me to express , but this time in a three - dimensional form with an engine and an exhaust and some wheels
and that is ultimate satisfaction
" during his fashion model days , elo owned seven cars and would drive a different one each day of the week
what started as a passion gradually demanded more and more of his time , and after a while elo felt that he came to a crossroads
" i had to weigh between continuing modeling or stopping modeling to just do cars
so i chose the latter , " he says
" my friends told me ' you 're absolutely crazy , look at all these beautiful women , look at all this traveling around the world
' and i 'm like ' are you out of your mind ? look at that beautiful steel ! ' that 's the best
" today , the car - lover 's collection includes gems such as the 1937 lincoln zephyr , and a low - riding customized cadillac which used to belong to snoop dogg -- the so - called " snoop de ville "
but what gives elo the most satisfaction is something less material : the feeling of freedom
" when i drive a car , i feel like i am leaving all my worries behind , and it 's just staying behind whilst i 'm going forward , " he says .
