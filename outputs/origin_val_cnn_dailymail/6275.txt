bale rammed some of the ridiculous criticism he has received in recent weeks from real madrid supporters back down their throats with a first half double and the perfect goal celebration
the former tottenham forward who scored 22 goals in 44 games in his first season at the club including strikes that won the copa del rey and champions league final has had to put up with whistles in his own stadium and a fan poll that had 40 per cent of supporters calling for him to be dropped in recent weeks
when he put real madrid ahead on 18 minutes in the 2 - 0 win over levante on sunday night he made sure he left off some steam , covering his ears as he ran to the corner to give the flag a celebratory kick

host commentator thanks for following sportsmail 's live coverage of real madrid 's 2 - 0 win over levante
big week of football coming up , starting with swansea vs liverpool - stick with mailonline for all the updates
a drab second half is brought to the end by the referee
if only karim benzema had netted that ridiculous flick , eh ? anyway , bale 's seven - game run without scoring is over and he looks ready for next week 's el clasico , even if cristiano ronaldo was a bit out of sorts
real madrid move to within a point of barcelona , and they are nine goals behind the catalan club in terms of goal difference
yeah , he 's not scoring today
marcelo puts in a cross , bale slicks it on and cristiano ronaldo shins the ball wide
cristiano ronaldo elects to allow someone else to take a free - kick
this time it 's marcelo , he whips it in and it finds javier hernandez but he wastes a header wide of the post
oh , and javier hernandez was just one of four real madrid players offside - the linesman spots it
seconds later nabil el zhar flashes a shot well over the bar from the edge of the area , not that that statement will surprise liverpool fans
it 's a yellow card for the spaniard
cristiano ronaldo still looking for that elusive goal , he cuts in from the left along the edge of the area , past two markers and fires in the shot but it 's straight at goalkeeper marino
another change , karim benzema gets a bit of a rest towards the end - with most people still gutted not to see his wondergoal effort go it - and is replaced by javier hernandez
give the maestro a rest before el clasico next week ... modric comes off after completing 77 minutes and is replaced by illarramendi
he might be the best player in the world but cristiano ronaldo is taking a bit of a liberty here
first the lack of respect to bale in the first half , and now he 's running around demanding the ball
he gets it from jese and then just loses the ball on the edge of the box
obviously frustrated and not one for defensive responsibility , he stands with his hands on his hips
uche off , victor casadesus on
karim benzema plays in bale and he fires at goal
marino saves well but it escapes his grasp and jese almost reaches it to tap in but the goalkeeper eventually gathers
there 's four forwards for real madrid on the pitch now - looks like they 're going to go with cristiano ronaldo and karim benzema up front as a pair , jese on the left and bale on the right as an extremely attacking front through
wow ! how do you describe that ? cristiano ronaldo crosses from the right and karim benzema is completely unmarked
with the ball coming slightly behind him and around his midriff , he lifts his right heel and directs the ball on to the angle of post and crossbar
so close to a crazy goal
absolute class and so , so ridiculous
hopefully that will wake up this otherwise drab half
nabir el zhar ( yes , the ex-liverpool one ) and ruben garcia replace jose luis morales and xumetra for levante
not much going on so far but karim benzema fires over a half - volley seven minutes after the break
real madrid could do with a few more , they 're nine goals behind barcelona on the goal difference tally
can cristiano ronaldo get himself a goal ? and will bale get his hat - trick ? we 'll find out in the next 45 minutes at the bernabeu
the bernabeu crowd might be a bit more pleased with bale , but team - mate ronaldo certainly is n't
the portuguese forward effectively set up the welshman for both goals , albeit unintentionally , and was not best pleased
first , his acrobatic volley was cleared and bale smashed in the rebound , with cristiano ronaldo raising his arm in frustration even as bale netted
second , bale deflected in cristiano ronaldo 's shot , which was heading wide , to make it 2 - 0 , and the ballon d'or looked far from pleased , and it 's not something that 's gone unnoticed
two bale goals - the second to the frustration of cristiano ronaldo - and they 're 2 - 0 up
navas has been a spectator in goal
that 's real sure of the win
a quick free - kick by modric plays carvajal in down the right , he cuts back to cristiano ronaldo who fires a shot across goal
it - decisively - deflects in off bale and real madrid are 2 - 0 up
cristiano ronaldo celebrates the strike but we 're crediting that one to bale
he 's on a hat - trick now , unless the ballon d'or winner has a word at half - time
morales cuts in from the left and tries to fire in a shot but it 's blocked at close range
real break but karim benzema makes a wrong pas and the bernabeu begins to boo
no pleasing these guys is there ? they 've done next to nothing so far but levante are trying to play a bit , but there 's just no intensity to their play jose luis morales does well down the left but he ca n't get past his man and real madrid recover and are free to build up again
moments later they look close to finding a gap in the real madrid defence but pepe does well to clear away
bale cuts back in from the right wing and it hits the chest of simao to deflect on to the crossbar - not sure if the welshman was aiming for a shot or cross but he 's come close nonetheless
bale also gets to the subsequent corner first but heads over
it 's real madrid 's 10th shot of the game ( levante have had none ) and cristiano ronaldo almost makes it 2 - 0 to his side
he looks set for a tap - in in front of goal after bale plays the ball across the six - yard line but tono manages to get in with a last - ditch block to save levante
bale might have had the chance to silence his critics but iker casillas is n't quite so lucky as he sits on the bench
the real madrid captain got a less - than - warm reception from the crowd when his name was announced pre-match , as you can hear here : bale runs towards the bernabeu crowd with his hands to his ears
where are the boos now ? after cristiano ronaldo 's acrobatic volley was headed off the line , bale slams in with a right - footed volley
it 's 1 - 0 and bale has his goal
marino 's having to be everywhere right now , although he probably knew it would be a busy night
this time it 's bale with the effort , he gets up to head modric 's corner goal - wards but the keeper makes a stunning diving save to keep it goalless
karim benzema has the ball in the net after he latches on to marino 's save from lukas modric 's long shot , but the frenchman is ruled offside by the linesman
cristiano ronaldo is brought down 25 yards out and wins a free - kick
six player wall ... can he test marino ? no. ... it 's hit the six - man wall
here we go with another long - winded real madrid attack
real not really breaking through their opponents in the last couple of minutes but they are well in control
levante are effectively an eight - man defence and as soon as they break into the opposition half they give the ball away
lovely flick from bale over to karim benzema who cuts back to cristiano ronaldo inside the box and he toe - pokes it towards the corner ... but it hits the base of marino 's post
a goal is n't far away
first chance for bale to show what he can do
decent early chance as he turns and volleys towards goal which arrows just wide of the top corner
we 're underway at the santiago bernabeu
before kick - off , a moment 's reflection for former real madrid player antonio betancort who passed away today aged 78
it 's bad enough having to play away against real madrid , but levante have a dreadful record here and will likely just be hoping not to be on the end of a rout
the reverse fixture back in october ended 5 - 0 to real madrid , with cristiano ronaldo scoring twice , and their past record at the bernabeu makes grim reading too , looking from now back to 2008 their form here reads : 3 - 0 , 5 - 1 , 4 - 2 , 2 - 0 , 8 - 0 ( yes , eight ) , 5 - 2
bale has no goals in his last nine games , so tonight is a big for him to change the fans ' perceptions
remember , we 're only one week away from the big one : el clasico
it 's vital real madrid stay in touch
all the action here in 10 minutes
the big news for real madrid is that their famous front three of karim benzema , cristiano ronaldo and bale all start - while toni kroos is rested
oh , and of course iker casillas is dropped for jesus navas - although that seemed to be hinted by carlo ancelotti on saturday
here 's the rest of their line - up plus the levante xi : real madrid ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : navas ; carvajal , pepe , ramos , marcelo ; modric , silva , isco ; bale , karim benzema , cristiano ronaldo
levante ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : marino ; lopez , navarro , ramis , tono ; camarasa , simao ; xumetra , barral , morales ; uche .
