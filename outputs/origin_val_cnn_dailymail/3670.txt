a famous thailand temple has apologised after finding itself at the centre of an international row for reportedly banning chinese tourists from its new toilet
the tourists were said to have disgusted other visitors to the white temple â the temple â by urinating on walls and defecating on the floor
the complaints were believed to have prompted a decision by the temple âs owner that new toilet facilities due to open would be made unavailable for chinese tourists , according to people âs daily
but , responding to online criticism , owner chalermchai kositpipat â who stressed he is â three quarters chinese but can not speak the language â â said everyone would be allowed to use the new facilities

it is better known as the white temple due to its stunning all - white exteriors
and , keen to remain whiter - than - white , the temple had become concerned with reports that foul messes left behind by a minority of guests had made it difficult for others to use the toilets

all tourists are now free to use any of the bathrooms , continued the report

' i do nât have any intention to look down upon chinese , ' said the owner
