the swedish driver 's licence examiner has come under fire after asking students if it is ' a mitigating circumstance ' if a woman is drunk during sexual assault
learner drivers undergoing a compulsory theory course on drink - driving have been invited to discuss several rape scenarios where alcohol is involved
the organisation behind the material has defended the use of questions involving rape , saying it is intended to inspire discussion about using alcohol ' as an excuse when you do something stupid '
anger : swedish 's driver 's licence examiner asked learner drivers to discuss if it is ' an aggravating or mitigating circumstance ' if a woman is drunk during a sexual assault ( stock image ) the theory booklet is used across swedish for compulsory risk - assessment courses as part of the drivers licence theory exam , which mostly undertaken by 16 to 18 - year - olds
learner drivers are asked to discuss several scenarios where alcohol and drugs are involved , including two about rape with no relation to traffic or driving
the book asks : ' an intoxicated woman is raped by a man
when he is punished , is it an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that she was intoxicated ? ' it also described a similar rape - scenario where the male perpetrator is ' intoxicated ' and whether that would be ' an aggravating or mitigating circumstance ' in court
risinger , 32 , from falun , dalarna , spotted the questions during her course , and posted a picture of it on her facebook
the two questions read : ' an intoxicated woman is raped by a man
when he is punished is it an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that she was intoxicated ? , ' and similarly ' an intoxicated man rapes a woman ' unrelated question : the questions were asked during a compulsory course which all learner drivers in swedish must undergo in order to get their licence ( stock image ) the picture caused heated reactions , with many asking what the rape scenarios had to do with getting a driver 's licence
ms risinger said she had been surprised to see the questions , especially as there could be victims of sexual assault forced to take part in discussions about rape in a context where they could not be expected to be prepared for them
' rape has nothing to do with a driver 's licence , ' ms risinger , a spokesperson for the local green party , told aftonbladet
' it is not okay that you should be forced to discuss during a compulsory course to get your licence
' it is highly likely that there are boys and girls who take part in this course who are victims
they are there to get a driver 's licence , not go to therapy
' however , the swedish national organisation for driving schools ( sveriges trafikskolors riksfÃ¶rbund ) defends the use of the rape scenarios , saying it shines a light on the fact that alcohol is often used as an excuse when ' doing something stupid '
' we want a discussion about taking responsibility for your actions , and that is the reason the questions are in there , ' a representative told newspaper etc.
