obama did not call kanye at home - despite the rapper 's claims to the contrary - but a presidential staffer did ring to set up a future chat , sources have claimed
the back - and - forth began a couple of weeks ago , when kanye boasted about his close relationship with the most powerful man in the world during a speech at oxford university
kanye , who is married to kim , claimed that mr obama would call him at home , and he would call obama ' out of the blue '
last week , mr obama was forced to deny the claims during an appearance on chat show jimmy kimmel live , saying he did n't even have kanye 's home number
when asked about kanye 's claims about their friendship , he replied : ' i met kanye twice
' the first time was when i was a senator and he was with his mom and he had just gotten big â¦ and then about six months ago he came to an event
' president obama had dismissed the claims he called rapper west at home during at appearance on jimmy kimmel live ( pictured ) ' i do n't think i 've got his home number
' but kanye refused to back down , and made the bizarre assertion again when questioned by a tmz reporter at lax airport
after the kimmel interview was aired , kanye told reporters at lax airport ' i love obama , he called our house before ' despite mr obama 's flat - out denial , the outspoken rapper still insisted that he would contact him at home
' i love obama , he called our house before , ' he claimed
' he knows that , do n't try and pit us against each other
' now the truth appears to have finally been revealed after sources close kanye said a presidential staffer had contacted the west home to set up a potential future chat with mr obama
a source told tmz that the president had attended a celebrity - filled breakfast in beverly hills last october where he spoke about using star power to get people to vote
when it was over mr obama told guests including kim and kanye he wanted to set up a call to continue the conversation
afew days later , a staffer reportedly called to follow up
the president has praised kanye 's music but has previously labelled the singer a ' jackass ' after his 2009 mtv video music awards antics during taylor swift 's acceptance speech .
