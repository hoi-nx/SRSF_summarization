' i 'm over the moon
i really was n't expecting to run so quickly
' dafne was amazing and i saw verena as well so i knew the track was quick
obviously it was n't going to change my race , but i did have that at the back of my mind that maybe if i put in a bit less effort i could still get a quick time
