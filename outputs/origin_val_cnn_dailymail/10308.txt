ukip has also lost two other general election candidates in recent days in separate incidents
david coburn ukip was expelled after her chief of staff was filmed allegedly attempting to make fraudulent expense claims
the party 's candidate for scunthorpe stephen howd , was suspended last week following an ' alleged incident at his workplace '
mr david coburn 's recent controversial comment was made during a telephone conversation with the scottish mail earlier this month , in which he spoke about his appearance on bbc two show the big immigration debate
he claimed that snp and international development minister humza yousaf was supposed to appear on the programme , and said : ' humza yousaf , or as i call him , abu hamza , did n't seem to turn up
' ukip 's only scottish mep david coburn is facing calls to resign mr david coburn has since apologised for the remark and mr farage has dismissed it as a ' joke in poor taste ' , adding today : ' that 's david coburn â¦ that 's the way he is
' but mr tim wilson told the mail : ' what david coburn said is unforgiveable - it 's racist abuse
it does n't matter whether it was a private comment , or a public comment , this man has public office and he needs to filter the ridiculous thoughts that come from his brain
' he should be dismissed from ukip and held to account
' he added : ' mr farage can not dismiss something like this as a joke
you ca n't toss this thing off as a joke with a pint of beer
' if a leader can not understand that it is the effect of his words not his intention that matters then maybe he too needs to consider his position and i would be the first to welcome mr farage into the political wilderness
' in his resignation letter to the local party , seen by the mail , mr tim wilson wrote : ' since selection , i have been systematically gagged by the party ' whip ' and forbidden to speak about islam favourably â¦ ' ironically , while i am told not to talk positively about islam , a scottish mep and member of ukip has used appalling language that should never be condoned and that must be described as islamophobia
mr farage has dismissed this as a joke
' this is a red line , therefore , that has been crossed
this is not a joke to me
' in an interview today , i have criticised both mr farage and the david coburn and for that reason , i can not and will not represent ukip at an election
' however , if the party is to progress , it must certainly deal with the thugs and bullies who currently have positions of power and whose appalling views are both tolerated and / or presented as party policy
' mr tim wilson was selected as the party 's candidate in february , and joined ukip last year after leaving the tories
earlier today , ukip leader mr farage continued to defend mr david coburn
he said : ' what 's he done wrong apart from telling a joke in poor taste ? ' that 's david coburn , he 's out there , that 's the way he is
there was no malintent in it
â it was a joke in very poor taste
i wish he would think a bit more before he tells such jokes again
' nicola sturgeon arrives at the scottish parliament with humza yousaf - described by ukip 's david coburn as abu hamza but mr humza yousaf , msp for glasgow , said : ' ukip 's pathetic response to religious hatred , racism and bigotry has exposed them as a party that is so out of touch with people that even their own senior members are abandoning them
' i welcome tim wilson 's resignation
he has demonstrated that he is unwilling to be associated with a party that allows islamophobia to be rife within its ranks
' serious accusations have been made about ukip actively preventing their members talking positively about islam
farage should heed warnings from his own members and demonstrate that he will not tolerate prejudice in any form by expelling david coburn without any further delay
' a spokesman for ukip said : ' tim wilson was never gagged or told that he could not speak about islam
' when mr tim wilson submitted some videos that he intended to use as a viral campaigning tool , all that his regional officers advised him to do was produce shorter videos focused on national issues such as the nhs , not five minutes or more discussing the nuances of islam in britain
