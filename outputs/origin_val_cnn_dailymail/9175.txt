tottenham 's fans may have been sick of the sight of chelsea blue after their capital one cup final defeat , but their captain did n't appear to be
tottenham lost 2 - 0 to jose mourinho 's men at wembley , but as hugo lloris led his team up to collect their loser 's medals , he appeared to don a chelsea scarf
in fairness to the french goalkeeper , he did n't appear to notice it was n't his team 's colours - time playing for les bleus will do that to you
as hugo lloris goes up to collect his medal , he sees that something has been thrown at him without realising that it is a chelsea scarf , the tottenham captain picks it up and wraps it round his neck hugo lloris wearing the scarf after defeat by chelsea in the capital one cup final at wembley as a clearly distracted hugo lloris walked up to get the medal , a member of the crowd threw the scarf at him
the former lyon man then nonchalantly picked it up and chucked it around his neck before trudging onward
it was an unfortunate end to an unfortunate day for hugo lloris in which he conceded twice after opposition shots took wicked deflections off of his own players .
