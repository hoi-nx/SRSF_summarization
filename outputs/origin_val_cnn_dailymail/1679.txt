an outspoken , liberal multimillionaire congressman from florida believes his 24 - year marriage should be annulled because his estranged wife ' committed bigamy '
rep. alan , 56 , whose pretrial hearing was likened to an episode of the netflix drama ' house of cards ' , is set to make claims in court on monday that his wife , lolita , was still married when they wedded in virginia in 1990
the outspoken liberal gained national attention during the debates over health care reform when he said the republican party ' opposing plan was ' do n't get sick , and if you do get sick , die quickly
' alan , a democrat and highly successful trial lawyer , said his wife 's marriage to robert carson was not dissolved until 1994 in broward county , florida
however , she claims she divorced robert carson in guam in 1981 , and she also disputes that she was divorced in broward county
if the marriage is annulled , alan would avoid having the court divide personal property or decide whether he owes lolita alimony - his worth is listed by her at $ 31 million , according to court papers
an outspoken liberal congressman from florida believes his 24 - year marriage should be annulled because his estranged wife ' committed bigamy ' ( above 56 - year - old rep. alan pictured during a house of cards democrats ' new conference in january ) besides bigamy , the divorce has featured mutual allegations of battery , accusations by lolita of financial abandonment by the congressman and a trial delay caused by her leaking breast implants
last year , it was reported that lolita was approved for public assistance by the state of florida to help feed her four minor children that she has with alan , according to wftv
it was shortly after he was named the 17th richest man in congress
lolita has claimed she is not the ' lolita b. carson ' cited in a dissolution of marriage final judgment that alan said is proof that she was still married to robert carson when they wed. neither side has found robert carson
during a recent pretrial hearing , when attorneys were arguing over who had access to the couple 's financial documents , circuit judge bob leblanc likened the scenario to the well - known netflix political drama
he said : ' this is starting to sound like ' house of cards "
' if the marriage is annulled , alan would avoid having the court divide personal property or decide whether he owes lolita alimony - his worth is listed by her at $ 31 million , according to court papers ( above 2005 picture of alan with his daughter , center , lolita , right , and john edwards , left ) attorneys at the hearing suggested that politics , in part , may be preventing any effort to reach a quiet , confidential settlement that the judge hinted is the best option for the graysons , who are the parents of five children
' when lies are told about you and you 're in the media , your detractors are going to use it and use it forever more
you have to neutralize that and the only way to do that is to get the truth out , ' said nejame , one of alan 's attorneys

' lolita ' attorney , mark longell , said the congressman was going to ' drag her through the mud ' so that he does not look bad

he requested a trial delay so he could have more time to prepare , and the judge will consider another delay monday
the trial will move ahead if the judge decides against it .
