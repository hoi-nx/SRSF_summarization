hillary clinton has been accused of ignoring official advice issued by her office while secretary of state against using private email addresses by using her own server housed in her new york home
the leading democratic presidential hopeful has faced criticism for using her @ clintonemail.com email address for official government business , especially during the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the us consulate based in the libya city of benghazi
according to leaked diplomatic cables , the state department warned employees against using their own private email addresses for official business
they were also warned against using ' auto - forward ' tools to channel emails to their own accounts
clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of emails to the state department following the revelations
the cable advised state department officials that ' online adversaries ' had attempted to hack into the private email accounts of its employees
the june 2011 advice contained in the cable only applied to ' sensitive but unclassified ' information
this could include personal information of state department officials or members of the public , business secrets , plus ongoing investigations or records about visa or asylum applications
the cable was signed hillary clinton , but it is not apparent whether she was aware of its content as many official memos would bear her name if she was in washington at the time
fox news contacted an unnamed computer hacker as part of its own investigation into the clinton email issue , who used a publicly available tool called ' the harvester ' to determine how many email addresses clinton used while at the state department
according to the hacker : ' given the sequential similarities to hdr22 @ i suspect some others found by my search may also have been used by hrc
' i suspect hdr18 - hdr21 may have been used by hrc as well as h@clintonemail.com and hillary@clintonemail.com ...
i âd also be interested to learn if there were ever hdr1 @ thru hdr17 @
' clinton 's staff maintained that the former secretary of state only used the one email address , understood to be hdr22@clintonemail.com
clinton has been forced to hand over 55,000 emails as a result of a house of representatives investigation into the september 11 , 2012 terrorist attack on the us consulate in benghazi , libya , pictured white house press secretary josh earnest was questioned on hillary clinton 's email policy however , the hacking expert claimed several slightly different email accounts existed , which may have been used by the democratic hopeful
clinton 's critics fear she has been able to control what information will be made public as she will have control over the data
under the freedom of information act , the government can censor or withhold emails to protect information that would hurt national security , violate personal privacy or expose business secrets or confidential decision - making in certain areas
it was n't clear whether the state department would automatically apply those provisions to its review of clinton 's emails , or use its discretion to release even emails that might be covered under those exemptions
withholding emails merely because they might be embarrassing or expose government incompetence or malfeasance is not permitted under the act 's guidelines
more than 11,000 people have sought access to clinton 's emails under the freedom of information act since the use of a private system has been revealed .
