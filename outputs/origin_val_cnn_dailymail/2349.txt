do you love rice but are worried about your weight ? the good news is scientists have now discovered a way to reduce the calorie content by 60 per cent - simply by the way it is cooked
cooking the rice with coconut oil , and then cooling it for 12 hours in the fridge , more than halved the number of calories in the rice when it was eaten
however , doctors have previously warned that eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning , and so advise making sure the rice is steaming hot all the way through before eating it
they also advise leaving the rice in the fridge no more than a day before reheating
their recommended method of preparing the rice increases the amount of resistant starch inside it , which is indigestible to the human body
therefore this resistant starch is not absorbed and turned into energy or fat , and has no calories
the scientists found a two - step process that was able to increase the amount of resistant starch in rice by 10 times
first , they added a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water , adding half a cup ( 105g ) of rice , and then either simmering it for 40 minutes , or boiling it for 20 to 25 minutes
then , they put the rice in the fridge for 12 hours to cool
lead researcher james , of the college of chemical sciences , sri lanka , said if the best variety of rice is prepared using this method , ' it might reduce the calories by about 50 - 60 per cent
' he said the team wanted to find food - based solutions to the problem of obesity in developing countries , where rice is often a staple food
' we discovered that increasing rice resistant starch ( rs ) concentrations was a novel way to approach the problem , ' he said
the coconut oil enters the starch granules in the rice during its cooking , changing its architecture so it can no longer be digested , experts explained a cup , or 210g of rice , contains around 240 calories
mr james explained that starch can be digestible or indigestible
rice is made of both of these types of starch
unlike digestible types of starch , rs is not broken down in the small intestine , where carbohydrates are normally metabolized into glucose and other simple sugars and absorbed into the bloodstream
so , the researchers reasoned that if they could transform digestible starch into rs , then that could lower the number of calories of the rice
this is because the coconut oil enters the starch granules during cooking , changing its architecture so that it becomes resistant to the action of digestive enzymes , mr james explained
this means that fewer calories ultimately get absorbed into the body
the cooling for 12 hours is essential , but reheating the rice for consumption does not affect the rs levels , he said
he added that the next step will be to complete studies with humans to learn which varieties of rice might be best suited to the calorie - reduction process
the team also will also experiment to see if other oils besides coconut have this effect
the research was presented at the 249th national meeting & exposition of the acs ( acs ) , the world 's largest scientific society
doctors warn reheated rice can cause food poisoning doctors warn that reheated rice can cause food poisoning
however , it 's not the reheating that causes the problem but the way the rice has been stored before it was reheated
uncooked rice can contain spores of bacillus cereus , a bacterium that can cause food poisoning
when the rice is cooked , the spores can survive
if the rice is left standing at room temperature , the spores can grow into bacteria
these bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins that cause vomiting or diarrhoea
the longer cooked rice is left at room temperature , the more likely it is that the bacteria or toxins could make the rice unsafe to eat
how to serve rice safely : ideally , serve rice as soon as it has been cooked if that is n't possible , cool the rice as quickly as possible ( ideally within one hour ) keep rice in the fridge for no more than one day until reheating when you reheat any rice , always check that the dish is steaming hot all the way through do not reheat rice more than once source : nhs choices
