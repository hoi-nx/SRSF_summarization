these are some of their stories : the grandfather preyed on by fraudsters blake was shocked when he received a cold call from somebody who knew details of his past financial investments
the caller used the information to try to scam the grandfather , 75 , into handing over his bank details
mr blake , who is a carer for his wife anita , now believes the scammer got his details from b2c
the caller claimed to be from a utility company mr blake previously had shares in , but sold seven years ago
they told him he still had 180 shares with them and offered to buy them from him
luckily , he consulted his son , who immediately realised it was a scam
he said : â what is shocking is how they knew all this information about me
how did they know i had those shares ? â one caller also knew i had arthritis â where did that come from ? they know more about my life than i do , it seems
â mr blake , a retired thames waterman , often receives surveys asking him very specific personal information , such as how much his house is worth , his earnings and investments
he and his wife , who has recently suffered three strokes , have also been offered will - writing and funeral services , which mr blake described as â insensitive â
he said he â could nât get over â the fact that his private financial details were on a database

mr nealer was shocked to be told his personal information was on a database held by b2c â which includes details on his investments â and were being sold on to nuisance callers
wye valley called mr nealer on his home phone and sent him letters claiming he had won such a prize
thankfully , he did not respond
â i ca nât think where they would get these details , â he said
â the only places that know financial information about me are my banks
â mr nealer , who ran a florist with his daughter before he retired , says the nuisance calls increased after he recently turned 65
â people want to get their hands on my pension , â he said
mr nealer said the worst nuisance call was last week , at 8pm in the evening , when his wife answered a call from someone trying to persuade her to start planning her and her husband âs own funeral for when they die
â it âs totally inappropriate , â he says

on these occasions he has been telephoned by people from china or india claiming to be calling on behalf of microsoft
â they start by saying that my computer needs updating or has errors and then ask me to turn it on and log in , â he said
thankfully , mr west â a chartered engineer â consulted a computer expert he knew , who told him immediately it was a scam
on microsoft âs website it says that such cons are unfortunately common
thousands of people are thought to have been scammed over the phone , including the elderly ( file picture ) couple targeted by computer scammers williams and his wife , carol , receive at least two nuisance calls a day â and almost fell victim to the same con artists as mr west
they suspect they were targeted because they were on the same set of data being sold by b2c
both couples were told , by a company falsely claiming to be microsoft , that their computers needed fixing so they could access it remotely and steal their personal details
the couple get cold calls both on their mobiles and landline
the nuisance calls have got worse in the past three weeks
mr williams , 66 , a retired cabin crew member for british airways , said he was outraged that his details are being sold
â what right has anyone got to be selling these kinds of details ? we are always so careful about giving information away and never answer calls when they ask for our details

i never tick boxes on forms where it says your information can be shared
â mr edghill is also getting a growing number of calls about his finances and pension
he said cold calls made life a misery for disabled people who had to struggle to get to the phone , only to find it was a call about marketing or a scam
