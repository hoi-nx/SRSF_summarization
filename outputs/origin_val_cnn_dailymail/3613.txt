this is the moment a five foot long unexploded second world war bomb discovered under a building site in south london was blown up
a controlled explosion was carried out in a quarry at cliffe in kent this morning after the german device was discovered under a former pensioners home in bermondsey in the southwark borough on monday
soldiers of 11 eod ( explosive ordnance disposal regiment ) royal logistics corps used two kilogrammes of high explosives to blow up the luftwaffe - cylindrisch bomb
the area in bermondsey , southwark , which was severely bombed during the blitz in the second world war , was put into lockdown from monday night
it is believed the bomb was dropped over london by the luftwaffe on 11 may 1941 but unusually did not detonate
more than 1,200 people were evacuated from their homes following the discovery by builders working on the construction site of the former southwark irish pensioners centre
a police cordon sealed off 200 metres of land surrounding the bomb site for 32 hours as the army built a bunker around the bomb to safely defuse it
the teams , who had previously worked on improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) in afghanistan and northern ireland , used hesco blast walls , like those used to build camp bastion and other military bases in afghanistan during the conflict there
a soldier in charge of removing it has revealed that if the bomb had exploded it could have led to ' major loss of life ' and significant damage to buildings
senior ammunition technician john lester said it was a ' a live munition in a dangerous condition ' which had to be taken far from the city before it could be safely destroyed
sat lester , of 11 eod , royal logistic corps , said : ' this bomb was a live munition in a dangerous condition
it had been disturbed by some pretty heavy building machinery , which is never a good thing
bombs do n't like being bashed around
' but once we 'd uncovered it , we knew what we were dealing with and it was just a question of solving the puzzle quickly so we could get it away and the good residents of bermondsey back in their homes
' we knew we had to get it away to dispose of it safely because trying to deal onsite with a bomb that size , even under a controlled explosion , would cause significant damage to buildings , ( and ) property , and the risk of major loss of life in such a highly populated part of the city was very high
