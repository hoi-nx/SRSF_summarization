clarkson told the paper : ' i 've been put on silence
there are very good reasons from my point of view why i simply ca n't say a word
' his future at the bbc is to be decided next week when the corporation 's internal probe into his ' fracas ' with mr oisin tymon is put before director - general tony hall

the sunday times has reported that clarkson is already considering a change in direction - and may become the face of a new documentary series on farming
the paper reports clarkson originally took the idea to then bbc director general george entwistle in 2012 but it did not get the go - ahead
but following the now infamous fracas and the uncertainty surrounding his current job , clarkson it said to be preparing a new proposal for the show
a source told the paper : ' in the last week clarkson has had a chance to firm it up
it 's about trying to run a farm when you do n't know anything about farming and getting things wrong ... in a top gear-esque way
' in 2012 , clarkson told the radio times : ' i love the idea of being a farmer , that 's why i like watching adam 's farm [ on countryfile ]
but farming land is complex
it 's a business , but it 's important to me that the land looks beautiful too
