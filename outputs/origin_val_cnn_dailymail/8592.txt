roy hodgson picks his three lions squad on thursday for a euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania and a friendly against italy
wayne rooney , danny welbeck , rickie lambert and saido berahino were named to face scotland in november
daniel sturridge is fit again now too , but there are three new boys on the block
so what do the likes of danny ings , charlie austin and harry kane have to offer ? danny ings he âs a very astute and clever player , aware of what âs going on around him in midfield and around the penalty box
his movement and technical ability are good
danny ings looks to go in behind the defender and to face up and receive the ball
he has a bit of pace as well
here is a player who will really flourish if he ends up at liverpool , arsenal or manchester united because of the amount of chances he âll the get there
he has a big future
burnley striker danny ings ( right ) is a a very astute and clever player with a bit of pace as well charlie austin what people do nât appreciate about charlie austin is that he âs scored 15 goals this season yet because qpr are fighting relegation , he âs not had that many chances
he is a born finisher , instinctive in the way that gary lineker or ian rush was and perhaps the best of the three in that regard
i was with him at qpr and charlie austin knows he has to work on his game outside the box , in his positioning and movement
but he will do that , because he is committed learner and though he âs 25 , you can see him improving over the next few years
qpr forward charlie austin has scored 15 premier league goals this season , despite the club 's struggles harry kane harry kane âs probably not quite as good a finisher as charlie austin , but his all - round game is better
he can play off the front , he can play the one right up the top
his movement is excellent and technically he looks a really good player
his finishing is much more clinical now and he has range , from the header he scored against arsenal , to shots outside and inside the box
in general , if a player is good enough for the senior squad , i do nât see the sense in sending them back to the under 21s
it âs unlikely harry kane will get much game time against lithuania and italy so he will probably go back to the u21s for the summer tournament
but once he has three or four senior games under his belt , there should be no going back
harry kane is the premier league 's form man - winning the january and february player of the month award verdict i do nât think three lions have had this amount of players to choose from up front since i was manager
alan shearer , teddy sheringham , ian wright and michael owen meant the likes of as robbie fowler , les ferdinand and andrew cole were nât first choice
roy hodgson might have a similar scenario developing now
michael owen ( left ) was one of several attacking options glenn hoddle had at his disposal as three lions boss
