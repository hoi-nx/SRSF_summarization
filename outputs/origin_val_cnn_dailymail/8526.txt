having to find a suitable place in which to land and refuel your f - 16 fighter jet can take a lot of time
but this video released by joint base elmendorf-richardson in anchorage , alaska shows the ingenious way to top up the tank without losing any air miles
captured on camera is the moment the f-16 skilfully flies up behind a tanker aircraft and steadies itself in the skies over snowy alaska
the f - 16 fighter jet skilfully flies up behind the main aircraft and steadies itself while getting into position a large nozzle extends from the back of the tanker plane and then manoeuvres towards the fighter jet
the jet moves into position , allowing the nozzle to enter a small triangular hole at the top of the f-16
the two planes maintain their speed as the snowy alaska landscape flashes by below them , and the fuel transfers from one to the other
receiving enough fuel to carry on its flight , the fighter jet pulls away from the larger plane and flies off
the large nozzle hanging from the bottom of the plane manoeuvres towards the fighter jet and it latches on the process is then repeated with another plane moments later
eielson and joint base elmendorf-richardson are the home of red flag-alaska , who execute tactical air combat employment exercises
the exercises are designed to help pilots gain more experience by having them deal with the stresses war fighters go through while flying , but in controlled conditions
the two planes maintain their speed while flying over alaska as fuel is transferred from one to the other after receiving enough fuel to carry on its flight , the fighter jet pulls away from the larger aircraft the crews are subjected to a number of conceivable combat threats , and up to 70 jet fighters can be operating in the same airspace at one time
on average , however , more than 1,000 us air force members and up to 60 aircraft deploy to eielson , and an additional 500 people and 40 aircraft deploy to joint base elmendorf-richardson for each event
the exercises also provide an operations training environment for participants such as unit - level intelligence experts , maintenance crews , and command and control elements
refuelling in the air is an example of a tactical exercise pilots are required to demonstrate .
