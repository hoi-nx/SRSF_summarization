' stuart mccall had a fantastic record at motherwell
they need to get back to the premiership for the state of the game up there â in terms of revenue , crowds , competition
' it 's important and i think that 's why scottish has struggled
celtic need it as well â the competition has been missing
' neil lennon guided the parkhead side to the knockout stage of the champions league during his four - year spell in the dug - out , but revealed that the overall decline of the premiership 's financial situation had necessitated the sale of key players
lee wallace ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after giving rangers the lead away to hibs he said : ' it all depends on celtic
when i was there we ended up selling the crown jewels in terms of victor wanyama , gary hooper , joe ledley , georgios samaras
' it 's very difficult to keep churning out those players , but that was the financial situation
there 's no doubt the scottish game is significantly weaker
' hibs , hearts and rangers are in the championship and they were a big loss in terms of revenue , crowds , quality and competition
' it 's lacking at the minute , it 's not in a great state
there are seven or eight teams in the premiership who have average gates of 4 - 5,000 and with that it 's very difficult to compete with other european countries
' kenny miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for rangers and close the gap on hibs neil lennon believes that smaller european countries may look to combine with their neighbours to create more competitive leagues

' the eastern bloc , as well â you never see any of those teams participating in the champions league these days
these countries are trying to make a play for having a fair crack of the whip in terms of revenue or even amalgamating some leagues and creating a better standard
