it has long been seen as a mythical and powerful city , lost for more than 2,000 years beneath the sea
explorers have traveled to crete , malta , sicily and santorini in search of the the mysterious metropolis of atlantis - described in detai by greek philosopher plato
but a computer expert has challenged these theories after he claimed the lost city did not sink at all , and said he had tracked down the site - to an area on land in morocco
the german computer expert formed his theory using mathematics to calculate the precise gps coordinates of the lost city
he meticulously gathered every detail he could from plato 's ' timaeus ' and ' critias ' which describes atlantis in detail and gives in total 51 clues about the mysterious city
these ' clues ' include that atlantis was near the sea and had a ring - like structure surrounding its centre
crucially , it was also said to be 3,100 miles from athens
this area includes western europe , africa and the middle east
other clues were that atlantis was not in ancient western europe or asia and had very high and big mountains , with morocco having the atlas mountains
it was also said to lay west of egypt and tyrrhenia
using these details hubner put the measurements into a computer programme and used a map which divided the area into 400 squares
the site pinpointed by hubner had many of the 51 clues , including being surrounded by concentric circles hubner 's theory challenges previous ideas about atlantis , that it lies somewhere beneath the sea hubner marked the areas where more characteristics were present and came out with one region which had the most clues - the souss massa plain in morocco , about 100 miles south of marrakesh
he then took the gps coordinates and went to have a look himself
what he found appeared to have many of the attributes of atlantis described 2,600 years ago by plato , regarded as one of the greatest western thinkers
this map of atlantis - oriented with south at the top - was drawn by 17th century scholar athanasius kircher , who pinpointed the mythical continent as being in the mid-atlantic before it was lost to the sea the site was in a desert basin just seven miles from the sea and in the centre was a small mound , similar to the raised area at the heart of the ancient city described by plato
surrounding it were circular dry riverbeds , matching plato 's description of the city being surrounded by concentric circles , which alternated between land and sea
hubner concluded it was highly improbable that all the characteristics of atlantis were present in this area purely by chance
the findings are described in adams ' book the theory is described as ' the most convincing on paper ' by adams in his book , ' meet me in atlantis
' adams wrote : ' the measurements for the diameter of his outermost ring and distance of his capital from the atlantic varied by only about 10 percent from plato 's numbers
' the author also found support for hubner 's idea that rather than sinking into the ocean , atlantis was overwhelmed by a large wave
the area around souss massa is prone to earthquakes , which can cause tsunamis of the size needed to flatten a city
hubner had claimed that the idea of atlantis being beneath the sea was simply an example of the real elements of the story being lost over years of retelling
also morocco has historically not been examined by archaeologists , suggesting many undiscovered remains that may hold the key to the lost city could exist
hubner formulated his theory in 2008
before he died in 2013 he met adams and took him to the precise site he had pinpointed from his calculations
the theory differs from many hypotheses that place atlantis as a lost city beneath the sea , as described by plato
earlier this year orichalcum , a form of metal , was found beneath the sea off the coast of sicily and is believed to have come from the lost metropolis
a total of 39 ingots were found in the wreck of a 2,600 year old cargo vessel thought to be from greek
atlantis was first described by the greek philosopher plato more than 2,000 years ago
while many believe the story is a myth created by plato to illustrate his theories about politics , others insist it is based on a real historical disaster
according to plato 's account , written around 360bc , atlantis was a major sea power located in the atlantic
it was larger than ancient libya and asia minor ( modern turkey ) put together , and was ' the way to the other islands , and from these you might pass to the whole of the opposite continent '
his account included detailed descriptions of the island - with mountains in the north and along the coast , and a plain in the south
its kings were descended from poseidon - the god of sea - but their divine lineage became diluted as they mixed with mortals
by around 9600 bc the island had conquered much of western europe and africa and enslaved its enemies
this date would make the city nearly as old as the end of the last ice age and pre-dates the earliest recorded city states , found in what is now iraq , so seems rather unlikely
after a failed attempt to invade athens , the entire island sank into the sea ' in a single day and night of misfortune '
over the centuries , scholars have attempted to locate the real atlantis - believing the account was based on a real ancient superpower
one of the most plausible theories is that plato was describing the minoan civilisation on crete and the neighbouring island of santorini which was devastated by a massive volcanic eruption around 1600bc
some believe the atlantis myth was inspired by the black sea floods of around 5000bc - an event that may have also generated the flood stories which appeared in the old testament .
