kieran ( pictured ) , was strangled when the straps of his backpack became entangled as he tried to get off a ski lift the 14 - year - old was on a school skiing trip in the alpine resort of tourisme a chatel ( pictured ) in february 2011
kieran 's parents , nick and brookes , have said they want to establish the sequence of events that led to his death so no other family will suffer a similar tragedy
they hope the trial will provide answers to lingering questions surrounding their son 's death
mr kieran , 50 , an nhs manager from bovey tracey , devon , said : ' all this time after kieran 's death we are still not sure of exactly what happened
' not knowing the events which led to his death is something which holds back the healing process
' we have some information about what went so dreadfully wrong but not all the details
we have a jigsaw but with some of the pieces missing
' we 're hoping that through the trial in france we will soon get those questions answered
' lawyers representing saem sports a tourisme a chatel confirmed the firm and cettour will face trial this year
kieran ( pictured ) was one of the brightest maths prospects in the country after scoring 96 per cent in a national test
he was on a six - seat ski lift when the tragedy struck they are accused of failing to enforce a rule banning skiers from boarding the lift while wearing backpacks , not carrying out daily checks on equipment and not ensuring a safety device which could stop the lift was properly installed
richard cettour is also accused of a number of failings , including not being at his post at the time of the accident and not reacting to other skiers ' calls to hit the emergency stop
kieran , a pupil at torquay boys ' grammar school , who was one of the brightest maths prospects in the country after scoring 96 per cent in a national test , was on a six - seat ski lift when the tragedy struck
it is believed his backpack got stuck on the lift chair as he tried to climb off at the top of the slope
kieran was suspended by his clothing for around four minutes before he was released , according to witnesses
first aiders battled for eight minutes to revive him before he was taken to hospital in annecy with a severe brain injury
he was transferred to the royal devon and exeter hospital intensive care unit where he died nearly a month later on march 17 , 2011
mr kieran said : ' it feels so very fresh because we are still going over the events in our mind
nick and brookes , the parents of kieran ( pictured ) , have said they want to establish the sequence of events that led to his death so no other family will suffer a similar tragedy ' i think it is natural as parents to ask the questions : could more have been done to save kieran , did he suffer , what went wrong and what can be done to prevent this from ever happening to another family ? ' it is like we have an open wound that we can not close because we do n't have the resources at our disposal
' the hole in our life left by kieran will always be there - all the future we would have had together is missing
' it 's so difficult not being able yet to point at something positive to come from this tragedy - some safety improvements that we can say were made as a result of what we learned from kieran 's death
' hopefully , the trial will help us understand
' mrs brookes , 52 , also an nhs manager , said : ' he was academically bright but also loved to be physically active and was a member of the army cadets
' kieran dreamed of becoming a doctor and helping people
he wanted to be a gp
we could n't bury kieran for six months because of the police investigation
' we also could n't donate his organs which was something that would have given us some comfort
the comfort that we 're looking for now is that we can say that something good came of this , that lessons have been learnt from this which will make things safer
' the family 's lawyer mark montaldo , of slater and gordon , said : ' the french alps prosecutor has enough evidence to bring two charges of involuntary manslaughter in this case against the pilot of the ski lift and the company which employed him
' it has been devastating for kieran 's family to lose a much - loved son in these circumstances
but they are determined that the full facts of what happened are revealed and any safety failings exposed so that no other family has to suffer a similar tragedy again
