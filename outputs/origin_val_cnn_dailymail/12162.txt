as a manager at several prominent media outlets , zaleski did not understand the demands on working moms and often belittled their work ethic
then she became a mom , and everything changed
in a widely shared piece this week for fortune.com , the journalist - turned - startup executive apologizes for disparaging the mothers she worked with in her 20s at the huffington post and washington post
zaleski said she committed multiple " infractions , " against these women , including scheduling late - afternoon meetings or happy hours without considering that mothers with after - work responsibilities would n't be able to attend
she even did n't disagree " when another female editor said we should hurry up and fire another woman before she ' got pregnant
' " now a mother to a young daughter , zaleski said she was wrong to undervalue mothers ' contributions by counting hours logged in the office and not the actual work done
" i wish i had known five years ago , as a young , childless manager , that mothers are the people you need on your team , " she wrote
" there 's a saying that ' if you want something done then ask a busy person to do it
' that 's exactly why i like working with mothers now
" zaleski 's piece has been shared more than 1,000 times and has been hailed on social media by many commenters who applaud her for seeing the error of her ways
" your message is so important and it 's about time it was addressed , " said heather bouvier on twitter
" thank you for writing this
there are so many people like your then - childless 28 - year - old self who need to read it
seriously , thank you from the bottom of my heart , " wrote alice gomstyn on facebook
since the essay was published tuesday , zaleski told cnn she 's received more than 2,000 emails from readers who admit they 've committed similar infractions in the workplace
" i 'm so motivated and thrilled , " she said
" i could n't be more psyched for the responses
" but not all the responses have been positive
some people refuse to accept zaleski 's apology and accuse her of borrowing from similar apologetic essays by other new moms
" this woman has basically stolen another woman 's post about her views on mothers with children in the workforce for her own personal gain ! ! , " wrote one commenter on zaleski 's essay
others accuse zaleski of writing the essay just to promote the new company she co-founded , power to fly , an online platform that matches women with technical skills to freelance projects they can do from anywhere
" this woman & her shameless self - promoting article disgust me
no integrity , " kitten holiday said on twitter
zaleski said that notion is " just silly , " and she 's taken a huge risk leaving a stable job to start a company that is a part of the solution
zaleski said her company , which launched in august , enables women to work from home so that they can " be valued for their productivity and not time spent sitting in an office or at a bar bonding afterwards
" but some critics say encouraging mothers to work from home only perpetuates a problem
" i like this article a lot , but wish the solution was n't to have a company that helps mothers find jobs that keep them tucked away at home , but to change the dominant culture to create better , more supportive workplaces where flexible schedules are encouraged , " said suzanne pekow carlson on facebook
others say they wish zaleski went further , and instead of only addressing the challenges of the working mother , wished she 'd included other caregivers , like dads
" i hope the convo ... expands beyond just working moms to working dads , folks taking care of sick parents , etc. , " abc 's karen travers said on twitter
" i do n't understand why we still refuse to acknowledge that our society needs to be more flexible for parents
it is not just the woman 's burden , " said margaret weingart berger on facebook
and said another commenter on zaleski 's essay , " if it takes this woman becoming a mother to understand the value of working mothers and have compassion for them , then i guess we ca n't expect men to understand and have compassion because they will never be able to be mothers themselves
" zaleski said she finds the criticism " frustrating , " but said she refuses to dwell on the negative
she wants to " stay focused on helping women find fulfilling work they can do from home
" she said her essay represents her " own personal experience , " which happens to mostly involve working with mothers
but she 's glad her piece has opened a dialogue and she hopes the conversation continues
women not supporting women " is a systemic problem in our society , " zaleski said
serena markstrom nugent , posting on facebook , agreed
" to the women mad at her ( zaleski ) and saying too little too late : she not only had not had kids but was very young and ambitious
in the spirit of not tearing down other women , i would say cheer her on for where she is on in the journey , " she wrote
" still young , still learning , and at least at this point , it appears , part of the solution
" still other critics suggest the issue is n't as simple as parents versus non-parents in the workplace
instead , they say , it 's about the lack of empathy that exists between colleagues whose circumstances are different from their own
" why is it necessary to ' walk in someone 's shoes ' before we understand their perspective ? " said ann oconnell on facebook
" until we strive to have understanding and compassion for people regardless of our personal circumstances or life choices , we will remain selfish and self - centered as a whole
