black caps seamer boult is not taking the threat of bangladesh lightly as his side look to keep building momentum for the world cup knockout phase
the tournament co-hosts have won their opening five matches and are guaranteed to finish top of pool , regardless of their result against the tigers at seddon park in hamilton
yet the black caps will want to end the pool with a flourish and enter their quarter - final in the best possible frame of mind
boult , who has taken 13 wickets already this world cup , appeals successfully for an lbw decision on home soil , they have won all six of their previous one - day international meetings against bangladesh but it is the asian side that triumphed 3 - 0 when the teams last met on the subcontinent in late 2013
boult told new zealand cricket 's official website : ' success is there for us when we are playing them in their own backyard but when we have travelled there we have struggled a little bit
' they are full of some world class players and we know that they will be a tough candidate come friday night
' black caps have won all five games so far , including beating co-hosts australia , to secure top spot in pool b boult has played a starring role in black caps 's stellar start to the tournament with 13 wickets in five matches , including a spectacular five - for against australia
it is quite an achievement for the 25 - year - old , who had made just 16 odi appearances before the tournament got under way
' the success that we have been having has been pretty special and [ this world cup ] is something that i will look back on and be really proud of , ' he added
' i am sure that i speak for the majority of the group there as well
a world cup in my home country , it 's not hard to get motivated for that
' boult and the black caps attack have been unstoppable , but he says they wo n't take bangladesh lightly another pillar of black caps 's success has been the largely excellent starts they have made to their batting , thanks to opener mccullum 's masterclass in power hitting
the black caps captain has made 249 runs at an average of just under 50 in his five matches and his staggering strike rate of 193.02 has laid the foundations for his side
bangladesh spin bowling coach kalpage has admitted they have options to try and stifle mccullum
bangladesh are already into the quarter finals after beating england on monday to get out of the pool stage ' he has not had to start against spinners , ' kalpage told cricinfo
' it will be tough for us but we have plans for him as well
i 'm pretty sure it will help the spinners
' the tigers proved they were not among the also rans of the tournament by beating england to book their place in the quarter - finals and could finish as high as second in the pool if they win on friday and scotland record a shock win against australia
the tigers could still finish as high as second in the group if they pull off an unlikely victory over black caps
