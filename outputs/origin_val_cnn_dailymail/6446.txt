alecsandra raluca dragoi , 22 , from london , captured people of all ages in various locations in a bid to explore ideas of human interaction and communication
a new photo project shows people holding their regrets on handwritten signs
this woman 's deepest regret was when she stole her sister 's money the girl on the left wrote : ' i regret that i forgot to take my baby doll with me today ' and the boy ( right ) wrote ' i regret i do not have more time to play ' standing straight clutching holding their signs , the unnamed subjects stare straight into the university of portsmouth graduate 's lens , allowing viewers to judge them and draw their own conclusions
while some declared they had no regrets , others were much more forthcoming in their vulnerable state
alcohol addiction , theft and smoking weed were among the most explosive revelations from those keen to unburden themselves
a young man with a smiling toddler in a pram confessed his drinking problem while a teenage wears the ghost of a smile as she admits stealing her sister 's money
a couple now living in a british seaside town said : ' our biggest regret is that we did n't move here many years ago
we love it here ' these young men regret supporting middlesbrough and smoking cannabis a remorseful woman regretted not being able to help her child more and another wished she had different parents
there were positive messages too though , with one elderly couple expressing joy at where they live , while a little girl simply wished she had brought her doll out with her
alecsandra raluca dragoi said of the project : ' this question has given to me the chance to have a profound connection between me and the interlocutor , thus managing to get into their soul and bring out a grinding they have for years
' the girl on the left wrote ' not having the confidence to be the best i can ' and the girl hiding behind her sign wrote ' what i did last night ' this man regrets : ' not saying " i love you ! " enough ' but while many people alecsandra raluca dragoi asked were happy to open up about their experiences , others flatly refused
she said : ' it is true that many of the surveyed people had some abstention regarding their answers , and some of them said that it is too personal , but i had the chance to meet kind people to whom i could talk
' the project was inspired by the work of gillian wearing , obe , an english conceptual artist who was part of the young british artists ' movement in the 1990s
wearing uses photography and video to document the confessions of ordinary people and won the turner prize in 1997 for her ' 60 minutes silence ' and ' sacha and mum ' videos
this woman revealed that she regretted : ' that i did not have the right parents ' the man with the pram on the left confessed ' developing an addiction to alcohol ' and the man on the right wrote ' not becoming a footballer ' alecsandra raluca dragoi believes that her project had the power to help the people she met , by helping them to offload their burdens
she said : ' i think that frequently when you share your thought with somebody , even if it is strange person , you release the black stain which is on the soul and you can feel free
' i do not trust in people who say that they do not have regrets
' in my opinion , there is a difference between not having regrets and not thinking about them
' not thinking about regrets is better , because what you have done is in the past
