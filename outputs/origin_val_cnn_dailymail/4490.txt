i 'm also working to restore the strength of my voice after the op. ' many thanks to all the doctors and nurses who have been , and are , looking after me - particularly at the royal brompton and royal free hospitals
' heartfelt thanks too to the many people who have been in touch with their good wishes
' news of his illness last month sparked an outpouring of messages on twitter , with prime minister david cameron one of the first to tweet a get - well message
he said : ' sorry to hear you 'll be off for a few weeks
i wish you well - and a speedy return before the general election
' labour leader ed miliband tweeted : ' best wishes for a speedy recovery

' mr robinson , who is married with three children , used the blog to kick - start his return to work and covering the election with some advice for voters
his message was : ' it 's all about you
' mr robinson had been diagnosed with a rare bronchial carcinoid tumour
located in the lungs ' larger tubes , they are usually slow - growing
but they can spread and trigger cancer elsewhere in the body , becoming fatal
bronchial carcinoid tumours are different from ' normal ' lung cancer , which forms among the cells that line the lung
carcinoid tumours are actually cancers of tissues that produce hormones and send messages , called the neuroendocrine system
they can occur in numerous organs
two - thirds appear in the digestive tract , a quarter in the lungs , and others in the pancreas , kidney , ovary and testes , according to cancer research uk
mr robinson faced vicious personal attacks by supporters of the ' yes to independence ' campaign during the scottish referendum dr keith prowse , medical adviser to the british lung foundation , said while bronchial carcinoid tumours were malignant , they tended to be less aggressive than other forms
he said : ' i 've had ten or a dozen patients who have had it removed successfully and are still around , some of them older than i am
the majority are cured by surgery
' it 's often possible to remove the tumours completely , because they tend to grow inside the air passage rather than into the lung
' about 70 per cent of patients live at least five years after being diagnosed , he added
but he said if they did spread , they tended to be fairly resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy
most people with bronchial carcinoid tumours are diagnosed after the age of 60 , although they can have existed for years without any symptoms
mr robinson has been the corporation 's political editor since 2005 , when he was poached from itn
his illness follows that of his bbc predecessor , marr , who suffered a stroke in january 2013 at the age of 53
after lengthy rehabilitation mr marr has made a good recovery .
