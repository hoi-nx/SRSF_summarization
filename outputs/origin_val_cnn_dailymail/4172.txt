respect for officials may not always be at the levels the referees would hope , but fiorentina seem to have taken it further than most during their game against milan on tuesday
' fiorentina ' players were in the middle of a startling comeback win , and held the momentum with five minutes to go having just equalised through gonzalo rodriguez , when referee carmine rosso halted the game to get treatment
carmine rosso left the pitch , thinking he had stopped play , to receive medical attention and eventually be replaced by his fourth official
fiorentina players continue to play against milan , despite there being no referee on the pitch the players looked genuinely surprised when they were pulled back after the lack of official was pointed out carmine rosso did n't realise the players were continuing as he left the pitch to receive treatment carmine rosso blew his whistle and gestured angrily to halt the play , before being replaced by the fourth official after a short stoppage carmine rosso was replaced , before fiorentina went on to win the game with a late goal however , the fiorentina stars took no notice , continuing to attack with no referee on the pitch , until the official , rather angrily , had to forcefully bring the move to the end with several short blasts on his whistle
eventually the men in purple realised what was going on and stopped so that carmine rosso could be replaced , in an incident similar to chris foy 's injury during arsenal 's win over west ham this weekend
however , the stoppage did little to interrupt vincenzo montella 's side , as just moments later joaquin scored a header to put them in front and secure a superb come from behind win
