the last salmon fisherman on the severn is embroiled in a legal battle with the ea - after catching just a single fish too many
nigel , 71 , has been catching salmon in traditional basket traps since the 1970s and once netted up to 600 fish a year worth Â£ 100 each
but his livelihood was thrown into doubt in 2012 when the ea ruled that no individual fisherman could land more than 30 in a season
nigel is the last remaining commercial salmon fisherman on the severn and claims it is impossible for him to make a living if he is restricted to catching just 30 fish in a season the severn
nigel 's home in stroat , gloucestershire , is around six miles from the town of lydney , off which he fishes
the 71 - year - old used to catch up to 600 salmon a year worth Â£ 100 each defiant nigel continued to use his putcher rank - an array of 650 basket - like traps - and hit the quota in just 26 days
as a protest he presented his 31st fish to the local ea office - and was duly prosecuted
he won his case but the agency has now announced plans to appeal the decision
nigel said : ' when i caught the 30th fish , i rang them up and told them i was going to fish in excess of the 30 - i even brought them my 31st fish
' they seized my fish and warned me of a prosecution - which is exactly what i wanted because i was very anxious to get my evidence before a court
' the ea introduced the new quotas amid fears that the salmon population in the severn was dangerously low
nigel , of stroat , gloucestershire , has won his case , but must face another hearing in the court of appeal after catching his 31st fish nigel was prosecuted for breaching his licence and the case was heard at the high court in london in february
nigel , of stroat , gloucestershire , argued that the unreasonably low quota threatened his livelihood and would put him out of business
he claims his form of fishing has minimal impact on salmon in the severn , as his putchers stretch out just a couple of hundred metres from the riverbank
that leaves a mile of open water for the fish to swim past his cages , he argued , allowing plenty of space
despite winning the case his legal battle still shows no signs of ending as the ea has vowed to take it to the court of appeal
a spokesman said : ' although the judge has at this stage ruled in mr nigel 's favour , we will be seeking leave to appeal to the court of appeal
' all of these sites are designated to protect salmon , and these populations are currently under threat
' we impose restrictions on salmon fishing for all fisheries in these areas because of the need to protect the designated habitats and fisheries
