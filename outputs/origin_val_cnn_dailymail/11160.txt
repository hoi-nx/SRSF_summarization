ronny deila has branded dundee united âs aidan connolly a diver - then called on the sfa to prove they do nât just punish celtic players for simulation
aidan connolly tumbled to win dundee united âs goal from the penalty spot - scored by nadir ciftci - towards the end of the first half after ref craig thomson deemed he had been tripped by anthony stokes
in august , celtic winger derk boerrigter was handed a two - match ban for diving to win a penalty in a 2 - 0 win at st johnstone
and ronny deila insisted he was baffled as to why it âs only his team that is targeted â albeit he was seemingly unaware st johnstone âs brian graham was also suspended for diving to win a penalty against inverness in december
celtic manager ronny deila wants retrospective action after claiming aidan connolly dived to win a penalty the referee points to the spot after aidan connolly was brought down in the celtic box during william hill scottish cup clash celtic keeper craig gordon fails to stop nadir ciftci from giving dundee united the lead at tannadice â the dundee united penalty was a dive and hopefully it will be the same rules for everybody , â fumed ronny deila
â we are the only team this season in the league to have a suspension for diving , derk boerrigter
â i said at the time it was no problem because that is the line that will be taken by everyone
but i do nât think anybody has had it since then
the scottish players have been unbelievably good
they âve not dived but if they do ( like aidan connolly ) it should be the same rules
â is it the fault of the ref or the player they got a penalty ? it âs both
but i accept people make mistakes
we have a rule where people look at things afterwards but i do nât see anybody else getting suspensions
â celtic defender virgil van dyke ( right ) was sent off after only nine minutes of the william hill scottish cup quarter - final in what appeared to be a case of mistaken identity , the referee also sent off dundee united 's paul paton dundee united had a second player sent off after paul dixon ( 3rd left ) receives his marching orders ronny deila will study footage of the melee that saw virgil ordered off alongside paul paton before deciding whether to appeal in a bid to clear him for sunday âs league cup final against dundee united at hampden
but stefan will miss the william hill scottish cup quarter - final replay at parkhead on march 18 after being booked yesterday
â i have looked at some pictures but it âs hard to see what happened , â said ronny deila
â virgil just said there was a tackle and suddenly somebody was holding his legs
there was some kicking of each other to get off each other
' hopefully everybody can play in the next game
will we appeal ? we will see
i actually did nât know until now that stefan is out of the replay
it âs good we have a big squad
â leigh griffiths missed his chance to equalise for celtic from the penalty spot leigh griffiths made up for his penalty miss by drawing celtic level with a header celtic captain scott brown celebrates with leigh griffiths as the game finishes in a 1 - 1 draw ronny deila did nât fear any further disciplinary problems in the final but took a swipe at the abysmal tannadice pitch
â there is going to be a high temperature , yes , but i âm not worried
that âs why we love football
we are fighting for big things , trophies , and we have to keep our discipline
but the pitch made it a fight today
it was nothing about playing football
if you are going to develop players in this league , you have to have pitches you can play on
â meanwhile , the sfa compliance officer could be forced to look at footage from dutch tv in which celtic âs john guidetti is alleged to have performed a song during an interview including the words â the huns are deid â
a recent petition lobbying the scottish parliament was launched by a group of rangers fans who claimed â huns â is a derogatory term used against protestants .
