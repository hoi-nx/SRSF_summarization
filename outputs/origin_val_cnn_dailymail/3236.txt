still the sweetheart : dame vera will be central to the festivities dame vera lynn is to play a central role in a long weekend of spectacular celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of ve day
the wartime singer â who will be 98 on friday â is to be included in events to commemorate seven decades since the end of the second world war in europe on may 8
ministers will today announce a three - day spectacular , including wartime - themed parties , the lighting of a chain of beacons , a veterans â parade , an raf fly - past and a 1940s - themed celebrity pop concert
government sources said they were â pulling out all the stops â for the commemorations â which start the day after the election â because it is likely to be the last major anniversary to fall during the lifetime of second world war participants
although now too frail to travel to the events , dame vera â the forces â sweetheart â will be consulted over the arrangements and is likely to provide either a written tribute statement or video message
under the plans , a service of remembrance will be held at the cenotaph on ve day itself , including a two - minute silence at 3pm marking the moment churchill announced the end of the war
schools will hold ve day - themed assemblies or tea parties , and during the evening a chain of over 100 flaming beacons will be lit across the uk
on saturday may 9 , cathedrals will ring their bells in celebration and a 1940s - themed concert will be held at london âs horse guards parade
the concert , to be broadcast live on bbc1 , is expected to feature many of the stars who appeared in a similar 60th anniversary ve day concert , such as the singers katie melua and katherine jenkins
may 10 will be marked by a service of thanksgiving at westminster abbey , followed by a veterans â parade which will pass along whitehall and under the hm treasury balcony where churchill appeared before ve day crowds
couples celebrate ve day - which marked the formal conclusion of hitler 's war - in trafalgar square in 1945 a reception for 2,000 veterans will be hosted by the royal british legion in st james âs park , coinciding with a fly - past by a hurricane , spitfire and lancaster

last night , she said : â i am sorry i will not be able to celebrate the 70th anniversary of ve day in london in person , but my thoughts are with all who take part
we must always remember those who fought and all those who gave their lives on our behalf
