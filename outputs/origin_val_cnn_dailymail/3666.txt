a fortnight ago , eight - year - old janshir gingerly stepped off a plane at heathrow , his lips blue
it was nât the uk weather that had turned them such a deathly colour : syrian â janshir âs home country â can be just as cold in early spring
rather , it was a combination of rare heart problems that meant blood was not getting around his body properly
in fact , it was receiving little over half the oxygen it should
ever since birth , congenital heart defects meant janshir was being slowly starved of air , much like a climber marooned at high altitude
since janshir was four , he and his family have had to live with the devastating conflict that has ripped syrian apart , claiming more than 200,000 lives in the process
dodging bombs and bullets , his family first fled their aleppo home just weeks before it was blown to bits by president assad âs jets
then they took refuge in a village near the turkey border , only for it to become the focus of fierce fighting
like thousands of other children , janshir has spent time in a tented refugee camp too
unsurprisingly , his health suffered â and his family frequently feared he would die
but today , thanks to a uk charity which brought him here for a life - saving operation , janshir looks like a different boy
in fact , just days after undergoing surgery at the harley street clinic in london , he appears remarkably healthy
like any impatient eight - year - old , he grabs a mobile phone from his father omar â with whom he shares an unmistakable likeness â to show him how it really works
his eyes are bright â and his lips are pink
â janshir is a walking miracle , â says emma scanlan , chief executive of chain of hope , which brings children to uk for heart surgery and conducts operating missions abroad
devastation : a man walks with children in jansir 's home town of aleppo after it was hit by bombs last year â most children in the uk with his condition , called tetralogy of fallot , would be treated on the nhs soon after birth
but he has been walking around with this for eight years , been bombed , and had to flee
â curling up on his father âs lap , shy janshir simply says he is â happy â to be recovering after his operation
it involved patching up a huge hole in his heart , widening a crucial vessel taking blood out of the heart , and correcting a narrow valve
the operation , performed without charge by consultant cardiothoracic surgeon kostolny , means his heart now pumps more efficiently
and thanks to the hole being closed , de-oxygenated â blue â blood will no longer be mixed with fresh blood
without it , mr kostolny says , janshir âs life would have been â severely limited â
he would have got progressively weaker and would probably have died in early adulthood
instead , he should now have â a fairly normal future â and could even be up and playing football within weeks
â children , in general , recover amazingly quickly after heart surgery , â says mr kostolny
mr janshir , a physics teacher , holds his son tight
â it was a race against time to get him here , â he says
aged three , janshir was flown to france to be fitted with a stent to widen a heart opening , but the family knew that was a temporary fix
as daily life became more difficult , janshir âs health went slowly downhill
by summer 2012 , things had got so bad that mr janshir decided to move the family out of aleppo
â we fled with nothing except our clothes , â says mr janshir
the family , who are kurd , took shelter in a village where they have roots
â leaving aleppo was awful , but a month after we left , the apartment block where we lived was bombed
we lost everything and heard friends of ours had been killed
â but they could not escape the war
by early 2013 fighting had spread to their village near azaz , close to the turkey border , so they moved again â this time to a tented camp
a month later , with janshir âs fragile health getting worse , the family returned to the village , only for mr janshir to face interrogation by kurdish fighters from a group called the ypk
despite being a kurd himself , they held him captive , asked him why he had left , and whose side he was really on
homeless : the apartment block jansir and his family were forced to flee before it was blown to bits by president assad âs jets â i was in prison for 25 days , â he recalls
â i thought that they were going to kill me
â all this time he could do nothing to help janshir , who he desperately needed to take to turkey to see a heart specialist
after being set free , he took the boy and made for the border , helped by guides
father and son then spent months in turkey , during which they visited a cardiologist who confirmed the extent of janshir âs problems
but nobody could help and they were forced to return to syrian
finally , last november mr janshir âs brother wahid , who lives in london , discovered chain of hope
since being set up 20 years ago by pioneering heart surgeon professor sir magdi yacoub , the charity has treated more than 2,000 children
janshir and his family were in syrian when news filtered through that the operation would take place â prompting mr janshir and his wife awash , 31 , to break down in tears
from there janshir and his father travelled to istanbul and caught a flight to london , accompanied by a chain of hope doctor as there were concerns over how janshir would cope on the flight
the operation last sunday went well and janshir should soon be discharged
mr janshir is now considering applying for asylum in the uk
at the moment , janshir and his father are here on three - month medical visas
the charity stresses it does not get involved in immigration issues
while janshir âs heart has been fixed , what his life now holds â like countless other syrian children â remains uncertain
