after being knocked out of the champions league , chelsea have just 11 games left this campaign with all eyes geared towards the premier league title
although five points clear , some chinks in mourinho 's side 's armour were bared for the world to see on wednesday
here , sportsmail lays out five things the portuguese manager must do to end the season in style
rediscover the attacking flow anyone watching the limp defensive display against psg would find it hard to remember , but for the first half of the season , chelsea were breathtaking
the creative hub of eden hazard , oscar and fabregas , the fearsome diego costa in full , free - scoring behemoth mode up front , glued together with the tireless nemanja matic and a rock - solid back four
chelsea need to rediscover the attacking form that saw eden hazard as the league 's best creative force diego costa nets chelsea 's third in a demolition at swansea that showcased the side 's attacking brilliance take the departed andre schurrle âs goal at burnley in the season opener , fabregas âs strike at crystal palace , any of the five netted at swansea â¦ it seemed the blues had finally meshed typical mourinho steel with the beautiful attacking craved by roman abramovich
mar 15 - southampton ( h ) mar 22 - hull ( a ) apr 04 - stoke ( h ) apr 12 - qpr ( a ) apr 18 - manchester united ( h ) apr 26 - arsenal ( a ) apr 29 - leicester city ( a ) may 02 - crystal palace ( h ) may 16 - west brom ( a ) may 24 - sunderland ( h ) in recent weeks , however , mourinho has reverted to defensive type â to the side âs downfall against 10 - man psg
with a host of winnable games left among the remaining premier league matches , putting a few teams to the sword in style would do wonders for confidence in the home straight
use the whole squad mourinho has used just 22 players in the league this season â fewer than any other team
the boss would point to being five points clear at the division âs summit as justification , but the stars of the side being tired out leads to displays like wednesday âs
felipe luis and loic remy must have envisaged getting more playing time when moving to stamford bridge in the summer , while juan cuadrado would hope to have made more of an impact in his two months
the likes of oscar and fabregas , in particular , have been noticeably poorer as the season has progressed
use of the whole squad is key at the top level , and something mourinho has mastered at all his previous clubs
if he does nât trust the players below the first xi , expect changes this summer
while he has less games left than he would have liked , mourinho must utilise everyone at his disposal to keep the side fresh in the run - in
loic remy may be wondering why he has had so little game - time since arriving at stamford bridge juan cuadrado has found chances hard to come by since arriving in january from fiorentina give petr cech a proper swansong thibaut courtois can be chelsea âs goalkeeper for the next decade
one of the most highly - rated keepers in europe , his extended loan at atletico madrid prepared him for a long career in london
it would follow that we are in the final moments of petr cech âs sublime stewardship between the posts
however , the distinction between first and second choice has become far more blurred as the season has progressed
thibaut courtois has started to struggle to deal with crosses whipped into the box , leading to goals conceded thibaut courtois , while one of the world âs finest shot - stoppers , has had trouble claiming crosses and showing authority in the box
against psg , he pulled off a terrific stop only to fail to come for the resulting corner
he has time to develop into the role
for now , however , mourinho must reinstall petr cech as undisputed no 1
he has performed in every big game when called upon this season , knows what it takes to win the league , and has the experience required to guide the defence through the last 11 fixtures
petr cech has impressed whenever called into the no 1 role after manning the chelsea gloves for 10 years petr cech ( left ) knows what it takes to win the title at chelsea , here celebrating in 2005 with his team - mates reclaim the midfield â¦ by giving fabregas a rest when fabregas left barcelona in the summer , the catalan club âs official website bemoaned his performances tailing off in the second half of the season
while this may have been a little facetious , his maiden campaign at stamford bridge would appear to prove them correct
the midfielder has been poor since the turn of the year , at least
fabregas , battling marco verratti , has not been firing on all cylinders since christmas particularly in upcoming fixtures against manchester united , liverpool and arsenal , mourinho could do with the frenetic presence of ramires , a repositioned kurt zouma or even the young nathan ake to add more physical and defensive presence in midfield
chelsea âs midfield , with the spaniard at the helm , completely failed to make the extra man count against psg
unless fabregas can prove he is as useful in central midfield against a top side as he is while carving up swansea or schalke , he may lose the manager âs faith when it comes to the crunch
cut out the madness every back page in the country on thursday morning showed chelsea players surrounding the referee before being dumped out of europe
it was nât the first time blues fans woke up to see their team being discussed for the wrong reasons this season
chelsea players surround the referee before zlatan ibrahimovic was sent off during the hot - tempered affair branislav ivanovic , gary cahill and diego costa have all sparked nationwide debates with on - pitch antics , while mourinho âs famed siege mentality has manifested itself in fairly ugly ways as the campaign has progressed
in these remaining 11 matches , chelsea need to do what they do best â win , with minimum fuss
on form they âre the best team in the country by some distance , so they need to remove the histrionics and resume being plastered over the papers for the right reasons
diego costa has been more noticeable for his physical play and histrionics than his goalscoring ability
