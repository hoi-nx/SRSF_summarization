the pair would often stop for a drink at pub on his days off
the night before he died mr paul wilson was waiting for a taxi to take him home with the curry at the pub. mr horsman , who has run the pub for 26 years , said : ' it was a shock to find out someone i was talking to 12 hours before had died
' in 2011 another indian restaurant , the spice lounge in norfolk , had to pay Â£ 6,000 in fines and costs after a diner was rushed to hospital after she suffered a serious allergic reaction to milk in her curry - having already warned it made her ill. last year a landscape gardener with a nut allergy died after eating a curry
derek stephenson was eating his chicken tikka while watching the x factor then he started coughing uncontrollably and his lips turned blue
he told friend stephanie hodgson : 's * * * , i 'm allergic to nuts ' before he collapsed and died
nuts can trigger some of the most severe allergic reactions , although it 's not clear why nut allergy is the most common type of severe food allergy
it it is an umbrella term for an allergy to both peanuts ( which , strictly speaking , are not nuts but legumes , belonging to the same family as peas and beans ) and tree nuts , such as walnuts , hazelnuts , almonds , cashews , pecans , brazils and pistachios
like many other foods , nuts can act as allergens , but for reasons that are n't clear , they cause some of the most severe reactions
in the british , about 1 in 100 people have an allergy to peanuts and about 1 in 200 people have an allergy to tree nuts
the number of people with peanut allergy is growing
people who have other allergic conditions in their family - such as hay fever , asthma and eczema - are more likely to suffer nut allergy
most people with nut allergy react after contact with small amounts ( less than one nut ) and some people may react to trace amounts , the website patient.co.uk reports
this means some people do n't even have to eat an actual nut to have a reaction
a minority of people are so sensitive to nut allergens that a tiny amount on their lips - or even standing next to someone eating peanuts - can trigger a reaction
when someone comes into contact with something they are allergic to ( an allergen ) , a group of cells in the body - mast cells - release a substance called histamine
histamine causes the tiny blood vessels in the tissues of the body to leak fluid , which in turn causes the tissues to swell
this results in a number of different symptoms
signs of a mild allergic reaction include : * tingling mouth and lips * facial swelling and / or a feeling of tightness around the throat * feeling sick , stomach pains * a rash or hives signs of a severe reaction include ( in addition to the above ) : * wheezing or difficulty breathing due to an asthma - like attack , or throat swelling * fast heart rate - or low blood pressure which can cause fainting or collapse * redness of the skin , due to dilation of the blood vessels a severe reaction is known as anaphylaxis
without immediate treatment , victims soon become unconscious
a small number die every year due to this type of severe reaction , typically because they do not receive treatment quickly enough
