the incident was looked at retrospectively using television evidence after both the skrtel flashpoint and the stamp on can were missed by referee michael oliver
skrtel could argue a precedent was set in january when chelsea striker costa escaped punishment for an alleged stamp on him that was reviewed on video after referee michael oliver missed the incident costa was however suspended for this contact with skrtel 's team - mate emre can in the same match ' following a review of an incident during the game involving costa and liverpool 's skrtel , the fa will not be taking any further action , ' a statement from the fa said at the time
however , skrtel 's hopes of succeeding appear slim
costa appealed his charge for the offence against can - with manager mourinho insisting both incidents were ' absolutely accidental ' - but was found guilty and banned for three matches
it led to mourinho claiming there was a ' clear campaign ' against chelsea .
