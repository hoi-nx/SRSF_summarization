the scotland under - 21 international insists , however , that he feels under less pressure at his new club than he did at dundee united
ryan gauld secured a dream Â£ 3million move to sporting lisbon from tannadice last summer after long being tagged with his â mini messi â nickname on these shores amid endless hype about his ability
the portuguese giants have blooded him slowly into their side , giving the 19 - year - old plenty of time to adjust to his new life

â of course there was a bit of pressure on me going to portugal , â he says
â but i was excited at the thought of a new beginning
â there was a lot of focus on me in scotland â a lot of talk about me and what i was going to do
youngster gould ( right ) is currently back in his home country with scotland under 21s â but i wanted to escape that
that âs why i was delighted to sign for sporting lisbon because it was like starting again
that was part of my thinking behind the move
to get away from it all and develop as a player behind the scenes
â people might think the pressure would increase going to a bigger club in a bigger league
but for me it was almost the opposite
i can relax more at sporting lisbon
i was delighted to get out of the limelight that i had at dundee united
when i was there , there was so much talk about stuff i did nât like to read about or hear
â so going over to portugal was the right move for me , in terms of development
i knew i would nât go straight into the first team
it took ryan gauld a while to settle into his new surroundings , but now he feels at home in lisbon â i was always going to have to play for the b team first but that was perfect for me to learn
there was no pressure on me
i could get on with it behind the scenes
â ryan gauld admits it was nât all straightforward and that it took some time to settle into life in lisbon
however , he believes he has finally adapted to both the change of football style and lifestyle and loved making his bow for sporting lisbon , where he was widely praised by coming off the bench and inspiring a 4 - 2 win at home to rio ave. â i âm in a good place right now , definitely , in my football and in my life , â he continues
â i âm at a really good point in my career
i âm playing games every week and i âm enjoying it
i feel more settled in lisbon now than i did six months ago
it was a big move and it was always going to take time to adapt
ryan gauld ( left ) played in an international challenge match for scotland under 21s against hungary this week â if i âm honest , it did take longer than i expected it to
but now i âve been there nine months and i feel totally at home in portugal
â that âs my first year nearly up and it âs flown by
i âve settled well and i âm really happy
the main thing to begin with was adapting to the way the portuguese play because it âs very different to what i was used to
â it took a lot of games for the b team before i felt comfortable with portuguese football and the way they play
but i âve been rewarded by a couple of substitute appearances for the first team , so everything âs going well right now
ryan gauld has long held the nickname ' mini messi ' but he feels out of the spotlight playing for sporting lisbon â the night when i made my debut in the league was brilliant
it was against good opposition in rio ave. â to get around 25 minutes and see the tempo the game was played at was a great experience
i was playing with top players
â the crowd seemed to take to me
a big deal was made when i went over to sign , so the fans were eager to see what i could do
i think they were quite happy to finally see me in action
hopefully i âve not disappointed them

â i âve picked up a fair bit of the language recently , â he adds
â i can now have conversations and stuff off the pitch
i âm maturing as a person over here
living in a different country by myself and not knowing the language has made me grow up
i âve matured a lot
â i had to learn loads of things and do it on my own
it has made me come out of my shell because i was quite shy before i came
ryan gauld ( right ) stretches with under 21 team - mate billy king at st mirren park this week â there are a couple of portuguese phrases that i âve heard the boys saying , so i tried to pick them up
but i ca nât seem to get a grip of them and they âre giving me a hard time about it ! â it âs not swear words , just slang saying like we âd say in scotland : â what âs happening ? â or â what âs up ? â
â it âs just a casual phrase
i think i âm saying it the exact same way as them but they tell me i get it wrong
maybe it âs my scottish accent ! â ryan gauld ( front right ) leads the way as scotland under 21s arrive at glasgow airport on wednesday the focus for ryan gauld now is to get more game time and figure more prominently in manager marco silva âs plans
â between now and the end of the season , my aim has to be to be more involved in the first team , â he says
â i âve had a spell where i was in a lot of squads but now i âm back in the b team
they want to dip me in and out
it âs to make sure i continue to work hard and know what it takes to make the a team
