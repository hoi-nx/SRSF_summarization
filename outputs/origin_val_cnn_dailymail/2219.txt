palace manager alan pardew is promising an exciting summer of recruitment at selhurst park after the club effectively guaranteed their premier league survival with a comeback victory at stoke
palace are now 11 points clear of the drop zone and alan pardew can think about building for next season , buoyed by the new sky sports tv deal and a possible takeover from american businessman josh harris
recruitment is now uppermost in alan pardew âs mind and he revealed : â we are getting calls regarding players from inter milan and benfica because they are our market now
alan pardew 's palace came from behind to beat stoke 2 - 1 at the britannia stadium alan pardew ( left ) congratulates wing wizard yannick bolasie at full - time after palace 's impressive victory wilfried zaha has scored in his last two games against qpr and stoke , the first time he âs netted consecutively since october 2012 in his first spell with palace â palace now come into the same group as everybody below the likes of everton , tottenham and liverpool , and the most important thing is to try to trade well
â it âs important to preserve your premier league status early
if you leave it late , it is very difficult to get players
you do nât want other teams putting packages together and working on players before you can
â we are pretty secure in approaching clubs and players now as a premier league side for next season and that âs what we will do
we have the finance to do what we say we are going to do
so it does give us a slight advantage
â one player who will remain is reborn winger wilfried zaha who scored the winner at the britannia for his first back - to - back goals since 2012
in february , wilfried zaha ( right ) was sad , but according to alan pardew he is now playing with a smile zaha signed for manchester united after palace 's promotion , but his career nosedived at old trafford zaha âs career nosedived after a Â£ 15million move to manchester united went sour and he has gone from being capped by england to not even making the under 21 squad
he was ordered to smile more and sulk less by alan pardew last week and celebrated his goal at stoke by playfully sticking out his tongue
â he looked a sad player when i arrived ( from newcastle in january ) , â said alan pardew
â you are never going to play your best football when you 're sad and sometimes good management is not about tactics but inspiring players
he was down in the dumps for whatever reason
â young players need that exuberance , particularly with the way he plays
and smiling and being happy is part of that exuberance
â nonetheless , 22 - year - old zaha does nât plan on transforming himself into a cartoon clown
â i do smile when i need to ! , â he stressed
palace players celebrate with glenn murray after he scored a penalty to draw palace level stoke manager hughes was distraught with two key decisions by referee marriner â when it is time to be serious , i âm serious
when it is time to play around i will play around
â we âve got the points we âve needed to now so we can play without pressure and enjoy the rest of the season
â there was nât much hilarity from beaten stoke manager hughes who felt his side were robbed by two key decisions from referee marriner after taking a 14th - minute lead from mame diouf
hughes has joined west brom manager tony pulis in saying technology should be brought in immediately to stop the wrong decisions being made
the stoke boss was furious that mr marriner awarded palace a penalty when asmir begovic and yannick bolasie collided and glenn murray levelled from the spot
and after zaha had put palace ahead , the official waved away a strong appeal for handball against palace defender joel ward
hughes believes that palace defender joel ward ( right ) was guilty of handball in the penalty area hughes slammed the standard of refereeing in the premier league this season hughes said : â it was clear to everybody that he has thrown his body , his arms to stop the ball going goalwards
it was a shot on target , he was not close to the ball , he was about five yards away so it was a clear penalty
â i do nât think the standard of refereeing this year has been as good as it needs to be
they need a little bit of help and i âm an advocate of tv replays
â i think it is quite simple
if a big decision is made , he needs to ask the question : is there any reason why i should not give a penalty , or why i should not give a goal
within 10 or 15 seconds they can give the referee an answer and there will be more correct decisions
they need to be given that option because at the moment they need a lot more help
â i think we have reached a tipping point
before there were debates one way or the other but now i think it needs to come in
