the oklahoma sooners football team made their stance against the university 's racist fraternity chant row known on thursday , as they have every day since monday , by declining to take part in a scheduled practice
instead , the team took to the field -- all of them dressed in black -- and stood arm - in - arm in a silent vigil
coach bob stoops said in a statement that letting the world know the team 's stance was more important than their practice
' extremely proud of our guys right now for the way we have handled this issue ! i love this university and i love this team ! # weareone , ' the 21 - year - old posted to twitter
saying they were committed to curing the ' disease ' of racism , oklahoma football players called thursday for the expulsion of fraternity leaders tied to a racist video and vowed to help the mostly white campus end its ' culture of exclusivity
' ' our hope is to shed light on this issue and promote meaningful change at a national level , ' the players said in a statement many released nearly simultaneously on their social media accounts
' but before we can change the nation , we make it our mission to change our campus

the players said they want sae leadership ' expelled , suspended or otherwise disciplined severely
' ' allowing this culture to thrive goes against everything it means to be a sooner , ' said the players , who vowed to raise awareness of racism and show ' we are defined by more than the numbers on our jerseys and that we are human beings that desire to get to know our classmates
' the situation already has hurt the football program , usually a national power
north mesquite ( texas ) high school football star jean delance , a top offensive lineman prospect who had verbally committed to oklahoma , said he would not attend the school because of the video

jon - terry , a tight end from victory christian in tulsa , oklahoma , and hardy , a quarterback from dekaney high in houston , have not changed their plans
boren 's strong response played a role in keeping hardy 's mother , umeki davis , from becoming concerned
' as long as they ( those leading the chant ) were escorted off , and they have nothing to do with oklahoma , and oklahoma stood up for their kids - i 'm ok with that , ' davis , said
' it would have been different if oklahoma would n't have stood up for what was right
what was right to me was when they stood up and those students were removed from the school
i 'm fine with that
' victory christian football coach brent marley said he discussed the situation with terry , and nothing changed
# weareone : oklahoma sooners quarterback trevor knight tweeted this week , ' extremely proud of our guys right now for the way we have handled this issue ! i love this university and i love this team ! # weareone ' oklahoma 's former players said the incident was not an overall reflection of the campus
' i just believe that does n't represent the school , ' former defensive end chuka ndulue said during his pro day workout this week
' no matter where you go , it 's just - stuff like that happens
it 's just because we 're in this day and age where social media runs everything where they happened to catch the guys on camera
it does n't reflect the student body
that 's not the image of the oklahoma
' former oklahoma offensive lineman adam shead said he was glad to see things that normally get swept under the rug out in the open
he said he was encouraged when the team marched on monday
' i was proud , ' he said
' i was happy to see coach stoops right there in the front , leading the pack , and all the rest of the coaches right there behind him
i 'm proud to have been a part of the program that thinks like that and does things like that , who believes in doing the right thing because it 's the right thing to do
