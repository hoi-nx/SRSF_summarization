former pm brown warned that leaving the eu would turn britain into europe 's north korea britain would turn into the european if it left the eu , brown has claimed
in a bizarre warning ahead of a speech to the commons tomorrow , the former prime minister said the britain would be ' left out in the cold with few friends [ and ] no influence ' like the regime in pyongyang
he rejects claims that britain could succeed on its own by becoming an open , trading nation like switzerland or hong kong
but the warning that britain would fall into north korea isolationism is likely to spark ridicule
a report commissioned by johnson last year said leaving the eu was ' definitely a viable option ' for the britain
mr johnson 's chief economic adviser gerard lyons said the best option was to stay in a reformed eu â but if that could n't be achieved exit was better for the economy than the status quo
but in a startling intervention ahead of tomorrow 's commons debate on the eu , mr brown said : ' we must tell the truth about the 3 million jobs , 25,000 companies , Â£ 200billion of annual exports and the Â£ 450billion of inward investment linked to europe
' he said leaving the eu but staying in a free - trade area could leave us ' subject to eu rules , but denied a vote in shaping them '
the former labour leader , who is stepping down as an mp in may , also dismissed the ' hong kong option â leaving europe to join the world
he said this was ' really the north korea option â out in the cold with few friends , no influence , little new trade and even less new investment '
in a bizarre warning ahead of a speech to the commons tomorrow , former prime minister brown said the britain would be ' left out in the cold with few friends [ and ] no influence ' like north korea under kim jong-un mr brown , writing in the guardian , said britain should not contemplate exit when it was on course to overtake germany as the eu 's largest economy
he said : ' it would be sheer defeatism to cast ourselves , as sceptics do , as helpless victim , impotent bystanders unable to influence events
' our destiny is not a bit player on someone else 's stage , or a spectator hectoring from the wings , but always setting the agenda , bringing people together , and championing change
' he added : ' being half - in half - out , a britain that is semi-detached and disengaged â the britain of the empty chair even when we are in the room â has made us weaker than ever : irrelevant on greece , fringe player on climate change , mere spectator in the debate that could have shaped a european pro-growth policy , marginal on ukraine , with ministers sounding ludicrous as simultaneously they say : ' russia must be confronted with a more united europe ' , and : ' by the way , we are thinking of leaving
