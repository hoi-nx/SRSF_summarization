a kim jong-il production by paul fischer were it not for the fact that north korea is despicably tragic , it would be comical in the extreme
as a nation , it is so hermetically sealed â the regime lets â few foreigners in and virtually no information out â â that the population has never heard of jesus , santa or elvis
they fully believe their dear leader , kim jong-il , who died in 2011 , was descended from an egg impregnated by the sun and that when he went into battle , he rode on a unicorn
at the grand age of eight weeks , kim jong-il was walking , talking and dispensing sage military advice
he could control the weather and catch rainbows with his bare hands
the north korea believe that their kim jong-il , kim jong-il , who died in 2011 , was descended from an egg impregnated by the sun such was ( and is ) the potency of north korea âs messianic cult , however , that dare to laugh at such claims and a prison camp â or â custody management centre â or â enlightenment centre â â awaits
paul fischer , in this gripping tale , tells us that a typical penal colony near pyongyang , the capital city , is bigger than the entire surface area of los angeles , with 220,000 inmates
criminals include painters or poets whose work is â too western â
the ministry for the protection of state security rounds up people who have used more than the allocated quota of electricity , or have been accused of wearing blue jeans , growing their hair too long , reading a foreign newspaper or cracking jokes about kim jong-il âs appearance ( kim jong-il âs son , the latest dictator , kim jong-un , is another squat little monster , â prone to bursts of anger and bad temper â )
there are no trials â simply the whim of the current kim jong-il
one person âs guilt implicates an entire family
â children are executed in front of their mothers , wives in front of their husbands
â children who informed on their parents were commended for their patriotism
husbands suspected of a political crime would beg to be able to shoot their own wives as a sign of loyalty
in this evil hell - hole in kim jong-il âs time , â chatter , laughter and singing were forbidden â
if kim jong-il himself had one weakness , however , it was for the movies
though he had personal control over huge armies and a nuclear arsenal , kim jong-il âs mind was filled less with totalitarian ideology than with â james bond and rambo
his favourite stars were sean connery and elizabeth taylor â
it must be a mightily strange person who can confuse elizabeth taylor with sylvester stallone
nevertheless , kim jong-il set up the central film distribution centre , which obtained prints from abroad and secretly dubbed them into north korea using professional actors
fischer says kramer vs. kramer and mary poppins were in the pyongyang vaults â though only kim jong-il was permitted to screen such incendiary foreign fare
it was kim jong-il âs dream to establish â a world - class film industry â but , unfortunately , local productions were boring in the extreme â â tedious stories of selfless factory workers and exemplary farm girls â
the north korea leader ( left ) had a weakness for films despite the strict regulations he imposed on his country , he wished to establish a ' world - class film industry ' the studios had access only to a limited stock of â ill - fitting uniforms , wigs and detachable facial hair â
the sets consisted of a tyrolean chalet and a fake vineyard
not only that , but actors and actresses often disappeared mid-scene
if they were â declared guilty of some obscure offence â , their performances would literally be chopped from the celluloid , â rendering the film unintelligible â when shown
nor was kissing or a love scene ever depicted â emotion had to be reserved for the kim jong-il
it was a rule that north korea was always to be shown in rich sunshine
scenes set abroad had to be uninvitingly dark and rain - swept
in the wider world , spielberg , scorsese and george lucas were emerging so , in 1978 , kim jong-il had the idea to abduct a director and star from south korean , whose â knowledge and manpower â would stimulate his own cinematic ambitions
shin and his wife , choi , who âd produced â melodramas , thrillers , historical epics and martial arts films full of frantic zooms and moving cameras â , were snatched from hong kong harbour , drugged and bundled into a speedboat by the north korea â covert operations department
â they were kept apart and for five years were held in solitary confinement or put under strict house arrest
kim jong-il abducted a south korean filmmaker shin and his wife , choi in 9178 in a bid to bring a thriving film industry to north korea choi was made to memorise passages from hagiographies of kim jong-il and his equally demented father kim il-sung
â you must bear some pain for the good of the revolution , â she was told
at gunpoint , she underwent â daily compulsory ideology training sessions â
no debate or voicing of doubt was allowed
shin , having made a feeble attempt to escape , was flung into a prison cell , where he had to sit immobile in the same cross-legged position , staring straight ahead , for 16 hours a day
if he swayed or blinked , he had to thrust his hands through the bars , so that his fingers could be â smashed violently with the guard âs baton â
other prisoners had their fingers and ears melted away by the sheer intensity and duration of electric shocks
no prisoner could sit or lie down , in any event , because the cramped cells were covered with spikes
eventually , in 1983 , when it was believed that shin and choi had been thoroughly indoctrinated , they were introduced to kim jong-il in person â all 5 ft 2 in of him , in platform shoes and bouffant hair
the kim jong-il invited his â guests â to attend regular feasts and drunken orgies thrown for elite members of the workers â party central committee and the propaganda and agitation department
though the remainder of the country was starving and poverty stricken â subsisting on frogs and mice â kim jong-il indulged himself with imported exotic foodstuffs
kim jong-il ( left ) is seen her with his son , kim jong-un ( right ) who is now the north korea leader since his father 's death he collected motorcycles and mercedes limousines , built luxurious villas , travelled on private trains and drank expensive cognac â the annual budget for hennessy vsop was $ 700,000
he paid for all of this with the loans given to the country by moscow and beijing , the proceeds of organised crime and bogus insurance claims made against allianz global and lloyd âs of london
yet if ever a whisper of this excess or embezzlement got out , executions followed
assuring kim jong-il that â i will take part in the revolution â , shin agreed to make a propaganda film
here , he believed , was a way of escape
he encouraged kim to permit a location shoot abroad in budapest and vienna
they had built up sufficient trust to be allowed to travel
though surrounded by armed guards , shin and choi made a dash for it in austria and hid in the american embassy
they were flown to virginia
in time , shin made ninja films for the disney channel and was a juror at cannes with clint eastwood
he died of liver disease in 2006
choi moved back to seoul , south korean , where she continues to live in obscurity , her history disbelieved by her neighbours who regard her as a defector , not a former abductee
it does all sound almost too far - fetched and , well , cinematic to be true , but fischer assures us he has checked and double - checked the available facts
the book is a nightmarish , clammy adventure story , an absolutely brilliant page - turner .
