in a sport increasingly dominated by statistical analysis and calm dissection of performances it was reassuring to hear dan cole discuss the depth of anger felt by england âs players on reviewing their ireland no - show
dan cole , one of the few england stars to depart dublin with his reputation enhanced last sunday , revealed the extent of the frustration within the england squad at their misfiring display when their grand slam dream was broken by a series of tactical and technical blunders
stuart lancaster âs men held a debrief on tuesday at their five - star pennyhill park retreat in surrey and the video analysis made for uncomfortable viewing
dan cole has revealed the frustration felt by england 's squad as they relived the ireland defeat chief among their concerns was the spectacular first - half line - out fail which saw england hooker hartley throw straight to 6ft 10in ireland lock toner at the back when a clean catch and drive would have almost certainly yielded points
england âs repeated disciplinary infringements also led to a 13 to eight penalty deficit and dan cole admits watching the match again was deeply frustrating
â there is room for emotion because you are frustrated with the game and there were a few things we âve gone over , â he said
â we did nât plan to do a lot of the stuff that we did
trust me we did nât train what we did at the weekend
we did nât do that on the training field
â there is that frustration and it comes out in anger or whatever from coaches and players because they are frustrated in that regard
it is not just a cool , calm dissection â sometimes it is but if a point needs to be raised it is talked about
england failed to take their chances and made some basic errors , before being punished by the irish â it was interesting , it was good , it was honest
i think there were some areas â a lot of areas obviously â where we did nât perform like we should have done
â ireland outmanoeuvred england by denying them scrummaging opportunities and by failing to implement the expected â choke tackle â , therefore denying the visitors the chance to play to their strengths
their british lion half - back pair of johnny sexton and conor murray controlled field position with some outstanding tactical kicking
when england did have a chance to gain a foothold in the game , hartley âs wayward throw to toner cost them dear after george ford opted to kick a kickable penalty to the corner
dan cole was one of the few englishmen to come out of the defeat in dublin with any credit â that line - out was a frustration
in international rugby if you get a set piece in the opposition 22 and especially 5m out you have to take it , â dan cole added
â you do nât really get another chance like that against sides like ireland , and we did nât really get one
i âm not saying that the game changed on that but it was an emotional swing
' they steal the ball and the crowd lifts up
you score there and it is a different mentality
it was nât the reason we lost the game but next time we âll probably throw away from the 6ft 10 bloke with long arms ! â the england prop will hope his side can bounce back against scotland at twickenham next week while south african referee craig joubert took exception to much of england âs work at the break down , lancaster and his team hope frenchman romain poite will be more forgiving at twickenham against unfancied scotland next saturday
dan cole added : â referees have their strengths and weaknesses , just like players do
set - piece , open play , some refs will let you play stuff , others wo nât
there is a variance but it is a case of being as clean as you can
if you are positive in your actions , you will be on the right side of the referee
