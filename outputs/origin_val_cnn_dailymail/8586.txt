udhai ri 's selfie , accompanied by the ' feeling sad ' emoji , clearly shows his uncle 's corpse in the background a man has caused a storm on social media after posting a selfie of himself with his uncle 's corpse during a funeral
udhai ri , 34 , from jaffna town in sri lankan , stunned friends and family when he snapped himself standing in front of his dead uncle lying on a funeral bed
the photo was then posted onto his facebook and twitter accounts
accompanying it , using the tamil translation for uncle , were the words : ' my peiriya appa passed away
' this was followed by a ' sad face ' emoji and the words ' feeling sad '
but he was soon turned on by shocked online users
facebook user dinesh devi posted : ' oh , man ! really ? this is disgusting
' som gamage wrote : ' what is this ? a deady ? could you sink any lower ? ' nalin kodikara added : ' i 've never seen anything as disgustingly poor taste as this
' mr udhai ri soon took the photo down but not before it had begun doing the rounds on social media
a friend of mr udhai ri 's said : ' he was very upset and wanted to express that and share his grief and final moments with his uncle with his friends
' being upset he was n't thinking clearly though , as this was obviously a bad idea , to say the least
' he apologises for any offence he has caused
' although there 's no doubt the selfie has become a bona fide cultural phenomenon , popularized perhaps most famously by kim kardashian , there remain some limits to its acceptability
among the people to have gained notoriety are a man who took a photo of himself in front of his dead grandmother 's casket , those smiling cheerily at the scene of the sydney siege in december and people taking pictures of themselves before sometimes fatal accidents
