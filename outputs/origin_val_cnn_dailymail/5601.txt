saffery , from hereford , herefordshire , has now been convicted of six counts of indecent assault and two counts of sex with a girl under the age of 13 following a trial
he was jailed for 12 years for the historical sex offences , which took place in the 1970s and 1980s while the girl was aged between 12 and 15 , and shouted ' it 's all lies ' as he was taken to the cells following sentencing yesterday
the ' dangerous ' sexual predator , who served as an officer for more than 30 years , was also convicted of two allegations of having child pornography images on his computer in 2013
he was cleared of two further charges of raping a second girl aged under 16 in 1986
during sentencing , judge robert juckes qc said saffery had helped the girl to become ' infatuated ' with him and groomed her so he could ' help himself to her ' whenever the opportunity arose
he added : ' your job was to protect members of the community , not to abuse them
' the court heard saffery groomed and repeatedly assaulted the victim while he was in his 20s and a serving police officer
in a police video played to the jury , the victim said saffery would take ' every chance ' to engage in sexual activity with her
she said : ' he would say nice things
he would tell me i was lovely and beautiful
' a little girl would be flattered by that
' i had a teenage crush on him
i was infatuated by him
' the jury were told they first had sex when she was 12 - years - old and it stopped when she was 15 - years - old with her realisation that the ' relationship ' was wrong

detective inspector richard rees , from west mercia police , said after the case : ' outwardly , saffery was a respected police officer and an upstanding member of the community
' however , behind closed doors he was a dangerous sexual predator who took advantage of a young girl
' today his past has caught up with him
