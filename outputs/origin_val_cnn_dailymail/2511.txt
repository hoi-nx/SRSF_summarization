four - time champion vettel enters the new formula one season in the unusual position of being the outsider
this time , the ferrari driver is doing the chasing - behind the mercedes pair of lewis hamilton and rosberg
vettel used to be the man to beat , winning the title four years in a row with red bull
but mercedes ended that dominance in crushing style last year and vettel - who seemed isolated and despondent throughout the season - made the switch to ferrari
' the change felt right for me and it gives me a lot of joy , ' vettel said
' my ambition is to be right there at the top again , not only for me but also in terms of the team
in this respect , we should make a perfect fit
' vettel enters the new formula one season in the unusual position of being the outsider the ferrari driver is doing the chasing behind the mercedes pair of lewis hamilton and rosberg the german also gets the chance to emulate his childhood idol , seven - time champion michael schumacher , who won the vast majority of his titles and his 91 gps with ferrari
the 27 - year - old vettel , who has 39 gp wins and 45 pole positions , clearly needed to get away from red bull
vettel finished a dismal fifth in the drivers ' standings , with no wins and just four podium places
the gap between him and lewis hamilton was a mammoth 217 points
worse still , he was usurped by his junior team - mate , daniel ricciardo , who finished third and won three races
the timing seemed just right for ferrari , too , which needed a change following two seasons of tensions with fernando alonso
pre-season testing has been like a fresh start
vettel takes part in pre-season testing at circuit de barcelona catalunya in his new car last month vettel joined ferrari in the off - season after many successful years at red bull vettel drives behind mercedes driver rosberg during testing in catalonia earlier this month ' i feel very well
the tests so far have contributed a lot to that feeling , ' vettel said
' of course things take time , as growing into a team that works a bit differently requires that
' the positive tone was set at the first testing session in jerez , with vettel and teammate kimi raikkonen claiming the fastest time on three of the four test days as ferrari announced its comeback in style
overall , a reinvigorated vettel completed more than 600 laps over the three winter testing sessions and ferrari showed glimpses that it can challenge mercedes for speed
over the 12 days of testing , ferrari completed 1,182 laps - the fourth most mileage of any team - and the second most by power unit behind mercedes
' the path to the very top right now still leads via mercedes and it is our aim not only to draw level with them but to surpass them , ' vettel said
' that is a very ambitious goal
