the golden boot is one of the most sought - after individual prizes in the game - and this season âs competition is delicately poised for the final run - in
the three main contenders - chelsea âs diego costa on 19 , tottenham hotspur âs harry kane on 19 and manchester city âs sergio aguero on 17 - are all in with a chance of winning it
will it go down to form ? will it be rocked by injury and suspension ? will it have the fairytale conclusion that so many would love to see ? sportsmail takes a look at the runners and riders in the race for the golden boot ... the race for the golden boot seems to be between harry kane ( left ) , diego costa ( centre ) and sergio aguero left foot : 5 right foot : 10 head : 4 minutes per goal : 98.26 harry kane , tottenham hotspur can harry kane âs whirlwind season continue right until the end or will it run out of air ? his hat - trick against leicester city in tottenham hotspur âs last league match just goes to show how quickly the goalscorers chart can change as he leapt to catch diego costa within the space of 90 minutes
ultimately , any englishman and most neutrals would want to see harry kane top at the end of the campaign , regardless of which team they support , given his story
harry kane âs main downfall will be his lack of experience
hopefully his youthful exuberance will not fade into nervous tension
diego costa , 26 , and sergio aguero , 26 , are seasoned experts compared to the 21 - year - old , more aware of what is required to find the back of the net after a long campaign when the thighs ache and the quads burn
tottenham hotspur 's harry kane was 500/1 to be the golden boot 's top goalscorer at the start of the season burnley ( a ) ( scored 1 goal against ) aston villa ( h ) 1 united ( a ) 1 southampton ( a ) manchester city ( h ) stoke ( a ) hull city ( a ) 1 everton ( a ) record against remaining teams : scored against 4/8 ( four goals total ) this zonal map shows where harry kane scored his 19 goals this season for tottenham hotspur in the golden boot this pitch view map shows where harry kane scored his goals from around the 18 - yard box for tottenham hotspur left foot : 5 right foot : 11 head : 3 minutes per goal : 102.42 diego costa , chelsea the snarling , street - fighting chelsea striker is joint - top of the goalscorers chart , but has played fewer games to reach his total goals tally and has one more to play than his two main rivals
forget kane and sergio aguero , however , diego costa âs main adversary is himself
his aggressive style of play means he is the most likely of the three to pick up a suspension
he is already on eight domestic yellow cards for the season and was retrospectively banned for three matches for a stamp on liverpool âs emre can
chelsea also have a tougher run - in than tottenham hotspur and manchester city
they still have to face manchester united and liverpool at home and arsenal away
having said that , diego costa has already scored against arsenal and liverpool this season and is yet to face united who have had an unstable defence
chelsea striker diego costa is among the best signings of the season and has 19 goals in the golden boot stoke ( h ) qpr ( a ) manchester united ( h ) arsenal ( a ) ( scored 1 goal against ) leicester city ( a ) 1 crystal palace ( h ) liverpool ( h ) 1 west bromwich albion ( a ) 1 sunderland ( h ) record against remaining teams : scored against 4/9 ( four goals total ) this zonal map shows where diego costa scored his 19 goals this season for chelsea in the golden boot this pitch view map shows where diego costa scored his goals from around the 18 - yard box for chelsea left foot : 4 right foot : 13 head : 0 minutes per goal : 107.53 sergio aguero , manchester city he is the rank - outsider , but one who you would bet against at your peril
sergio aguero is trailing the other two by two goals , but he has scored four in one game this season , against tottenham hotspur who he will face again in manchester city âs remaining eight games
of the three strikers , sergio aguero is by far the best finisher who can conjure a goal , or two , from nowhere in a game
he has already scored eight times against the last eight teams manchester city have to face - the same amount as diego costa and harry kane âs record put together in their last fixtures of the season
injury will be sergio aguero âs main concern
the knee injury he suffered in december cost him a month out and he has failed to consistently string together games since he moved there four years ago
manchester city striker sergio aguero has 17 goals and is just two behind the leading golden boot goalscorers crystal palace ( a ) manchester united ( a ) ( scored 1 goal against ) west ham ( h ) aston villa ( h ) 1 tottenham hotspur ( a ) 4 qpr ( h ) 2 swansea city ( a ) southampton ( h ) record against remaining teams : scored against 4/8 ( eight goals total ) this zonal map shows where sergio aguero scored his 19 goals this season for manchester city in the golden boot this pitch view map shows where sergio aguero scored his goals from around the 18 - yard box for manchester city my golden boot guestimate â¦ this is , obviously , no exact science
you can analyse all the statistics , numbers and records in the world and the enigma of chance will always rear its head
for example , diego costa has scored more of his goals , eight , against teams currently sitting from sixth to 10th , but only plays one of those , stoke
harry kane has netted eight of his strikes against teams now in the bottom five , and has two of those , aston villa and burnley , remaining
conversely , sergio aguero has a more even spread against teams throughout the table
and sergio aguero has a far better early - season record against manchester city âs last teams than the other two
but then sergio aguero has not scored in five games , diego costa has two in last two and harry kane six in his last four
my heart says harry kane , but my head goes with diego costa , so i choose the chelsea man
