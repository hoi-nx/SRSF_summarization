snooker champion stephen hendry has won a five - year battle with his neighbours to build 11 luxury homes in his back garden snooker champion stephen hendry has won a five - year battle with his neighbours to build 11 luxury homes in the back garden of his mansion â just a stone 's throw from gleneagles
the seven - times world champion , 46 , is set to build a multi-million pound housing development on land currently used as a horse paddock and stables on his perthshire country estate
he and neighbour alexander birnie teamed up to apply for permission to build 11 new homes less than two miles from the world - famous course at gleneagles
but the move upset residents in the upmarket village who voiced fears that it will invade their privacy and spoil the natural beauty of the area
the auchterarder development was originally given the go - ahead in 2012 but construction never started because of the decline in the housing market
renewed plans were submitted to perth and kinross council last month by mr alexander birnie 's company craigmount developments and they have now been given the green light
drawings submitted in 2011 for a planned house on mr stephen hendry 's land show a large four - bedroom property
the proposed house has a massive snooker room at the rear as well as a studio , a tv room , a drawing room and a built - in garage
mr stephen hendry left the family home last year after splitting from his wife mandy , but he still owns the land
the couple moved into the turreted five - bedroom mansion in 1996 after paying Â£ 300,000 and they carried out extensive renovations
they rented the house out for rumoured five - figure sum during the golf tournament
council planners approved the application after finding it complied with the local development plan and that there were no ' material considerations ' to justify refusal
the snooker player and his neighbour alexander birnie teamed up to apply for permission to build 11 new homes less than two miles from the world - famous course at gleneagles , pictured are planned new homes in an objection letter sent to the council , neighbour colin campbell said : ' you have requested comments from property owners bordering this development
what is the point ? ' your department has already rubber - stamped every housing development plan for auchterarder in recent years
' bett homes , cala , robertson homes , muir homes , milne homes etc together will build in excess of 1,000 new homes
' when occupied this will double the population of auchterarder with little or no consideration given by you to the impact of schooling , town parking , medical facilities or shopping facilities
' this application is yet another example of a developer squeezing many properties onto a small plot
' another neighbour said : ' i am concerned about the loss of privacy this would cause and because it spoils the status quo
' the area is absolutely beautiful in terms of the visibility i have right up to the grampians and we thought we were very lucky to find this house
' i 'm not surprised our concerns have been ignored
i do n't have much faith in the system
