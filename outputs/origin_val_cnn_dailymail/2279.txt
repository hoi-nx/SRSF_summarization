many of us pass urine without thinking â or looking â at the colour of it
but perhaps it âs time to take note , because our pee can say a lot about our health , according to one doctor
speaking on itv âs this morning , dr chris steele explained what each shade of pee â from clear to red to green and blue â tells us about the body
he lined up test tubes of a range of colours of urine , from clear through to dark yellow , to red and blue
his first piece of advice is to look at the colour of urine while peeing , rather than when it has hit the toilet bowl
however , it could be due to blood in the urine , signalling an infection , or tumours or kidney stones he told presenters phillip schofield and amanda holden : ' you should look at the colour in the stream that you âre passing , not when it âs in the toilet bowl , because it gets diluted in two litres of water
â when asked if this would be a bit difficult for women , he replied : â you can even catch it if you âre worried
â and when thinking about the colour of our pee , it 's important to remember how food , drink and medication could be affecting it , he added
he said : â laxatives can cause a darkening colour of the urine
always think about what you âre putting in your mouth , could that be affecting things ? â an example of this is asparagus and food colourants that can turn the urine blue or green
meanwhile , urine that is frothy and foamy could be a warning sign someone is eating too much protein and needs to cut back , he said
â it could be due to protein
maybe you âre on a high protein diet
or it could be due to infection
' next , he explained what each shade of pee means , in terms of health
clear urine could be a sign of a â good hydrated person â , dr chris steele said
however , it could be because they are taking diuretic medicine which is making them pass water frequently
the diagram , created by the cleveland clinic , ohio , shows that urine should be straw coloured or pale yellow
if it is darker , it suggests the person is dehydrated he added : â they might be drinking diuretic - type drinks , such as coffee and alcohol
they can cause this effect
â he explained that the kidneys have two main functions : the first being to filter out toxins , create waste matter , and get it out of the body
the second is to balance fluid in the body ; the fluid gained from drinks and metabolic reactions in the body , and the fluids lost through sweat
a deep yellow coloured urine means the person is more dehydrated
he said : â in the morning you might notice your urine is darker coloured than in the evening
' this is because in the night you âve just been laying there doing nothing and your kidneys have been working concentrating the toxic effects
if a person 's urine is brown , it could be a sign of liver disease
if it is red , it could contain blood orange urine is normally a sign of dehydration , but could be a liver or bile duct disorder
blue or green urine is normally due to food dye or medication â deep yellow urine could be a sign of liver problems which cause jaundice of the skin , eyes , and the urine to become more yellow
â but the most important colour to look out for is a pink or light red colour
if a person has red - coloured urine , it could be because they ate certain foods the night before
dr chris steele said : â beetroot , blackberries , blackcurrants even rhubarb [ are all common culprits ]
food colourants are powerful and can get through the kidneys
â however , it could be a more serious sign of infection from the kidney travelling down through the bladder and urethra
it could also be due to a tumour , or kidney stones
â but the commonest reasons for red urine is cystitis - or urinary tract infections , â dr chris steele said
â this causes excess blood to come out into the urine
â a person with dark red urine is deeply dehydrated , he warned
â we âre talking about patients with liver disease , ' he explained
foaming or fizzing urine is usually a sign of too much protein in the diet , or a kidney problem
