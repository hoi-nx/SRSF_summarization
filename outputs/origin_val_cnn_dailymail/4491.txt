liverpool defender toure admits he has a difficult decision to make about his future
the ivory coast international 's current deal expires this summer and while there have been talks over extending his stay , nothing has yet materialised
toure , 34 later this month , remains hopeful an offer will be forthcoming but even if it is he has a tough choice to make as to whether to stay on in the knowledge he will only be a squad player or to make the most of his remaining time in the game by looking for regular football elsewhere
defender toure ( left ) is hoping a new contract offer to stay at liverpool will be forthcoming toure ( right ) hit the post with a header in the second half as liverpool drew 0 - 0 with blackburn on sunday toure predicts that emre can will go on and become a ' king ' at anfield after his impressive displays ' we are still talking to the club
we will see in a few days
the club have to think and i have to think , ' he said
' it is a big decision and that is why i need to think very hard and take a decision and stick with it
' it is very important to know what you are facing
i need to do the right thing for me and my family
' whether toure ultimately stays on as a player at liverpool or not he has predicted a brilliant future for his successor emre can , who he believes will become a ' king ' at anfield last week manager brendan rodgers claimed the german under - 21 international will develop into a world - class asset for the club and now toure has echoed those sentiments
can endured a difficult adaptation period following his Â£ 10million summer move from bayer leverkusen and a lengthy injury lay - of contributed to him featuring in just nine matches - most as substitute - up until christmas
however , somewhat fortuitously he found himself thrown on as a third centre - back at burnley on boxing day and has never looked back , starting every match since and often moving into midfield - his preferred position - to provide cover
his performances have led to some suggesting he has all the credentials to one day captain the side and toure has no doubts about the 21 - year - old 's quality
' he is a top player
he has been playing outstandingly at the back and in midfield he is a very strong player , ' said the african nations cup winner
' we like him here
he is from german and german players are good
they learn football and they are really intelligent , tactically outstanding and are really strong
can has also received strong praise from his liverpool manager , brendan rodgers ( centre ) toure believes that his team - mate can ( right ) has eladership qualities that could see him become captain ' i am not surprised how he has been doing because he has been working hard at training and he is a top professional
' he is young but really good
when you are on the pitch you can see by the way he plays he is really confident and he talks on the pitch as well
' right now jordan henderson is very good ( as captain ) but there is no doubt this boy is going to be a king here because he is a top player and can make a difference on games
' he can score goals , his work - rate is amazing and there is no better player
