it seemed like a major coup for ed miliband
freeman , one of britain âs most bankable hollywood stars , was last night unveiled as the first big celebrity backer of labour âs 2015 general election campaign
the millionaire actor , who has enjoyed a dizzying rise to international superstardom with the hobbit trilogy , was the focus of a glossy three - minute film in which he insisted mr ed miliband âs party would â make sure the economy works for all of us , not just the privileged few â
millionaire actor freeman ( pictured ) is the focus of a glossy three - minute film in which he insists mr ed miliband âs party would â make sure the economy works for all of us , not just the privileged few â but last night , the labour leader faced embarrassment after it emerged that freeman is a former supporter of scargill âs far - left socialist party which openly refused to vote labour at the 2005 general election
freeman himself also faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported that he sends his son to a Â£ 12,000 - a - year private school
not only that , but his long term partner once declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid Â£ 120,000 tax bill â despite freeman having an estimated fortune of Â£ 10million
in last night âs three - minute broadcast , freeman , who found fame in the satirical britain sitcom the office , said : â i do nât know about you , but my values are about community , compassion , decency ; that âs how i was brought up
â freeman with his partner abbington ( pictured ) who declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid Â£ 120,000 tax bill , despite living with freeman , who is worth more than Â£ 10million in an address straight to the camera , the 43 - year - old , who also stars in sherlock , claimed the tory would take the country on a â rollercoaster of cuts â while labour would â make sure the economy works for all of us , not just the privileged few , like me â
the actor also insisted the tory â do nât believe in the nhs â and added : â for me , there âs only one choice â and i choose labour
â at first glance , it appeared to represent a much needed boost for mr ed miliband as freeman is a good deal more famous than some of labour âs other celebrity backers â such as baldrick actor tony robinson
but last night it emerged that mr freeman spent years supporting a far - left socialist labour party that was set up by the militant miners â union boss scargill in protest at labour
in an interview with the guardian ahead of the 2005 election , freeman declared that he voted for the party in 2001 and would not back tony blair
asked how he would vote that year , he replied : â not labour â
the socialist labour party , which is now almost defunct , campaigns for the â abolition of capitalism â and the nationalisation of virtually every industry
freeman faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported he sends his son to a private school the conservatives said freeman âs decision to switch his support to labour showed how far mr ed miliband had dragged the party to the left
tory mp nigel adams said : â even bilbo baggins has recognised how far labour has lurched to the left , imagine the chaos ed miliband would cause across britain and the shire
â labour was also facing potential embarrassment over revelations about freeman âs personal life
despite his socialist outlook , freeman is reported to send his son to a school which charges up to Â£ 12,669 a year
a spokesman for the actor was asked to comment , but did not respond
it was a major coup for labour leader ed miliband ( pictured ) but he faces embarrassment after it emerged freeman is a former scargill supporter the star also hit the headlines two years ago after it emerged his long - term partner abbington had declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid Â£ 120,000 tax bill , despite living with freeman , who is worth more than Â£ 10million
miss abbington , who also appears in sherlock , had been with freeman for 11 years at the time
the couple have two children
the revelations sparked an outpouring of bad publicity for the couple , prompting miss abbington to settle her debts
she told the radio times later in 2013 : â it âs fine , it âs being sorted out
it was a big mistake and i âm sorting it out right now
â it âs being paid off now
i would never want to go through this again
but i âm paying it off
â freeman âs decision to back labour appeared to win the enthusiastic backing of miss abbington , who posted a message on twitter saying : â f * * * the tory
â labour said the party election broadcast had received â unprecedented â interest on the internet , with hundreds of thousands of people choosing to watch
the actor appears in front of a plain white background and , despite encouraging voters to put labour in power , makes no mention of mr ed miliband or the prospect of him becoming the next prime minister
instead , he focuses on contrasting labour âs â values â with those of the tory , who he claims â have got sod all to offer the young â
tory mp nigel adams said : â labour is trying to whitewash ed miliband from their campaign â his mps do nât want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast does nât even mention him
