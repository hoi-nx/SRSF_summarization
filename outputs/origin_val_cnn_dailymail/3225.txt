barkley believes he needs to wise up to recapture his edge after admitting he has fallen below the standards of his dazzling debut season
the everton midfielder lit up roberto martinez âs first campaign in charge and was instrumental in helping his side reclaim a place in europe ; his form was so good that he broke into england âs squad and went to the world cup in brazil
this time around , though , things have not been so straightforward
barkley began the campaign by damaging his medial ligaments and he has struggled to recapture his swagger , playing in unfamiliar roles out on the wing
barkley scored everton 's third goal against newcastle united during their 3 - 0 win on sunday barkley began the campaign by damaging his medial ligaments and has struggled for form but barkley looked sharper after he came on as a substitute in sunday âs 3 - 0 win over newcastle united and he restored some confidence by scoring the final goal
he maintains the education has been beneficial and is determined to have a string finish to the campaign , starting in kiev on thursday
â it has been a tough season for me , â said barkley
â i âm still learning and i am still a young lad
every game is different and because last year was my first full season in the barclays premier league and then maybe no one really knew about me
â maybe this season they know part of my game and it is up to me to learn and adapt
if people think they know what i am going to do , i have to come up with something different and have other options
â our season has nât been the best and everyone else is still learning , but hopefully this season will be a good experience for me
i know i have nât been at my best but the gaffer will give us confidence in training saying he knows what we are capable of
â all the backroom staff and the more vocal lads in the team like gareth barry , sylvain distin , jags , bainesy , tim howard â all the older lads in the team , the most experienced ones , they help us because they have all been through similar experiences
listening to what they say helps

â i am always going to try and want the ball , â said barkley
â that is the way i have been brought up through the academy
even if i make a mistake , i will keep wanting the ball because i know eventually things will click together and i will create chances and the goals will come
â i feel like this can be a turning point for me and the team
all the lads were buzzing , we got three points and you could see the crowd were happy as well
everyone is getting on with each other and we are looking forward to the games coming up , gathering some points and climbing up the table
â before everton âs next barclays premier league assignment against queens park rangers , they can book a place in the europa league quarter - finals if they preserve the 2 - 1 advantage they secured against dynamo kiev last thursday
â we are going to approach it the way we approach every game , â said barkley
â we did well at home and hopefully now we can do that in the away game
we have to be positive and give our all
