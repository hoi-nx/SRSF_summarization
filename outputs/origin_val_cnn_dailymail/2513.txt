newcastle united hotshot armstrong scored the winner as england 's under 18s beat switzerland in a behind - closed - doors friendly at st george 's park
armstrong popped up three minutes after half - time , firing home at the second attempt after swiss goalkeeper gregord kobel blocked an initial one - on - one attempt
but neil dewsnip 's team missed several good chances and the coach will hope they are more clinical when the two sides reconvene at walsall 's banks 's stadium on saturday
newcastle united striker armstrong scored the winner as england 's under 18s beat switzerland england coach neil dewsnip would be disappointed that england wasted a number of chances it was a strong side that lined up at the england headquarters in staffordshire , with chelsea 's dominic solanke , liverpool 's sheyi ojo and everton 's ryan ledson among the players on show
neil dewsnip also handed international debuts to sheffield united midfielder louis reed and fulham goalkeeper magnus norman
and magnus norman was almost involved inside the first minute when swiss forward neftali manzambi burst through , only to be denied by a last - ditch challenge by manchester city 's tosin adarabioyo
gradually , england asserted themselves and dominic solanke , who trained with the first team the other day , was inches away from turning home a low sheyi ojo cross
sheyi ojo , the liverpool prodigy currently out on loan at wigan athletic , was denied by gregord kobel shortly afterwards having been slipped clear by dominic solanke
the pressure was relentless and louis reed , keen to make a positive impression , curled an effort just wide of the post after southampton man josh sims and armstrong combined to tee him up
chelsea forward dominic solanke featured for england in their win at st george 's park the busy gregord kobel was again tested in the dying seconds of the half , tipping sheyi ojo 's header over the crossbar following more good build - up work from armstrong and everton defender jonjoe kenny
after armstrong finally made the breakthrough , england were able to relax a little but they continued to create chances at regular intervals
sheyi ojo fired over the bar after more good work from the lively armstrong and gregord kobel was called upon to deny dominic solanke , who made his chelsea first - team debut earlier this season
armstrong could have added a second after finding himself in an identical situation to his goal but on this occasion the goalkeeper saved
tammy abraham , who has featured in chelsea 's run to the fa youth cup final , came on for dominic solanke and nearly claimed his first england goal late on , only to fire inches wide
