he admits it is â the biggest gamble of his life â and is terrified that his latest television venture will be a flop
and it would seem comedian corden , who makes his debut this month as anchor of the late , late show â one of american âs top talk shows â may be right to be concerned , according to some members of the test audience at a rehearsal last week
corden and his new employers , cbs , could be worried that american audiences wo nât get his british brand of humour and they want to ensure he is word perfect for his first live show on march 23 , when hollywood superstar tom hanks will be a guest
response : corden is to make his debut as anchor of the late , late show later this month - but cbs bosses could be worried about how he will be received , so a rehearsal was held this week a source on the programme revealed they needed to â iron out the glitches and find out what works â , adding : â the american audience is totally different to anything james has experienced before
it âs been a real rollercoaster of highs and lows
â the mail on sunday gained exclusive access to corden âs rehearsal last week , and while some of the 200 invited audience â many of them professional actors paid to â fill â seats â seemed charmed by his laid - back delivery , most complained that they were â baffled â by his sense of humour and found his estuary accent difficult to understand
though he told interviewers last week that he intends to â shake up â late - night tv in the american , the new show is surprisingly formulaic
corden , 36 , sits behind a desk topped with an old - fashioned rotary phone , while guests sit on a blue sofa in front of a fake backdrop of la
there is a small bar set up in the corner of the studio , staffed by barman ian , and a house band led by wild - haired musician reggie watts
the comic opened the â show â with a monologue of jokes , including one about last week âs scandal over us secret service members who crashed into a white house barrier after a drunken party
â they âve got a new motto â to protect and serve me another , â he told his audience
guest susan wittan , from rockville , maryland , who attended thursday âs rehearsal said : â i âd never heard of corden until today
' he seems to be a very friendly , nice guy but i did nât get some of his jokes and i found him a bit hard to understand at times
he speaks quite quickly and used british words like mate
â i enjoyed some of the humour but i âm not sure how well he will go down in american
â revolutionary : despite corden - seen here interviewing cummings , of sitcom 2 broke girls , and eric christian olsen , from crime show ncis : la - promising the shake up the tried - and - tested format , some audience members complained there was little to differentiate it from other talk shows another woman , christine , who revealed she was being paid as a â seat filler â said : â i do nât think enough people know who he is
i did nât enjoy the show much
â the dress rehearsal came amid increasing concerns that corden , who has lost 6st in the run - up to the show âs launch , has been under tremendous stress , doubtless mindful that many other british , such as ant and dec , and russell brand , tried and failed to crack the american audience
while friends and family insist his new , slimline image is the result of a conscious effort to look svelte for his big launch , others close to the show say his fear of failure is the real reason that he has lost so much weight
risk : corden has moved his family - wife julia , son max , three , and four - month - old daughter julia - to la , but admits taking the role is the biggest gamble of his life so far in recent weeks he has displayed obvious signs of anxiety
â there have been a few heated moments , â the source said
â there have been a few raised voices
but that can be normal for any new show
â you ca nât blame him for being stressed and nervous
his entire professional future is on the line
â corden , who relocated to la at christmas with wife julia and their children max , three , and 14 - week - old carey , is on a reported Â£ 1.5 million - a - year deal
he admits cbs has taken â a huge gamble â bringing him to the american , saying : â i do nât know if i âm making a huge mistake
but i âd rather regret doing something than not doing something
â it âs madness really
when i got the job i âd never even been on an american talk show
â before thursday night âs rehearsal began corden , clearly on edge , spoke to the audience
he told them : â this is a dream come true for me
if you âd told the 12 - year - old me that i would be doing this i would never have believed it
â he also spoke about his children , saying : â when you have one kid it âs like having a pet
when you have two it âs like getting the whole zoo
â but he appeared distracted at times , with one onlooker commenting : â he seemed like he had a lot on his mind
there were times during the moments by himself when he looked stressed and worried
â he interviewed comedian cummings , of sitcom 2 broke girls , and actor eric christian olsen , from crime show ncis : la
when cummings joked about british being â a nation of alcoholics â corden replied : â i would refute that although i am aware that i âm the only late - night host with a bar in his studio
â family man : corden told the audience about his newly expanded brood , saying : â when you have one kid it âs like having a pet
when you have two it âs like getting the whole zoo
â unknown ? : some said they thought corden was not well - known enough to do well as a talk show host in the states - but cbs have been doing a lot of promotion to spread his name around , like this billboard stunt afterwards one british audience member said : â the show was pretty predictable
the main difference between this one and the other american late - night shows is that the guests walked out and sat on the sofa together
it âs more like graham norton âs show in format
â there were skits and jokes and a house band
he made the effort to engage the audience and invited everyone up on to the stage at the end to dance
' but there âs nothing revolutionary about it
he âs likeable but wo nât win any originality awards
he was trying very hard , though
the tone of the show is sweet
â amelia darwin , who also watched the show , added : â corden worked really hard and is a likeable man
but i âm not sure he âs got what it takes to be a huge success here
the show is too similar to everything else out there
' i wish him well but i wo nât be tuning in
â nick bernstein , cbs vice president , late night , west coast said : ' the studio audience reception to the practice shows has been terrific
80 % of the audience has re-booked for a future taping
a late night host with an accent is hardly a foreign concept to cbs
we find james british accent quite charming
