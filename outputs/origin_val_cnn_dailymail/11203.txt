the australia government has rallied behind a plan to protect the great barrier reef from future degradation , releasing a long - term plan to prevent the world heritage site from being declared ' in danger '
the world heritage committee is to decide whether the great barrier reef is on the ' in danger ' list in june , and in a bid to ensure the long - term health of the national treasure , the federal and queensland governments released reef 2050 long-term sustainability plan
the great barrier reef , which covers an area of 348,000 square metres , is the world âs most extensive coral reef ecosystem , and is listed by unesco ' a site of remarkable variety and beauty '
' great barrier reef is an incredibly diverse and rich environment â a maze of 3000 coral reefs and 1050 islands stretching for over 2300 kilometres , ' said a press release from mr tony abbott
' it is already regarded as being among the best managed marine parks in the world
we âre determined to keep it that way
' the great barrier reef includes 2,500 individual reefs and over 900 islands , as well as over 1,500 species of fish , about 400 species of coral , 4,000 species of mollusk , and 240 species of birds
' collectively these landscapes and seascapes provide some of the most spectacular maritime scenery in the world , ' says the great barrier reef 's listing by unesco
' this diversity , especially the endemic species , means the great barrier reef is of enormous scientific and intrinsic importance , and it also contains a significant number of threatened species
' mr tony abbott said that australia is ' utterly committed as an entire nation to the protection of the great barrier reef which is one of the natural wonders of the world ' ' great barrier reef is an incredibly diverse and rich environment â a maze of 3000 coral reefs and 1050 islands stretching for over 2300 kilometres , ' said a press release from mr tony abbott the great barrier reef includes 2,500 individual reefs and over 900 islands , as well as over 1,500 species of fish the great barrier reef can be seen from outer space , and includes popular tourist destinations such as the whitsundays and princess charlotte bay
the plan includes a ban on dumping dredge spoil anywhere in the world heritage area , a limit on port expansion to four sites and targets for reducing sediment , nutrient and pesticide contamination
the plan identifies climate change as one of the major threats , and aims to improve water quality
queensland environment minister steven miles said run - off of sediment , nutrients and pesticides was the biggest medium term threat to the reef , which the plan addressed
' with it , we will be able to convince the world heritage committee that not only should they not list the reef as in - danger but that we will actually keep the reef from being in danger , ' he said
greenpeace labelled the plan weak , as it still allows for massive coal port expansion and did not address climate change to a deserved extent , despite the report declaring this the main threat facing the great barrier reef
the commonwealth government has committed a further $ 100 million for the reef trust , in addition to the $ 40 million provided by the coalition last year
the reef can be seen from outer space , and includes popular tourist destinations such as the whitsundays and princess charlotte bay the great barrier reef is home to approximately 400 species of coral , 4,000 species of mollusk , and 240 species of birds the commonwealth government has committed a further $ 100 million for the reef trust , in addition to the $ 40 million already provided ' australia are rightfully proud of the great barrier reef and recognise its immense biological , economic and cultural value , ' said the statement
' together , we are committed to protecting it for future generations
' the federal minister for the environment hunt released a statement with mr tony abbott highlighted that the continued increase in water quality was a focus of the plan
' the work that âs being undertaken to improve water quality builds on the commonwealth government âs total and permanent ban on the dumping of capital dredge spoil in the great barrier reef marine park , ' the statement said
' the heart of this plan is about better quality , with hard targets including a 50 per cent reduction in nitrogen by 2018 and an 80 per cent reduction by 2025 , ' mr hunt said at the release of the plan
