in a tunnel dug deep underneath the besieged gaza strip , masked gunmen from palestinian islamic jihad ferry rockets and mortars back and forth , preparing for the next conflict with israeli
six months ago , the palestinian militant group emerged battered and bruised from a 50 - day conflict with israeli , where it fought alongside fellow islamist movement hamas , which controls gaza strip
palestinian islamic jihad 's armed wing the quds brigades lost 123 men , but fired 3,249 rockets at the jewish state , it says , including iranian - made fajr 5 missiles which reached tel aviv and even northern israeli
heavily armed : palestinian militants from the palestinian islamic jihad 's armed wing , the quds brigades , squat in a tunnel used for ferrying rockets and mortars back and forth in the gaza strip the conflict , where israeli tried to flush out hamas and palestinian islamic jihad militants by bombarding the coastal enclave , killed nearly 2,200 palestinians , mostly civilians , and 73 people on the israeli side , mostly soldiers
but the group says it is resurgent
' we 're at our highest level of alert to counter any attack
we 're used to the occupation ( israeli ) breaking its ceasefires , ' senior commander abu al-bara told journalists from inside one of the group 's tunnels
' what does n't kill us makes us stronger
we 're gathering all our strength since it 's a war that never ends
we 're ready to go to another level against the zionist occupation and carry out actions we 've never done before , ' he said , without elaborating
the war ended on august 26 with a fragile hamas - israeli ceasefire brokered by egyptian
in the meantime , palestinian islamic jihad has sought to replace its fallen comrades , and its manpower is estimated at between 10,000 and 15,000 fighters
hamas and palestinian islamic jihad refuse to specify the number of fighters , or rockets , they currently possess , but both were severely depleted by the israeli assault , which included ground combat
under cover : palestinian militants hide in a tunnel used for ferrying rockets and mortars back and forth in preparation for the palestinian islamic jihad 's next conflict with israeli israeli 's ground invasion was aimed at destroying the hundreds of tunnels gaza strip 's two main islamist groups had built , both for smuggling supplies and for attacks inside israeli
palestinian islamic jihad and hamas staged deadly assaults on israeli troops using the tunnels
for the first time , afp news correspondents were permitted to enter a tunnel , provided they were blindfolded whilst being taken to them , so as not to give away its location
inside , placards had been erected on the concrete walls , naming ' streets ' to help militants navigate the network
one route was named after abu bakr al-sadiq , the first palestinian islamic jihad caliph following the prophet mohammed 's death in 632 ; another , othman ibn affan , a successor
quds fighters said the group had a network of tunnels of ' different lengths , some with several entrances '
but they were silent on the network 's location or how it was built
still there : israeli 's ground invasion during the 50 - day war with palestinian militants in the summer of 2014 was aimed at destroying the hundreds of tunnels used by gaza strip 's two main islamist groups their weapons were made inside gaza strip , they said , but without elaborating on how the parts were obtained or purchased
it was an open secret before july 2013 that smuggling tunnels underneath the egyptian border brought in much of gaza strip 's construction and fuel needs , money , and weapons , or the material to make them
but egyptian destroyed the vast majority after the military ousted islamist president mohamed morsi and a crackdown was launched against his muslim brotherhood , hamas 's ally
palestinian islamic jihad , founded like hamas in the 1980s , traditionally has its closest ties with tehran , having been inspired by the iranian revolution
israeli accuses the groups of continuing to seize construction material entering gaza strip to make tunnels and weapons
' hamas and the palestinian islamic jihad have openly declared that they are rebuilding tunnels and testing rockets and other things like that , ' army spokesman lieutenant colonel peter lerner said
' they 've been siphoning off from the civilians of gaza strip forever , ' he said , warning that israeli was prepared for further confrontation
useful : it was an open secret before july 2013 that smuggling tunnels underneath the egyptian border brought in much of gaza strip 's construction and fuel needs , money , and weapons , or the material to make them underground and overground , the quds brigades lie ready.in the southern city of khan yunis , a banner reads : ' school of the mujahedin '
some 200 new recruits aged 19 to 22 are training at the camp , ducking under live fire , jumping through flaming hoops and shouting ' death to israeli ! death to america ! '
instructor abu ahmed says the masked young men are going through ' very advanced training '
' their training lasts between 36 days and six months , before they go to a specialised unit like explosives or sharp shooting , ' he said
' we do n't just have tunnels - we also invest in people , ' abu al-bara interjected
' with ideas and fighting , it is people who will liberate this land
