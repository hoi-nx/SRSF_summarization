the hosts started stronger , and it was no surprise when mohamed salah fashioned the chance for the opening goal after 17 minutes
mohamed salah has been a revelation since arriving in serie a on loan from chelsea , with six goals in seven appearances , and he continued his good run of form by playing josip ilicic in for the opener
with fiorentina on the counter-attack , mohamed salah picked up the ball on the left flank - slightly unfamiliar for him - and drove forward at pace
no challenges came in and the egyptian had the simple task of slipping the ball between two defenders to the feet of josip ilicic , who took a touch to compose himself before smashing a left - footed drive past skorupski at his near post
roma came more into it as the half went on and missed good opportunities through juan manuel iturbe and florenzi but they did also lose both captain daniel de rossi and kostas manolas to injury
radja nainggolan also picked up a booking meaning he will miss the second leg in the italian capital
after the break the two sides edged back into their shells a little in fear of giving away more of an advantage , but the game burst back into life on the hour mark

the protests were fierce as the brazilian clearly got a hand to the ball but referee antonio mateh lahoz refused to waver
adem ljalic stepped up and hit the penalty hard and low but neto dived low to his right to palm it away
brazilian goalkeeper neto brought down juan manuel iturbe to give away a penalty on the hour mark but neto swept himself down , got back between the sticks and brilliantly saved adem ljalic 's penalty but roma were not to be denied for too long
just 17 minutes later seydou keita found space to nod in florenzi 's corner and grab the crucial away goal
fiorentina could have restored a lead moments later but milan badelj was brilliantly stopped by skorupski
but it was not enough , roma take a slender lead back to the stadio olimpico next thursday
