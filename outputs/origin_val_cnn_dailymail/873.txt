ben evans has had surgery after rupturing his hamstring against st helens warrington 's wales international ben evans is set to spend around four months recuperating from a ruptured hamstring
the 22 - year - old prop suffered the horrific injury during the wolves ' 32 - 24 defeat by super league leaders st helens last thursday
he spent the weekend in london , where he underwent surgery , before returning to warrington on sunday night
' it was a particularly nasty injury and he was in a considerable amount of discomfort at the time , ' warrington assistant coach agar said
' but they got him off to hospital as soon as they possibly could and got him down to london the next day to see the specialist
' he 's had a fairly extensive operation to re-attach it but it 's going to be a long injury
the first estimates are around four months but all that will depend on the success of the operation and how he rehabs
' if it goes well for him , he will have a chance of playing again this year and at this place he is going to get the best medical care
' the wales international ( centre ) will be sidelined , alongside brother rhys , for around four months ben evans will have the company of his twin brother rhys , the warrington winger , during his recovery period
rhys underwent shoulder surgery after damaging it during the wolves ' world club series clash with st george illawarra in february and is facing a similar length of time on the sidelines
' it 's sad for ben evans because he 's got an opportunity that he had been patiently waiting for , ' added agar
' both him and rhys have now picked up sizeable injuries and will be out for a similar length of time
