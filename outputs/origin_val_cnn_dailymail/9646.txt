sacrifice : jogendra sen was the only non-white man in his regiment they were all young , proud , and ready to serve king and country
but among the eager group of young men who had signed up to fight in the first world war together , one face stood out from the rest
jogendra sen rushed to join the queue of recruits to the leeds â pals â battalion when it was raised in september 1914 â and became the only non-white member of the 15th west yorkshire regiment
yet were it not for a chance discovery almost a century later , his life â and death â might have been lost to history
a pair of broken and bloodstained spectacles in an indian museum have shed light on the sacrifice of a volunteer who battled prejudice and racism to serve the country he made his home
they were the same glasses that â jon â , as he was called by his english comrades , had worn in a photograph taken at a training camp in yorkshire
cruelly , the west bengal - born student âs race had barred him from fulfilling his dream of being an officer in the british army , even though he was highly educated and had earned a degree in electrical engineering from leeds university
but it also won him a place in history
because less than 20 months after that training camp photograph , jogendra sen was killed in action near the somme on may 22 , 1916
academics believe that the 28 - year - old private had become the first bengali to die fighting for britain in the war
although many more would later serve on the western front in the indian army , at the beginning of the war , most bengali were banned from joining up in their own country because of racial prejudice
the catalyst that allowed the tale of pte sen âs spectacles to emerge publicly was dr das , a reader in english at king âs college london , who noticed them and some of his other belongings in a museum on a visit to jogendra sen 's home town of chandernagore , some 22 miles north of kolkata in west bengal , indian
one of the chaps : private jogendra sen , centre , and his comrades pose for a photograph at a training camp in 1914 poignant : jogendra sen 's glasses and other belongings were discovered in a museum in indian a book of friendship quotes given to private jogendra sen by ' cis ' , believed to be mary cicely newton when the academic mentioned his discovery during a talk at leeds university , a local researcher recalled seeing jogendra sen âs name on its war memorial
from this , leeds researchers painstakingly pieced together one man âs war
jogendra sen had worked as an engineer while continuing with his studies
a photograph of a woman found in his personal effects , inscribed â yours with love , cis â , was found to be of mary cicely newton , who had links with the mill hill chapel in leeds where , it transpired , jogendra sen sang in the choir
but although jogendra sen was deeply involved in his local community , he faced discrimination even as he offered his life for the war effort
in an interview in 1988 , his fellow soldier arthur dalby recalled : â he was the best - educated man in the battalion and he spoke about seven languages , but he was never allowed to be even a lance corporal because in those days they would never let a coloured fellow be over a white man , not in england

the photo is thought to have been taken at colsterdale camp in yorkshire shortly after they signed up in 1914 dr das commented : â i was absolutely stunned when i saw the pair of glasses
â it âs one of the most poignant artefacts i âve seen â a material token of the fragility of life at the front
' more than a million indian soldiers and non-combatants served in different theatres of the first world war , but what is so unusual about jogendra sen is that he was not part of the indian army but of the leeds pals battalion
â i sometimes wonder what his experiences would have been as the only non-white person in the battalion at that time
â a photograph of a woman found in his personal effects , inscribed â yours with love , cis â , was found to be of mary cicely newton , who had links with the mill hill chapel in leeds where jogendra sen sang in the choir private jogendra sen ( fourth from the right in the third row back ) with number 16 platoon ( d company ) of the 16th west yorkshire regiment in about 1915 it can not have been easy â but what has become clear is that jogendra sen won the hearts and respect of his white comrades
shortly after his death , his commander wrote : â his loss is felt very much throughout the whole of the company
â he always showed himself to be a keen and upright soldier , and myself and the officers of this company thought a great deal of him
â a bbc inside out film tracing jogendra sen âs story is broadcast tonight on bbc one ( yorkshire and lincolnshire only ) at 7.30pm and is also available on bbc iplayer .
