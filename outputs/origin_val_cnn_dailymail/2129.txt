' the blaze began on may 23 last year after flammable spray foam for a student artwork was sucked into projector fan and caught alight the fire started in the basement , where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year art show firefighters in breathing apparatus stood shoulder to shoulder to forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections thousands of damaged pieces of building material have been marked in the hope that experts can put them back where they were before david page , head of architecture at page \ park architects , said : ' page \ park architects are delighted to have won the commission to lead a team to restore the world - renowned charles rennie mackintosh glasgow school of art.

the mackintosh building was damaged last year after a blaze sparked when canned spray foam , which a student was using for an art project , drifted into a projector fan and caught alight
the building caught fire on may 23 , starting in the basement , where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year art show
blackened stones from the library 's walls have been numbered with chalk
the building is considered by critics as charles rennie mackintosh 's finest work firefighters were able to save irreplaceable paintings and furniture by charles rennie mackintosh after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found a student had been using highly flammable canned spray foam to fill in the gaps in a piece which involved three large sheets of thick foam , which formed three ' walls ' framing a fourth blank wall , onto which a digital projector was beaming images when the spraying took place
as the fumes from the spray foam spread around the room , they were sucked into the cooling fan of the projector and caught alight as they wafted over the heat of the circuit board
the fire engulfed the basement room and spread to destroy much of the iconic building 's west wing
witnesses described firefighters in breathing apparatus standing shoulder to shoulder , forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections of the art school in a bid to prevent the blaze from spreading
other firefighters then darted in and out of the building to remove irreplaceable paintings and furniture by charles rennie mackintosh after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found
