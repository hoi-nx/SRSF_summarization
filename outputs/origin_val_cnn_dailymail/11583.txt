head coach gus poyet insists he will not walk away after the result which leaves the sunderland one place above the relegation zone
but it was an alarming performance which has raised serious questions over his future and that of sunderland âs top - flight status
sportsmail was at the stadium of light to witness their sorry display and brings you the merit marks which lay bare their shortcomings â¦ gus poyet ca n't bear to watch as his sunderland side are dismantled by aston villa at the stadium of light costel pantilimon 4 â left exposed for three of the goals but was outwitted by agbonlahor for crucial second which changed mood inside stadium
anthony reveillere 3.5 â looked a class act when he first signed , now looks like a 35 - year - old veteran struggling with pace of premier league
costel pantilimon was at fault for the crucial second goal , which changed the mood in the ground anthony reveillere , who looked off the pace throughout , is dominated in the air by benteke john oâshea 3 â the usually - dependable skipper was shambolic and will be wishing republic of ireland no.2 roy keane had not been in the stands
wes brown 3 â another who is looking like age is catching up with him and was helpless to prevent aston villa from running riot in the first half
john o'shea ( left ) looks defeated as benteke celebrates aston villa 's fourth goal before the interval wes brown is shrugged off the ball all too easily by agbonlahor as he began to look his age van aanholt 3 â afforded little help by those around him but aston villa soon realised the weakness in sunderland âs side and attacked at will down the left , where van aanholt had no answer
liam bridcutt 4 â nâzogbia ran all over him and the holding midfielder offered little resistance to wave after wave of aston villa offensives
ricky alvarez 3 â no surprise to see him hooked at the break after a typically ineffective first half
reports that an Â£ 8m deal is already agreed for the inter loanee must be a worry for sunderland supporters
seb larsson 4.5 â he ran about and gave his all but was involved in the bizarre incident at start of the second half where he failed to appear until the 49th minute
it was in keeping with the home side âs disastrous afternoon
the sunderland defence can only stop and stare as agbonlahor scores his second goal to make it 3 - 0 ricky alvarez is set to join the club for Â£ 8.5million from inter - he was ineffective again in the first half jack rodwell 5 â it was arguably his best display in red and white , but there has nât been much to choose from
he at least got on the ball , although did little with it
steven fletcher 3 â asked to man the left - hand side of midfield , it was a tactic which backfired spectacularly as aston villa right - back bacuna had a hand in three of the goals
jermaine defoe 3 â was anonymous and failed to pounce on the one decent cross flashed through the goalmouth by steven fletcher
jermaine defoe was anonymous up front and missed the few opportunities that did come his way subs wickham ( on 46 ) 5 â the second half was nothing more than a training - ground exercise and , like the rest of them , wickham went through the motions
manager gus poyet 2 â started with just one up front against lowly aston villa and stationed striker steven fletcher on the left - wing
it was a negative set - up and produced a negative performance
he insists the players are still on board with his message , but the evidence on the pitch suggests otherwise
sunderland fans show their anger at the club 's manager after gus poyet 's side were thrashed at home gus poyet set up for the game in a negative way , and his team were punished by a clinical aston villa side
