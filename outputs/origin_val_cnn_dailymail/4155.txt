relations between the uk and china took a significant leap forward with an historic meeting between its president xi and the duke today
president xi , whose communist party leadership was once derided by the prince as ' appalling old waxworks ' warmly shook hands with his son william and heaped praise on the british royal family
the two men met in the imposing great hall of the people - home of the congress - where the president highlighted their past interest in his country and told of how they had contributed ' positively ' to co-operation between china and uk
he also extended an open invitation to the queen and her family to come to china , which could pave the way for a visit by the heir to the throne
' over the years the royal family has shown great interest in , and support for china / uk relations
and members of the royal family have done a lot and contributed positively to ( the ) changes and co-operation between our two countries in areas ranging from trade to environment protection ... and cultural exchanges
' he added : ' i know this is your royal highness ' first visit to china
in china we have two sayings , first , hearing about something is not as good as seeing it
' and the second saying is hearing about something 100 times is not the same as seeing it once
' so i very much welcome your royal highness and other members of the royal family to make ( a ) visit to china and see more parts of china
' the president also passed on his good wishes about william 's second child expected next month and ' congratulated ' the duke and kate on the imminent birth
he concluded by saying ; ' i 'm sure your royal highnesses visit to china will be a productive visit and a visit of building friendships , ( it will ) surely go a long way to developing mutual understanding and friendly ties between china and uk people and i would like to wish your visit a great success
' in response william thanked the president ' enormously ' for inviting him to the great hall of the people and said : ' it 's been a long interest of mine , for many years , to come and visit china
' he told the china leader he was going to have an informative few days adding : ' i look forward to as you say strengthening uk / china relations and building things for the future
' william , who is an aston villa fan , added : ' i also gather you 're quite a football fan , i 'm looking forward to learning about china 's football ! ' the prince - who has left pregnant wife kate back in uk - said the forbidden city is ' beautiful and lovely ' he looked relaxed during his day in beijing , where the royals hope he can foster good relations with china prince william , who is on a week - long tour of the far east , flew into china last night from japan for one of the most high - profile â and diplomatically sensitive â tours of his fledgling royal career
with china on course to overtake the united states as the world 's largest economy , the uk government is keen to foster positive diplomatic relationships - and william 's visit is being seen as a key part of those efforts
stepping foot for the first time on china soil , the second in line to the throne became the most senior member of the royal family to visit the country since the queen nearly 30 years ago
in truth , many had believed that william 's father , prince charles , would be the first to stake that claim
the queen 's heir has been assiduously courting the china in recent years on behalf of his charities , setting up a number of initiatives in the country , including the prince 's charities foundation ( china ) and an organisation to preserve historic architecture
he has also met with several senior communist party leaders in the uk
however he has also made no secret of his personal , and deeply held , opposition to china actions in tibet , regularly welcoming their exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama ( reviled in beijing as a dangerous separatist ) , to clarence house
the prince chats with a crowd of well - wishers outside the uk ambassador 's official residence in beijing william admitted his china is coming along ' slowly ' , and is mainly limited to greeting ' ni hao ' the pair have even been photographed holding hands
after taking part in the formal handover of the former uk colony of hong kong in 1997 to china , charles also memorably described the officials taking part in ceremony as ' appalling old waxworks '
two years later he let it be known he was boycotting a buckingham palace banquet in honour of the then visiting president of china , jiang zemin
william 's grandfather , prince philip , also has form in the country
during the queen 's 1986 visit to china he memorably caused enormous offence by telling a group of uk students : ' if you stay here much longer , you 'll all be slitty eyed
' following his meeting with the president , william visited the exquisite forbidden city â the ancient home of china 's deposed emperors
the future king toured the former imperial palace â home to emperors and their households for nearly 500 years â on the first full day of his tour of china
accompanied by zhang , vice-director of foreign affairs at the forbidden city and an interpreter , he was given a guided tour of the stunning 15th century complex in dazzling sunshine
also present was barbara woodward , uk 's new ambassador to china and the first - ever woman in the role and sajid javid , minister for culture , media and sport
they were joined by a large security detail as they crossed a bridge over a semi-frozen moat into the inner courtyard to take in several of the main palaces
william listened intently as his guide described the construction and history of the vast landmark
he said : ' the sheer scale of it is phenomenal
' as he posed for photographs in front of the imposing hall of supreme harmony , he was asked how his china was coming along
he laughed and replied : ' very slowly
' william thanked the president ' enormously ' for inviting him to the great hall of the people and said : ' it 's been a long interest of mine , for many years , to come and visit china ' the president also passed on his good wishes about william 's second child expected next month and ' congratulated ' the duke and kate on the imminent birth responding to the mandarin greeting ni hao ma , he said : ' ni hao
that 's about as far as i have got
' the duke was shown giant bronze urns once used to burn pine - scented incense and fill the courtyard below the palaces with clouds of smoke , giving the impression the emperors was sitting heaven
he said : ' it must have smelled fantastic
' he paused to admire an ornate throne room in the hall of central harmony , where emperors from the ming dynasty onwards received ministers and officials
above the intricately carved throne , flanked by statues of cranes â the symbol of longevity in china â hangs an imperial motto in ancient china characters
roughly translated it reads : ' build yourself up in order to contribute to your nation
' william was told how each of the ' golden bricks ' in the floor were baked from highly prized type of mud
mr zhang said : ' unfortunately today we can not make a replica of the bricks because the quality of soil in china has changed and we do n't have the craftsmanship
' william joked : ' that 's a shame , you can have them made of gold now
' admiring the view of ancient temples and palaces on the hill beyond the forbidden city 's 10m - high walls , he also noticed building work taking place across the skyline
he said : ' there is an amazing contrast between the old and the new here
' as he left to attend lunch with the chinese premier , william thanked his hosts
mr zhang told him : ' welcome to china , we did n't have time to visit all of the forbidden city today , just a small portion
' during a whistlestop tour of the forbidden city , william admired the view of ancient temples and palaces on the hill beyond the 10m - high walls it came the duke took part in a ' shaun the sheep ' promotion at the uk ambassador 's official residence the duke , whose whistlestop tour lasted just 35 minutes , replied : ' it feels like a very big portion
' it 's beautiful and lovely , thank you so much for showing me around
i hope that you manage to conserve it going forward
it 's such a massive area
' built between 1406 and 1420 , the china imperial palace was home to 24 emperors , 14 of the ming dynasty and 10 of the qing dynasty
the last emperor , puyi , abdicated in 1912 but was allowed to remain in the inner court until a coup in 1924
it is now a museum housing some 1.8million items and attracts more than 15 million visitors a year
it contains 980 buildings , including 90 palaces and courtyards , 8,704 rooms and is the largest collection of preserved wooden structures in the world , covering 150,000 square metres
later today he will fly to shanghai to embark on a concerted push to promote uk business and culture when he opens the government 's great festival of creativity at the city 's long museum
the festival is designed to showcase uk innovation and creativity in everything from fashion to health , technology , education and entertainment
it 's a packed programme of engagements and while there is palpable disappointment that the prince 's wife , the kate , had been forced to remain at home due to the advanced stage of her second pregnancy , william has made the right noises so far , it seems .
