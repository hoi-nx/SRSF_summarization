a texas lawyer has come forward claiming he is responsible for plastering stickers that read ' exclusively for white people ' onto business storefronts last week
reposa , 40 , a criminal defense attorney explained why he put up the stickers in a video posted on thursday , titled why i did it
a shirtless reposa is seen saying it would be obvious that even though people know the real problem , which is that ' people without money are getting pretty f * * * ed , they are getting pushed out and pretty quick this area of town is turning into whites only '
nelson linder said : ' it 's repugnant and also alarming , and also indicative of a mentality that does n't understand race relations
' so if you 're trying to help race relations , you just did the worst thing you could possibly do
' a shirtless reposa is seen saying it would be obvious that even though people know the real problem , which is that ' people without money are getting pretty f * * * ed , they are getting pushed out and pretty quick this area of town is turning into whites only ' he said : ' everyone is going to jump on " that 's racist , that 's racist " , man this town and the way s * * * works is racist on wednesday , a picture of the sticker on a local business surfaced on facebook causing outrage after at least six businesses were left with the seals
each one read in its entirety : ' exclusively for white people
maximum of five colored customers

' reposa said he is not worried about offending people or stirring up racial tension
' i 've seen nothing but the emotional attachment that human beings place on events in history , ' he said
' it 's regrettable and unfortunate and as soon as we can step beyond that precious of mawkish emotionality and just look at the real facts like human beings , is the moment that we have the chance for real progress
' in the video , reposa said that everyone attacked the stickers saying ' it 's racist ' but did not consider the ' condition of the way things are '
while it appears reposa is claiming gentrification as his defense , austin naacp president said the issues in the community run deeper and reposa 's actions add to the problems reposa said he is not worried about offending people or stirring up racial tension he said : ' everyone is going to jump on " that 's racist , that 's racist " , man this town and the way s * * * works is racist
' but i knew i could bait all of y'all into being as stupid as you are and allowing the issue to be framed of the in the most simple way
" oh he said an offensive term , let 's not worry about the actually condition of the way things are , let 's worry about an offensive term "
' and that 's how they got it , they got it sewed up and they got this poor girl coming out here saying " it hurt my feelings " , man who cares about your feelings man
seriously ? ' are y'all gon na get pulled around like that y'alls ' entire lives , or y'all just gon na stop givin a f * * * ? i do n't give a f * * * and look at me
' i use the technology every day to create possibilities
apply the technology in your life and stop worrying about getting snitched on because it do n't make a f * * * what i did because i 'm gon na do it again , i do n't give a f * * *
' the ' technology ' that reposa references in the video is linked to a facebook page that reads : ' taking human beings out of a false sense of belief and into the darkness by removing any meaning attached to any event in life
' reposa also wrote a sarcastic post on his personal page saying that he was not aware highlighting institutional racism was ' so repugnant '
it was reported that he said the full story would be revealed in a press conference on friday on the page he explains that the result of the ' the technology ' is that people ' who give a f * * * passionately express their beliefs '
he also wrote a sarcastic post on his personal page saying that he was not aware highlighting institutional racism was ' so repugnant '
he wrote : ' my f * * * ing bad y'all
i had no idea that pointing to institutional racism was so repugnant
