isil supporters have vowed to murder twitter staff because they believe the site 's policy of shutting down their extremist pages is a ' virtual war '
a mocked - up image of the site 's founder dorsey in cross-hairs was posted yesterday alongside a diatribe written in arabic , which claimed twitter employees ' necks are ' a target for the soldiers of the caliphate '
addressing mr dorsey personally , it claimed twitter was taking sides in a ' media war ' which allowed ' slaughter ' , adding : ' your virtual war on us will cause a real war on you
diatribe : an image of twitter founder dorsey in cross-hairs was posted alongside a rant in arabic it is nine years since mr dorsey launched the site , which is trying to avoid being a vehicle for jihadi videos ' how will you protect your employees and supporters , helpless jack , when their necks officially become a target for the soldiers of the caliphate ? ' it also claimed killing employees ' outside a neighbourhood pub ' would be no more preventable than the massacres of charlie hebdo killer amedy coulibaly and copenhagen shooter omar el-hussein
it then said men and women , young and old , would all be targeted and closed by saying nothing would prevent the ' delivery of the holy mission to the world '
the rant was written anonymously and posted on the text sharing service pastebin yesterday before being shared by isil supporters , including on twitter
a twitter spokesman told buzzfeed law enforcement officials had been made aware of the rant and will assess whether it poses a genuine threat
killers : the message compared its threat to the murders carried out in paris by amedy coulibaly ( left ) and in copenhagen by omar el-hussein ( right )
