a stag party in las vegas is usually the cue to go a little crazy
but the groom , my mate justin jacob , was adamant he did n't want ' crazy '
on this trip , we were determined to do things differently
after all , we are all older and wiser now â¦ las vegas was n't the first choice among our party - we had originally planned to go to thailand
there were going to be just five of us , so we thought we would head somewhere with some nightlife and a good spa so that we could relax too
the famous las vegas casinos are definitely worth a punt if you 're feeling flush but then the number who wanted to travel grew to ten , so justin jacob suddenly announced : ' we 're going to las vegas
i do n't care if it 's been done before â we 're going to go and do our best out there
' as justin jacob 's best man , it was my job to organise the stag party - and i discovered what a nightmare that can be
first of all , it was impossible to get everyone to pay the money at the right time
and then those who had said they were coming suddenly decided that they could n't make it , and people who had said ' no ' then announced they were available
we planned a three - night trip
going on past experience , i knew it would be intense - nobody gets much sleep because there is always something going on
you plan to go to bed , for example , and then you get sucked into going to a pool party
las vegas is home to many stag and hen parties - but the groom on jeff 's trip said he did n't want ' crazy ' we stayed at the cosmopolitan , one of the newer hotels in las vegas
it 's vast - just walking from one end to the other takes about half an hour
it has great shops and 14 different restaurants , including stk , a steakhouse which also has branches in new york and la
like most of the hotels in las vegas , the the cosmopolitan is very skilfully laid out so that it does n't matter where you are going to or coming from , at some point on your journey through the hotel you will find yourself passing the slot machines and the gaming tables
nobody gets much sleep in las vegas because there is always something going on
you plan to go to bed , for example , and then you get sucked into going to a pool party when you get to your room at the end of the day , you 're unlikely to have any change in your pockets - it will all have been eaten by the ' slots '
i 'm not really a gambler , so i think i probably came home with a little bit more in my pocket than the others
i had to be the sensible one , after all , because i saw it as my duty to look after the groom
you 're there to make sure he 's having a great time - within the limits , of course
as the best man , jeff ( left ) was ' mr sensible ' on the trip , and looked after the groom - to - be justin jacob ( right ) we did n't start off with a carefully drafted plan about how we spend our days in las vegas - instead , we decided that we would all meet up at certain points
we would all get together at dinner , for example , and then we would all head out to a club afterwards
it was n't that difficult to arrange
we had three rooms between us , so it was usually just a case of picking up the phone and saying : ' right , we 're meeting in 15 minutes
' we looked at going on a grand canyon tour , but in the end we never really escaped the hotel scene â las vegas really sucked us in , chewed us up and spat us out ! half the time you 're not sure whether it 's breakfast or whether you should be getting ready for a night out while we had planned to take it easy , in the end we partied like we did when we were in our 20s
the problem is that when you 're down in the gaming rooms , there is no natural light , so you have no idea whether it 's night or day
half the time you 're not sure whether it 's breakfast or whether you should be getting ready for a night out
but we all agreed the trip was a huge success
we did n't get much sleep but we had plenty of fun
and on a stag trip , that 's all you can ask for
