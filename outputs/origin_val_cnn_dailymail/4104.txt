because the newest , most exciting products all have a distinctly eastern flavour
the korean craze all began with bb creams â technically short for blemish balms , but essentially rebranded tinted moisturisers

â there was nothing special about them , it was just another way of selling an existing product
â the korean cosmetic craze began with bb creams ( blemish balms ) , which quickly became popular in uk thanks to online promotions ( pictured posed by model ) but thanks to the internet , the trend quickly spread , and as soon as uk brands saw an appetite for bb creams , they started bringing out their own
they also started to keep a close eye on what was happening in korea
because while bb creams were not much more than clever marketing , some genuine innovation is emerging
â there âs a big pharmaceutical industry there which the government has ploughed money into , â says kathy
