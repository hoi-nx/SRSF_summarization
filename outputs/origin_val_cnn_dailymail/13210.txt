it was a sophisticated attack with sophisticated devices
authorities quickly identified the boston bombing suspects , but almost immediately after tamerlan tsarnaev was killed during the manhunt for the perpetrators and dzhokhar was captured , investigators privately questioned if more people were involved
if there were others , perhaps a bomb maker is on the loose
dzhokhar told police he and his brother built the bombs , but court documents show some people involved in the case had their doubts
the bombs were described as powerful pressure - cooker explosives controlled remotely
there were fuses from christmas lights and detonators constructed from model car parts
the twin bombings in april 2013 killed three people and wounded more than 250 others
" these relatively sophisticated devices would have been difficult for the tsarnaevs to fabricate successfully without training or assistance from others , " prosecutors wrote in a filing opposing a move by dzhokhar 's lawyer to throw out statements he made in the hospital
two years after the attack marks , a former special agent for the naval criminal investigative service , agrees on the technical aspects of the bombs
" these were two relatively sophisticated devices that went off almost simultaneously
they had a very , very short delay , " he said
" it would be my opinion that they had somebody who was more of a skilled bomb maker , an engineer if you will , assist them in saying these are the steps you need to go through and then assemble the device to make it safely and to make it function the way they want
" they were the kind of bombs that need testing to make sure they work the way you expect
" there has been no evidence that the two brothers actually tested and tried out making a bomb and detonating it , " cnn national security analyst kayyem said
" now it could be luck that they put this thing together , put it at the boston marathon finish line , and were able to detonate them so close to each other and sequentially
but it was a pretty sophisticated attack
" dzhokhar told fbi agents he and his brother built the bombs following instructions from al qaeda 's inspire magazine
no one has been publicly named as a possible co-conspirator
investigators have focused on tamerlan tsarnaev 's suspected ties to militants
in 2012 the older dzhokhar spent six months in russia
authorities have questioned how much exposure he may have had to radicals and whether he could have received training there
there are other clues that the brothers would have needed help with the bombs
there was n't trace evidence -- black powder from fireworks -- found in either home , their cars or anywhere associated with them , the court documents said
also , investigators apparently were troubled that they recovered one remote - controlled detonator at the scene of the bombings when there should have been two
that suggested the other was being kept to use with other bombs
marks said investigators did n't find circuit testers
" you want a separate circuit tester in order to test the functionality of the components without it being hooked up to the actual device , for your own safety , " he said
the trial underway in boston will center on not whether dzhokhar did it , but why he did it
the prosecution will paint a portrait of a cruel co-conspirator , an equal partner in hideous crimes
a man who planned to kill and did
but the defense will draw the accused as a boy living in the shadow of a mastermind older brother
younger , struggling in school , abandoned by his parents
an easy victim of deep manipulation
the question of how he was influenced is essential to the case
kayyem , who said she believes the brothers acted in tandem without outside help , said she think the defense strategy will be to create enough doubt within the jurors ' minds of dzhokhar 's mental state leading into this
" so this idea that there might be some evil hand out there telling dzhokhar what to do -- whether it 's his brother or someone who 's a bomb maker -- fits nicely into that narrative , " she said .
