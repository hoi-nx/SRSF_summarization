nasa had chosen the ambitious mission that will visit a comet and pluck a boulder from its surface to create an orbiting base for astronauts
a robot ship will pluck a large boulder off an asteroid and sling it around the moon , becoming a destination to prepare for future human missions to mars , the u.s. space agency has revealed
the so - called asteroid redirect mission is estimated to cost about $ 1.25 billion not including launch costs and is targeted for liftoff in december 2020
it would be followed five years later by a human expedition to the space rock , a modification of a plan proposed by president barack obama in 2010
after extensive studies , nasa opted to collect and move a boulder , a mission that will cost about $ 100 million more , but which better prepares the agency for the ultimate goal of landing astronauts on mars
' they 're the kind of things that we know we 're going to need when we go to another planetary body , ' nasa associate administrator lightfoot told reporters on a conference call
nasa plans to study the asteroid for about a year and test deflection techniques that one day may be necessary to save earth from a potentially catastrophic collision
an asteroid or comet smashed into the planet about 65 million years ago , leading to climate changes that killed off dinosaurs and most other life on earth then
so far , nasa has three candidate asteroids , but does not expect to make a decision about where to fly before 2019
the mission involves flying a robotic spacecraft , powered by solar electric propulsion , to an asteroid for an extensive survey
once a target boulder was selected , the probe would hover down toward the surface and deploy a pair of robot arms to grab hold of a 6.5 - to 13 - foot ( 2 - to 4 meter ) wide boulder
the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation orion
after the orion and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object
once the orion docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows
after the mission is complete , orion returns to earth on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean - likely the pacific-10 days later
the mission is seen as an important step towards eventually sending humans to mars and returning them safely
' i 'm going to have multiple targets ... we can assess which one we want to go after and i then have three - to five tries to get it , or i can move on to a different one , ' lightfoot said
the captured boulder , which would remain attached to the probe , would then be nudged into an orbit circling high around the moon , a maneuver expected to take about six years
the probe would include a docking ring so a orion spaceship , carrying two astronauts , could reach the asteroid , a mission targeted for around 2025
nasa 's ultimate goal is to send humans to mars , and they say the asteroid redirect mission ( arm ) will be an important stepping stone towards getting there
a number of new spaceflight capabilities will be tested in the 2020s as part of the mission , which will involve redirecting an asteroid to orbit the moon and sending humans to explore it
astronauts aboard nasa 's orion spacecraft , launched from the upcoming sls ( sls ) rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the mid- 2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon nasa plans to launch an arm robotic spacecraft to rendezvous with , capture and redirect an asteroid by the end of this decade
the spacecraft will redirect it to a stable orbit around the moon called a ' distant retrograde orbit ' - one that orbits the moon very widely , coming quite close before extending out much further away
astronauts aboard nasa 's orion spacecraft , launched from the upcoming sls ( sls ) rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the mid- 2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon
within the papers , authors explain the current work taking place across the country to examine options for these robotic and crewed missions
this includes advanced sep ( sep ) - one of the critical technologies needed to send larger payloads into deep space and to the mars system
sep - or ion propulsion - creates thrust powered by solar arrays , which transforms sunlight into electromagnetic fields that accelerate and expel charged atoms ( ions )
this is a very efficient way to power a spacecraft and significantly cuts down on the amount of fuel a spacecraft needs to carry , which can be heavy and expensive to launch from earth
an asteroid named itokawa photographed by the hayabusa probe
the agency plans to announce the specific asteroid selected for the mission no earlier than 2019 , approximately a year before launching the robotic spacecraft
before an asteroid is considered a valid candidate for the mission , scientists must first determine its characteristics , in addition to size , such as rotation , shape and precise orbit
nasa has identified three valid candidates for the mission so far : itokawa , bennu and 2008 ev5
the agency expects to identify one or two additional candidates each year leading up to the mission
returning asteroid samples will help nasa develop tools and techniques for future space exploration
this early experience with raw materials could also help advance our ability to make use of natural resources in space
rocky bodies like asteroids and our moon could hold enough oxygen and hydrogen to create breathable air , drinkable water or even components for rocket fuel
there also is growing interest in the commercial space industry to potentially mine asteroids for resources in the future
with this in mind some of the papers outline ways in which arm might benefit future commercial activities at asteroids - namely collecting resources for use back on earth or in space
current studies at nasa detailed in the papers are examining ways sep will be used to power the arm robotic mission
nasa was also working on a mission concept that would fully enclose a large asteroid using an inflatable system and the other would capture a smaller boulder from of a much larger asteroid using robotic arms
the arm crewed mission , in which astronauts will explore the redirected asteroid around the moon , provides unique opportunities to test human spaceflight capabilities as well
the papers detail current work underway at nasa to upgrade spacesuits in preparation for the first spacewalks in deep space since the 1960s and farther from earth than ever before
concepts for new hardware to dock the crewed and uncrewed spacecraft together are also in development
this will allow the crew aboard orion to attach to the arm robotic spacecraft and study the asteroid
this could be later used to connect orion with a deep space habitat or ' stepping stone ' on its way to mars , or even station cargo and fuel depots in strategic places such as lunar orbit
astronauts returning home with samples from mars will hold a treasure trove of research scientists will study to unlock new knowledge about mars and the solar system 's history
various techniques for deflecting a potentially hazardous asteroid could be tested on arm to enable planetary defense capabilities
these techniques include ion beam deflection , enhanced gravity tractor , and kinetic impactors
in ion beam deflection , the plumes from the thrusters would be directed towards the asteroid to gently push on its surface over a wide area
a thruster firing in the opposite direction would be needed to keep the spacecraft at a constant distance from the asteroid
the ion beam deflection approach is independent of the size of the asteroid , and it could be demonstrated on either mission option
in the enhanced gravity tractor approach , the spacecraft would first pick up a boulder from the asteroid 's surface as in mission option b. the spacecraft with the collected boulder would then orbit in a circular halo around the asteroid 's velocity vector
the mass of the boulder coupled with the mass of the spacecraft would increase the gravitational attraction between the spacecraft and the asteroid
by flying the spacecraft in close formation with the asteroid for several months the very small gravitational forces would produce a measurable change in the asteroid 's trajectory
a kinetic impactor could also be launched as a secondary payload with the spacecraft or on a separate launch vehicle , and it would collide with the target asteroid at high velocity while the spacecraft observed the impact
as well as this , returning asteroid samples will help nasa develop tools and techniques for future space exploration
