he also needs to prove his form
â if you put those two things together , i think england would be foolish not to consider him as a genuine option
you ca nât help but admire his motivation to try to scale everest again in test cricket
â pietersen was sacked by england following the 2013 - 14 ashes defeat but has been tempted back to surrey after incoming england and wales cricket board chairman graves hinted he could return to the test arena by scoring heavily in county cricket
pietersen will have nine county championship matches for surrey to impress england 's selectors he 's secured a released from sunrisers hyderabad to stake his claim for an england return in the ashes tom moody , whose sunrisers hyderabad will get pietersen back if they reach the ipl knockout stage , anticipates a successful return to the oval for pietersen
â i think there is a small chance , â he said of a test recall
â but i think that âs enough to motivate him
â he âs got an agenda â to score as many runs as he can to make it near - on impossible for the selectors to ignore him
sunrisers hyderabad coach tom moody believes england would be ' foolish ' not to welcome back pietersen surrey âs director of cricket stewart is happy to welcome back the batsman on a contract initially for county championship cricket which could evolve during the season
stewart said : â he has ambitions to play for england â and to do that , or even be considered , he has to score big runs
â that âs why we âve signed him ( so that ) he gets those hundreds , those double - hundreds
after that , it âs down to the selectors
â pietersen , who will donate his surrey wages to his charitable foundation , insists he will have no problem working with england captain alastair cook and coach peter moores
pietersen started the year by playing more short form cricket for melbourne stars in the big bash â even if this does not work out and i do not get back in the england team , i will at least end my career knowing i gave it another shot , â pietersen said in his daily telegraph column
â i would kick myself for a long time if i walked away now , without having a go
all i am looking for is a fair opportunity to play for england again
i just want a blank sheet of paper , and to be judged on merit
â i will be meeting mr graves face to face
i think he is open to discussing drawing a line in the sand in terms of what âs gone on
