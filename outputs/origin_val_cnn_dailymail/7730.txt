no - one enjoys filing their tax return , but paying your duty would have been an even more arduous task 2,000 years ago
a recently translated ancient egypt tax receipt has revealed that it probably took more than 220lbs ( 100kg ) of coins to settle just one wealthy person 's bill
the tax receipt was written in greek on a piece of pottery that is said to date back to 22 july 98 bc. a recently translated ancient egypt tax receipt ( pictured ) has revealed that it provably took more than 220lbs ( 100kg ) of coins to settle one wealthy person 's bill
although it is difficult to calculate what it would have been worth in modern - day terms , estimates place it in the region of $ 1,670 ( Â£ 1,120 ) the person , whose name is unreadable , paid a land transfer tax of 75 talents , which was a unit of currency , as well as a fee of 15 talents on top , reports livescience
the pottery receipt shows that the tax was paid in coins , which were hauled to a bank in the city of diospolis magna , also known as luxor or thebes
brice jones , a phd student at concordia university in montreal who translated the text , said that the bill was â incredibly large â
as paper money did nât exist and there were no coins as large as one talent , the payees of the bill would have had to make up the sum using drachmas , where 6,000 of the coins equalled one talent
a stock image of a silver drachma dating to the 3rd century bc is shown it may seem incredible that such a rigid tax system continued to function at a time of political infighting
politics were deadly in 98bc
pharaoh ptolemy x , who was part of a dynasty of pharaohs who ruled egypt after the death of alexander the great , had fought against his brother for the throne and some sources say he killed his own mother to keep a firm grip on power
despite his best efforts , in 89bc his army mutinied and he was killed the following year , leaving his brother to take over the running of the region
as paper money did nât exist and there were no coins as large as one talent , the payees of the bill would have had to make up the sum using drachmas , where 6,000 of the coins equalled one talent
consequently , 540,000 drachma were needed to settle the tax bill written on the receipt
although it is difficult to calculate what this would have been worth in modern - day money , estimates suggest it would have been around $ 1,670 ( Â£ 1,120 )
lorber , an expert in egypt coins , explained that the highest denomination coin was probably worth just 40 drachma , so 13,500 of them would have been needed to pay the bill
â the coins in question weigh , on average , 8 grams ( 0.3 ounces ) , so the total payment of 90 talents probably had a weight in excess of 100 kilograms ( 220 lbs ) , â she said
the people charged with collecting the money , known as tax farmers , would have had to ring the heavy load to the bank , and it may have been placed in baskets and carried by donkeys
dr lorber said the surcharge , known as the â allage â , may have been added to the bill because part of it was paid in bronze coins , instead of silver

this stock image shows medinat habu temple in luxor ancient texts uncovered in egypt village deir el-medina ( ptolemaic temple pictured ) suggest new kingdom workers had state - supported health care ancient texts recently uncovered among the human remains of an egypt village suggest workers from the new kingdom also had their own version of a state - supported health care
this scheme , which involved paid sick leave and on - site doctors , made sure workers making the king âs tomb 3,600 years ago were productive and well looked after
the dig of the ancient egypt worker âs village at deir el-medina is being led by stanford archaeologist anne austin
the village was built for workmen who made the royal tombs during the new kingdom ( 1550 to 1070 bc )
during this period , kings were buried in the valley of the kings in a series of rock - cut tombs
the village was purposely built close enough to the royal tomb to make sure the workers could hike there on a weekly basis
â these workmen were not what we normally picture when we think about the men who built and decorated ancient egypt royal tombs - they were highly skilled craftsmen , â said dr austin
â the workmen at deir el-medina were given a variety of amenities afforded only to those with the craftsmanship and knowledge necessary to work on something as important as the royal tomb
â according to ancient texts found on the site , as well as other historical accounts , the egypt state paid workers monthly wages in the form of grain and provided them with housing and servants to help with laundry , grinding grain and porting water
ancient texts found among human remains ( pictured with lead archaeologist anne austin ) include daily records detailing when and why workers were sick and reveal they were also paid a certain amount of sick leave
other papyri describe on - site physicians who would treat the workers as part of their employment
