the home secretary set out a comprehensive overhaul aimed at curbing the power of the police federation , ending decades of mismanagement
theresa may announced membership will no longer be compulsory for the 126,000 frontline officers who serve across england and wales from next month
its senior leadership will also not be paid from the public purse and they must demonstrate their â integrity and value â , she added
the move is a victory for the mail which has repeatedly exposed how the union was hijacked by a militant minority bent on attacking the government
their bullying tactics , lavish spending on corporate credit cards and drunken antics were laid bare by this newspaper in a series of devastating exposes
the union was also discovered to have invested vast sums in mysterious off - shore accounts amid questions over its Â£ 95million of cash and assets
the huge cash pile was reflected in the Â£ 26million lavished on the new luxury hq in leatherhead , surrey , which includes a freemasons â lodge
and last year two of its most senior officials resigned just days after this newspaper revealed it had hired a pr firm to mastermind a â blitzkrieg â campaign against the government
the â guerilla tactics â deal was designed to undermine a deeply unpopular programme of cuts and reform designed to drag policing into the 21st century
the union was also damaged by the plebgate affair , sparked by a clash between the then chief whip andrew mitchell and downing street armed guards
some senior figures seized on the scandal , printing t - shirts , posters and launching an online campaign in a bid to discredit the tory command
but the series of politicised stunts backfired after officials were discovered to have misrepresented mr andrew mitchell âs comments in a private meeting
the police federation âs new leadership , led by chairman white , now hope to draw a line under the entire saga
they agree the union must be more transparent and open with both its members and the general public
many of the changes announced yesterday are the result of a review they commissioned by former home office mandarin sir david normington

the home secretary said the frontline police â union â must end its closed shop culture or she would legislate against it
in an astonishing speech , she accused it of complicity in an â attitude â that leads to racism , neglect of vulnerable victims and the obstruction of official inquiries
â every police officer , every single police leader , and everybody in the police federation should confront it and expunge it from the ranks , â she added
yesterday , in a ministerial statement , mrs may confirmed the reforms , many of which have been requested by the police federation
mrs may said the union has made â steady progress â getting its house in order by implementing the recommendations
many of the reforms focus on financial management and include a move to enable accounts to be â called in â and examined by the government
a further change puts the police federation on notice to prepare to be subject to freedom of information laws once new legislation can be agreed
mrs may said the changes will bring â accountability and transparency â to the way the union conducts its affairs
mr white said : â we are pleased the home secretary has recognised the progress that we have made in implementing the reforms contained in the independent review we commissioned .
