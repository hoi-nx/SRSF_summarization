he said : ' it is good to know that these young men are now safely home with their families
this is because the families involved decided to call the authorities as soon as they realised their children were missing

' i would like to thank the met police and turkey authorities for their swift action in returning the boys back to the british in less than 48 hours

speaking in the commons , security minister james brokenshire said he could not comment on the specifics of the recent arrests but told mps : ' it has been reported three young men were arrested at the weekend after attempting to travel from turkey to syria
' this reflects the good working relationship we have with the turkey authorities
' mps will understand i can not comment on the specifics because there is an on - going investigation but i will say those seeking to travel to engage in terrorist activity in syria or iraq should be in no doubt we will take the strongest possible action to protect our national security , including prosecuting those who break the law
' mp vaz , who chairs the home affairs select committee , said the latest arrests suggest the flow of young people intending to travel to syria is ' on a much larger scale than we envisaged '

' the police need to be commended for the speed with which they dealt with this case
i have spoken to the turkey ambassador to congratulate him on the action taken by the turkey authorities
' this is a rare good news story in the fight against terrorism and is a lesson to us all that we need to be vigilant against those who seek to groom our young men and women in this way
' it comes just weeks after an international police hunt was launched to find three east london schoolgirls who travelled to istanbul on their journey to syria last week scotland yard chief sir bernard hogan-howe said the three schoolgirls who fled to syria from east london would not face prosecution if they came home
this is despite the fact they successfully reached is and at least two of them are known to have communicated with wanted terrorists
the families of shamima begum and amira abase , both 15 , and kadiza sultana , 16 , have criticised police and others for failing to stop them
but questions have been raised about why the families themselves did not spot their conversion to radical islamists
the families of the three girls yesterday released a statement appealing for them to come home immediately
saying they felt their loss ' more acutely ' on mother 's day , the families also criticised authorities , saying : ' with respect to the disappearance of our children we have been disappointed by the handling of this matter by the school , met police and the local authority , all of whom we feel failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information to us or indeed between each other
' on saturday the daily mail revealed the identity of another girl , a close friend of the trio , who left british before them in december
sharmeena , 15 , disappeared from bethnal green academy and flew to istanbul from gatwick
those closest to all four girls suspect they were groomed by islamists using social networking sites and secretive internet messaging software
there are also suspicions the trio kept in touch with sharmeena who passed on information about how to follow in her footsteps
the schoolgirls are understood to be in the terror group 's de facto capital raqqa
the authorities in turkey said the quick deportation of the latest travellers showed how their efforts to combat the flood of extremists is working
one source said : ' the turkey are willing to act quickly and arrest people but they do not see this as their problem
that is why the suspects were sent back to the british so quickly
no one here wants to deal with them any longer than they have to
