it 's all incredibly exciting
' the shows , which take place on march 20 , 21 and april 3 , have a twist
those appearing on the catwalk will be bravely admitting what their true insecurities are , which are nât always the obvious anxiety that people assume
whether it be their height , their weight or colour of their hair , the representatives will be emphasising that what others assume to be their insecurity is nât always the case
in her role as a fashion and beauty ambassador , katie ( pictured at one of her charity events ) will launch a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from her foundation , the katie piper foundation , and models of diversity katie , who was left with severe scarring after being attacked in 2008 when her ex-boyfriend employed an accomplice to throw a cup of industrial - strength sulphuric acid in her face , is keen to reveal hers
' you might look at me and think that 's what i would be insecure about it , but it is n't , ' she revealed
' in fact , it 's my height ; i would love to be a bit taller
' in another uk first , katie is also offering two people with visible differences the chance to join her catwalk

last month , katie rocked the runway for naomi campbell 's fashion for relief catwalk show , which she describes as ' a once in a lifetime opportunity ' explaining the inspiration behind the show 's name , katie said : ' it 's called confidence-the secret because confidence is something you can use to express yourself and convey yourself and it 's something i 've used through several periods of my life
' it 's not about trying to look and be perfect , it 's about a positive mindset and being the best version of yourself that you can possibly be
' katie , who penned several positive affirmation books during her recovery , says an optimistic outlook is one of her secrets to success
' i ca n't express how important positive thinking is , ' she said
' when i was recovering from my attack , i would write lots of little powerful notes and stick them around the room
before i walk onto the red carpet , i have a mantra and always repeat to myself " inhale confidence , exhale doubt " ; it really is so powerful
' it 's all about looking at what you do have and not what you do n't
' katie , who was left with severe scarring after being attacked in 2008 , says that despite what people may think , her height is her insecurity and she would love to be a little taller katie heeded her own advice recently when she took to the runway for naomi campbell 's fashion for relief catwalk show , which she describes as ' a once in a lifetime opportunity '
