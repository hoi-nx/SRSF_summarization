leeds did it under don revie ; sir alex ferguson âs manchester united side did it ; atletico madrid under diego simeone do it
many great sides have hounded and harassed referees over the years
it âs a characteristic at times of their determination to win and their unity
so when chelsea surrounded referee bjorn kuipers to get zlatan ibrahimovic sent off on wednesday it was nât something new , or a modern phenomenon that has been creeping up on us
it has nothing to do with foreign players and managers coming into the game
it âs been a part of english football for years
having said that , now is the time to draw a line and punish teams that overstep the mark in this way , as i believe chelsea did on wednesday and i think it could be done with a simple amendment to the rules
almost all the chelsea squad surrounded referee bjorn kuipers after an incident at stamford bridge if a referee feels that he is being aggressively hounded by a group of players he should have the power to reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way
so on wednesday night , he could still have sent off zlatan ibrahimovic if he really felt it was a red card offence but chelsea would have lost the advantage of a free kick
it would nât immediately cut out hounding refs but it would be a nudge in the right direction
behaviour only changes if managers are encouraged to discipline their players
at the moment , it âs worthwhile clamouring round a referee to get a decision , so few coaches would discourage their players from doing so
however , if you felt that by hounding the referee , your team might lose a potential goal - scoring opportunity , because you would miss out on a free kick on the edge of the box , managers would soon start telling their players to exercise more restraint
and over-zealous appealing for penalties would stop pretty quickly
imagine losing the chance to take a penalty kick because you had surrounded the referee
the manager would be furious
bjorn kuipers might have looked at the zlatan ibrahimovic tackle and thought it was a 50 - 50 decision
but when you have 38,000 people screaming for the red card and then you have a group of players around demanding it too , all of that activity around him might make him feel it âs a 90 per cent decision
this tackle from psg striker zlatan ibrahimovic sparked a furious reaction from chelsea players the chelsea players surround referee bjorn kuipers at stamford bridge as he brandishes the red card chelsea captain john terry ( left ) reacts after zlatan ibrahimovic 's tackle on oscar in the first - half this would only be a small change in the rules but i believe it would make a massive change in behaviour over time
certainly managers would nât encourage their team to attempt to influence the referee in that way anymore because there would be an immediate punishment which could cost the team
it gives the referee a little bit more power and it would act as powerful disincentive
you could also apply the same rule of reversing the free kick if a player showed an imaginary card , trying to get an opponent booked or sent off
that would soon end what is an unsavoury practice
another area which needs looking at is when a player marches towards a referee in an aggressive manner , forcing the referee to back off
it âs natural for players to complain when they feel aggrieved and when emotions are running high
but what is important is that we establish that exclusion zone around the referee where players wo nât encroach
if someone is to complain , they can do so backing away from the referee , getting into position , not moving towards him
and if someone does need to go to referee , it should only be the captain
and when complaining they should show some respect for the personal space of the referee
john terry ( centre ) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following zlatan ibrahimovic 's first - half challenge football is a physical game and that is part of its spectacle
i âve no desire to curb the aggression of players when it âs directed in the right way
but referees need to be protected and their personal space needs to be almost sacrosanct
it âs important to draw a line and clearly state what is and is nât acceptable
when friday comes , english teams can feel benefit in europe it has been an awful few weeks for english teams in europe with only everton thriving in the europa league
given the competitiveness of the premier league you would imagine that our teams would be more than ready for this stage of the champions league and europa league , when the competitions step up a level
but the reverse seems to happening
the sheer competitiveness of the premier league is leaving us short in these difficult games
not only do we tend to have four teams who believe they can win the title , which is not the case in most of europe âs other major leagues , but there is an increased level of intensity about all our games
everton are progressing well in the europa league as other english sides continue to struggle in europe having played in france , i know that for psg , marseille and lyon there will only be a handful of games for which they need to be at their best
it âs not that it âs easy but going to the smaller france teams is not like going to turf moor to play burnley or loftus road to play qpr , where the crowd is right on top of you and everyone is expecting the home side to put one over chelsea or manchester united
that âs not the case in france , and i âm not sure it is in italy or spanish
obviously bayern are utterly dominant in germany at the moment , so there are nât that many games where they need to be at the top level
do nât forget that while our teams were playing five games in two weeks over christmas , bayern , borussia dortmund and schalke were on a 40 - day break
arsenal endured a torrid champions league 3 - 0 defeat against monaco late last month and while the christmas break is nât as long in france , italy and spanish , it allows their players to relax get a couple of weeks in the sun. it âs ironic that the intensity and competitiveness of the premier league , which is what has made it so successful , might now be damaging our performance in europe and by extension damaging it âs reputation
however , there is an opportunity now to help english team in the champions league
jose mourinho has long drawn attention to spanish teams playing games on a friday night if they have a tuesday night champions league game
the new Â£ 5.1billion tv deal â a mark of how popular the premier league is â has provision for some friday night games
the premier league and tv companies should be looking at those friday night games to see whether they can schedule teams competing in the champions league
we need to give our teams every chance we can
after all , if premier league clubs consistently fail in europe , global audiences will begin to question just how good these clubs really are
liverpool manager brendan rodgers ' side crashed of the europa league to besiktas in late february great to look back at my career i was really honoured a few months ago when sky sports asked if i would be the subject of a documentary covering my life in football
the result will be shown tonight on sky sports and it âs been a trip down memory lane for me and a chance to reflect on my career
there are one or two things i had nât remembered , like the post-match interview i did after scoring on my league debut as an 18 - year - old against stoke in 1976
the collars on the shirt i was wearing â oh my word ! they look like something barry white might have turned down as excessive
glenn hoddle volleys in for tottenham against manchester united in 1979 , his favourite goal he scored and i âm pleased to say my top of the pops appearance singing diamond lights gets an outing â not that any of the musicians will be
it also gave me a chance to take another look at my favourite goal , the volley i scored for tottenham against manchester united from just inside the box in 1979
i âve never taken drugs in my life but the feeling i had that day , with the adrenalin pumping through my body after scoring , is how i imagine it feels
i hope people enjoy watching the film as much as i did making it
