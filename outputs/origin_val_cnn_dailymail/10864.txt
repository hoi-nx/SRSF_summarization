ten million people may have watched carls jr. superbowl ad featuring a seemingly naked model and their new ' all natural ' burger - but it did n't make them want to take a bite
advertising research firm ameritest found that , although the ad featuring model charlotte mckinney went viral , it failed to help sell burgers and even offended potential customers
ameritest , which has tested thousands of ads for the industry and conducted the carls jr. report for research purposes , found that only 27 per cent of the study 's viewers planned to visit the fast food chain in 30 days after watching the superbowl spot
the study also found that 52 per cent of viewers found the ad offensive and 51 per cent found it irritating and annoying
the commercial features mckinney walking through a farmer 's market , where she appears to be in the nude as suggestively placed melons and tomatoes cover her
' i love going all natural , it just makes me feel better , mckinney says
the model is then revealed to be wearing a beige - colored bikini , as viewers find out what she was really talking about was an all - natural carls jr. burger - which she takes a big bite of
ameritest found that 52 per cent of viewers found the ad offensive and 51 per cent found it irritating and annoying only 27 per cent of the study 's viewers planned to visit the fast food chain in 30 days after watching the ad , compared to 43 per cent who have answered yes to the same question for other restaurants ' commercials according to the survey , thirty - two per cent of viewers felt worse about the restaurant after seeing the ad , a 24 per cent increase compared to how they felt after watching an average fast - food ad
a spokeswoman for cke restaurants , which owns carls jr. , said the ameritest study was ' not consistent ' with the fast food company 's ' sales results '
' sales for the all-natural burger reached a new high the week of the superbowl broadcast , ' she said
but scott , ameritest 's senior brand consultant , credits carls jr. 's sales with the fact that the restaurant offered $ 1 coupons for an all-natural burger combo
scott said the ad does ' nothing for the brand long - term '
a spokeswoman said the study was ' not consistent ' with carls jr. 's ' sales results ' , but ameritest attributes the fast food company 's sales with the fact that it offered $ 1 coupons for an all-natural burger combo
