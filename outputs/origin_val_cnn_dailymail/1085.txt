englishman 's fisher faces a completely different challenge as he looks to successfully defend a european tour title for the first time in his career in this week 's tshwane open
fisher ended a four - year victory drought with his win 12 months ago at the els club at copperleaf , which , at 7,964 yards , was the longest course in european tour history
this year the tournament , which is the sixth and final event co-sanctioned with the sunshine tour this season , has been switched to pretoria country club , which measures 7,063 yards and has had the par - five fourth and 18th holes reduced to par fours , making it a par 70
fisher says it will be tough for him at the tshwane open this year but that he is looking forward to it the englishman plays a shot during a practice round at the pretoria country club fisher poses with the trophy last year ' it 's a lot shorter and a lot more fiddly , ' said fisher of the course , which was redesigned in 2004 by gary player , who calls it a ' hidden gem '
' there will be a lot of positional play off the tee , a lot of irons and not many drivers
' it 's an adaptation that we have to make as players
we do n't generally play these types of golf courses
' it 's very different and i would prefer to be on a long golf course that 's quite tight , because driving is my strength
' it 's going to be different this week
your wedges will have to be sharp and you 're going to have to get a hot putter , because i can imagine the scoring will be pretty good with some quality players here this week
' i 'm looking forward to the challenge and hopefully the game can live up to that
' compatriot andy sullivan missed the cut in the africa open last week but is looking for his third win in south africa in the space of 10 weeks , while home favourite coetzee has the benefit of local knowledge
pretoria native coetzee has been a member of the club since he took up the sport and won his first tournament here at the age of 10
' i did n't build my game at this golf course , ' coetzee said
' i putted well to shoot good scores here , but it 's a drawer 's golf course
there is a lot of risk and reward and on a lot of holes you can take it on
' there are some advantages to knowing the course as well as i do , but it suits a certain type of golfer
hopefully i make enough putts to make up for that
andy sullivan is looking for his third win in south africa in the space of 10 weeks ' i guess there 's probably a little bit of extra pressure but hopefully i will thrive on it this week
' i 've got a couple of tricks that i know the course likes to throw at you and hopefully i 'll use them to my advantage
' compatriot fisher jnr comes into the event on the back of winning his first european tour title at east london last week , a win which proved highly popular
' it 's been overwhelming , ' fisher jnr said
' all the messages and support , it 's something special
i 'm still busy soaking it in and looking forward to this week as well
