then the sounds of a commercial jetliner slamming into the mountainside
that much is known about the final few minutes for the 144 passengers on germanwings 9525
beyond that , it 's a matter of imagination and speculation -- about what they saw and what they felt as their plane approached and then crashed into the alps
none of them can speak for themselves , nor can any of the flight 's six crew members
but authorities have given some clues , based on what investigators know about the aircraft 's trajectory and what they 've heard on a mangled cockpit voice recorder recovered at the crash site
it all began on what seemed like most any other tuesday as citizens of 18 countries packed into the germanwings plane in barcelona , spain
the passengers came from all walks of life , using lufthansa 's low - cost carrier to get to dusseldorf , germany
they were high school students , heading home after a week in spain
they were parents and children enjoying their vacation
there were businessmen , scouting out store locations
there was a 26 - minute delay before takeoff because air traffic controllers did n't give the ok to start the plane 's engines earlier and there was a small wait in the takeoff rotation , according to lufthansa
for any frequent flier , that kind of delay is nothing abnormal
nor , it seems , was takeoff
the airbus a320 left and headed northeast at 10:01 a.m. ( 5:01 a.m. et ) on what should have been a 726 - mile journey
the plane leveled off at 38,000 feet , its cruising altitude
by this point , passengers would be ok to unbuckle , head to the restroom or get their bags out of the overhead bin
a seemingly innocuous act changed everything : the aircraft 's pilot had to use the restroom , according to lufthansa ceo carsten spohr , telling the co-pilot that he was stepping out
it 's possible that passengers saw the captain in the cabin , going to or from the restroom
they also could have noticed that the aircraft was going down -- even though they were about a half - hour into a nearly two - hour flight , with the alps ahead of them
the passengers could n't have known it , but the co-pilot -- identified as 28 - year - old andreas lubitz -- " manipulated the buttons of the flight monitoring system to activate the descent of the aircraft " while the pilot was out , marseille prosecutor robin said thursday
this was around 10:45 a.m. it was n't like the plane suddenly jerked down , plunging straight into the ground
authorities described a steady descent at a rate of about 3,000 to 3,500 feet ( or roughly 1,000 meters ) per minute
still , it is the kind of descent you 'd expect while nearing an airport -- not traversing the alps
if passengers did n't notice that fall , they might have caught wind of what was happening at the front of the plane
students , singers among the victims inside the cockpit , the only sound was that of andreas lubitz breathing steadily
but outside the cockpit , the noises apparently grew louder and more frantic
the pilot tried to open the door but could n't get in
he likely knocked on the door
he used a video conference system to talk to the co-pilot , robin said
nor did his last - ditch attempt , as recounted by a senior french military official involved in the crash investigation to the new york times
" you can hear he is trying to smash the door down , " the official said
did the passengers hear this commotion upfront ? it 's hard to imagine they did n't
and if that was n't reason enough to cause worry , they just had to look outside -- at the mountain chain that should have been far below them instead of getting closer and closer and closer
the voice recorder did n't indicate any abnormal noise in the cabin until the final few moments
still , even if the passengers did n't know it at the time , all it took was eight minutes for a seemingly normal flight to become a nightmare
the nightmare ended in a violent crash into rugged , remote terrain
so did the screams and the lives of all 150 people on flight 9525 -- a death that robin described as " instantaneous
" who was co-pilot andreas lubitz ?
