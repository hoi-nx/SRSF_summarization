pacquiao 's preparations for the biggest fight of his career against floyd mayweather jnr have been disrupted by his opponent 's manager / adviser , claims trainer roach
pacquiao took to instagram on thursday to post the latest video of him at work from his los angeles training camp , as his $ 300million bout at the mgm grand in las vegas draws closer on may 2
however , roach has accused haymon - who works with mayweather - as attempting to sabotage their sparring selections ahead of the fight
the cleveland - born haymon initially made his fortune in music by promoting such acts as mc hammer , whitney houston and the oâjays before venturing into boxing
a business administration graduate , his biggest client is floyd mayweather jnr - who he helped leave top rank promotions
as well as mayweather his elite 150 - fighter stable also includes britain 's amir khan , deontay wilder and julio cesar chavez - a man carl froch is keen to fight
the 55 - year - old claims that they have had several chosen sparring partners , who have a similar fighting style to mayweather , decline their offer to train with their camp because haymon 's team have offered them more more money to stay at home - in attempt to derail their preparations
' i 'm hiring sparring partners , haymon 's people calls them up and offers more money for them not to come
[ but ] i 'm not worried about those guys , ' roach told abs-cbn news
' we got four really good sparring partners for pacquiao for this fight , mayweather look - alikes
' we started our game plan five years ago but we changed it a little bit
definitely there will be some adjustments
i 'm confident that we 'll win the fight and this will be the biggest fight night of all our lives
' the guy is undefeated , he 's a very good boxer and he 's the most talented fighter we 'll ever face
he 's tricky also ... he 's intelligent as a fighter
i believe we need to fight the perfect fight
