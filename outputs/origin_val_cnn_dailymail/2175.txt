they may look like they are from different families , but believe it or not jayden and xavier are actually twins
the adorable 11 - year - old boys , who hail from auckland in new zealand , were born with contrasting skin tones - jayden has a dark complexion and xavier is white
and as if questions over the colour of their skin was n't enough for the young fellas , they also have the added complication of having different birthdays - with jayden being born on november 6 and xavier coming into the world after midnight , making his birthday november 7
their mother , helen castles , 32
brings the dark skin to the family , which she inherited from her grandmother , who is samoan
their father is the complete opposite - phil boughey , 36 , has a white complexion and fair hair
when the pair found out they were expecting twins , they wondered how their children would look , but could never could have dreamed of the conclusion
' we were surprised for sure - the running joke is because they were made in the bahamas that helen castles had the local bohemian milkman stop by one day when i was at work to make the brown one , ' their dad phil boughey told daily mail australia
' but we do n't really see it as a huge deal they just look different like any siblings can
' their parents joke that because the boys were conceived in the bahamas the local milkman dropped by to make the ' brown one ' xavier ( left ) is carefree and jayden ( right ) is responsible and as the oldest of the two is a born leader now the boys have just started a new school , sacred heart , and are tasked with the unenviable challenge of trying to explain to their peers that they are related
' they do get a lot of people believing they are not twins especially school kids , ' he said
' we make sure they are in different classes at school too because jayden is the stronger one and xavier will just sit back and ride on the coat tails of jayden - so we have had to pull him out of the clouds
' the odds of a mixed race couple having twins of different colours are a million to one
skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together
if a parent is of mixed race , their eggs or sperm will contain a mixture of genetic codes for both black and white skin
however , if both the egg and sperm contain all white genes , the baby will be white
and if both contain just the versions necessary for black skin , the baby will be black
but the boys embrace the attention they get for looking so different
' they think it 's perfect - they think it 's great because they are twins but they are individual and celebrate different birthdays , ' their proud dad said sometimes xavier gets jealous of his brother 's bronze skin
' we went out fishing in the boat the other day and xavier and i had to put sunscreen on while jayden just lay there with his shirt off getting tanned without any sunblock , ' he said
according to their father , the boys have contrasting personalties but do have a strong twin bond
' they are best friends and always will be , ' he said
' xavier has a very dry sense of humour whereas jayden is more outgoing and takes the lead as the older boy , ' he said
' whenever i 'm away for work he will always be responsible and make sure the house is locked up whereas xavier is carefree and relaxed
' xavier ( left ) gets jealous of his brother 's bronze skin because he does n't have to wear sunscreen - pictured with their mum helen castles and her father pat castles the boys are in different classes so xavier ( right ) does n't ride on the coat tails of his older brother by a day lucy and maria aylmer , 18 , from gloucester are non-identical twins their story comes after a pair of 18 - year - old girls , from gloucester , who were born with radically different colouring thanks to mixed - race parentage , revealed how they constantly have to explain their looks to curious strangers
lucy and maria aylmer , who looks completely different told itv 's good morning britain that their classmates did not believe them when they told them they were twins
their mother donna is half jamaican and their father vince is white , and in a genetic quirk , together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin .
