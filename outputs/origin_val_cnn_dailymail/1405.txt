' mr matt trotter thinks he knows just what to look for when looking for the ideal chocolate egg
he said : ' when testing , i always look for a creamy flavour in milk chocolate and a bold intense cocoa flavour with dark chocolate , but both must have a good snap ! ' to benchmark our products , i 'll taste at least 50 easter eggs at a time to make sure we score the best
' and the chocolate tasting does n't stop after easter
' i look after all the seasonal periods such as christmas and halloween , tasting chocolates , sweeties , jellies and mallows in all shapes , sizes and flavours for up to eight hours a day , taking inspiration from countries all over the world to bring exciting new products into our ranges , ' he said

who knows , maybe next year we 'll get one on the shelves ? '
