zeke was born at the gladys porter zoo in brownsville , texas , before being transferred to his new home
he is currently in quarantine at cincinnati zoo âs nursery to ensure he is healthy before being introduced to the other animals
he will eventually be part of the park 's cat ambassador program which allows visitors - by special arrangement - to see some of the cats up - close and without bars
