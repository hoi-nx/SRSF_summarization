but his artwork also includes unflattering watercolours of overweight and greedy guards

now , his story and sketches have been made available for the first time , 100 years on
they have been made available for free online as part of the soldiers ' stories series on the national army museum 's commemorative portal , first world war in focus
a spokesperson for the national army museum said : ' reginald bond spent over six months observing both his fellow prisoners and his captors
' he recorded them in a series of brilliantly preserved watercolours and sketches , providing a unique insight into daily life in captivity
reginald bond was commissioned into the king 's own yorkshire light infantry at the age of 22 and was 48 when war broke out in 1914
above , his pencil sketch , a britain officer in his hut at magdeburg camp at the outbreak of the first world war , the army was , unlike forces fielded by many other nations , composed exclusively of volunteers and was much smaller than its france and germany counterparts
as fighting began in europe , britain could boast only a relatively small force of 400,000 soldiers - over half of which were posted around the world to garrison the empire
the first army sent to the western front was known as the old contemptibles , which was formed for service in france and became known as the old contemptibles
by the end of 1914 â after the battles of battle of mons , the le cateau , the aisne and ypres â the old regular army had been wiped out , although it managed to help stop the germany advance , and more men were needed
that marked the beginning of the famous recruitment drive fronted by general kitchener which in 1914 â 1915 assembled the volunteers destined to go into action at the battle of the somme
conscription was only introduced in 1916 and , by the end of 1918 , the army had reached its maximum strength of 4,000,000 men and could field over 70 divisions , many of which were drawn from colonies like india
' hundreds of miles away from the action of the trenches , officers - unlike ordinary soldiers - were not required to engage in manual labour for their captors , and often found themselves with endless hours of free time to occupy
' such personal accounts are being unveiled each month on the soldiers ' stories series
' they piece together the development of the war from the point of view of those directly involved - 100 years from the time that they describe
' we hope that in sharing these personal stories , the human scale and impact of the great war can be better felt and understood
