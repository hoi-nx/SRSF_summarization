solitary : steve fuller has worked as the winter caretaker of yellowstone since 1973 steve fuller has lived in new york , san francisco and london , but the place he decided to settle down is about the opposite of any booming metropolis
for the past 42 years , steve fuller has worked as the caretaker of yellowstone , protecting the park 's buildings during the long and brutal winter months
he lives in a small cabin alone during the winter , with enough food stored up since his closest neighbors are a two - hour snowmobile ride away
it sounds like the premise of stephen king 's thriller the shining , but steve fuller claims he 's never felt lonely or the least bit antsy cooped up alone in his cabin
' never had cabin fever
never been bored , ' the 70 - something outdoorsman told cbs
that 's because there 's plenty of work to keep steve fuller busy
winter preparation starts in november , when he works with a crew to board up his share of the parks about 100 buildings
then , once everyone is gone , he waits for the snow to come - and it never disappoints
yellowstone averages about 150 inches of snowfall a year and steve fuller has to stop it from accumulating on the roofs of the park 's buildings , which can collapse under the weight of the snow
over the years , steve fuller has developed a system which takes some of the hassle out of shoveling the roofs
instead , he uses a saw to cut the snow into blocks which he then pushes off the roof with the help of gravity
steve fuller has been doing the job since 1973 , when he was the only applicant and the pay was just $ 13.24 a day
over the years , steve fuller 's responsibilities have grown and now he is one of the only yellowstone staffers who work at the park year round
but he says he never gets lonely tough work : during the day , steve fuller works to keep about 100 buildings free from snow , since they can collapse under the several feet that accumulate every year
he has developed a method of sawing the snow into blocks and pushing them off the roof , which makes the job a little easier the cold months : the winter care - taking job starts at the beginning of november and ends whenever plows can reach the park

he packs it with just enough food to last the winter while most caretakers only last a few years in the job , steve fuller continues because he 's comfortable with the solitude and has the right interests to make the job fun
amazingly , steve fuller has no tv in his small cabin , which he estimates is about 100 years old
instead , he gets his news by tuning into wyoming public radio and entertains himself with his vast library of books
he also spends a lot of time outside cross-country skiing and taking pictures of the winter landscape
many of his pictures of the frozen - over park have been featured in national geographic
' i 've seen many wonderful things here , ' he said
' occasionally get a picture of them
but a lot of the great pictures are in my head , you know , that you could n't quite pull it off with a camera
' in 1978 , he illustrated his own story for the magazine about raising his two daughters at the park
avid reader : steve fuller has no tv
instead , he reads for entertainment and has a vast library technology : steve fuller is able to connect to the outside world with a computer
he gets his news from listening to the radio far from civilization : steve fuller 's closest neighbors are about a two - hour snowmobile ride away during the winter , he and ex-wife angela home - schooled the two girls , which they were suited to with his bachelor 's degree in history and her master 's in education
his daughters are grown now and steve fuller has since broken up with his wife , but they made plenty of memories during their winters together in yellowstone
in 1973 , a female grizzly bear broke a window into their kitchen while angela was cooking a pot of stew for dinner
the sow reached in and grabbed the pot and luckily took off with the meal instead of sticking around
' the next morning i found the pot behind the house , licked shiny clean , ' steve fuller said in his national geographic piece
beautiful scenery : steve fuller is also a gifted photographer , and many of his pictures of the snowy yellowstone landscape have been featured in national geographic all to himself : above , steve fuller is seen walking near the park 's legendary geysers , which three million people flock to see every year he had iron bars installed on the windows to protect from any future run - ins with the local wildlife
steve fuller says there 's no set schedule in place for when the care - taking season ends
it 's over when the plows can reach him
' this job has never been by the calendar or by the clock , ' steve fuller said
' you work with the winter
' in the warmer months , steve fuller gets some much - needed sun and travels to african where he spends every april on safari
before be became caretaker at yellowstone , steve fuller spent three years living in uganda and kenya teaching and it was during that time that he first became interested in the quieter life
' it changed my life , ' he said of his time in the african bush , ' and that 's what brought me here
' with his older age , steve fuller says he 's considered retirement , but does n't seem to have taken the prospect too seriously
' i think of it
they say a lot of people die when they retire , you know ? ' he said
however , he does think his way of life may be coming to an end , as transportation in and out the park during the winter months gets easier .
