few would be surprised if noel meade 's love affair with the festival had turned sour and he had filed for divorce long ago
four wins are outnumbered by a list of defeats , some of them crushing
but if you have to feel real pain to truly appreciate ultimate happiness , the co meath trainer could experience a legal high to catapult him over the grandstand if road to riches wins the gold cup on friday
road to riches ( right ) , ridden by bryan cooper , jumps the last to win the lexus in december trainer noel meade has high hopes for road to riches in the gold cup the winner of the lexus chase , who will be ridden by bryan cooper , is one of 18 remaining
he may have lost his place as shortest - priced irish contender â that now is well - backed willie mullins - trained djakadam - but noel meade 's hope is arguably the form horse from across the water
few would have even dreamt of a gold cup challenge when the eight - year - old landed the galway plate in august
back then he was a promising gelding beginning to bounce back from a disappointing slump thanks to a change in his diet and work routine
his only defeat since â behind sizing europe over two and a half miles at gowran park in october â came in a race that had not been on his original schedule and was a mistaken afterthought
when the gelding , owned by ryanair boss michael o'leary , landed the lexus chase at leopardstown over christmas , defeating 2014 gold cup runner - up on his own and ap mccoy 's gold cup mount carlingford lough , hopes were raised that noel meade might finally secure the feature festival prize he craves

he said : ' anyone who trains a jumping horse wants to win the gold cup
i would rather win one gold cup than 10 grand nationals
to me that is just an ordinary race compared to the gold cup
' the gold cup and the champion hurdle , they are the two cherries
' the latter race was a ' cherry ' that was picked out of noel meade 's back pocket in 2005 when harchibald cruised up to hardy eustace with long - time jockey ally paul carberry sitting motionless
it looked done and dusted until , in a dramatic final 50 yards , the rallying reigning champion trained by the late dessie got his head back in front
it was a result as tough to take for noel meade as the short - head 1998 arkle chase defeat of hill society by martin 's champleve when he was still searching for his first festival winner
noel meade - trained harbour pilot ( right ) twice finished third behind best mate in the gold cup harchibald 's ( left ) capitulation to hardy eustace in the 2005 champio hurdle was hard to take for noel meade noel meade said : ' harchie was the one that hurt the most
he was going to win and then did n't
i was watching with dessie and he was nearly congratulating me
he had his hand on my shoulder and then , the next moment , it was just like someone had pulled a trap door from underneath me
' hill society was also tough
martin came over and said i am sure you have won but , luckily , richard dunwoody had ridden mine and said he thought we were beat
but the photo - finish went on for so long
' when they called the result , i walked straight out and went back to the car park
' i talked to the attendant for half an hour about the joys of parking cars at festival
it just me got away from the whole thing
' the disappointments meant noel meade became used to a familiar refrain before each festival
the trainer said : ' the same thing would start
' noel meade has never had a winner ' and at festival previews some fella in the audience would start getting on to you
you 'd say it did n't bother you but of course it did
' noel meade finally scored a festival winner with sausalito bay 's victory in the 2000 novice 's hurdle when sausalito bay finally cracked the festival for noel meade , he knelt down and kissed the turf in the winner 's enclosure that had eluded him it is where he would love to be again and the trainer , who was hit hard by the recession , seeing his string half in number from a high of 150 horses , reckons he is bringing one of his strongest ever teams
there is wounded warrior in monday 's national hunt chase , very wood , winner of last year 's albert bartlett novices ' hurdle , in wednesday 's rsa chase and apache stronghold , the ' big white hope ' and rated a future gold cup contender , in thursday 's jlt novices ' chase
but it is gold cup that noel meade seeks most and he reckons he might be on the right road
' favourite silviniaco conti is the form horse but i do n't think there is an awful lot between the irish , ' he said
' my horse lost his way as a novice but we always thought stamina would be his forte and no horse was staying on better in the lexus
