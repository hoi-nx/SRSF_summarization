a brave transgender teenager came out in front of his entire class
tom , 13 , of fresno , california , first read the suicide note written by leelah alcorn , another tragic teen who took her own life at the end of last year
he then told the students ; ' i am no longer mia
i never really was ' tom ( above with glee star lauren potter ) when he was mia the middle school student then said ; ' and now i finally stand before you in my true and authentic gender identity as tom
i stand before you as a 13 - year - old boy
' tom then detailed his struggle over the past few years , and what it took to bring him to the moment where he made this announcement
he eloquently explained his challenges , saying ; ' for a while , i dismissed the fact that i hated my body
i pretended to be content with what i was assigned until , at a certain point , i broke
' tom began his speech by reading the tragic suicide note of leelah alcorn ( above ) he then added ; ' i went through a series of horrible breakdowns
and i would stand under the water in the shower crying
i knew i was n't happy
' he also took some time to let other students know if they were struggling with their sexual identity or orientation , he was there for them
' i want you to know that if no one else accepts you , i always will , ' he said
if you are reading this , it means that i have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue
please do n't be sad , it 's for the better
the life i would 've lived is n't worth living in â¦ because i 'm transgender
i could go into detail explaining why i feel that way , but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is
to put it simply , i feel like a girl trapped in a boy 's body , and i 've felt that way ever since i was 4
i never knew there was a word for that feeling , nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl , so i never told anyone and i just continued to do traditionally ' boyish ' things to try to fit in
when i was 14 , i learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness
after 10 years of confusion i finally understood who i was
i immediately told my mom , and she reacted extremely negatively , telling me that it was a phase , that i would never truly be a girl , that god does n't make mistakes , that i am wrong
if you are reading this , parents , please do n't tell this to your kids
even if you are christians or are against transgender people do n't ever say that to someone , especially your kid
that wo n't do anything but make them hate them self
that 's exactly what it did to me
my mom started taking me to a therapist , but would only take me to christian therapists , ( who were all very biased ) so i never actually got the therapy i needed to cure me of my depression
i only got more christians telling me that i was selfish and wrong and that i should look to god for help
when i was 16 i realized that my parents would never come around , and that i would have to wait until i was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment , which absolutely broke my heart
the longer you wait , the harder it is to transition
i felt hopeless , that i was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life
on my 16th birthday , when i did n't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning , i cried myself to sleep
i formed a sort of a ' f * * * you ' attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school , thinking that maybe if i eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock
although the reaction from my friends was positive , my parents were pissed
they felt like i was attacking their image , and that i was an embarrassment to them
they wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy , and that 's obviously not what i wanted
so they took me out of public school , took away my laptop and phone , and forbid me of getting on any sort of social media , completely isolating me from my friends
this was probably the part of my life when i was the most depressed , and i 'm surprised i did n't kill myself
i was completely alone for 5 months
no friends , no support , no love
just my parent 's disappointment and the cruelty of loneliness
at the end of the school year , my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media
i was excited , i finally had my friends back
they were extremely excited to see me and talk to me , but only at first
eventually they realized they did n't actually give a s * * t about me , and i felt even lonelier than i did before
the only friends i thought i had only liked me because they saw me five times a week
after a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college , save money for moving out , keep my grades up , go to church each week and feel like s * * t because everyone there is against everything i live for , i have decided i 've had enough
i 'm never going to transition successfully , even when i move out
i 'm never going to be happy with the way i look or sound
i 'm never going to have enough friends to satisfy me
i 'm never going to have enough love to satisfy me
i 'm never going to find a man who loves me
i 'm never going to be happy
either i live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or i live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself
there 's no way out
i 'm sad enough already , i do n't need my life to get any worse
people say ' it gets better ' but that is n't true in my case
each day i get worse
that 's the gist of it , that 's why i feel like killing myself
sorry if that 's not a good enough reason for you , it 's good enough for me
as for my will , i want 100 % of the things that i legally own to be sold and the money ( plus my money in the bank ) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups , i do n't give a s * * t which one
the only way i will rest in peace is if one day transgender people are n't treated the way i was , they 're treated like humans , with valid feelings and human rights
gender needs to be taught about in schools , the earlier the better
my death needs to mean something
my death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year
i want someone to look at that number and say ' that 's f * * * ed up ' and fix it
goodbye , ( leelah alcorn ) josh alcorn
