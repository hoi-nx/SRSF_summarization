it 's no secret that supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg has a young , liberal fanbase that shows its devotion in distinctly millennial ways
her positions on wage parity , same - sex marriage and women 's rights ( to name a few ) have earned her the nickname " the notorious r.b.g. " thanks to a tumblr of the same name dedicated to her
there are tattoos , muscle tees and youtube serenades paying homage to the soft - spoken justice , who has been on the nation 's highest bench for 21 years -- longer than some of her followers have been alive
so it seems appropriate that her fans would celebrate her 82nd with social media memes , the internet 's favorite tool for honoring / mocking public figures
here are some of the tributes wishing ruth bader ginsburg a # notoriousbday
