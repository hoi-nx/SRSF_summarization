actress meili cady was just a small - town girl aspiring to be an actress in los angeles , but was lured into a life of crime by ' pot princess ' and alleged samsung heiress lisette lee , she claims in her new book
meili cady , who appeared in californication and chick magnet , said she became enchanted with the extravagant lifestyle of lee - but she realized too late when she was taken into custody by dea agents that she was apart of lee 's illegal smuggling operation into the midwest
the book , smoke : how a small-town girl accidentally wound up smuggling seven tons of marijuana with the pot princess of beverly hills , tells of how it all came raining down on meili cady when she learned that lee was transporting 500 pounds of marijuana , according to the new york daily news
but she realized too late when she was taken into custody by dea agents in connection to lee 's illegal smuggling of weed into the midwest on a day in june 2010 , the private jet her best friend had leased headed for columbus , ohio had 13 suitcases filled with weed
and as lee 's personal assistant , she never knew the reality behind the glamorous life of the ' gangster princess ' , as named by the rolling stone , was closely entangled in a web of lies and manipulation that would leave her facing 40 years in prison
it was estimated that during 14 trips made to ohio , lee had transported 7,000 pounds of pot and made a profit of $ 3million
lee was sentenced to six years , while meili cady received 30 days in custody and one year of home confinement after making a deal with prosecutors
it all began when she left washington state at 19 years old and headed for california where she worked part - time jobs to support herself and pursued her dreams by enrolling for classes at an acting studio
a friend from the studio introduced her to lee , an aspiring korean pop star who dropped out of harvard and called herself the ' korean paris hilton ' , and though meili cady was hesitant to befriend an heiress who had to seek friends , she was lonely
and as lee 's personal assistant , she never knew the reality behind the glamorous life of the ' gangster princess ' , as named by the rolling stone , was closely entangled in a web of lies and manipulation that would leave her facing 40 years in prison ( above lee , left , with meili cady , right ) lee ( left ) was sentenced to six years , while meili cady ( right ) received 30 days in custody and one year of home confinement after making a deal with prosecutors
it was estimated that during 14 trips made to ohio , lee had transported 7,000 pounds of pot and made a profit of $ 3million ( above the 13 suitcases filled with marijuana ) following her release from prison , she spent a year under house arrest and was forced to wear an ankle monitor while confined in her apartment lee 's japanese father was a big player at sony and her korean mother was the granddaughter of the founder of samsung - so the luxury condo she lived in along with the purple mercedes all made sense to meili cady
and when she was struggling financially , lee offered her a job as personal assistant , as she needed the help while ' embarking on a new business venture '
while lee was vague on the details , meili cady took the job with her first assignment pretending to be a wealthy diva who was particular about the way her luggage was loaded onto the plane at the van nuys airport in california
meili cady learned later that she was risking arrest for lee who feared it , as she was sent on the drug - smuggling flight in her place
but on her fourth flight , when meili cady ( above ) complained about the smell of marijuana in the cabin , she finally understood that luggage was actually filled with drugs - and that she was an accessory in a major criminal operation but she nearly made a fatal mistake after offering to help with the suitcases on her second flight , which she was scolded for by lee
this along with other jobs including making large wire transfers under her own name left her confused about her role as lee 's personal assistant
on her fourth flight , when she complained about the smell of marijuana in the cabin , she finally understood that luggage was actually filled with drugs - and that she was an accessory in a major criminal operation
in the book , which is out on march 24 , meili cady revealed that even though the truth came out , she remained silent and was arrested along with lee in columbus by federal agents in 2010
in the end , during the trial , meili cady learned the truth-lee had been fostered as a small child , and was the illegitimate daughter of a samsung heiress and a japanese father who owned casinos
film director craig brewer , a sundance winner for 2005 film hustle and flow , is considering making a movie based on lee âs life .
