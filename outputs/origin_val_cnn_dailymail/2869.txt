radio presenter jane garvey has revealed she was left â upset â after watching hardcore pornography in preparation for the radio 4 show âs latest debate as the host of woman âs hour , jane garvey has chaired discussions on harrowing topics ranging from rape to domestic abuse
but despite her experience , the presenter has revealed she was left â upset â after watching hours of hardcore pornography in preparation for the radio 4 show âs latest debate
the mother - of - two , 50 , said she may have been â naÃ¯ve â but was shocked by the way women were treated in the explicit clips , with many looking like they were in pain
she also raised concerns that pornography is â no longer limited to the top shelf â as it was in her own childhood but has become easily accessible as â erotica has gone mainstream
â speaking during the debate â can porn empower women ? â , miss jane garvey said : â i have to say i spent an informative hour or so last week watching porn at work
i do nât want to miss call the midwife
â when i watched it last week , if i am really honest with you , i am probably a bit naÃ¯ve and vanilla in my taste , i do nât think upset is too strong a word , but i was upset by the expressions of some of the women
i do not want to watch women in pain
i do nât get why i should be expected to get that
why should i ? â other members of the panel , which included sex workers , defended pornography , claiming that not all porn is the same and that it can empower both men and women
miss jane garvey , who divorced television presenter adrian chiles , 47 , in 2009 , said access to pornography has changed since her childhood and that she worries what impact this could have on society
she said : â when i was a child you might find a school friend âs dad âs copy of playboy in his bedroom and have a blooming good look and be slightly amazed and a bit stunned and a bit baffled if you were me
it was not everywhere and now it is
it was not so easily accessible
surely that has made a difference ? â statistics published by pornographic website pornhub suggest that pornographic influences are having on how people view sex and relationships
since the release of the fifty shades of grey film , the site has seen a spike in searches for explicit videos about â domination â of 55 percent among men and 40 percent among women
psychotherapist susie orbach , 68 , author of books such as fat is a feminist issue and what do women want ? , agreed that what was once seen as pornography is now mainstream
she said : â i think there is porn in every women âs magazine
in vogue and cosmopolitan , we represent girls as if though they are always ready for it
that is a very interesting way of representing femininity and women
what used to be on the top shelf is now in every magazine and it is constructing a different relationship for girls in terms of their own bodies
â since the release of the fifty shades of grey film , pornhub has seen a spike in searches for explicit videos about â domination â of 55 percent among men and 40 percent among women other panellists were keen to defend pornography
blake , 29 , who describes herself as a feminist porn performer , said it is wrong to tar all explicit videos and images with the same brush
miss blake , who runs a website called dreams of spanking and posts pictures on twitter of bare bottoms that have been caned until they are bleeding , said : â porn is not a genre
it is a medium like film or television
saying it is degrading is like saying all of tv is degrading just because you have watched top gear
i would say do nât throw the baby out with the bath water
there is a growing number of feminist porn directors making the porn they want to see
it is a huge business and it is happening now
â i have produced porn for nine years
i have a creative vision that i want to get out there
it gives me body confidence and financial independence
we should not be judging porn on whether it empowers women as capitalism is degrading as you have to exchange your labour for money
â to those who said the internet was to full of pornography that they would rather not see , she replied : â you can scroll past
the internet is like that
the women choose to be there
they would rather be there than washing dishes or cleaning toilets
â however , this was not enough for sex shop founder sam roddick , 43 , who said the modern pornography industry , and the morals it teaches are sex and relationships , is damaging for everyone
she said : â i am worried what is happening now
there is too much profit engineering now
i believe the porn industry is unregulated
this is not just un-powering to women but un-powering to us all
â â as the industry stands i do nât believe it holds women in a safe place
i can make my own home erotica and give it to my friends freely but if there is a mechanism of money behind it lets question it and let âs change it
that is what we need to do
â the debate , which was recorded at the weekend , will be broadcast in an edited version on sunday march 8 to mark international women âs day .
