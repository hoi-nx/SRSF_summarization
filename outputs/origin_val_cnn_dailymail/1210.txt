clinton used her ipad as well as a blackberry handset while she was secretary of state , despite claims she used her own private email server so she would only have to carry one electronic device
mrs clinton , who is a leading candidate for the democratic presidential nomination , is expected to announce her latest run for the white house next month
however , the state department has released four emails to the ap which appear to show mrs clinton mixing personal and professional emails as well as sending correspondence from her ipad
critics claim that mrs clinton used the personal email account so her correspondence could not be subject to the same scrutiny as someone using an authorised government account subject to the freedom of information act
on one occasion , mrs clinton 's adviser abedin at the state department emailed the secretary of state an ap story concerning a drone strike in pakistan
mrs clinton replied with questions about interior home decorations and later apologised for the mistake
she also asked ms abedin whether she was receiving any emails sent from her ipad using her clintonmail address
in one of the email exchanges , mrs clinton expressed her concern over the leak of classified information to the media
she wrote : ' i think this is both dishonorable and dangerous and want to find way to say it
clinton 's spokesman nick merrill said during her time as secretary of state mrs clinton primarily used her ipad to read news clippings
during some of the emails , mrs clinton replied to official mesages with questions about personal items mrs clinton , pictured , is expected to announce her latest bid to run for president next month earlier , mrs clinton said she used her own personal account instead of a government one as it was more convenient
mrs clinton became secretary of state in 2009 - a year before the ipad was launched
at the time she used a blackberry as a mobile email device
she said : ' looking back , it would have been probably , you know , smarter to have used two devices
' already , mrs clinton has admitted to exchanging some 60,000 emails during her four years as part of president obama 's administration
around half of these emails related to personal business , such as the death of her mother , he daughter 's wedding and her own yoga routine
many of these emails have been deleted
although mrs clinton said she did not send any classified material over her personal network and the security of the system was not breached
however , republican trey gowdy , chairman of the house committee investigating the 2012 benghazi attacks said mrs clinton 's use of a personal email account has allowed her to ' clean ' her email server and delete correspondence to the attacks
clinton 's attorney said she had turned over to the state department all work - related emails sent or received during her tenure and it would make no sense to turn over her server , since ' no emails ... reside on the server or on any backup systems associated with the server ' .
