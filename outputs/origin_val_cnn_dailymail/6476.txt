a student was booted off a southwest airlines flight during a stopover because he refused to take off a shirt emblazoned with the f - word
daniel podolsky was flying from dallas to chicago with the budget carrier after attending the south by southwest festival ( south by southwest festival ) festival in austin , texas - and decided to wear a souvenir
he was dressed in a comedy central shirt he was given at the trendy festival , which read broad f * * * * * * city
until this point he had been wearing a jacket , but he took it off
when he went to get back on , the gate attendant challenged him
daniel podolsky cited his ' freedom of speech ' , but was told he would be breaching southwest airlines 's rules by wearing an offensive shirt , so could n't get on
he refused to back down , and was left behind as the flight soared off to illinois
denied : first a southwest airlines member of staff , left , then a member of his flight 's cabin crew , right
told him he could n't get back on while wearing the shirt daniel podolsky then got in touch with fox to tell them his story , and handed over video footage of the exchange
he told the station : ' it just happened so fast
within thirty seconds the flight was gone
' when asked whether he considered covering up , or taking the shirt off , he replied : ' i mean i would have gladly done so
' however , his own cell phone video shows him being asked first to change the shirt , then to turn it inside - out , and lastly to do ' anything ' not to display the shirt
each time he answers ' nope '
he was later allowed to board a flight to new york , his ultimate destination , after changing his shirt
a southwest airlines spokesman backed up its staff , telling fox : ' we rely on our employees and customers to use common sense and good judgment
