these incredible photographs show dogs hard at work in the most dangerous job in the world - clearing mines in the war fields of afghanistan
the mines are a legacy of the soviet invasion of afghanistan in the 1980s and children are particularly vulnerable to the blasts when they go out to play or tend to their herds of cattle
mine detection teams work with the highly - trained dogs , typically belgian or german shepherds , to find and neutralise the lethal explosives in the namak ab district of afghanistan
the devices are destroyed in controlled explosions once they 've been found ( right ) the mines are a legacy of the soviet invasion of afghanistan in the 1980 's the heroic dogs are from the afghan mine detection center and funding comes from government donations around the world and international charities the dogs are selected as puppies based on health and their fixation on a rubber ball , which is used as a reward for them during the mine - hunting sessions the humbling and inspirational pictures were taken by craig mcinally , a 40 - year - old former us army bomb disposal expert who has been working in explosive ordnance disposal and mine action since 1999
craig mcinally has served in iraq , afghanistan , libya , el salvador , and nigeria and has been stationed in afghanistan since january 2014
he said : ' some mines are intentionally designed with minimum metal to make detection difficult
' dogs can search much faster than a person with a detector , especially in areas where mine contamination is low
this is particularly helpful in reducing the total size of a suspected area

they are selected as puppies based on health and their fixation on a rubber ball
this rubber ball is the reward for all their hard work
the handler will start the dog in a warm - up box , then show the dog where to start based on wind direction and previous cleared areas
the dogs then know to sniff along in a straight line searching for the explosives
when the dog reaches the end , it is called back and their progress is marked with coloured flags
the process will continue until all the fields are cleared of mines
after the mines are found they are destroyed in a controlled explosion .
