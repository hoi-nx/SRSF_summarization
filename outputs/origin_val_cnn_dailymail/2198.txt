rohit sharma hit his maiden cricket world cup century as india claimed a clinical 109 run victory over bangladesh in the second quarter - final here on thursday
it was the reigning cricket world cup champions â 11th consecutive victory in a cricket world cup , second best only to australia âs run of 25 matches between 2003 - 2011 , as ms dhoni won his 100th one - day international match as captain
featuring in their first ever cricket world cup knockout match bangladesh promised much early on as they restricted india to 125 - 3 from 30 overs but fell away under the pressure of the occasion , though there was an element of controversy
the platform for the resounding victory was set - up by rohit sharma âs measured innings as india posted 302 for six and was backed - up by an impressive 4 - 31 from yadav as bangladesh were bowled out for 193

at times the noise from the immensely vocal crowd will tell you all you need to know about what is going on in the middle
and , while that support no doubt buoys the indian players , it equally places them under an incredible amount of pressure
the type of pressure that has seen ravichandran ashwin and ravindra jadeja âs places in the side constantly questioned because of the limited time they spent in the middle during the tournament
the mere fact that they have batted so little because the rest of india âs batsmen have performed so well is left by the way side
but if any of the players are feeling the weight of burden upon them then they are refusing to let it affect their game
in fact the players have risen to the task
rohit sharma is congratulated for his milestone by india captain ms dhoni on thursday rohit sharma finally fell in the 47th over when he was bowled by bangladeshi quick taskin rohit sharma 's innings of 137 from 126 balls came to an end after taskin endured some punishment india 's suresh raina goes aerial for a six in his innings of 65 , india 's second highest score suresh raina celebrates reaching his half - century as india 's batsman struggled to score quickly arguably rohit sharma came into this match as one the few top - order indian batsmen who had yet to really impress , having made just 159 runs in his previous six innings
when required though , the 27 - year - old rose to the challenge producing some of the best shots of the entire tournament
the indian innings began uncharacteristically slowly as bangladesh âs attack produced a master class in tight bowling
dhawan , having prodded and probed his way to a modest 30 of 50 balls , was stumped off the bowling of shakib al hasan after being beaten by the flight of the ball and failing to drag his foot back in time
england âs ultimate destroyer hossain erupted in jubilation eight balls later as he had star batsman kohli caught behind for just three
the dismissal was all the more impressive , with mushfiqur taking a low catch , as the wicketkeeper was stood so far back a car could have fit between him and the stumps
bangladesh wicketkeeper mushfiqur whips off the bails to dismiss india opener dhawan dhawan was given out for 30 from the bowling of shakib al hasan as india 's opening partnership ended on 75 taskin ( left ) and mashrafe mortaza chest bump in celebration after the wicket of ajinkya rahane taskin was the pick of bangladesh 's bowlers with three wickets for 69 runs off his 10 overs taskin ( left ) and shakib al hasan ( right ) fall to the ground laughing as ajinkya rahane walks back to the pavilion and when ajinkya rahane mistimed a loft over extra-cover from a fuller taskin delivery to depart for painful 19 off 37 balls , india looked to be struggling
if discipline defined the first 30 overs for bangladesh , having bowled an impressive 107 of those 180 as dot balls , then meltdown almost perfectly defined the last 17
mashrafe mortaza took the ball in the first over of the batting powerplay and after suresh raina sent the ball between two fielders , the bangladeshi captain stood and berated his players
however , the game - changing over followed four overs later as hossain believed he had rohit sharma caught at deep midwicket for 90 , only for the delivery to be called a waist - high no ball
confusion ensued , with the bangladeshi players calling for a third - umpire second opinion but ian gould remained unmoved and rohit sharma remained at the crease
after reaching his ton off 108 balls the right - handed batsman let loose , lofting a beautiful inside - out drive for six
taskin eventually had his man , bowling an excellent yorker â a delivery so rare now but still a marvel when produced perfectly â as rohit sharma departed to a standing ovation from the 51,000 strong crowd
bangladesh 's hossain gives key wicket kohli an impassioned send off as he 's dismissed hossain followed a series of short balls with a full and wide delivery that caught kohli 's outside edge tamim got bangladesh off to a steady start with a run a ball 25 before falling to yadav yadav celebrates his breakthrough as he finds tamim 's edge and ms dhoni takes the catch to make it 33 - 1 it seemed surprising then that the 19 - year - old bowler was another who found himself on the end of a verbal rollicking from his captain as india passed the 300 run mark for the third time in the tournament
at the beginning of the year 302 - 6 would probably have been seen as an achievable target against an indian bowling attack that looked anything but international players
but with ms dhoni âs pack of bowlers having claimed 60 wickets in six matches bangladesh needed tamim to fire from the beginning
having found the boundary rope four times , tamim departed for a run - a - ball 25 as ms dhoni took a low catch off yadav âs bowling
without a run being added to their total , a mix - up in the middle saw kayes run - out for five and bangladesh two down for 33
bangladesh did their to best to keep up with the rate but the constant loss of wickets hindered their chances of making the match a contest
without adding a run mahmudullah ( left ) and kayes found themselves at the same end of the pitch despite a desperate dive , kayes is run out as yadav whips off the bails after a throw from ravindra jadeja india opening bowler mohammed shami ( right ) celebrates taking the wicket of bagladesh 's soumya sarkar shami claimed the tigers no 3 caught behind as soumya sarkar attempted to hold his side 's innings together yadav celebrates the wicket of mushfiqur as india take total control of the quarter - final india fans were out in force in melbourne for the day - night quarter - final on thursday the national flag of india is impossible to miss at the famous ground as suresh raina celebrates his 50 police speak to a fan wearing an india shirt and sitting behind a group of bangladesh supporters soumya sarkar ( 29 ) , mushfiqur ( 27 ) , sabbir rahman ( 30 ) and nassir hossain ( 35 ) all made starts but bangladesh failed to ever really trouble the indian bowlers who bowled out their opposition for a seventh consecutive match
while rohit sharma walked away with the man - of - the - match award , having become the fourth indian batsman to hit a century during this cricket world cup , the indian bowlers contribution to the side remains invaluable
ridiculed ahead of the start of the tournament and spoken of as india âs weak link , yadav , mohammad shami and mohit sharma continue to carry their side to outstanding victories
india look intent on holding on to the cricket world cup and at the moment it would take a very brave individual to bet against them
the winner of friday âs match between australia and pakistan await in the semi-finals .
