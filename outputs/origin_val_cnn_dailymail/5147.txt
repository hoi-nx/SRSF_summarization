fired : visual arts teacher traci gauthier was let go by st vrain valley school district last week after posting a picture of freshman phoenix bowen on instagram a colorado visual arts high school teacher has been fired after posting a picture of a student on her instagram account
traci gauthier was substituting for a different class in skyline high school in longmont , colorado , when she posted a photo of freshman phoenix bowen as he walked out of the room
the caption of the photo read : ' stem kids are trying too hard
i do n't know him , but i hate him
# pothead stem # wannabecool # dorkywhiteboy '
phoenix became aware of the picture after his friend showed it to him after class
' you ca n't hate me , you do n't know me , ' he commented on the post
gauthier was quick to respond , saying , ' i know i do n't know you - but i can hate anyone i 'd like
# nobig # dontbesad # meanartteacher
' phoenix thought the most offensive part was the hashtag accusing him of being a pothead because ' it 's false , ' he told fox31
he said gauthier was probably making a reference to his backpack , which has a logo of the energy drink cannaenergy on it
the company 's logo includes a hemp leaf , though there 's no thc in the drink
' people automatically see the hemp leaf and assume it is a pot leaf and pot is " stoner " , and that 's not what it 's about , ' phoenix told fox31
words hurt : the caption of gauthier 's photo read , ' stem kids are trying too hard
i do n't know him , but i hate him
# pothead # stem # wannabecool # dorkywhiteboy ' phoenix 's father erich bowen said that he 's worried about his son , who is usually outgoing
' i can see a difference in phoenix 's attitude and the way he 's handling himself , ' he told fox31
this is a lot of lines crossed
' st vrain valley school district told fox31 that it did not have a social media policy for teachers and said on thursday that gauthier was no longer employed
the district 's school board president bob smith said the photo could be seen as a threat to student welfare , according to denver post
crossed the line : phoenix 's father , erich bowen ( left ) says gouthier 's instagram post should be considered bullying that targeted phoenix ( right ) not a stoner : phoenix said he was offended by gauthier 's ' # pothead ' hashtag , because he says ' it 's false '
his backpack has an energy drink logo on it that includes a hemp leaf ' we would take bullying from anyone absolutely seriously , and particularly from a teacher , ' he said
' student wellbeing is our number one priority
without a strong sense of wellbeing , students ca n't learn
' in april of 2014 , gauthier appeared to share that stance on bullying when sent a letter to board members addressing the district 's policy
' something as simple as having announcements and fliers around the building can dramatically improve the climate of anti-bullying in a building and make kids feel safer , ' wrote gauthier , who was one of the school 's gay - straight alliance advisers
' that is the beauty and power of advertising
presidents , senators , school board members , etc. win campaigns because of visibility
students and staff can only feel safe if the group is visible
