social media and other technology are making it increasingly difficult to combat militants who are using such modern resources to share information and conduct operations , the head of the united states cia said on friday
cia director john brennan , in a speech in new york , said such communications only add to the difficulty of dealing with diffuse threats and attacks across the world from groups like islamic state , known also as isil , and others
' new technologies can help groups like isil coordinate operations , attract new recruits , disseminate propaganda , and inspire sympathizers across the globe to act in their name , ' john brennan said , using an acronym for the militant group that has taken hold in syria and iraq
speaking at the council on foreign relations , john brennan cited a recent spate of attacks , including shootings at the french satirical newspaper charlie hebdo , at a cafe in copenhagen , denmark and a pakistani school
' these attacks underscore a disturbing trend that we havebeen monitoring for some time : the emergence of a terroristthreat that is increasingly decentralized , difficult to track , and difficult to thwart
' flocking to fight : more than 210,000 people have been killed in syria since the uprising began in march 2011 - now more fighters are flocking to the area as social media helps draw new recruits the security concerns over the last year underscore an increasingly volatile world with more outbreaks of instability since the fall of the soviet union , john brennan said
and while agencies such as the cia have worked to boost their capability of fighting cyber-based threats , those bent on committing acts of terror have also improved their use of technologies , he added
john brennan said governments would have to work with private industry and other partners to identify and track down extremists , pointing to the ongoing conflict in syria and iraq and the challenge of foreign fighters engaging in the conflict there as a top priority
there , he said , ' at least 20,000 fighters from more than 90 countries have gone to fight - several thousand of them from western nations , including the united states
