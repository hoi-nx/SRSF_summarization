one transferee told the review that women in the camp could offer sexual favours in return for marijuana
' because they ( the transferees ) are suffering great depression here , and they feel relieved when they smoke the marijuana , the officers have made them addicted for their own reasons , ' the detainee said
' because the women do not get paid here , so what they need to obtain , they only have to offer sexual - fulfil the requests of the men
