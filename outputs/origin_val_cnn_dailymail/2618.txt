kfc fight : richard burbage promised to take her out for a meal if she joined him at a football match a car dealer got into a row with his wife when he promised to take her out for a meal if she went to a football match with him - then drove her to a kfc restaurant
richard burbage , 41 , of whiteley , hampshire , then tried to fight an expert in martial arts who attempted to break up the argument
the father - of - three was convicted of assault and fined Â£ 320 for attacking julian raffle
richard burbage had been arguing with his wife , lorraine , in kfc after they had been to a football match on a sunday afternoon
the row erupted because richard burbage told his wife he would take her out for a meal in exchange for coming to the match with him
but when she discovered the meal meant being taken to kfc in hedge end , hampshire , the couple began arguing
dan oâneill , prosecuting , told magistrates that customers at the eatery became disturbed by the row
he added that customer mr julian raffle then tried to calm the couple down and intervened
mr oâneil said there was then a struggle between mr julian raffle and richard burbage - and the car dealer twice tried to punch him
but what he did not realise was that mr julian raffle is an expert in the martial art of jiu - jitsu and when richard burbage tried to upper cut mr julian raffle , he used his self - defence training to dodge the blows
when the wife discovered she was going to kfc ( above ) in hedge end , hampshire , the couple began arguing richard burbage was then arrested and charged with common assault
after admitting this at southampton magistrates â court , he was fined Â£ 200
he also had to pay Â£ 100 costs and a Â£ 20 victim surcharge
a separate allegation of assaulting his wife by beating on november 30 was dismissed after the prosecution offered no evidence
mark rigby , defending richard burbage , said : â he and his wife both describe the relationship as feisty , fiery and passionate
â what he did was wrong because he swings for him and he bites off more than he can chew because mr julian raffle is trained in jiu - jitsu
â with hindsight they are very embarrassed by what sparked this
she was thinking she would be rewarded with a meal and was nât pleased to find out that that meal would be at kfc
â i think the salient lesson has been learned by the defendant and his wife
