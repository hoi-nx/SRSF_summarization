his face twisted in fury , hussen punches his fist into the air and launches into an islam war cry
â burn , burn us , â he yells from his prime spot at the front of one of the most notorious rallies in recent times
once the crowd is whipped into a fever , an us flag is set on fire and held aloft by a fanatic
video footage shows mr hussen desperately trying to hold the burning flag as the chanting behind him intensifies
as the remainder of the flag burns on the ground , mr hussen chants â allahu akbar â
he pushes the palm of his hand repeatedly toward the embers , rejoicing at the destruction of the stars and stripes
mr hussen â the father of one of the three schoolgirls who fled uk to join islamic state â then turns his attention to a burning israeli flag on the floor and begins to chant and gesture toward it
he is one of a dozen fanatics standing behind a banner which proclaims : â the followers of mohammed will conquer us
â behind him , hundreds of fanatics repeatedly chant incendiary slogans while holding menacing black jihadi flags
among the rabble - rousers was notorious hate preacher anjem choudary , who has led a number of islamist groups that were subsequently banned
alongside him stood michael adebowale , one of the two islam converts who murdered and almost beheaded fusilier lee rigby in the name of allah eight months later
sinister : also at the rally was michael adebowale who went on to murder soldier lee rigby the following year respectable : hussen , pictured far right , giving evidence to the home affairs select committee following his daughter 's disappearance
the report was released this week abu izzadeen , infamous for heckling former home secretary john reid in 2006 , also led some of the chanting
but last month mr hussen gave evidence to parliament refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls â actions , instead seeking to blame the police , teachers , turkish officials and others
in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee , mr hussen , who was with the families of the other two girls , denied even knowing what islam radicalisation was
cuddly : hussen appealing for the return of his ' jihadi daughter ' a few weeks ago after she ran off â as for me , i do nât know the symptoms even â what radicalisation is , â he told mps
mr hussen also repeatedly blasted the metropolitan police for handing a letter to his daughter requesting parental permission to speak to the girls about a friend who had earlier travelled to syria
he said police officers should have given it directly to the families
he said : â i strongly disagree with the letter being given to 15 - year - old girls
the word â police â by itself and â terrorism â or â counter-terrorism â , as global issues â it is a heavy burden for a 15 - year - old to deal with that
we also feel that we are neglected as parents
â we are supposed to know these things
the letter destructs our daughter , destructs our family and terrorises our children
what we want to know is : apart from this letter , what was the verbal conversation with this child ? i know my daughter
she is the kind of girl who , if it is sunset , she will call me to pick her up
â how on earth she travelled abroad to join isis , is a very difficult question for us to answer â even to predicate
the letter terrified my daughter
â the families were led by their lawyer akunjee , once the representative of a close associate of the woolwich killers , who repeatedly demanded an apology
mr akunjee , who has posted extremist views on his facebook page , accused scotland yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in february and their close friend in december
in a 45 - minute grilling in front of the families , met commissioner sir bernard hogan-howe was forced to apologise for failing to communicate more directly with the families
giving evidence to the committee , mr hussen claimed he did not know that his daughter amira might have been exposed to radical views
chairman vaz pressed him on this point , asking him : â did it come to your attention in any way that they were involved in the kinds of things that it is alleged that they were involved in following this becoming public ? â mr hussen replied : â not at all
â chilling : a cctv image of 15 - year - old amira abase , kadiza sultana , 16 , and shamima begum , 15 , at gatwick airport before they caught their flight to turkish fanaticism : footage of the controversial rally showed mr hussen chanting among the crowds of protesters
the demonstration , held in 2012 , was led by firebrand preacher anjem choudary and attended by lee rigby 's killer extremist : the protest was led by the hate preacher and notorious rabble rouser anjem choudary , who made a speech saying that sharia would take over the entire world , including us and the uk shocking : scotland yard said it would examine the footage ( pictured ) to see if any criminal offences had been committed what the mps were not told was that mr hussen was caught on camera in one of a wave of demonstrations that took place across the world in september 2012
thousands had taken to the streets to protest against an obscure film called innocence of muslims , criticised for ridiculing islam
in east london , more than 150 clashed with police outside the us embassy
they included luton radicals rahin aziz , who is fighting for islamic state , and saiful islam , who was the subject of a channel 4 exposÃ© called proud and prejudiced
radical : amira abase , 15 , daughter of hussen , travelled to syria with two other girls rahin aziz has called for theresa may to be executed , suggested that islamic state - style executions take place in trafalgar square and threatened to blow up big ben
last night members of the commons committee expressed their shock and astonishment over mr hussen âs activities
labour mp ian austin said : â it is extraordinary that this man blamed the police , the government , the school , the turkish government and everyone else for his daughter âs decision to go to syria but failed to mention his own involvement in an appalling islamist rally
perhaps the committee should invite mr hussen back so he can explain what he was doing
â tory mp michael ellis , who also sits on the committee , said : â this will come as a surprise to those who heard criticism of the police and school
this raises serious questions about the potential negative influence on an impressionable young mind
â mr vaz said : â it is clear that families and communities need to take greater responsibility for protecting young people who could be at risk of radicalisation
â witnesses before the committee are responsible for their own statements
when mr hussen gave evidence , he said he had no idea that his daughter had been involved in radicalisation or had been radicalised
â amira fled with her friends shamima begum , 15 , and kadiza sultana , 16 , from their homes in east east london to syria last month
the trio were following in the footsteps of sharmeena begum , who left their school , bethnal green academy in east london , to go to syria in december
scotland yard said it would examine the footage to see if any offences had been committed .
