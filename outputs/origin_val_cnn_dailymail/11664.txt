in the history of human invention , there 's nothing that matches the car
we rely on them every day
to do our jobs , drop the kids off at school , or take an elderly relative shopping
cars mean freedom and independence , and most importantly of all , convenience
but years of crazy parking rules have made many law - abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals , and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses
we all know the story
you return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen
or maybe you run a local shop , and customers have dried up because what you sell costs less than the parking fee
local government and communities secretary eric pickles ( left ) and transport secretary patrick mcloughlin ( right ) have vowed to end the ' war on the motorist ' with their new ' common sense ' approach in 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end
that meant not only changing the rules , but changing attitudes , because under the previous government councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny , treating them like cash machines on wheels
this included spying on and filming drivers going about their daily lives
where if you made a mistake it would mean an expensive bill in the post
if you protested it could mean a doubling of the original fine , or an angry bailiff knocking on your door
and all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by parliament
residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence
the minister says they want to see ' fairness and balance ' restored to the system so parking no longer generates profit these rules have now been changed during this parliament
local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area , including charges and the use of yellow lines
parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued
they have also vowed to end the industrial use of cctv ' spy cars ' to enforce on - street parking we are bringing back common sense
very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute ' grace periods ' for council - controlled parking , whether it 's on or off - street , paid or free
it means you wo n't get fined for being a few minutes late
we 're also ending the industrial use of cctv ' spy cars ' to enforce on - street parking
the new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post , but ensure public safety as cctv will still be used to protect schools , bus lanes and red routes
why have we done this ? because we want see fairness and balance restored to the system
as a result it will no longer possible to use parking to generate profit and we 're cracking down on the use of aggressive bailiffs
and in another victory for common sense parking at an out - of - order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay
there are also occasions where shoppers and drivers receive a fine and appeal because they genuinely believe they 've done nothing wrong
we 'll be trialling a new system so if this happens to you , you 'll receive a 25 % discount even if the appeal is lost
these changes are great news for drivers but they are good news for town centres and business too
people supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce
under the previous administration life became unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring
we 're ending this pointless war on motorists so that you do n't feel like a criminal just for parking your car .
