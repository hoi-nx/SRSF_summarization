the lib have been accused of accepting a potentially illegal donation in a new party funding scandal
an undercover reporter , posing as an indian businessman , was told he could make a major gift to the party without revealing his identity , it was claimed
treasury minister danny alexander was dragged into the row after he was recorded urging him to give more money , but nick clegg insisted he had done nothing more than poliutley thank a suporter for their help
the journalist , who was posing as an indian businessman , was allegedly told to split his donations between family members to keep his identity a secret , and was pictured at a meeting with danny alexander an undercover daily telegraph reporter was reportedly told that by spreading his donation among other family members , he would not exceed the Â£ 7,500 threshold requiring him to be named on the electoral commission register
the reporter was offered private meetings with nick clegg and other senior figures
he was allegedly told he could also back - date cheques so he appeared to have given the money in different years and could avoid declaring it as a lump sum
the fake donor was said to have been invited to a fundraising dinner with senior lib figures after he and his fictional ' cousin ' handed the party Â£ 9,100
the donation was sought by taguri , the party 's former chief fundraiser
he is running to be an mp in brent central
he was pictured at a private meeting with chief secretary to the treasury danny alexander who allegedly encouraged him to provide further financial support and said his money would ' genuinely make a difference to the results of the election '
the cabinet minister is said to have told him : â i just want you to know that i , personally , am very , very grateful for what you âre doing
it genuinely will make a difference to the results of the election â
mr taguri was recorded telling him : â when you do this , the doors will open for you â¦ we âre going to introduce you to the parties , they will be , very , very helpful once they know you are helpful
â but mr nick clegg told lbc radio that the recording showed ' danny alexander being a polite guy , just saying thank you to someone who he has been told is supporting the party '
the lib leader added : ' the idea that danny alexander or any parliamentarian has done anything wrong is categorically untrue
' on the issue of taguri , no cheque has been received by the lib , no cheque has been cashed
if we had received this cheque in question , of course it would have been scrutinised and checked
' lib leader nick clegg insisted mr danny alexander was just being ' a polite guy ' and had done nothing wrong the scandal will put the spotlight on how funding is sought by the lib and , potentially , other parties , and what access they may have been offering in return
it comes weeks after ex-foreign secretaries malcolm rifkind and jack straw were filmed accepting money to work for a bogus chinese firm
the fake businessman is understood to have made contact with mr taguri , the party 's spokesman on race equality
he told the candidate he wanted to donate but keep his funding ' secret ' , the daily telegraph reported last night
mr taguri apparently told him the money would ' open doors ' explaining donors can give Â£ 1,500 to a local party office or Â£ 7,500 to the central party per year without having their name on the register
the undercover reporter donated Â£ 1,450 to mr taguri , just under the limit , last october , it was claimed
the fresh scandal comes just weeks after sir malcolm rifkind ( left ) and jack straw ( right ) were caught offering to exploit their parliamentary connections while working for a bogus chinese firm but it is alleged that the aspiring mp then told the businessman he could use ' cheeky ' ways to donate larger sums by using ' a cousin ' to give money for him or back - dating cheques
the reporter was said to have then arranged for a ' cousin ' to donate a further Â£ 7,650
he was then invited to a lib fundraising dinner
mr taguri was recorded telling him : ' when you do this , the doors will open for you â¦ we 're going to introduce you to the parties , they will be , very , very helpful once they know you are helpful
' the following month it is alleged the fake businessman asked mr taguri for some contacts at local councils as he was interested in pursuing housing grants to help his property investments
the lib said they were investigating the claims
mr taguri denied any wrongdoing
he said he had not cashed the cheque and would have declared it properly
he added he thought the ' cousin ' had given his own money and that he was ' publicly declaring all donations ' , even those he was not required to disclose
a lib spokesman said : ' had the money come to us , which it as of yet has n't , we would have declared the original source as is legally required and we would have no intention of doing anything otherwise
' electoral commission rules say intermediaries ' must not be used as an attempt to evade the controls on permissibility and transparency ' .
