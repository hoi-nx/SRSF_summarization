italy interior minister angelino alfano is set to push for migrant screening and processing centres in african , at meetings with his eu counterparts in brussels tomorrow
mr angelino alfano claims that the migrant crisis should be tackled with refugee camps on african soil , where asylum seekers could be identified and then distributed evenly throughout europe states
the minister âs proposals come as the eu border chief warned that there are up to a million migrants in libyans preparing to cross the mediterranean
italy , with its southernmost landfall just a 80km ( 49 miles ) from african , is the first port of call for many seeking new lives in europe
with libyans descending into ever - worsening chaos and lawlessness , almost 9,000 migrants arrived on italy shores in january and february , up 43 per cent on last year âs record figures
fabrice leggeri director of eu border control frontex said : â our sources tell us there are anywhere between 500,000 to a million people ready to leave from libyans
â â we have to be ready to address a more difficult situation than last year
â with militias loyal to the islamic state making frightening inroads in libyans , it is feared that jihadis could enter europe by boat hidden among migrants
minister angelino alfano , of the centre - right ncd party , said the solution has to be found in african : â we must resolve the problem at its origin
there are two paths , stabilise libyans and create refugee camps in african so that the screening is done there , and those who have the right to asylum are identified with a balanced distribution between the europe countries
â he told italy television la 7 in advance of the meeting that libyans has become â an international priority
â â the camps would do a preventative screening , â he said
â who has refugee status would be distributed in a balanced way among various europe countries , those who are nât would not be given permission to leave
â italy is the first place many people arrive when seeking a new life in europe
these migrants were rescued from the sea after the boat they were travelling in capsised three of the camps would be based in niger , tunisia and sudan , according to italy media reports
natasha bertaud , spokesman for the eu executive , said the plans were in an â orientation phase â
she said the commission was â aware that some member states are in discussions to develop centres in north african and are in contact with the iom and unhcr about the possibility of developing centres for migrants to facilitate screening and logistics for the voluntary return of economic migrants , as well as identifying those who need help
â a pilot project in niger is under discussion , she said
deploying liaison officers in third party countries is â a long term project â she said
it is thought up to a million people might be willing to make the crossing from libyans

but the plans were welcomed in italy

â the facilities would be created by the eu in conjunction with international humanitarian organisations to two ends : avoiding the illegal crossings of the mediterranean with the risks that it brings and distributing the asylum seekers in europe according to balanced reception quotas
