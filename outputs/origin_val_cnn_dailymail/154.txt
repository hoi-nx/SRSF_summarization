two thugs who brutally assaulted a commuter on a st louis light rail car when he refused to give his opinion on the shooting of michael brown have been arrested
david autry , 43 , was travelling home on the metrolink train at 10pm last monday when he was punched and kicked in the head by the men
the two suspects , a 15 - year - old juvenile and a 21 - year - old man , will be formally charged tomorrow , police said
the video shows a man in a red t - shirt and baseball cap approach david autry who was sitting at the front of the train
according to david autry , the attacker first asked to use his cell phone
when he refused , the man asked for his opinion on the death of michael brown
' i responded i was too tired to think about it right now , ' david autry told kmov
' the next thing i know , he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face
' two other men then join in , with one swinging a left hand punch at the victim 's head
as the train pulled into a station , the man in the red t - shirt kicks his victim in the head before escaping
the victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead , but declined medical treatment
david autry told kmov he was more upset that no one stepped in to help and worse he could hear people laugh
' i think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it , ' he said
' and no one offered to help
no one seemed to call 911
' david autry has said he would prefer not to use public transportation in future and he has set up a gofundme page in the hope of raising $ 5,000 to buy a motorcycle
the page was setup on saturday and he has already raised more $ 4,500
david autry also plans to donate some of the proceeds to neighborhood victims of violent crimes
david autry said he was most upset that no one stepped in to help him and worse he could hear people laugh writing on his gofundme page about why he did not fight back , he said : ' first , i was dazed from the sucker punch in the face
' second , c'mon 3 against one ? i was trying to protect my glasses
i did n't know they were on the floor all bent up and the lens popped out
' third , if i had stood up and fought , only white guy on that train car , how do i know i would n't be attacked from behind as well ? it 's easy to say what you would have done until you find yourself in that situation
' authorities in st louis have yet to release the names or images of the two suspects apprehended with what they are calling a misdemeanor third - degree assault
a third man pictured in the surveillance video was identified but not arrested following an investigation
unarmed 18 - year - old michael brown was fatally shot by police officer wilson in nearby ferguson last august following an altercation
the incident sparked days of violent protests , as did the decision by a grand jury not to indict wilson last november
police have said they arrested two of the three men recorded on the surveillance video of the incident , although they have yet to be identified
