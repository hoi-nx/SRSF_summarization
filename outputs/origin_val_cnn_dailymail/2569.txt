' we did not have the intensity in training leading up to that match and we were exposed on the day
' we were n't pointing fingers , we were looking at ourselves as to how we could have prepared better for that game
' it was a bitter pill to swallow because we were well - beaten and it was the first time in a long time that had happened to us
' we really struggled to cope with their driving game but we 've worked worked hard in that area and the boys showed against france what they 're capable of doing
' wales ' 20 - 13 victory in paris has revived welsh hopes of doing what they did in 2013 , namely becoming six nations champions after losing their first game in the tournament and they were boosted on friday when skipper sam warburton and dan biggar returned to training after suffering knocks in france

' they 're a very formidable outfit as they 've proven , ' mcbryde said
' you 've got to have your wits about you playing them in regards to the tactical and technical approach to the game
' but the france game was a reflection of what the players have been doing in training and some of the execution and accuracy under pressure which we we speak about constantly came to fruition
' we 've set the standard and now we 've got to do it again
