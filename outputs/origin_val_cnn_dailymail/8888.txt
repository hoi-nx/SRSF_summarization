â he obviously wants to come to this country because we are an easy touch
â fellow councillor lucy care , deputy leader of derby âs liberal democrats , said : â it does nât seem right to me that somebody that we âve sent out of the country because he is not following our laws is able to get back in again so soon afterwards
it makes a mockery of having gone to the effort to get rid of him
