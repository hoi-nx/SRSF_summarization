for a bullock with two heads , he 's mighty healthy
a cattle saleyard in mareeba , north queensland , hosted an unusual sight on tuesday when a livestock agent arrived to hawk a two - faced cow
its second face , mounted on top of its first , had one eye , a single tooth and functional nostrils , according to the saleyard
it was in ' great condition '
' mate , he 's as fat as a fool ! ' said elders selling agent mark peters , who witnessed the animal 's purchase yesterday
unsurprisingly , the two - faced animal attracted curious glances at the saleyards
' it received a fair amount of attention , ' said queensland rural livestock agent jack ' jacko ' shephard , who sold the bullock
mr shephard said he had not seen another two - faced cow during his 17 years on the job , although he had seen other abnormalities
the 440kg animal successfully sold for $ 537aud , or 122 cents per kilo
but the future is not bright for this cow
he was purchased by an abattoir
' it was an absolute prime condition animal , he just had two faces , ' said elders mareeba livestock agent mark peters , who witnessed the two - faced bullock 's sale ' he 's as fat as a fool ' : this 440kg animal was sold for 122c per kilo , or $ 537aud
