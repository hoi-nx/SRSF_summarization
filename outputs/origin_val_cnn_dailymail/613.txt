for the first time , nasa has tested one of the explosively powerful boosters that will help its space launch system rocket reach space in 2019 , and eventually take humans to mars
the 126 - second static - fire test took place in utah today at 11:30am edt ( 3:30pm gmt )
temperatures reached 2,500 Â° c ( 4,500 â° f ) - enough to melt sand on the site into glass - as 3.6 million pounds of thrust poured out of the engine
that static - fire test ( seen in the animation above ) took place at 3:30pm gmt and lasted 126 seconds
the 3.6 million pounds of thrust produced temperatures of 2,500 Â° c. when sls eventually flies , two of these boosters will be used this was the first test of the redesigned booster for sls
when it ultimately flies , it will use two of these srb ( srb )
there will be two versions of the rocket
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton sls will stand 321ft ( 98 metres ) tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history
towering a staggering 384ft ( 117 metres ) tall , it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds
it will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit
in its final configuration the sls will be the most powerful rocket ever launched , more powerful even than the saturn v rocket that took men to the moon
during the test , flames exited the nozzle at about mach 3
the booster itself is an upgraded version of the same one that took the space shuttle into orbit , but it has an additional section to allow more fuel , and thus more power , to be added
known as qualification motor 1 , the booster spent several days inside a chamber as it was heated up to a core temperature of 32 Â° c ( 90 â° f )
it measures 117 ft ( 54 metres ) in length , 12.2ft ( 3.7 metres ) in diameter and has a total mass of around 725 metric tons

former astronaut and vice president for advanced strategic programs at atk charles precourt said after the event that it was a â really nice result â
he added : â it looked really clean and was very exciting
you could see the pressure coming off the motor
â nasa 's booster manager alex priskos added : ' we could n't be happier with what we know so far
today was about as successful as you can get ' towering a staggering 384ft ( 117 metres ) tall , the sls ( sls ) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds when it eventually takes flight
it will be used to take astronauts to mars sometime in the 2030s , with nasa âs orion spacecraft being carried on top
