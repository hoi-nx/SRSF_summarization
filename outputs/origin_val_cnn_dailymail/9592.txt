the classic advice was given to me first by no less a figure than dame barbara cartland â then aged 90 â at one of her bizarre lunches to launch yet another romantic novel
she was busy rattling off a roster of men who had proposed to her over the decades , when she broke off and fixed a skinny guest with her gimlet eye
â after 40 , â she told me , â a woman has to choose between her face and her figure
my advice is , keep a lovely , plump pretty face , and stay sitting down
as she got up again and started working the room , distributing souvenir gold - leaf acorns from her garden and finishing the list of long - deceased suitors â the object of her remarks , a skinny fellow journalist , scowled and fiddled with her lettuce
i â past 40 by then â smiled my chubbiest , most complacent smile
it âs not often my tribe get our bums and faces validated over those of grumpy glamazons
in bergen 's ( pictured in the 1960 's ) memoir she merrily admits to putting on more than 2st over the past 15 years now , that face - and - figure tip has been reiterated by candice bergen , former model , actress and oscar nominee , whose memoir a fine romance will be published soon
in it , 68 - year - old candice bergen merrily admits that over the past 15 years she has put on more than 2st
â i am a champion eater
no carb is safe , â she joshes
food is fun , she believes , and it is ridiculous and sad that her contemporaries either starve or vomit in secret to stay stick - thin
candice bergen sounds a riot , just the girl for a grand night out
she also sounds â and here âs the key â confident and sexy
none of that weird , skeletal , sarah or victoria beckham vibe for her , nor that gristly , hard - body madonna look , all abs and biceps
oscar nominee candice bergen ( pictured ) is confident , sexy and fun , despite putting on more than 2st over the last 15 years her brand of femininity , which is shared by domestic goddess nigella lawson , is a bounce and a grin , a wink and a cuddle
the buxom woman âs image may not suit the gay - dominated fashion industry or the anxious self - hating celebrity circuit , but children ( and , frankly , most men ) gravitate towards the comfortable female form
both have an entirely natural instinct to bond with a female who seems fun , comfy , confident and able to enjoy her food
candice bergen and nigella lawson 's healthy , curvy figures differ from the tiny frames of celebs such as victoria beckham ( pictured ) and sarah indeed , scientists lately delighted us with news that the particular sort of fat on the female backside is rather special
it is vital for the formation of the healthy foetal brain in pregnancy
so any cheek from your teenage offspring , and you can riposte : â your brain is made out of my bum ! ha ha ha ! â before the health - police start pursing their lips , i hastily say that by â buxom â and â comfortable â i absolutely do not mean obese
there is a clear line to be drawn between the chub of the healthy and vigorous middle - aged and the vast jelloid spread of the clinically obese
domestic goddess nigella lawson ( pictured ) has a curvy figure and a healthy face , she shares her fun , comfortable brand of femininity with former model candice bergen this is not about those sad whale - forms who wheeze and waddle and risk diabetes ; who ca nât fit in train or plane seats
of course , serious obesity needs help , or in the last desperate resort , gastric - band surgery
but that is quite different from the 2st - above - model - weight which candice bergen is talking about
we all know perfectly well when we are ladling on the lard in the wrong places : if sensible , we take action
there are times â post-pregnancy , doing double - duty as a working mum or just imprisoned by sedentary work and depression â when women ( and men ) cross the line
but we do know inwardly when that point is
that is quite different , though , from the neurotic , bulimic daily anxiety of struggling to be unnaturally thin , too skinny for your natural metabolism
of course , some wiry women stay very slim all their lives without giving it a second thought
it can be very annoying for cautious eaters to see these lucky freaks piling into the pies with no apparent effect
others enjoy engaging in such ferocious sports that they rarely put on an ounce
actress sarah ( pictured ) sports a skinny , skeletal figure , similar to that of victoria beckham
but libby purves says there 's nothing wrong with some extra weight and curves but what about the rest of us ? as long as we walk our 10,000 steps a day , eat lots of veg , swim or bike or zumba and can nip upstairs and sprint for a bus , there âs no problem with a bit of extra round the bum
or in having ( shock ! ) a stomach which is not concave , or thighs which occasionally meet
the upside , as cartland and candice bergen remind us , is that a woman âs face does nât become haggard so quickly ; her skin stays peachy and she wo nât have that mean , cool , pinched , starved - weasel look so common on the social pages
rather , she exudes a contented , cheerful aura of enjoying life
she does not carry the quivering paranoia of one who is frightened of knives and forks , or sit with an agonised , tense expression in restaurants sipping mineral water and pretending not to be hungry
that âs what makes many happy , rounded , smiling women attractive
the morbidly obese are nât confident â how could they be ? but neither are those for whom every morsel , every pinch - of - an - inch , every dress size above 8 is a source of self - loathing
they have been conditioned to think they have no real right to take up space , and must keep a vulnerable adolescent skinniness all their lives
we can see here one memorable movie scene where bridget jones has her curves on display as she arrives at a garden party dressed as a bunny a lovely moment in the bridget jones âs diary movie is when she is counting calories and someone says : â do nât you need 1,200 or something just to live ? â and she realises it had never occurred to her before that food was actually necessary
it was , to her , just a reprehensible addiction
but you ca nât go cold - turkey on food , so what you need is a cheerful relationship with it and your body
and if , as life goes on , some of nature âs bounty settles as padding on your healthy active body , so what ? it âs certainly nobody else âs business
one of the most irritating eras in journalism was when sarah ferguson was first married , long before she blotted her copybook
the papers sneered â duchess of pork â and laughed at her broad - bottomed , bouncing shape , so far from diana âs fragile , bulimic slenderness
however , young sarah was active : a rider , a black - run skier , a sexy , larky happy girl
nothing wrong with her except an unfashionable shape
has she looked better , happier , jollier in her skinnier after - years ? i think not
papers were cruel to brand active sarah ferugson ' duchess of pork ' ( pictured ) in response to her broad - bottomed , bouncing shape so hurrah for candice bergen and her rollicking attitude to life
i find myself humming an irish ditty we used to sing in the pubs of west cork , with the chorus : â for she âs a great big shtout lump of an agg - er - i - cultural irish girl
she neither paints nor powders and her figure is all her own â¦ â the last line rises triumphantly with a cry of â the full of your arms of irish love â is mary ann malone
whoopee ! â and i will bet mary ann malone had a gorgeous , peachy , irish face and the comfiest of backsides
