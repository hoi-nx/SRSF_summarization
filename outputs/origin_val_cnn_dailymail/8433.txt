a fort worth , texas elementary school has come under fire from parents who claim certain teachers and administrators have cultivated a ' toxic ' environment for their children
at a monday board meeting , parents turned out to support glaser , the former vice principal at comanche springs elementary school in the eagle mountain-saginaw isd , who was placed on administrative leave after she experienced heavy vaginal bleeding that the school claims was caused by ' severe anxiety
' glaser , 31 , and her doctors , have firmly stated the bleeding , which occurred during a district training session and required glaser to seek immediate medical attention , was the result of an intrauterine device being lodged in her uterine wall
this was just the beginning of the parents complaints as well , as they also voiced their concern over ' staff drinking , ' the ' use of disparaging nicknames for teachers , parents and even children , ' and a principal who has been reassigned after her ' bullying tactics
she was not allowed to return to work however , and instead placed on leave after receiving a letter shortly after that said her bleeding had occurred on multiple occasions and was the result of ' severe anxiety
' on top of this , she was told she would need to see two doctors and sign a waiver releasing her medical records before she would be allowed to return to work
the letter also claimed she had trouble speaking in front of large groups , something glasser denied in an interview with abc 8
at this point , some parents at the school became aware of the situation , and seemed to place the blame on maurer , the principal of the school
the situation then became even further complicated when just last week maurer filed a police report claiming she was being harassed by an employee at the school and her husband
the name of the employee was not released , but it was revealed to be someone who was on leave
in her report , maurer claimed this employee had posted ' very hateful things ' about her on social media , and that these posts had led to national attention
the employee also reportedly referred to maurer as an ' idiot , ' while the employee 's husband is accused in the report of stalking maurer , coming to the school unannounced , following her to restaurants , and showing up at her home
maurer , 34,said this has been going on for close to five weeks
the district said it is examining the claims , while a lawyer for glaser , brittany lannen , all but admitted she was the woman named in the report , saying ; ' â once the aggressor is caught , they attempt to play the victim
thankfully with today âs technology and social media , ms. maurer âs false accusations can easily be dismissed with a quick view of mrs. glaser âs social media
' she also added that glaser 's husband was not ever told he could not be on school grounds
maurer , meanwhile , has been reassigned to another school in the district
' it was a very sad situation , ' said retired teacher carol smith
â smith then said of maurer ; ' she was hired against the recommendation of the committee , and i felt like i was working with a person in the seventh grade
' parents brought up glaser 's situation at a meeting monday ( above ) , along with staff drinking on campus and the use of disparaging nicknames for students the district said it is investigating the leadership and these incidents at the school ( above ) pta member jennifer jordan said that maurer tries to exercise too much control over how decisions are made at the school , claiming she ' has tried to remove pta leaders , and has said she only wants people she likes on the board
' there were also claims at monday 's meeting that maurer had ' misused pta travel funds for personal entertainment
' ' my daughter is stuck in a horrible situation at comanche springs , ' said chad ferguson
' i want my kids to grow up and feel like when something is not right , they have an obligation to try and make it right without fear of retribution
' in a statement released last friday , the district said ; ' the administration of eagle mountain-saginaw isd is very aware of the concerns surrounding the leadership team at comanche springs elementary school , and is actively working toward a resolution
