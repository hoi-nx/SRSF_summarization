it 's the home of uk politics , steeped in history , tradition and centuries - old pomp
but could the ornate splendor of the uk 's houses of parliament be about to offer a solution to london 's housing crisis ? in all honesty , probably not
however , that has n't stopped housing campaign group , generation rent , from proposing to transform the westminster into affordable new homes
the group 's eye - catching idea is to move the seat of uk democracy from one of london 's most exclusive neighborhoods to a new location in the city of hull , northern england
the vacant house of commons and house of lords ( the uk 's upper legislative chamber ) left behind would be converted into 364 flats of varying size and scale with prime office space facing the river thames
according to a press release on the proposal from generation rent , 335 mps from all over the uk currently rent second homes so they can carry out their parliamentary duties more effectively
they claim expenses for doing so cost the taxpayer Â£ 5.26 million ( $ 8 million ) in 2013 alone
by moving the seat of government to hull , a city with the cheapest housing rent in england , millions could be saved in expenses as well as staffing costs , the group claims
westminster is one of the most expensive boroughs for property in london , according to research from house moving firm , delivery quote compare
the ever - rising cost of property in the uk capital , meanwhile , is making it increasingly difficult for many to buy or rent in central areas of the city
a january report from rental referencing company , homelet , also found that average rental prices in london were more than double that of those found in the rest of the uk " we hope our proposal gives mps a sense of humility and some urgency to ending the housing crisis , " said director of generation rent , alex hilton
yet even if the generation rent proposals were seriously considered , they could come unstuck by the dilapidated state of the parliament building itself
speaker of the house , john bercow , said monday that repairs needed to bring the nineteenth century structure up to scratch could come close to Â£ 3 billion ( $ 4.6 billion )
a 2012 study entitled " the restorations and renewal of the westminster " found that the building could suffer permanent damage if work was not undertaken to stem leaks , repair crumbling stonework and remove asbestos .
