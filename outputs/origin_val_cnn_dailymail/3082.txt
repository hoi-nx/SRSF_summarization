they had earned a trophy and a promising title shot , but there was an appropriate lack of rejoicing by england on saturday night
wastefulness is no cause for euphoria
the calcutta cup had been retained , but the limitations of the opposition meant that was never in real doubt , despite considerable scots tenacity and occasional artistry
stuart lancaster , his assistants and his squad know that the standards they reached at twickenham will not suffice against the leading rugby nations
england beat scotland but they have n't shown enough to convince yet during the six nations defeating scotland earned chris robshaw and his men a trophy , but they did n't do enough the england squad smile for the cameras having defeated scotland 25 - 13 to win the calcutta cup 1st minute : george sends burrell clear but he ignores anthony watson in space on the right and the door slams shut
13th minute : ben youngs frees mike brown but the full - back â minus a boot â is chased down by stuart hogg close to the posts
15th minute : the pack drive a scrum towards the scots line but billy vunipola is unable to pick up and touch down
17th minute : nowell storms clear with two team - mates on either side but goes it alone , slips and can not offload the ball
31st minute : burrell bursts through and sends anthony watson scorching to the line , but the â try â is ruled out ny romain poite for a forward pass
54th minute : rampant england swarm into the visitors â 22 but the attempted offload by geoff parling is pinched by blair cowan
56th minute : replacement hooker tom youngs makes a dazzling midfield charge but it comes to nothing as his pass flies between two supporting runners
58th minute : anthony watson breaks from a ruck to the opposition 22 but runs away from burrell and can not release the centre to score
62nd minute : mike brown blasts over the scots 22 to score , but the â try â is disallowed due to another forward pass in the build - up â this time by james haskell
while the red rose is now planted at the top of the six nations table , even shambolic france may be no push - overs in the tournament finale at twickenham next saturday if there is not a sharp up - turn in english precision
â if you look at the all blacks , when they create a line break they usually end up scoring , â said stuart lancaster
â we created 12 line breaks , which is a huge positive because i have nât seen any team pull scotland apart like that , but to only come away with three tries is frustrating
i think the players know that
â they most certainly do
ben youngs was named man of the match for his efforts at scrum half , but he appeared underwhelmed by the manner of the victory
â we got what we wanted in terms of the result , but the scoreline should have been better , â he admitted
there is a recurring concern for england
composure â or a lack of it
they mustered plenty in cardiff to turn the tide against wales , but too often in tight games there are failures of decision - making or execution
the tone was set on saturday by burrell , who did nât manage to pass to the unmarked anthony watson on the scots 22
put him in a northampton shirt and the centre would surely make the pass and create the try
yet , on this high - profile occasion , the chance was squandered
a similar error of judgment by jonny may against italy cost the gloucester wing his place in the match - day squad , but burrell is likely to escape the same fate due to the absence of injured brad barritt and reservations about billy twelvetrees
george got england off to a perfect start in the second - half but the first half will have worried them exeter wing nowell crosses over to score england 's third try and send them top of the six nations table the saints player was not the sole offender , with nowell at fault for ignoring support more than once
it may seem churlish to criticise the exeter wing , who was dynamic and dangerous , but england urgently need a clinical edge
â it âs that composure after the line break , â said stuart lancaster
â it was good on some occasions because we scored three good tries , but there were also missing elements and we need to fix those for next week
â joseph continued his purple patch by touching down for the fourth time in as many games
but he was left irritated by the hosts â profligate streak , too
â we made costly errors in the red zone in their 22 which let them off the hook , â said the bath centre
â we are creating those opportunities , now it âs just a matter of finishing them
â england must not over-state their satisfaction at mere creation alone
on the one hand , wales â victory over ireland was a source of great english joy , as it leaves lancaster âs team with it all in their favour in the three - way tussle for the championship title
but with the bigger picture in mind , the red - shirted defensive heroism in cardiff rammed home the need for england to become more ruthless
on the latest evidence , their closest world cup pool a rivals wo nât be line - break fodder in the way scotland so often were
no other country can match the all blacks â ability to expose and seize the jugular , but lancaster will be painfully aware that his team can not rely on a torrent of attacking possession
when england are equalled or trumped up front â as was the case against ireland â they will require an executioner âs instinct
at least it was evident in one man on saturday
george wielded the conductor âs baton with staggering assurance for a 21 - year - old
he invariably took the right option while going through his wide - ranging repertoire in helping to conjure the tries by joseph and nowell
he added one himself when the fractured scots defence opened up in front of him
tom youngs ( centre ) leads an england breakaway as lancaster 's side returned to the six nations summit anthony watson runs clear but england repeatedly failed to take their chances at twickenham on saturday mike brown was one of the better performers but england spurned too many opportunities at twickenham ben youngs hands off a tackle but the man of the match was n't happy with his team 's overall performance joseph , his club - mate at bath , said : â i have played with george since under 18s and he has always been that kind of player who thrives under pressure and more or less always delivers
he has been outstanding for us in the six nations
â five days from now , england can win the title using their home advantage and the benefit of playing last and by preying on simmering french doubts
but if â le crunch â turns out to be a tense duel after all , they also need others to follow ford âs lead by finding the mental conviction to make the right calls
the wastefulness ca nât go on , or next time there may not be a trophy to soften the inquest .
