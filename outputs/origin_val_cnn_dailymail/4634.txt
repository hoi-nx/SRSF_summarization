david will be one of the ' awkward squad ' asking searching questions if he is elected as britain 's fifa vice-president , fa chairman greg dyke has claimed
gill , the former manchester united chief executive , is standing against wales ' trefor lloyd hughes for the position , which is being elected by uefa 's 54 members at its congress in vienna on tuesday
greg dyke , who has made clear his opposition to fifa president sepp blatter continuing in the position , said gill would act as a counter-balance to the ' acolytes ' on fifa 's executive committee
the fa chairman said : ' david will be the sort of person who will do the job as a fifa executive committee member properly
he will not be afraid of asking appropriate questions - in fact perhaps fifa needs to have someone from the awkward squad asking tough questions
' he has a strong background in finance so if there are financial questions he will know what to ask and what to look for
david , pictured with sir alex ferguson in 2011 , is running for britain 's fifa vice-president ' there is a feeling that there have been too many acolytes and not enough people asking difficult questions and ensuring that decisions are taken in a transparent , ethical and business - like manner
' michel platini ( uefa president ) was very keen for david to stand for the position and to represent uefa on the fifa executive committee
' gill himself admits that change can not happen overnight
he said : ' i aim to use my skills in football around the table and work with my uefa colleagues to have a greater say and influence in how it operates
in terms of votes it 's quite an important block
' in areas like transparency and decision - making , it 's not going to happen overnight and it 's arguable whether it will happen unless there is a president change
' my personal view is that it needs a change at the top to ensure that the required changes take place
i 'm not naive enough to think i can change things overnight
' fa chairman greg dyke claimed that gill would not be afraid of asking appropriate questions the football association of wales has claimed its english counterparts have reneged on a deal agreed in 2011 which would see a welsh nominee replace northern ireland 's jim boyce as fifa vice-president
gill said the agreement became void after fifa reforms , which saw the britain fifa vice-presidency elected by all uefa members instead of just the four home nations
he added : ' if there was a deal , that then changed after the reforms
it may be semantics but it previously was the britain vice-president of fifa
now it 's uefa electing a fifa vice-president
' we ( the fa ) very clearly took the view , as did uefa , that the 54 countries of uefa will determine that person and i think that makes sense
it 's more democratic to have that person selected by all 54 countries
if there had been that agreement , if it had n't been torn up , then obviously it would be the welsh turn
