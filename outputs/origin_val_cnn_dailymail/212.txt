resplendent in a navy coat with a wildwolf faux fur collar and carrying a bag by irish designer paul costelloe , zara tindall happily posed with fans for some silly selfies this afternoon as she enjoyed a third day of racing action at cheltenham
earlier , she had been spotted with husband mike with both glued to their smartphones as they arrived for the traditional st patrick 's thursday at the annual racing event
zara tindall , a former rugby player , and zara were both chatting away on their mobiles although both put their phones away once they got inside and the racing action kicked off
but today , she was happy to take a back seat , smiling and laughing with her husband as they watched jockey ruby walsh pilot the hotly tipped vautour to first place in the opening race of the day , the jlt novices chase
the queen 's granddaughter has become a familiar face at cheltenham this week , having begun it on tuesday , when she arrived to watch the action in a chic navy coat by paul costelloe , from whom she ordered four separate ensembles for the week of racing
earlier in the day zara and husband mike had been spotted glued to their own smartphones as they arrived at the st patrick 's day event cheerful : zara and mike both looked happy to be at the racecourse and smiled as they made their way inside ladies ' day saw her return to the races for a second time , although she chose to spend the day with friends rather than join her aunt , the duchess of cornwall , in her private box
despite zara 's chic black and grey checked outfit , it was camilla who ended up making a splash , after she bumped into glamour model katie price in the paddock while presenting jockey sam twiston-davies with his trophy following his win in the betway queen mother champion chase
ms katie price , 36 , was in the paddock with her plasterer husband kieran hayler , 27 , and her hairdresser when she spied camilla and promptly sidled up to ask for a photo
sharing a joke : later , zara was spotted laughing happily with friends as she waited for the races to begin taking it seriously : zara is building up a reputation for point - to - point training and last year worked with bay gelding monbeg dude not impressed : zara looked less than impressed with the performance of one of the runners , at one point allowing herself a grimace has one won ? zara and her friends look on as they watch the racing action on st. patrick 's thursday looking good : zara cut an elegant figure in her blue coat , brown boots and matching velvet cocktail hat glamorous : on ladies ' day , zara arrived looking lovely in a neat black and white houndstooth coat and a black fascinator chic : day one saw her dress up in an all - navy ensemble by veteran designer paul costelloe , from whom she has ordered four ensembles unexpected : yesterday saw the duchess of cornwall make headlines after she was accosted in the paddock by glamour model katie price smile ! the model asked for a photo with camilla , with her daughter , laura lopes , also joining the pair for a photo having a chat : camilla also bumped into cooper author cooper who partially based cad rupert campbell-black on her ex-husband family outing : as well as daughter laura lopes , the duchess of cornwall was also joined by her son tom parker-bowles for the day the duchess , who cheerfully obliged , also bumped into another famous face - the author cooper , who famously based her showjumping cad rupert campbell-black on camilla 's ex-husband , andrew parker-bowles
ms cooper , who lives in gloucestershire , is no stranger to the world of racing herself , having immersed herself in it while writing her most recent novel , jump ! , which like all the rutshire chronicles , features campbell-black
today , however , zara , who lives close to the racecourse at gatcomb park , was the only royal in the field and took centre stage while watching the racing with her husband and a group of friends
the presence of the royals notwithstanding , the big highlight of st patrick 's thursday is the pertemps network final , which will see veteran jockey ap mccoy back in the saddle aboard the hotly tipped regal encore
