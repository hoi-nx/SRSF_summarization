human rights campaigners have presented police with a ' dossier ' of new evidence against a bahrain prince accused of torture after he revealed on social media he was staying in london
prince nasser , 27 , accidentally let slip he was back in uk on thursday when he posted a video of himself running in hyde park
the prince posted the video on instagram alongside a squadron of the life guards of the household cavalry with the caption : ' that 's how it feels and sounds when you run in hyde park , london
' prince nasser posted this video of himself running in hyde park on thursday the video was captioned : ' that 's how it feels and sounds when you run in hyde park , london ' he now faces fresh calls for his arrest following a high court ruling last year which stripped him of diplomatic immunity
a bahrain refugee in uk , referred to only as ff , alleged prince nasser was involved in the torture of detained prisoners during 2011 arab spring protests
today the independent reported human rights lawyers acting for ff have delivered a ' dossier ' of new evidence to scotland yard in a bid to have him charged following the revelation he is visiting the capital
previous allegations which gave rise to the diplomatic immunity row did not stick
no charges were brought against him due to a lack of evidence and both he and the government of bahrain strongly deny the accusations
the case arose after ff , who has been granted asylum in the uk , claims he was badly beaten - though not by the prince directly - and given a prison sentence after taking part in protests in the gulf state in february 2011 which left dozens dead
following the decision to revoke his diplomatic immunity in october last year , a spokeswoman for the government of bahrain said : ' as the uk dpp has today affirmed , an arrest would have been improper given the absence of evidence of the conduct alleged
' as bahrain has never sought anonymity or sovereign immunity from the english courts for anyone in respect of this case , it expresses no view on the dpp 's statement that immunity was inappropriate
' this has been an ill - targeted , politically - motivated and opportunistic attempt to misuse the uk legal system
the government of bahrain again categorically denies the allegations against nasser
' lawyers for prince nasser said : ' the allegations are entirely false and categorically denied by prince nasser
the presentation of the " dossier " to the police appears to be a politically - motivated and opportunistic attempt to use the uk justice system once again to ventilate damaging allegations about prince nasser
' ff stated last october that he intended to submit further evidence to the police , but some five months passed and nothing had been forthcoming until today
the timing of the actions of the campaigners suggests this is nothing more than a publicity stunt designed to coincide with prince nasser 's visit to the uk and ff 's lawyers ' threatening earlier this week to bring judicial review proceedings in respect of the uk - bahrain naval agreement
' the police have previously declined to investigate prince nasser on the basis of the insufficiency of the evidence against him
the submission of this new dossier at this time coincides with other attempts by opposition activists to exploit the uk justice system to influence uk - bahrain relations
' prince nasser , born in may 1987 , is the fourth son of the king hamad bin isa al khalifa and his second wife , sheia bint hasan al-khrayyesh al-ajmi of kuwait
he was educated in bahrain at the ibn khuldoon national school , before commissioning from royal sandhurst military academy in august 2006 , two terms after prince william
during his sovereign 's parade , prince nasser was presented with the king hussein medal , awarded to the overseas officer cadet considered to be the most improved recruit
he currently serves as commander of bahrain 's royal guard and as president of the bahrain olympic committee
bahrain anti-government protesters wait at barriers they had set up for saudi arabia forces called in to prop up the monarchy against demonstrations in 2011
the barrier in the foreground reads : ' down with hamad bin isa al khalifa ' inspired by the arab spring , protesters in bahrain had initially wanted to achieve greater political freedom and equality for the shia muslims who form the majority of the population , as opposed to the ruling sunni royal family
however , following an attack on protesters who had gathered at the pearl roundabout in manama on february 17 , 2011 , demonstrators began to call for an end to hamad bin isa al khalifa 's rule
the following month 1,000 troops from saudi arabia and 500 troops from uae arrived in bahrain to quell the protests , and on march 15 the king of bahrain declared martial law and a three - month state of emergency
a man identified only as ff was later granted refugee status in the uk , and from there , set about trying to bring charges against prince nasser
claiming the prince should be held responsible for his beating and imprisonment during the turmoil , his accusations were stopped when the prince was granted diplomatic immunity
in october last year , this was overturned , creating the possibility - albeit an unlikely one - that he could be charged when travelling outside bahrain
however , these charges collapsed due to a lack of evidence .
