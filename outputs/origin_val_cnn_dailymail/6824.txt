no free speech : pate was arrested in abu dhabi last month after complaining about his uae employer on facebook - a violation of the country 's law against slandering an employer a hallmark of american life - griping about work - has landed a florida man in a middle eastern jail
pate , a helicopter mechanic from belleair bluffs , florida , took to facebook after a dispute over sick leave with the company he was working for in the uae
he was home in florida at the time , but when he returned to abu dhabi last month , he was told to report to the police station , where he was arrested for breaking an emirates law on slandering his employer
he spent about 10 days in jail , he said , and is now free on bail awaiting a march 17 trial
his supporters say he faces up to five years in prison and a steep fine if convicted
' i just could n't register it in my head because as an american growing up in the american , the first amendment right is just ingrained in my brain , ' he said in a phone interview wednesday
' i never even entertained the fact that i would wind up in prison out here for something i put on facebook in the american
' pate , 30 , said the incident stemmed from a trip to florida in december
during his return he spent the holidays with family and proposed to his girlfriend , cardoza , but also was trying to get treatment for a back injury
there was disagreement with his bosses about extending his leave to see a doctor , he said , and after a particularly unsatisfactory phone call with them , he took to a facebook
he says he ca n't remember precisely what he wrote , but knows he called his bosses ' backstabbers ' and warned other contractors not to work for them
he did n't give the rant much thought until he was back in the persian gulf , where he planned to handle paperwork to end his employment as well as empty his apartment and sell his car
soon after , he says he received a call from police telling him to come to the station , where officers showed him screen shots of his comments
pulled apart : pate ( left ) had just proposed to his girlfriend cardoza ( right ) when he was arrested by authorities in the uae
his trial is set to begin on march 17 ' i 'm being arrested
i love you , ' cardoza said he texted her from the station
pate 's congressman , rep. jolly , intervened on his constituent 's behalf , lobbying the state department and emirates officials for help
in a letter to the uae attorney general , jolly emphasized respect for the sovereignty of the country , but argued because the posts occurred while pate was on american soil , those laws should n't apply
' it is deeply troubling that mr. pate now faces judicial proceedings over an action that was done legally in his home country , ' the republican said
the emirati embassy in washington said it did not have much information about the case and could n't comment
an after - hours email to the company , global aerospace logistics , did not get an immediate reply
pate said he 's trying not to think too much about the sentence he could face
he says he 's remorseful for letting his emotions get the best of him
