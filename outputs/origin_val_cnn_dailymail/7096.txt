compare and contrast these two manager quotes about welbeck from this season
the uncompromising louis van gaal , asked in november whether he still thought it was a good idea to sell the in - form welbeck to arsenal on deadline day , said : ' i do n't have to prove that [ i was right ]
' why do i have to prove that ? i have already said what i think - he was not a line - up player , he was more a substitute than a line - up player
welbeck trains ahead of his return to man utd with arsenal in the fa cup sixth round the england striker has been reduced to a bit - part role in recent weeks , spending time on the bench louis van gaal wrote welbeck off as not good enough for the man utd first team ' he was already , with different coaches , not a line - up player , but then with mr van gaal , the world is changing ? no the world is not changing
they are not my facts , they are the facts of welbeck
' and wenger , speaking on the impact of welbeck just the other day : ' he 's very important and has played many , many games since the start of the season
' i think he 's played in nearly every single game
his position is one of the three up front , central , left or right
' so welbeck has apparently gone from a condemned man at man utd , destined to rot away on the bench , to a versatile and indispensable part of arsenal 's team
but , as the england striker returns to old trafford for the first time for monday night 's crunch fa cup sixth - round tie , has he actually fared that well at the emirates ? welbeck celebrates a goal for man utd against west ham under david moyes last season welbeck was given a chance to impress on man utd 's pre-season tour of the united states well , at the time of van gaal 's outburst , just ahead of man utd 's away match with arsenal on november 22 , he had every reason to be tetchy
while man utd had endured their worst start to a season in living memory , welbeck had made light of his Â£ 16m transfer fee
given regular football by wenger at the head of arsenal 's attack , he looked revitalised , a player brimming with confidence who looked on course to score 20 goals this season for his new team
just days after his move , welbeck scored two for england in their 2 - 0 european qualifying win in switzerland , before he opened his gunners account in a 3 - 0 win at aston villa
the highlight was a hat - trick in arsenal 's 4 - 1 champions league win over galatasaray , a performance praised by wenger as ' electric '
wenger was thrilled with welbeck 's early performances in an arsenal shirt welbeck 's best performance in an arsenal shirt was a hat - trick against galatasaray in the champions league welbeck pictured here completing his treble against the turkish side at the emirates back in october man utd 2008 - 09 13 appearances , 3 goals 2009 - 2010 11 appearances , 2 goals 2011 - 12 39 appearances , 12 goals 2012 - 13 40 appearances , 2 goals 2013 - 14 36 appearances , 10 goals 2014 - 15 3 appearances , 0 goals arsenal 2014 - 15 20 appearances , 7 goals at that point , it was all looking very awkward for van gaal
events since then have made him feel a little better , if not entirely vindicated
welbeck has scored just three more goals for arsenal since the galatasaray match
there have been mitigating circumstances though
welbeck suffered a thigh injury and missed the whole of january , his absence coinciding with a return to form for olivier giroud
by the time welbeck had rediscovered his fitness , wenger found it very difficult to take the frenchman out of the forward position
so welbeck 's versatility has become something of a curse
when he plays , he is stuck out on the wing , a position he is less effective in
when he left for north london , he said : ' i prefer to play through the middle
once i get into the box and am getting the chances , i have got faith in my ability
' and , at this pivotal stage of the season , his game time has dried up as well
arsenal are prospering without him
welbeck 's Â£ 16m move to arsenal led to a resurgence in form for england too welbeck 's last goal for the gunners came in the win over west ham just after christmas welbeck was left on the bench during the win over leicester and he was brought on for mere cameos in the wins over everton and queens park rangers
so the 24 - year - old returns to old trafford with plenty to prove
he believed arsenal was a club that would advance his career but evidence of this has so far been in short supply
however , earning champions league qualification and winning the fa cup for arsenal - the two things van gaal craves so dearly this season - would certainly make him feel better .
