x factor star cheryl fernandez-versini has joined fellow geordie tv celebs ant and dec in questioning whether she can still vote labour
the pop superstar said it was ' hard ' for her because all her friends and family supported the party - but said she already paid ' a f * * * * * * lot of tax ' and needed to listen to what the other parties said
mrs fernandez-versini , who has built up an estimated Â£ 20million fortune , said she was now a mature woman and felt a greater responsibility to be well - informed about politics
cheryl fernandez-versini said mr ed miliband proposed mansion tax on homes worth more than Â£ 2million would ' f * * * me over ' it came after ' staunchly labour ' tv stars ant and dec attacked the labour leader ed miliband and questioned whether they could vote for him
other celebrities , including myleene klass , angelina jolie , sol campbell and bill oddie have also publicly criticised the labour over the proposed mansion tax on expensive homes
but the popular x factor judge 's remarks are likely to particularly sting because of her life - long support for the labour
cameron and george osborne have also made tax cuts the centre of their pitch for re-election
the tories want to clear the government 's Â£ 90billion deficit without any tax rises - while labour has called for the rich to pay more
mr ed miliband has pledged to restore the 50p tax rate on those who earn more than Â£ 150,000 , introduce an annual levy on homes worth more than Â£ 2million - dubbed the mansion tax - and raise the point at which high earners start paying 40 per cent of their income to the government
mrs fernandez-versini told the telegraph 's stella magazine that she would ' listen ' more carefully to other parties now that she paid so much in tax
the ' crazy stupid love ' singer also suggested she could ' make my own party ' adding that ' stranger things have happened '
' it 's hard for me , because all my friends and family vote labour , ' she said
asked if she would consider voting for cameron , she replied : ' not really
i want to hear what everyone 's got to say
' i 've always been labour all my life but i want to hear what they 've got to say for myself
now that i 'm a mature woman
' i feel like a greater responsibility now to vote for who runs our country
and i pay a f * * * * * * lot of tax
so i think that i need to have a really well - informed , well - educated opinion
' the ' staunchly labour ' tv stars ant and dec attacked mr ed miliband and questioned whether they could vote for him the x factor darling has built up a fortune since her pop career took off after being voted onto the pop band girls aloud on the 2002 tv show , popstars the rivals
despite growing up on a council estate as one of five children in newcastle , she now earns a reported Â£ 2million a year as a judge on x factor and face of l'oreal
last year , she married french playboy jean bernard fernandez versini - who owns pop - up bar cosy box in cannes
it came after she divorced england footballer ashley cole in 2010 citing â unreasonable behaviour â after numerous allegations of cheating on his part
despite her wealth mrs fernandez-versini said there were ' big downsides that come with having money '
ed miliband 's proposed mansion tax has been attacked by a string of celebrities she said : ' as many as with not having money
i mean , they 're different types of stresses , but they 're both stresses
' mrs fernandez-versini later claimed on twitter that her remarks had been taken out of context , adding : ' i am a labour supporter , but will always want to hear what everyone has to say
' her comments come after presenter myleene klass attacked mr ed miliband over the policy , claiming it would hit ' little grannies ' whose homes had increased in value over decades , rather than the super rich
actress angelina jolie said she could be ' put off ' from moving to britain by the proposal , which would come in this year if labour wins on may 7
mr ed miliband was left bruised after and and dec questioned whether he was up to be prime minister
donnelly , 39 , said he had always voted labour but was unimpressed with mr ed miliband
he said : ' i 'm not sure i could picture him [ ed miliband ] as prime minister
' his britain 's got talent co-star ant mcpartlin â also 39 â said the pair were ' staunchly labour ' but did n't know if they could vote labour under mr ed miliband
the remarks appear to echo public concern over mr ed miliband 's leadership , with just 80 days until the election
according to the latest polls , more than half the public think mr ed miliband is doing a bad job â with less than a quarter happy with his leadership
his overall approval rating has slumped to minus 29
this is stark contrast to cameron â who splits opinion down the middle , according to the pollsters opinium
the pm has a net approval rating of minus one
despite mr cameron 's personal advantage , labour continue to be ahead by two points in the polls â on 35 per cent , compared to the tories who are stuck on 33 per cent
ant and dec , speaking to the times , said they followed politics ' keenly ' , but were disillusioned with labour and the tories
mr ant mcpartlin said : ' i voted labour all my life
but last election i voted tory because i was thoroughly disillusioned with the labour government
' now i 'm thoroughly disillusioned with a coalition government
i feel we 're both staunchly labour and would vote labour if we could , but i do n't know what their philosophy is any more
' mr donnelly added : ' i 'm not sure i could picture him [ ed miliband ] as prime minister
