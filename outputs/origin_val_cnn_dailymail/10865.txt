the notorious underarm delivery that created one of the most controversial moments in world cricket history is still hard to revisit after more than three decades
but as australia and new zealand go head - to - head in the world cup final at the melbourne cricket ground on sunday , the underarm bowling incident from 1981 will inevitably come back to haunt
the controversial bowl triggered a cold war between the two nations after the infamous day on february 1 when new zealand needed six runs with one ball remaining to draw the match
but aussie skipper greg chappell instructed the bowler , who was his younger brother trevor , to deliver the ball underarm in a bid to prevent batsman brian mckechnie any chance of hitting a six
australia went on to win the match but the hell that followed left the greg chappell brothers struggling to cope under the pressure from the backlash
despite the underarm bowling was not ruled as illegal at the time , it was deemed ' an act of cowardice ' and against the true spirit of cricket that cost new zealand the tournament
aussie bowler trevor chappell , right , bowls underarm to new zealand batsman brian mckechnie on the last ball of a one - day international from which new zealand needed to hit six runs to force a tie trevor chappell bowls under - arm , as ordered by brother greg chappell at the melbourne cricket ground in 1981 but new zealand fast bowler southee , who was two - years - old at the time of the underarm incident , said the infamous bowl is rarely mentioned
' i guess a few of us were too young to remember seeing it but we know it happened , ' southee said at a conference on friday
' i have nât heard too much about the underarm
' while new zealand prepares ahead of their first ever world cup final on sunday , aussie skipper michael clarke has announced his retirement from one - day cricket on the eve of the match
the 33 - year - old reached closure on the decision upon realising there was no chance he 'd still be leading the side in four years .
