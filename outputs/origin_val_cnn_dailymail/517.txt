for decades their names have been at the heart of britain life but cadbury , heinz and marks & spencer have now dropped off the list of our favourite â superbrands â
instead , john lewis , lego and hã¤agen-dazs are seen as integral parts of the country âs fabric
dyson and virgin atlantic are also new entries in the top 20 most popular big brands â an annual survey of 2,500 shoppers by market analysts at the centre for brand analysis
love lost : cadbury , heinz and marks & spencer have now dropped off the list of britain 's top 20 favourite â superbrands â , having been replaced by john lewis , lego , virgin atlantic and hã¤agen-dazs topping the chart for the second year running is british airways , followed by rolex , which was founded in london in 1905
cadbury was last year no 11 but does not even feature this year â following a string of controversies since it was taken over by us company kraft in 2010
the most recent public backlash came a few weeks ago when it changed the recipe of creme eggs and shrank the size of their multipacks
heinz â famed for its baked beans , tomato ketchup and tinned soups â has also slipped off the list after appearing at no 5 last year
it is not known why the company , which has always been us - owned , is falling out of favour with britain
what 's not to love : ice cream brand hã¤agen-dazs is new on the top - 20 superbrands list but our increasing curiosity in more exotic flavours and dishes could be one reason
however , the demise of marks & spencer , which was no 18 in 2014 , will be particularly painful for its bosses , especially as rival john lewis has leapt into the chart at no 6
marks & spencer has endured three difficult years , fuelled by poor sales of its womenswear and teething troubles with its new website
virgin atlantic makes its first appearance at no 20 but has some way to go before catching up with winner british airways
just last week , british airways âs parent company iag said it expected profits to surge 20 per cent to around Â£ 1.6billion this year
the firm âs share price hit an all - time high as a result
stephen cheliotis , chief executive of the centre for brands analysis , said : â british airways retaining the no 1 spot is a great example of a much - loved traditional brand that has also refreshed , refocused on innovation and invested to remain attractive and relevant
â it is winning out , while newer innovators , such as google , go in reverse , as the shine comes off
â the internet giant has slipped from no 7 to 18 , while apple â the richest company in the world and best - known for its computers and mobile phones â is at a relatively lowly 10
both have suffered a backlash over accusations they have failed to pay a fair share of their taxes in the britain .
