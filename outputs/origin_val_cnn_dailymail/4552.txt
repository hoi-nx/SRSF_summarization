but the 68 - year - old has vowed to stand again , despite major heart operations and spending time in a mental health unit
he told bbc news : ' i 'm going to stand for sure , i 've made this decision because my health is so much better and i think i owe it to a lot of people who have supported me
' once you 've been an mp for as long as i have it 's hard to just walk away
' i think if enough people realise that i 'm like everyone , i 'm a fallible human being who made a mistake but paid a very high price for it ... i think i could [ win ]
' it pitches him against lib dem candidate gerald vernon-jackson , who faces a challenge from the tories and ukip
