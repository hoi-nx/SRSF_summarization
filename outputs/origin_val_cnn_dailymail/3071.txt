' she added : ' i want my children to have options - if they want to go down the pretty girl , traditional route and grow up to have a family then i 'll be proud
' if they 'd prefer a career , no children or to play with toys that are n't supposed to be for girls then i 'm equally as proud
' i do n't want them hampered by expectations that tell them how they should behave as girls - i want them to be able to do whatever they want to do and become strong women
