everyone has settled down in front of the television or into their bed at some point only to realise they have left the kitchen light on
now a new gadget will allow homeowners to flip their lights on and off using their mobile phone , without having to change all their current light fittings and switches
engineers have developed a device that attaches on top of traditional light switches to enable them to be turned on and off from anywhere in the home
switchmate can be controlled using a mobile phone app over bluetooth and uses a physical toggle inside the device to move the light switch
imagine walking into your living room after a stressful day at work , to find the lights automatically dim themselves to suit your mood
it might sounds like the stuff of science fiction , but this is already possible , thanks to a gadget called muse
the device , which went on sale in the uk this week , is designed to track people âs brain waves , in the same way that fitness trackers count the number of steps a person has taken , or monitor their heart rate
users wear a plastic headband across their forehead , with sensors at the front and above the ears , to track their brain activity
this information is then beamed via bluetooth to the user âs mobile phone or computer , where it is â translated â into an image of a summer âs day in the country
people who have lots on their mind will see clouds rolling across the screen , whilst those who manage to empty their thoughts will be met by a clear blue sky
the product , developed by ariel garten , a canada neuroscientist and former fashion designer , launched in north america last year , and is designed to help people relax
it can also be linked to lighting and heating systems , in order to change the feel of a room depending on the user âs mood
according to peng , co-founder of california - based switchmate , the device works like a robotic finger for the lights in your home
the app can be used to set timers so the lights come on at prearranged times or proximity so lights turn on when you walk into a room with your phone
mr peng said : ' switchmate allows you to remotely control your lights via your smart phone , but you can still press the button on the switchmate face plate to manually flip the switch
' a lot of our users set timers to make their homes look occupied when they are away , great for making your home safer when you are on vacation
' you can also have the proximity setting on such that as you approach your home , your lights will turn on automatically for you
' many smart lighting solutions either require switches to be rewired but recently some manufacturers have developed smart bulbs that can connect to mobile phones
however , these take the light switch out of the loop entirely , meaning lights need to be left in the ' on ' position all the time for the bulb to work
switchmate attaches to the outside of the light switch using magnets and has a button on its face allowing lights to be turned on and off as usual
this means that should their mobile phone run out of batteries or they are unable to connect to the device , they can still turn their lights on and off
the developers , who raised $ 139,000 in a successful funding crowdfunding campaign on indiegogo , are also now working on a version that connects to the internet
the battery powered switchmate uses a physical toggle inside the device to flip traditional wall mounted light switches ( shown above ) - working like a robotic finger than can be controlled using a mobile phone app this means residents can turn their lights on and often while even while they are abroad on holiday
switchmate is apparently compatible with two types of light switch - traditional flat ' rocker ' switches and toggle switches
the developers say the device is also thin enough to be used on switches on multiple switch face plates and the battery will last between eight to twelve months
the team behind switchmate are currently taking pre-orders with a single unit costing $ 49 ( Â£ 32 )
however , at that price , it means kitting out the average home is unlikely to be cheap
the device is currently only available in the us and canada , but mr peng said they hoped to have it available in other countries soon
it also can not currently be used to control lights that use dimmer switches
switchmate can be used with two different switch types - toggle switches ( left ) and rocker switches ( right ) the developers say switchmate will be available in three different colours - gold , silver and white ( all above ) the device ( shown above ) can still be used like a traditional light switch by pressing the button in the middle mr peng said they are hoping to develop new features in the coming months
he said : ' we designed switchmate to make your lights smart in seconds - it snaps onto your existing light switch with magnets , connects to your phone , and allows you to automate your lights just like that
' because it just snaps over your light switch anyone can do it , and you can take it with you when you move in the future
' switchmate allows you to remotely control your lights via your smart phone , but you can still press the button on the switchmate face plate to manually flip the switch
