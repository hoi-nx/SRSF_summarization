iran 's supreme leader ayatollah khamenei on thursday accused the six world powers involved in negotiations over iran 's nuclear program of " deception , trickery and backstabbing " in their dealings with tehran , according to iranian state media
he also criticized a letter sent by 47 u.s. republican senators to iran 's leaders , which threatened to scupper any deal if a republican president is elected next year , iran 's official press tv reported
" of course , i 'm concerned because the other side is into deception , trickery and backstabbing , " ayatollah khamenei is quoted as saying in a speech in tehran
he suggested that the letter was part of a u.s. strategy of last - minute reversal aimed at undermining a comprehensive deal covering iran 's nuclear ambitions , press tv said
" this is part of their ploys and tricks , " said ayatollah khamenei
iran faces a march 24 deadline to reach a deal over its nuclear program
several interim agreements have been made in recent months , though a long - term pact so far has been elusive
the six world powers -- the u.s. , russia , china , the united kingdom and france , plus germany , a group known as the p5 +1 -- are seeking a deal that will ensure that iran does n't develop nuclear arms
officials in tehran have publicly insisted they want a nuclear program for energy purposes , not to create atomic weaponry
the republican senators ' decision to write to iran 's leaders has stirred up a political firestorm in the u.s.
u.s. secretary of state kerry denounced the letter wednesday at a senate foreign relations committee hearing , calling it a breach of " more than two centuries of precedent " and factually incorrect
did 47 republican senators break the law in plain sight ? " it purports to tell the world that if you want to have any confidence in your dealings with u.s. , they have to negotiate with 535 members of congress , " kerry said
" that is both untrue and a profoundly bad suggestion to make
" sen. tom cotton , a freshman republican from arkansas , penned the letter , which asserted that a lasting agreement would need congressional support
he was n't shy about his attempts to undermine the obama administration 's negotiations with iran and said tuesday that the letter is " about stopping iran from getting a nuclear deal
