their arrests came after an investigation by the education funding agency which found that more than Â£ 86,000 of funds given to the school had ' not been used for its intended purpose '
claims included reimbursements for first class plane tickets , furniture and parties , the report found
' having carefully considered all of the evidence presented to us , we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence to charge daud khan ( former director of finance ) and shabana hussain ( former head of department ) with a range of offences relating to their involvement with the kings science academy , bradford , and that it is in the public interest to do so , ' julian briggs , from cps yorkshire and humberside , said
' accordingly , i have today authorised west yorkshire police to charge daud khan with two offences of fraud by abuse of position and three of false accounting , and shabana hussain with one offence of fraud by abuse of position and one offence of acquiring criminal property
