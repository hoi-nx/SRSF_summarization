president obama today said the investigation into police in ferguson , missouri , has exposed a ' broken and racially biased system ' as he prepared to mark a half - century since ' bloody sunday '
addressing a south carolina town hall , the 53 - year - old leader also said the inquiry - launched in the wake of michael brown 's 2014 death - has revealed an ' oppressive and abusive ' police situation
' it turns out they were n't just making it up
this was happening , ' obama said , making reference to the justice department 's damning report on blacks - targeted racial bias in the st louis suburb
he told a room of both young and old attendees that ferguson must now decide how to move forward , adding that america 's top goal should be to prevent similar circumstances elsewhere
obama 's comments at south carolina 's benedict college come the day before he leads this weekend 's 50th anniversary of ' bloody sunday ' , when police beat scores of people marching from selma , alabama , to montgomery , the state capital , to protest against their lack of voting rights
the violent images broadcast on tv helped lead to passage of the voting rights act of 1965
during today 's gathering , obama made his most expansive comments yet about the justice department report , which found systemic racial bias created a ' toxic environment ' in ferguson
the president , who arrived at columbia metropolitan airport on air force one earlier today , said it was striking investigators had merely had to look at emails sent by police to find evidence of bias
the report cleared wilson , the white former ferguson police officer who shot to death 18 - year - old michael brown , who was black and unarmed , while he was on duty in the city in august 2014

' he added : ' that was the decision that was made , and i have complete confidence and stand fully behind the decision that was made by the justice department on that issue
' however , in a separate report , federal investigators found patterns of racial profiling , bigotry and profit - driven law enforcement and court practices within the ferguson police department
shockingly , obama himself was the subject of some of the racist emails from ferguson police and municipal courts employees that were uncovered in the investigation
a 2008 email said obama would not be president for long because ' what black man holds a steady job for four years , ' while another depicted the politician as a chimpanzee

he called for communities to work together to address tensions between police and locals without succumbing to cynical attitudes that say ' this is never going to change , because everybody 's racist
' ' that 's not a good solution , ' obama said
' that 's not what the folks in selma did
' during his speech at the college , the president also hinted at what he will speak about on edmund pettus bridge tomorrow , which is the 50th anniversary of the 1965 selma - to - montgomery march
he said the commemoration is as much about stirring young people to change as it is about honoring past legends - and about ' the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things '
' selma is not just about commemorating the past , it 's about honoring the legends who helped change this country through your actions today , in the here and now , ' obama said
' selma is about the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things because they believe they can change the country , they can shape our nation 's destiny
' selma 's about each of us asking ourselves what we can do to make america better
and historically , it 's been young people like you who help lead that march
' he added : ' it was young people who stubbornly insisted on justice ' , noting that one of the most famous leaders of the selma march - now georgia rep. john lewis - was just 23 at the time

he explained : ' i think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down , and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they 're protecting and serving all people and not just some
