former pm blair was given an award for his ' global legacy ' by save the children last year save the children has apologised over its decision to give blair an award for his ' global legacy ' after a furious public backlash
justin forsyth , the charity 's chief executive , said he was ' very sorry ' for those upset by the decision , but insisted it was only meant to mark his work in africa and not his entire time in number 10
mr justin forsyth , a former downing street aide , admitted it would have been ' wrong ' to give an award to the former pm for his political legacy rather than for his work on international aid
mr blair was handed an award for spending billions of taxpayers ' money on foreign aid at a star - studded ceremony in new york last year
the former pm , who set uk on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of gdp on overseas aid , was given the charity 's global legacy award in recognition of his leadership in international development
but the award sparked widespread fury when it was announced in november
more than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the award to be rescinded and around 500 saved the children staff members have reportedly backed a similar petition
questioned about the award on the bbc 's today programme this morning , mr justin forsyth said : ' i know that many of our supporters and volunteers were very upset and our staff , several of our staff too , and i 'm very sorry for that
' he said the decision had been made by the uk charity 's ' sister organisation ' in the us and insisted the award was only for his africa work
mr justin forsyth said : ' yes , it was a global legacy award
but actually it was an award very , very specifically for blair 's efforts on africa at two g8 summits at birmingham and gleneagles , not his wider legacy
' and if it had been for his wider legacy i think it would be wrong , but it was for something quite specific that helped africa and children
' i 'm sorry it 's upset so many people
it 's not really what we do at save the children
what we 're really doing is on the ground in syria with the ebola treatment centre in sierra leone â that 's the work we do
' this has been really an unnecessary distraction
i do apologise to those people that it 's upset

mr justin forsyth was recruited to number 10 by mr blair to help with work on poverty and climate change
he then became one of gordon brown 's senior advisers before joining save the children
as prime minister , mr blair set up the department for international development and hosted a series of aid summits
critics say uk 's foreign aid budget â which hit Â£ 11.4billion last year â has led to a string of perverse outcomes , including spending millions in countries such as india which can afford its own space programme
accepting his award last year , mr blair said : ' from the beginning of humankind there has been brutality , conflict , intrigue , the destructive obsession with a narrow self - interest
' but throughout all human history , never has been extinguished that relentless , unquenchable desire to do good
to act not only in self - interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it
' at the time , a spokesman for save the children said : ' the uk 's achievement of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international aid in 2014 is the culmination of work started under [ mr blair 's ] leadership
