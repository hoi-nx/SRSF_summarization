the trio also taunted the victim with a pizza cutter in what was described as like a scene from reservoir dogs
lorraine earles , 47 , natalie lilley , 19 , leah white , 22 , along with male defendant brendan teale , 27 , had plotted revenge on the victim for allegedly seeing several women at a time and lured him to a flat in scarborough before strapping him to a chair
natalie lilley , who appeared at york after admitting torturing a man in a scene like the film reservoir dogs the three women and one man then carried out a prolonged attack on the victim , who was also forced to drink liquid wash before having the hot curling tongs pressed to his genitals
york crown court heard one of his tormentors also burnt him with a cigarette lighter as the others laughed and giggled
during the torture he also had a pizza cutter pressed to his cheek and was punched , kicked and slapped repeatedly
the court heard lorraine earles bit the man 's ear , pushed his head down to his knees and used a cigarette lighter to burn the back of his neck , before threatening to suffocate him as she put a scarf around his mouth
she then ordered leah white to burn his genitals with hair curling tongs before pulling the chair back , causing him to fall backwards onto the floor
leah white , who also took part in the attack , which saw the man have burning hot hair tongs pressed on his genitals the frightening escalation of the assault prompted leah white and natalie lilley to alert brendan teale , who was reputedly the ringleader of the assault and took part in the beating , but had retired to a bedroom before lorraine earles upped the ante in a scene reminiscent of the bloody quentin tarantino film
brendan teale untied the victim and picked him up off the floor , then went back to the bedroom and fell asleep , while lorraine earles nodded off on a sofa
leah white then took the flat door keys out of his pocket and released the victim , whose blackberry phone had been stolen and later pawned by teale
the four torture suspects were later arrested after the victim 's step - mother called police
york crown court heard each blamed one another for the sickening attack but brendan teale and lorraine earles were found to be the main protagonists
the four suspects were originally charged with falsely imprisoning the man on november 10 , 2013 , but this was eventually dropped by the crown prosecution service and they each pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm
they appeared for sentence on friday , when the court heard that brendan teale - who has previous convictions for assault and battery - had been smoking cannabis on the day in question
after being bailed by police , he went on to commit a burglary and was also charged with handling stolen goods taken in a separate raid
leah white , who had once been in a relationship with the victim , and natalie lilley , a mother - of - one on benefits , both had clean records up until the attack
barrister andrew temple , for teale , said the defendants had lured the man to the flat to teach him a lesson for allegedly seeing several women at the same time , but he claimed that lorraine earles had been the ' main player ' in the torture scene
laura addy , for earles , said her client had severe mental health issues and was under teale 's spell
york crown court , pictured , heard how as the victim 's burnt him with a cigarette lighter the others laughed and giggled
leah white 's defence barrister glen parsons said she had acted ' wholly out of character ' under orders from others
' ' her role was to use the ( curling ) tongs but she insisted they were n't on full heat , ' he added
recorder bernard gateshill told the defendants : ' you all participated in an attack upon ( the victim ) which was designed to embarrass and humiliate him
' lorraine earles , of scarborough , was spared a jail sentence because she had spent five months on remand and was ' clearly a troubled woman with a history of psychological difficulties '
