the first rule of brazil versus chile is : you do not talk about brazil versus chile
the second rule of brazil versus chile is : you do not talk about brazil versus chile
brazil may have come away with a 1 - 0 win through roberto firmino âs second - half strike , but this match between two south american rivals was more like a scene from cult â 90s film fight club , in which brad pitt and ed norton get normal men kicking lumps out of each other every week , than the showpiece friendly expected
as the film goes , the third rule of fight club : someone yells stop , goes limp , taps out , the fight is over
no - one told the chileans players as they repeatedly floored neymar with challenge after challenge after challenge

here at the emirates it was 11 on 11
the first savage blow came three minutes in
brazilians enforcer souza crunched sanchez
somewhere , arsenal manager arsene wenger winced and knew it would be a nervy 90 minutes watching his star player
it was clear this was going to be a â friendly â in the very loosest terms
miiko albornoz was next in referee martin atkinson âs book , nailing neymar twice in a matter of minutes as the chileans competed against each other for how many times they could take out brazil âs star man
gary medel tried the hardest , taking him down in a challenge then standing back up on his calf
the former cardiff defender was lucky to remain on the pitch , perhaps helped by neymar writhing around as if he had been tasered
' they did nât get much protection , ' dunga said of his players â treatment after the game
on gary medel âs stamp , he added : ' the decision is the referee âs
chile has a great team , very dynamic , great fighting , but some players make mistakes
these days we have 300 cameras focusing on the action so you have to play football
there âs no other solution
' there were flashes of quality and skill , from sanchez and neymar mainly , the pair sending either side of the stadium into raptures of screeching and screaming with their every touch
on 37 minutes , neymar scooped the ball out of an opponent âs reach , which prompted their best chance of the first - half
the ball made its way to marcelo and he crossed for douglas costa to the right of goal , who controlled the ball with his chest but could only volley over
neymar also came close with an in - swinging free kick from out on the right after 26 minutes , which almost tucked into the far right post before claudio bravo tipped it wide
early in the half sanchez took a lovely touch to get clear and raced into the box , but was eventually blocked out
the first 45 minutes were brought to a close by fernandinho flying in with studs raised only to find air and neymar being booked for tripping gonzalo jara
if anyone was expecting anything different in the second - half , they were duly disappointed 100 seconds into it when mauricio isla went through the back of neymar , who was down clutching his ankles yet again
sanchez started taking the game by the scruff of the neck , while the others were too busy taking each other by it , and making things happen
the international friendly between brazil abd chile added a bit of south american flare to proceedings in a rain drenched north london arsenal forward sanchez sprints away from thiago silva ( left ) on the emirates pitch he has become very familiar with brazil manager dunga passes on instructions to his right back danilo as he watches his side take on south american rivals chile he got the wrong side of miranda on 63 minutes and was brought down , earning the brazil defender a yellow card
three minutes later he beat three men before being tripped by substitute willian and moments later he was spinning and shimmying past more again
the resulting free kicks , however , were poor
finally , after 72 minutes of the match , there was a chance of real note - and the brazilians âs scored it
substitute firmino was played through by a wonderful pass from right - back danilo and he rounded the goalkeeper to score
dunga was satisified with victory , he said : ' it 's true chile controlled the game , but we had more chances at goal
so it was n't just luck - we deserved to win
we are building a competitive team , working through obstacles very well , played against a very strong france team , changed six players but stayed stable and strong
' managers across europe with a vested interest in this game would have been relieved to hear the final whistle blow and no major injuries incurred
by the end , seven yellow cards had been brandished and it was incredible there were no reds
but the match is over now and , remember , the first rule of brazil versus chile is : you do not talk about brazil versus chile
