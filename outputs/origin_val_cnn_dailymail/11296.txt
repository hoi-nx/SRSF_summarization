the 42 - year - old former lawyer has been nicknamed ' ms u-turn ' after she softened the government 's approach to the teaching unions and performed a spectacular climbdown on gay marriage , which she opposed before joining the cabinet
but friends say she is only carrying out downing street 's orders to mend fences with the teaching establishment , which mr michael gove derided as ' the blob '
a tory source said last night : ' the prime minister is a big fan of education secretary â he thinks she is doing a good job
' the education secretary confirmed that a future tory government would not allow free schools to make a profit â an idea that was floated by mr michael gove but blocked by the lib dems
free schools legislation allows groups to establish new state - funded schools which are independent of local authorities
as with academies , they do not have to teach the national curriculum

he also insisted he is not trying to block controversial plans to allow a grammar school in kent to expand by opening an ' annexe ' in another town , saying : ' grammar schools are good schools and i like good schools
