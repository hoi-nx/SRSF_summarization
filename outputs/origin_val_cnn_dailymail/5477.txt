a wave of migrants 4,500 years ago left their trace in the dna and languages of modern europeans
this is according to a study that found evidence of this stone age migration by analysing dna of 69 people who lived across europeans between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago
among the shifts in the genetic make - up of ancient europeans they found that dna associated with the yamnaya people appeared strongly in what is now northern germany
researchers have identified a mass migration of kurgan populations ( yamnaya culture ) which went from the russia steppes to the centre of europeans 4,500 years ago
previously , researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the near east , now modern day turkey , brought it to europeans there are two main theories as to how indo-european spread in europeans
the first is the anatolian hypothesis , which claims spread of the language occurred some 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the near east ( currently turkey ) brought it to europeans
the kurgan hypothesis , meanwhile , proposes that the language was spread by nomadic herders of the steppes found to the north of the black and caspian sea
this theory suggests their language spread throughout europeans after the invention of wheeled vehicles , from 6,000 to 5,000 years ago
the yamnaya were herders who lived in the steppe north of the black and aral seas
this injection of dna indicates ' a massive migration into the heartland of europeans from its eastern periphery , ' said the researchers , led by david reich of harvard medical school
such a large - scale influx would likely have affected not just the dna but ancient cultures as well
although genes ca n't determine what people spoke , the researchers argue that their findings could influence the debate about the origins of indo-european tongues
indo - european languages include more than 400 tongues , from modern languages such as english and polish to ancient languages like hittite and sanskrit
basque , which is spoken in south - west france and northern spain , is not indo-european , and may be the only surviving relic of earlier languages once spoken more widely , according to the bbc
linguists have long debated whether indo-european came to europeans with farmers migrating from the middle east or some other group , such as the yamnaya
previously , researchers had believed that indo-european language spread some 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the near east , now modern day turkey , brought it to europeans
the latest study suggests that europeans was first reshaped at this time in what archaeologists call the neolithic revolution
farmers from anatolia travelled north , bringing new technology and language into europeans
this was followed by a second wave of people several thousand years later from what is today ukraine and russia
the latest study suggests that europeans was first reshaped during the neolithic revolution 8,500 years ago
farmers at this time travelled north , bringing new technology and language into europeans
pictured is an early neolithic 35 - 40 year old male from , czech republic , who was part of the first mass migration to europeans as well as genetic evidence , researchers point to the fact that many indo-european share words for things like axles , harness poles , and the wheel
these devices were invented long after the neolithic revolution began in europeans
' major language replacements are thought to require large - scale migration , ' said the authors of the study , which was published monday by the journal nature
' our results make a compelling case for the steppe as a source of at least some of the indo-european in europeans
' garrett , a linguist at the university of california , berkeley , who was not involved in the study , said it was significant that the mass migration occurred at a time some models had previously identified for indo-european expansion
' it fills in a significant piece of a big and interesting puzzle , ' said garrett .
