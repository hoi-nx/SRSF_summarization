hefty bonus : jenkins , who receives Â£ 5.5m a year , was immediately accused of being â out of touch â over the ' pie in the sky ' comments the boss of barclays has called for an end to free banking , claiming the controversial move would be a â step forward â for customers
jenkins , who said he would not make the first move in case it scared off customers , was immediately accused of being â out of touch â
his comments came as the high street giant unveiled another big pay - day for staff
mr jenkins â total package more than tripled from Â£ 1.6million in 2013 to Â£ 5.5million last year
asked whether he would approve of free in - credit bank accounts being outlawed and charges introduced across the board , he said : â i do think that would be a step forward , yes
â it âs difficult to achieve of course because the banks ca nât do that
it would probably have to be regulated or legislated
â he told itv news it was unlikely that any bank would make the first move in case it lost business
john mann , a member of the treasury committee , said last night : â he lives in a different world from the rest of us
people on lower incomes would suffer
this shows how out of touch mr jenkins is , as so many customers value free bank accounts
â mr jenkins came under fire last year when he argued that closing bank branches would lead to a â better customer experience â as current account holders are increasingly banking online
james daley of consumer group fairer finance said his latest comments were â pie in the sky â , adding : â to try and scrap the free in - credit banking system we have now would be incredibly unpopular
' no government would legislate for it â it would be a vote loser because more people benefit from it [ free banking ] than lose out â
but mr jenkins has the support of senior regulators including bank of england deputy governor andrew bailey , who has called free banking a â dangerous myth â â partly due to the confusing array of hefty charges for the millions who go overdrawn
supporters of packaged accounts â which can cost around Â£ 15 a month and typically include â perks â such as travel insurance â also claim banks will be less likely to mis - sell other products
but latest figures from the financial ombudsman show complaints from customers who believe they were mis - sold packaged accounts have soared
royal bank of scotland last week revealed it had set aside Â£ 150million to compensate customers mis - sold packaged accounts
the comments came as the high street giant unveiled another big pay - day for staff ( file picture ) the row came as mr jenkins was forced to defend his decision to accept a Â£ 1.1million bonus for last year , despite cutting 14,000 jobs
the 53 - year - old insisted the decision was â appropriate â , saying : â you have to look at the very significant progress we âve made in the two - and - a - half years that i have been chief executive
â barclays has set aside almost Â£ 1.3billion to pay likely fines for rigging the Â£ 3.5trillion - a - day foreign exchange market
this helped drag down profits by 21 per cent to Â£ 2.3billion
a spokesman for the robin hood tax campaign said : â bonus season has again been dominated by pay controversies , scandals and fines â underlining that too little reform has taken place
