it was , claimed ok ! us , a ' dramatic delivery '
' it 's a girl for duchess ! ' screamed life & style , adding that the birth had been a ' last minute c-section '
accompanied by photos of prince william cradling a baby and crowds outside the lindo wing , the magazine promised details of ' family feuds ' and claimed prince george has already met his ' sister '
unfortunately for the titles , their excitable announcement of the birth of the duchess 's second child has proved somewhat premature
by this point , duchess has totally mastered the art of looking put - together and ladylike ( as if she had any other choice ! )
there 's a reason why her outfits are endlessly replicated everywhere
of course , being royalty has something to do with it , but apart from that , duchess has majorly enviable style so its understandable why so many people want to get a piece of it to call their own
as every pregnant woman knows , it 's next to impossible to look chic and structured as your belly comes in , but duchess pulls it off with ease ! the duchess of cambridge 's coat is amazingly still available over at beulah london for close to one grand
but as we all know , once word gets out about where to buy this jacket , it 's sure to sell out super fast , so buy it while you still can ! if you do n't have the budget of a to - be - princess , one of our picks in the edit below should fit the bill ! libertine-libertine long overcoat at farfetch visit site which we want langdon blazer at need supply co. visit site the row guire wool suiting jacket at saks fifth avenue visit site msgm classic overcoat at farfetch visit site asked to comment on the rumours and whether the duchess has indeed had her second baby , a spokesman for kensington palace said , simply : ' she has n't '
ridiculous though the latest round of us magazine covers are , this is not the first time us publications have run ludicrous stories about the royal family
in 2012 , globe claimed the queen was dying and followed up with allegations of an ' evil plot ' mounted by the duchess of cornwall to seize the throne
unsurprisingly , the queen is still very much alive two years later and no such ' evil plot ' has been uncovered
the duchess of cornwall is a frequent target of the tabloid , which regularly runs stories claiming she is trying to sabotage the duke and duchess of cambridge 's relationship
dramatic delivery : ok ! us breaks the news of the royal birth with claims of a ' dramatic delivery ' panic : life & style says the duchess has had a girl and included lots of dramatic photos taken in 2013 target : the duchess of cornwall is regularly a target for bizarre claims in us tabloids allegations : one paper ran a story that claimed prince of wales is a cross-dresser jealous of his mother 's clothes still alive : the queen , pictured at an investiture ceremony yesterday , was said to be dying in 2012 it has also run specious stories about prince prince of wales ' alleged penchant for cross-dressing and included claims attributed to ' sources ' that the prince of wales is jealous of his mother 's wardrobe
as a result , the tabloid alleged , the duchess had been ' picked to be the next queen ' in place of camilla
most of the paper 's more ridiculous claims remain unpublished in the uk , with the globe among the us tabloids to make their website inaccessible in uk - a move designed to spare them the uk 's stricter libel laws , requirement for accuracy and from the ire of regulating bodies such as ipso
the latest round of bizarre stories , which also include allegations that the royal family was kept out of the delivery room , are unlikely to trouble the duchess herself , who revealed that her due date is in ' mid to late april ' during an engagement on wednesday
she is also expected to join prince william next week for a round of engagements in south london , among them a visit to the stephen lawrence centre in deptford
the centre , which was designed by architect david adjaye obe , is home to the stephen lawrence charitable trust and was set up in memory of stephen , who was murdered by racist thugs in 1993 .
