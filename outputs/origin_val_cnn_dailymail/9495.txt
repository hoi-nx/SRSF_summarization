zaha , left out of gareth southgate 's england under 21 squad this week , earned a standing ovation from the noisy palace fans when he was replaced late on
they are now 11 points above the bottom three and assured of another season in the barclays premier league
pardew , whose side are now above his old club newcastle united in the table , said : ' wilf had a hard game
the stoke city left back erik pieters is a player i tried to sign , he is aggressive and wilf struggled at times
but he still managed to have his moments
' the whole game was a physical but fair
it was almost like a six nations game at times in terms of its toughness
' stoke city boss mark hughes was justifiably angry at the two key decisions that went against his side
' when you see the replay for their penalty , the lad yannick bolasie has got his foot up high above asmir begovic , that is why asmir begovic missed the ball
but the referee deemed it a penalty
it was a key moment and andre marriner missed a lot of things
' the handball ( by joel ward ) was arguably the best save of the match , he has got two hands on it for heavens sake
how that is n't given , i do n't know
' stoke city goalkeeper asmir begovic was adjudged to have fouled yannick bolasie during a colision inside the penalty area asmir begovic was shown a yellow card by referee andre marriner after he was adjudged to have brought down yannick bolasie glenn murray scored from the penalty spot to put palace back on level terms following mame biram diouf 's opener glenn murray , pictured with james mcarthur , celebrates his side 's equaliser after scoring past asmir begovic from 12 yards pardew 's last visit to the britannia stadium in september with newcastle united had ended in defeat and calls for his head
he had an inauspicious start again when charlie adam 's 14th minute free - kick ran through a disorganised palace defence to mame biram diouf who scored from close range
the londoners have won 18 points from losing positions â a barclays premier league best â and they did it again
the early signs were n't good when zaha , ordered to smile more by pardew , shoved geoff cameron after a strong challenge from the american and was booked
but spirits changed when the equaliser arrived
yannick bolasie chased a long pass from james mcarthur and crashed into asmir begovic
stoke city were furious the goalkeeper was penalised but glenn murray ignored the fuss by smashing the spot - kick into the roof of the net
improbably , palace then went ahead when glenn murray flicked on julian speroni 's clearance and zaha accelerated past two defenders to shoot past asmir begovic
his smile must have looked more than a million dollars to chairman steve parish as it effectively guaranteed barclays premier league survival
julian speroni made great saves from mame biram diouf , with his face , and the excellent charlie adam as stoke city chased an equaliser
and mame biram diouf reacted furiously when his shot was blocked illegally by joel ward
