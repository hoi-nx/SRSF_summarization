in the middle of the southern andes is the unexpected magic mountain : a man - made volcano with a stunning waterfall cascading down its side
it 's also the home to the spectacular montaã±a mã¡gica lodge , a luxury hotel in the heart of patagonia 's 300,000 - acre huilo huilo biological reserve
looking as though it 's been plucked straight out of a fairy tale , the hotel is completely made out of wood and stone , and would no doubt be at home as a background set for the hobbit
aside from simply relaxing inside the one of a kind hotel , venturing into the rainforest offers guests the opportunity to spot many unique animals , such as the pudu , which is the world 's smallest at just 13 inches tall
inside , the five - floor hotel boasts an all - natural decor in its 13 small rooms , as well as several hot tubs carved out of gigantic tree trunks , and an intimate bar and restaurant area
but to experience the ' erupting ' hotel , guests will need to brave a swinging rope bridge to enter , as it is only accessible by foot
the inside bar and restaurant is just as beautiful as the exterior , with it 's all - natural wood and stone decor if you 're lucky , you may even spot the adorable 13 - inch pudu deer - the world 's smallest - which lives on the nature reserve the luxury hotel is only accessible by foot and all guests must walk across a suspension bridge in order to reach reception among the activities on offer are mini golf , where the holes are made out of the natural terrain , horseback riding , rafting , plenty of hiking trails and a chance to try the longest zip wire in south america , which runs through the nature reserve at a height of 1,500 feet
montaã±a mã¡gica is part of the larger huilo huilo biological reserve complex , with also includes the interconnected baobab hotel , which can be reached via a suspension walkway , and several other nearby lodges
prices at montaã±a mã¡gica range from Â£ 150 to Â£ 260 per night , which is a steal considering that some neighbouring hotels can go for as high as Â£ 1200 a night
the lodge is located in the 300 - acre region of huilo huilo biological reserve in patagonia
