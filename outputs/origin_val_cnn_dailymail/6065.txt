not only does keeper âs cottage offer a charming family home , it also boasts stables , a tack room , paddock , olympic - size manege ( training area ) and five - and - a - half acres of land to ride on
it âs no surprise then to learn that its current owner is a successful rider and trainer who has horses galloping through her veins â national dressage competitor tahley has represented england and is currently being trained by 2012 olympic gold medal winner carl hester
and the love of all things equine does nât end with her â tahley âs family are horse - mad too
â even on my mum and dad âs wedding day they went off and bought a horse ! â she says
tahley âs determination to compete is so strong that she has even taken to the saddle with a broken leg
â i was at an event and a horse trod on my leg , â she says
her leg was later immobilised with a plaster cast , but that was nât going to stop her
â two weeks later i got a letter asking me to represent england
so i got in the bath and got my cast all wet and soft and pulled it off
i put a bandage on and managed to get into my boots
my leg swelled up horribly but i won a bronze
â tahley and husband john bought keeper âs cottage , near the village of great munden in hertfordshire , eight years ago when they were looking for the perfect place to bring on their best horse , the appropriately named special
since then they have resurfaced the manege , making it perfect in all weathers , increased the number of stables to seven , and installed mirrors and floodlights so a rider can always see how they look as they practise
tahley , who is also a dressage judge , uses the manege to train novice horses and riders
keeper âs cottage itself is an attractive and spacious home â the red - brick house has three bedrooms , a study , family room , drawing room , dining room and office
and there is planning permission for two more bedrooms and a sitting area
â it âs a really characterful house , â says tahley
â you always find new things , like a switch you did nât know existed
â tahley has to cross only one quiet road and then she can go hacking for two hours and not see another
the only interruptions might be steering around a herd of deer
yet this is hertfordshire , and keeper âs cottage is close to the a10 and not far from the a1 and m25

she says keeper âs cottage and its facilities have really benefited special , adding : â the horse completely chillaxes because of the whole environment
â but however special special is , no horse could top tahley âs first , a new forest pony called , again appropriately , topper

â price : Â£ 1.1million location : near great munden , hertfordshire bedrooms : 3 unique features : stables for seven horses , tack room , paddock , olympic - size floodlit and mirrored all - weather manege tahley rode throughout her childhood and says she used every spare minute she had at school to get homework done so she could spend time with horses
and when she and her sister shelly did nât have a horse to ride , they would sit on 35 - gallon drums and pretend they were horses
the sisters â love of anything equine seems only natural since they would nât exist if it were nât for horses
â my dad says he fell in love with mum when he used to watch her climbing over the gate to feed her horses at my grandmother âs stables , â tahley says
tahley âs father justin was renting a house near the riding school in hertford
a physicist by training , he used to run a company in the metals industry but loved being around horses so much that , in his mid- 30s , he retrained to become a farrier , and later became qualified as a fence - builder for showjumping
tahley âs mother susan had less of a conversion â spending all her life around horses has led her to become an expert on horse bloodlines , their potential and breeding , and she has found future champions for tahley
tahley and john are leaving keeper âs cottage to be closer to shelly and susan , who has 35 acres of land
they will run a horses â yard while tahley continues to compete in dressage and train other riders
â i âve loved living here , â she says
â it âs been the best thing ever for my career
