' i was with myrna and she is absolutely thrilled â¦ i am too ! ' he told the paper , which added that there was no information on the baby 's father
joseph morrissey , who was re-elected from behind bars in january , was released from jail last week after completing a sentence for a misdemeanor relating to the sex scandal , which emerged last summer
sex scandal : joseph morrissey , pictured in january , has announced a teenager with whom he is accused of having sex has given birth to a healthy boy
he pleaded no contest to the charges last year to avoid a trial , he had pleaded no contest in december 2014 to contributing to the delinquency of a minor in a sex scandal involving the then - 17 - year - old girl
the plea allowed him to avoid potentially decades behind bars
he had been accused of having sex with the teenager in his law offices - where she worked - and of possessing a naked photo of her , which he also sent to a friend
their alleged relationship emerged after pride 's sisters and father found a nude photo and sexually explicit messages on her phone
they tracked joseph morrissey and pride from a restaurant one night in august 2013 , and then called police , who found the teenager inside his home at midnight
joseph morrissey , a bachelor who has fathered three children with three different women , has denied having sex with the teenager
she has also denied the relationship
joseph morrissey claimed that pride came to his home that night in august 2013 not to have sex , but to get his legal help recovering child support from her father , pride
then earlier this year , he was indicted on four new felony charges for allegedly forging a document relating to payments pride 's father owed her
joseph morrissey allegedly vouched for the document in court and persuaded the girl 's mother to swear to its authenticity as well
behind bars : joseph morrissey is seen leaving jail in barhamsville , virginia on work release in january
he was released last week but now faces four felony charges over allegations he forged court documents the document had been presented in court to support his version of events from the night the girl was found inside his home
it appeared to be a court order showing that pride , myrna 's father , had agreed to pay $ 50 a month into a college fund for his daughter
but prosecutors said there is no court record of any child support order , and that the document ' appears to be a fabrication '
charges : deirdre warren ( pictured ) is also accused of swearing the documents were authentic myrna 's mother , deidre warren , was also indicted on perjury and forgery charges
joseph morrissey faces up to 10 years on each count if convicted
he is preparing for a trial on the charges and pride , who will turn 19 later this month , has appeared at his recent hearings , the times-dispatch reported
joseph morrissey , an attorney known as ' fighting joe ' since his 1993 courthouse fistfight with another lawyer , said earlier this year that the charges are false and he vowed to beat them
' this is a very harmful and mean - spirited blow , but i 'll do what i 've always done
i 'll prevail , ' he said
after his conviction , the four - term democrat announced his resignation under pressure from his colleagues but angered them by running as an independent in the special election called to choose his successor
he won the election in january
that month , the associated press reported that his colleagues largely ignore him
house speaker howell stripped joseph morrissey of his committee assignments , and legislative leaders from both parties are debating whether to censure or expel him
' this is a truly painful and embarrassing chapter for the oldest continuously operating legislative body in the new world , ' howell said after learning of the new charges
' the house will evaluate these new indictments as it pertains to disciplinary action
