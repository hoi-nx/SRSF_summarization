labour leader murphy said he would use cash raised in england to fund a spending splurge north of the border labour murphy has threatened a new Â£ 1billion tax raid on england to fund a fresh spending splurge north of the border
mr murphy said labour would hit bankers with a new â bonus tax â and slash the amount wealthy savers could pay into their pensions tax free
he said labour would use this cash , almost entirely raised in england , for a range of giveaways in scotland
mr murphy said he would introduce a â jobs guarantee â , which mr murphy says will end long - term youth unemployment
about 5,000 young scotland aged 18 - 24 will be eligible for the jobs guarantee in the first year of the scheme
the Â£ 1billion package includes a Â£ 1,000 increase in bursaries for scotland students , a â future fund â worth Â£ 1,600 for every 18 and 19 - year - old in work and free university tuition
the future fund , unveiled at labour 's spring conference , will provide teenagers who do not go to university with Â£ 1,600 to spend on what they â need to get on in life â
mr murphy said : â this is an unprecedented investment in our young people , only made possible by harnessing the wealth of the whole of the uk , including the wealthiest in the city of london
â it is a guarantee of opportunity that the snp ca n't deliver because they do n't believe in redistributing from south to north
â it is a guarantee that the tories wo n't deliver because they do not believe in redistributing from rich to poor
â â this generation of young people has come of age when , for the first time , most parents believe that their children will do worse than they did
' mr murphy added : â while the living standards of those retiring now are greater than previous pensioners , young people 's living standards have stagnated compared to their older siblings and parents
â the economic and social costs of a generation for whom the hope of youth has been replaced with pessimism over the chances of a better future may dog us for years to come
â but it is not too late to turn things around and to make the promise of a better future real
â it is not too late because this generation of young people have been educated for longer and to a higher standard than any previous generation
â murphy said the snp could not match labour 's spending pledge because they wanted to break away from the uk on the jobs guarantee , mr murphy said : â we will use a new tax on the bonuses of bankers here in the city of london and in the uk 's other financial centres
â we will use that funding to guarantee a real job , at at - least minimum wage , and to guarantee training for every young person too
â we offer the guarantee to all young people who are at risk of falling into long - term unemployment
â this will be a scotland jobs guarantee , delivered by a distinct contract in scotland , in partnership with employers , colleges and the scottish government
â snp work and pensions spokeswoman dr eilidh whiteford said : â given that murphy has voted in favour of tuition fees at every turn , scotland 's young people wo n't fall for his empty attempts to buy their vote
â and despite westminster 's disastrous economic record , youth unemployment is at its lowest level for five years in scotland as a result of scottish government action
the scottish government 's opportunities for all scheme offers every 16 to 19 - year - old a place in work , education or training - and as a result , 90 % of school leavers are going into positive destinations
â mr murphy 's warm words wo n't hide the fact that his party voted arm - in - arm with the tories for Â£ 30 billion more cuts - at the same time as committing to wasting Â£ 100 billion on trident nuclear weapons
â if mr murphy really wanted to invest in scotland 's young people , he would dump this ludicrous policy in favour of nuclear weapons and back the snp in spending the money on education , childcare and health
