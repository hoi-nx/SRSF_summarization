tracey desmond , 35 , surprised her husband of four years , jason , by shedding almost three stone in two months while he was away on tour jason compared his wife 's look to tv character ugly betty ( right ) before her weight loss ( left ) tracey desmond said she was determined to beat the bulge before jason - a corporal in the royal logistics corp - returned home and lose the weight with hypnosis
she said she was so committed to keeping her changing figure under wraps she would even make sure jason could n't see her when the pair would video chat while jay was serving abroad with the army
she said : ' i decided after christmas that i needed to do something - it was getting ridiculous
the weight just seemed to creep up on me and i could n't believe that i was a size 20
' i wanted to keep the whole surprise factor and do a big reveal so i would make sure jay could n't see me when we skyped
' i was just googling weight loss and easy loss came up - i had heard of people doing hypnosis to stop smoking so i thought i would give it a go
' i started at the beginning of january and the weight just seemed to drop off - i 've lost 38 pounds in just two months
' i even went out and bought a new dress , in a size 12 , and got dressed up for the occasion
' and when jay walked through the door and saw me there was this look of shock on his face
' jason , 42 , said : ' it was a massive shock - i felt like i had left behind ugly betty and came home to cinderella
before the weight loss : tracey desmond had started to pile on the pounds after she became seriously ill with polycystic ovaries and comfort - ate to get over having to undergo a full hysterectomy ' nothing tracey desmond has tried before has ever really worked so i was shocked that this worked so well
and it was lovely to see her in a dress for a change
' i have had to learn to feed myself too as she only eats when she 's hungry - so it has probably done me some good too
' when i get back from tour i have promised her i am going to take her shopping and treat her to some new clothes for our holiday
' the hr and training coordinator can now fit her whole body in one leg of her former size 22 trousers tracey desmond started to pile on the pounds after she became seriously ill with polycystic ovaries and comfort ate to get over having to undergo a full hysterectomy
but the determined hr and training coordinator has now set herself the task of shedding the final two stone by the time jay 's tour comes to an end in 10 weeks time
and she is spurred on by a luxury holiday the pair have booked to the dominican republic - with her final goal being to flaunt her new bikini body in a size 12 tankini
the ultimate goal is for tracey desmond to wear a size 12 tankini on the beach on holiday in the dominican republic tracey desmond said : ' we always book a holiday for when jason is off so that we have something to look forward to
' my goal now is to be able to wear a tankini on the beach - that 's what i am pushing towards
and i do n't want all the women looking at him while we are away
' i feel such a huge difference in myself since i started easy loss and it is just so easy
it 's not a diet and i can still eat whatever i want , whenever i want - but i just eat when i 'm hungry
' it 's a way of life and i ca n't ever see myself going back to how i was before now
i have learned how to listen to my body , and only eat when i am hungry
