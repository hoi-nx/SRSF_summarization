in november 2002 , the world was captivated by the biggest archaeological discovery ever made relating to jesus : a 2,000 year - old ossuary -- or bone box -- bearing the tantalizing inscription in aramaic : " james , son of joseph , brother of jesus
" if it was true , this was the first physical evidence ever found of jesus ' existence
and yet , if this amazing ossuary was false , then it was one of the greatest forgeries in history
underlying the question of the authenticity of the ossuary is an even bigger theological problem : whether or not jesus actually had any brothers
though the debate 's origins are ancient , the answer still divides catholics and protestant
for catholics , mary , joseph and jesus are a family unit unto themselves
yet catholic theology also holds that jesus was god 's son , born of the virgin -- and that mary did not give birth to other children , divine or otherwise
' finding jesus ' : john the baptist q&a so who are these " brothers " that the gospel of mark mentions ? the rev. james martin , author of the book " jesus : a pilgrimage , " calls the relationship between james and jesus " very complicated
" " he 's called clearly the brother of the lord , and the greek uses the common word for brother , " james martin says
but catholics also believe in mary 's perpetual virginity , so james martin surmises that james and the other brothers were joseph 's children from a prior marriage
" it makes sense that joseph would have been older and mary was younger , so i see them in a sense as stepbrothers
" other catholic scholars see james and jesus as cousins , an idea that began in the fourth century , when jerome , who translated the hebrew bible and the the new testament into latin , argued the point against the theologian helvedius , who said mary and joseph had other children
' finding jesus ' : shroud of turin q&a jerome countered that these children were instead born to mary , jesus ' aunt
jerome used his linguistic facility to argue that " adelphios , " the greek word used for jesus ' brothers and sisters , could refer to cousins , as well as to siblings
protestants , however , see jesus ' family as free of ambiguity , with mary and joseph having several children
one of them is jesus -- but the question then becomes , which one ? ben witherington iii , professor of new testament interpretation at asbury theological seminary , offers the protestant view that jesus and james were full brothers , with jesus being the elder
" the new testament says nothing about mary being a perpetual virgin , it says she virginally conceived jesus , and it certainly implies that she went on to have more children after that , and his brothers and sisters are in fact his brothers and sisters , " ben witherington iii says
is judas in hell ? jesus is presented as the older brother who leaves the family and walks about in galilee and judea , has a ministry and leaves james and the other brothers and sisters in charge of the family , according to the scholar
what 's more contentious for some protestant , is the fact that jesus , as the eldest in the family , essentially forsook his obligation as next - in - line to head the family after joseph died
instead he followed his divine destiny , as ordained by his father in heaven
5 things you did n't know about jesus that left james to fill the void
whatever he was -- brother , step - brother or cousin -- we know that james became important in the early christian church because of his relation to jesus
paul , the apostle who transformed the new religion from a local phenomenon into a movement throughout the roman empire , says as much in his letter to the galatians : " then after three years i did go up to jerusalem to visit peter and stayed with him 15 days ; but i did not see any other apostle except james the lord 's brother
" james and peter and paul were the prime movers of this new faith , with james the leader of the jesus followers in jerusalem until he was martyred in 64 ce , forgiving his killers with his last breath , just as his brother jesus had done
given his importance to the early christian church , why would n't he be connected to his brother , or even stepbrother , on the burial box containing his bones ? michael mckinley is co-author , with david gibson , of " finding jesus : faith
