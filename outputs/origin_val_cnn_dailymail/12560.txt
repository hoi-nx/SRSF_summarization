a massachusetts teenager faces a pretrial hearing in april on involuntary manslaughter charges for allegedly sending text messages urging a friend to commit suicide , even after he expressed second thoughts , authorities said saturday
carter , 18 , was indicted on february 5
conrad roy , 18 , of fairhaven and mattapoisett , massachusetts , was found dead in his car of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning on july 13 , sgt. kobza , public information officer for the fairhaven police department , said saturday
at one point the night of conrad roy 's death , he exited the vehicle and communicated to carter that he was having second thoughts about taking his own life , kobza told cnn
carter then urged him via text message to get back in the car , kobza said
upon searching conrad roy 's cell phone , police discovered " hundreds " of texts between conrad roy and carter , many which contained language from carter that encouraged conrad roy to take his own life , kobza said
" instead of attempting to assist him or notify his family or school officials , ms. carter is alleged to have strongly influenced his decision to take his own life , encouraged him to commit suicide and guided him in his engagement of activities which led to his death , " miliote , director of communications for the bristol county district attorney 's office , said in a statement
carter 's lawyer , cataldo , said saturday that the evidence will show this was not manslaughter and that carter attempted to console conrad roy on " many occasions
" " the facts that have been given out to the public at this point put her in the worst possible light , " cataldo said
" my heart goes out to the family , but this was a young man who planned this for months and months
" on a twitter page confirmed by the office to be carter 's , several photos and tweets about conrad roy have been posted since his death
one tweet reads , " i ca n't believe today already marks 4 months without you
i love you and miss you always conrad roy ... " in september 2014 , carter organized a softball tournament in conrad roy 's memory and raised $ 2,300 for mental health awareness , according to kobza
carter was arraigned on the indictment on february 6 in new bedford juvenile court , released on $ 2,500 bail and told not to use social media , according to miliote
carter was indicted as a youthful offender because she was not yet 18 when the alleged crimes occurred
youthful offenders are tried in juvenile court but the proceedings are public , cataldo said
because of a familial relationship he has with the victim 's family , bristol county district attorney thomas quinn recused himself from the investigation and prosecution of this case , the district attorney 's office said
carter 's pretrial hearing is set for april 17 .
