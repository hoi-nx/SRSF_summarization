mrs piper o'neill , who was recently crowned mrs australia 2015 and is also an ambassador for charity program look good feel better , says she became involved in the competition as it was n't solely based on looks
' this pageant is really refreshing for me because it 's open to all married women from all backgrounds , shapes and sizes , ' she said
' about 50 per cent of it is about raising awareness about your charity while the rest is about your evening gown and your health and fitness
' mrs australia piper o'neill gave birth to her second child , a son called taylor ethan green in january since giving birth to her second child , mrs piper o'neill 's attitude has changed
' it took me some time to finally accept my body during my pregnancy and afterwards too , ' she said
' i 've been a model most of my life so not being in control of my body was really hard for me
my belly was growing and it felt like i was gaining five kilos just by looking at a piece of lettuce
' looking at myself in the mirror after my first child , with a fuller figure , was really difficult
' but when i was pregnant with taylor , i went in with brighter eyes and knew what to expect from my body
mrs piper o'neill back in her modelling days ( left ) and then with her second child ( right ) ' i especially knew i had to have better and more positive views about my changing body in order to become a good role model for my daughter
' and it is with that attitude she has decided to go into the mrs international competition

' i try to go the gym every night when my husband is home to look after the kids and do about 30 minutes of cardio , ' she said
' of course , i actually do n't end up doing this every day because as a mother something last minute always comes up
' but i 'm going to sign up to do a heavy training session with my personal trainer so i 'll be committed to do that once a week
' during nap - time for the kids , i try and squeeze in any other training
' piper and husband jordan green with their first - born , daughter elsie last year mrs piper o'neill is also very conscious of her diet , particularly because she is currently breastfeeding
' i have to make sure i eat healthy for my baby so i ca n't just eat salads all the time for the sake of the competition , ' she said
' plus this pageant does n't have a swimwear section and instead focuses on health and fitness which is also why i wanted to get involved
' mrs piper o'neill says her main goal is n't about getting her pre-baby body back
' there 's too much pressure on mums these days to go back to the way they were and i do n't think that 's a realistic goal , ' she said
' i 've had two children and there is no hiding that
my focus now is being fit and healthy rather than skinny
' so i 'd really like to reach out to other mothers , encouraging them to go easy on themselves because it 's an amazing thing that we can have children and bring them into this world
' mrs piper o'neill says she 's feeling pretty confident about the competition
' it feels good to be part of something i 'm familiar with again and hopefully i can bring home another crown for my daughter , ' she said .
