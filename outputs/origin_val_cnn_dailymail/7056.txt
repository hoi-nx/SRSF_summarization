â hopefully we can continue to stay a little bit under the radar , but i âm not sure if we can
maybe we have blown that , â he added when asked by sportsmail what message was sent to the world by ireland winning successive titles for the first time since 1949
â i just think it âs going to be an incredibly tough tournament
we âve never made a semi and everybody knows that is where we âve got to try to get to
â that is what we will work towards and probably the low - key approach
if we can take that into that challenge , it would be great because you can get distracted and that is always a risk
â the fact that we just managed to get the silverware is a testament to the group we âve got
