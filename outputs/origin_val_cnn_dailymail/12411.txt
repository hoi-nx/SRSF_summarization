budi , an adorable baby orangutan , is on the road to recovery after an animal shelter in indonesia rescued him
the 15 - month - old was on the brink of death after he was kept in a chicken cage and fed nothing but condensed milk for the first year of his life
he had been kept as a pet in ketapang , indonesia , his caretakers said
now budi is well enough to eat on his own , walk and climb
" after weeks of physiotherapy , medical treatment and a nutritious diet , budi 's muscles are developing well , " said united kingdom - based international animal rescue
but budi 's development remains slow due to the extreme malnutrition , his caretakers said
budi was in quarantine for awhile , they said , but has been introduced to another infant orangutan , jemmi , rescued by another shelter
neither orangutan had met another animal of its kind since being taken from their mothers just after birth , and they eyed each other with curiosity
when budi arrived at international animal rescue 's orangutan rescue center in ketapang , his condition was extremely critical
his body was swollen with fluid due to a severe lack of protein
his limbs were misshapen because he was never fed properly
budi 's " eyes fill with tears ever time he 's moved by the doctors and he screams in pain , " said dr. karmele llano sanchez , international animal rescue 's program director in indonesia
" it 's really amazing that budi has been able to survive this long
" it 's unclear how budi became someone 's pet , said dr. handayani
the owner said that she was afraid to give the animal any fruit and believed that giving budi only condensed milk was enough , handayani said
eventually , the caretakers said , when budi is strong enough , he will be released into the wild .
