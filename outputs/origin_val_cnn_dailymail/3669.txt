it âs a classic easter meal loved by families around the world : a juicy lamb joint served with rosemary , roast potatoes , carrots and sprouts
but one london restaurant is giving the traditional roast a twist this spring , serving the entire spread deep - fried
in fact , everything on this menu is doused in batter and then fried , from buttered crumpets and cheese strings to tunnock âs tea cakes , hot cross buns and even a whole pizza

the calorific eaterie is the brainchild of messhead , a collaboration between chef jim thomlinson âs london mess and freelance creative director emma thomas , better known as miss cakehead
miss cakehead told femail : we will be serving deep fried quiche lorraine , pasties , pork pies , scotch egg , frankfurters and burgers
' the pair will also offer fried desserts alongside their savoury items , with doughnuts , cakes and even coconut ices all getting the deep - fried treatment
â we are handmaking most things , â she continued , â and people are going to bring along stuff for us to fry and we do nât know what people will bring
â it has got to be edible and the final decision [ whether they should be deep - fried ] comes from jim thomlinson
â the fully fried easter feast will serve six people and has to be booked in advance
the duo will deep fry cake ( pictured ) , doughnuts , chocolate and even coconut ices as well as sweets # fryhard will also offer savoury items such as deep - fried pork pies ( left ) and pizza ( right ) â we had this idea at christmas as die hard is my favourite christmas movie , â miss cakehead continued
â messhead loves a good pun - it 's great to see other die hard fans get the ' now i have a deep fat fryer ' reference in the images by travis hodges
â she did however admit that the idea is a trifle silly
she said : â jim thomlinson is about to launch his street food concept prawnography at old street roudabout - part of burger bear hq - so we want to do something really fun and ridiculous before the hard work begins
â we also tried deep fried chocolate at jim thomlinson 's previous pop up the dead horse society - once i tasted it for the first time i knew i had to revisit ! ' but while the venture has been greeted with interest the pair have no plans to make it into a more permanent thing
' it is just for easter - after which jim thomlinson will continue with prawnogrpahy and i will continue on goodness knows what alongside , â miss cakehead continued
â the response has been amazing though one dentist on twitter said we were " disgusting "
â so many people want to come and try the foods on offer with deep fried babybel getting the strongest response so far
