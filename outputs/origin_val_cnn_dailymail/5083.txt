arrest : williams admits he fired the shots that hit two ferguson officers but insists he was aiming at someone else the man accused of wounding two policemen during a protest rally outside the ferguson , missouri , police headquarters last week appeared in court on monday briefly and did not enter a plea
the shooting was the latest violent incident in months of demonstrations in ferguson , a st. louis suburb , after a white police officer shot dead unarmed black teen michael brown during a confrontation in august
jeffrey l. williams , 20 , has admitted to firing the shots that wounded the officers early thursday and also told authorities he was not shooting at police , prosecuting attorney mcculloch said on sunday after announcing the arrest
williams did not give any statements on monday during his brief appearance before judge dueker in st. louis county circuit court
he is charged with first - degree assault and his bond is set at $ 300,000
williams told dueker he was going to hire a private attorney , st. louis public defender stephen reynolds said
no one responded monday at the williams address listed in court records , a one - story blue house that had trash strewn on the lawn
police had called the shooting an ' ambush ' of the officers , who were standing side by side , by a gunman embedded with protesters , but mcculloch said on sunday williams may have been shooting at someone else
several long - time activists have said they did not recognize or know williams as a protester
' he never protested before , ' bishop derrick robinson , an activist , told cnn on monday
the shooting of the officers , who were treated at a local hospital and released , followed a flurry of resignations and protests in the week after the justice department released a damning report accusing ferguson of racially biased policing
wounded : in the shooting early on thursday , a 41 - year - old county police officer suffered a shoulder wound
another officer , 32 , suffered a facial wound

activists said williams was not a consistent fixture in their tight - knit group
' we 're not sure we completely buy that part of it , ' mcculloch said of williams ' contention that he did not fire at the officers
williams is charged with two counts of first - degree assault , one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action
he made a brief court appearance monday , and the case was scheduled for a later date
court officials said he did not yet have an attorney
williams ' arrest came as anti-police protesters ( pictured ) have resumed demonstrations outside ferguson police station mcculloch said there may have been other people in the vehicle with williams and that the investigation is ongoing
williams used a handgun that matches the shell casings at the scene , mcculloch said
he also said tips from the public led to the arrest
williams is being held on $ 300,000 bond
brittany ferrell , 26 , a protest leader with the group millennial activists united , had just left a meeting with other leaders sunday when word of the arrest circulated
she said no one in the group knew williams , and they checked with other frequent protesters , who also had not heard of him
ferrell suspected mcculloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement
' this is a fear tactic , ' she said
' we are very tight - knit
we know each other by face if not by name , and we 've never seen this person before
' john gaskin , a st. louis naacp leader , said of williams , ' i do n't know him
i 've never seen him
' st. louis county police chief jon belmar said the officers could have easily been killed in the shooting , which came amid protests in ferguson over alleged police violence

its policeforce is mostly white and two - thirds of residents are black
ferguson police chief jackson , its city manager and its municipal court judge have resigned
williams , who had been on probation for possession of stolen property , is accused of firing shots early thursday from a car just as a rally after jackson 's resignation was breaking up
the justice report said ferguson police overwhelmingly arrested and issued traffic citations to black residents to boost revenue through fines , helping to create a culture of distrust that exploded with michael brown 's shooting
demonstrations erupted into arson and looting after michael brown 's shooting in august and again in november when a grand jury declined to bring charges against officer darren wilson
