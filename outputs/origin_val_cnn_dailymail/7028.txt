obama is taking daughters obamas and sasha on a spring break trip to japanese and cambodia in mid-march
mrs obama will visit tokyo and kyoto , japanese , from march 18 - 20 and end the trip with a march 21 - 22 stop in siem reap in northwestern cambodia , the white house said on tuesday
the white house made no mention of the girls joining their mother , but japanese newspaper the asahi shimbun , quoting a japanese official , reported last month that the teens will be part of the trip
obama and her daughters obamas and sasha meet china president xi jinping and his wife peng liyuan in beijing in march 2014
the mother and daughters were reportedly returning to asian for a spring break trip this year president obama , who was in japanese last april , will not join his wife and daughters
last march , mrs obama , her mother and the girls visited china and have previously taken trips to ireland and germany
obamas and sasha attend the elite dc school , sidwell friends , which begins spring break on march 20
there were so far no details on the cost of the trip but the first lady 's group spent $ 222,000 over two days in hotel expenses during the 2014 china visit , the washington examiner reported
on valentine 's weekend , the first lady and her daughters took a weekend skiing trip to aspen , colorado while the president jetted to california to golf
according to the washington examiner , in a piece published in october 2014 , the obamas ' recent vacations left taxpayers with a $ 6.2 million bill
the total amount billed over the family 's six years in the white house has been more than $ 40 million
the first lady will be promote educating girls around the world with the visit to japanese , and to cambodia , a place where the government 's record on human rights gave her husband pause during a reluctant visit a couple of years ago
cambodia is an interesting choice for the first lady
president obama became the first u.s. president to visit cambodia in late 2012 after his re-election
white house officials insisted at the time that obama was only going because cambodia was the host for two annual regional summits he has made a point of attending
obama appeared visibly unhappy during the brief visit
the cambodia government has been led since 1985 by prime minister hun sen , who has a reputation for ruthlessness and a low tolerance for opposition
the southeast asian nation also has problems with child prostitution and human trafficking
the obamas were announcing the ' let girls learn ' education initiative at a white house event on tuesday
president obama , pictured with cambodia prime minister hun sen in 2012 , voiced concerns about cambodia 's human rights record during his trip the president and first lady , the parents of two teenage girls , both say their own success would not have been possible without education , and everywhere they travel they encourage young people to finish school
in the u.s. , mrs. obama also leads a separate initiative encouraging young people to continue their education after high school
more than 60 million girls around the world , half of them adolescents , do not attend school
lack of education limits their economic opportunities and makes them more vulnerable to such afflictions as hiv and aids , early and forced marriage , and gender - based violence , said tchen , who also directs the white house council on women and girls
educated girls and their families , meanwhile , are more likely to have a better quality of life
the administration is putting under the ' let girls learn ' umbrella a range of programs currently operating largely across africa and the middle east that focus on education , empowerment and leadership , health and nutrition , gender - based violence , and early and forced marriage
separately , the peace corps and mrs. obama 's office will work together to support community - based solutions to these issues
the peace corps has thousands of volunteers working in more than 60 developing countries
its ' let girls learn ' program will begin in albania , benin , burkina faso , cambodia , georgia , ghana , moldova , mongolia , mozambique , togo and uganda , before it is expanded to other countries
a third aspect of the initiative is designed to help kids in the u.s. understand why they should care about the issue
the peace corps and the u.s. agency for international development are already spending money on these programs
obama is also asking congress for $ 250 million in new and reallocated funding for the initiative , tchen said
the administration anticipates getting additional support from the private sector , philanthropies , foundations and other donors
in japanese , mrs. obama will highlight the importance the two countries place on international girls ' education
president obama traveled to the close u.s. ally on a state visit last april , and prime minister shinzo abe is due to make a reciprocal visit soon
cambodia is one of 11 countries included in the first year of the ' let girls learn ' program to be run by the peace corps
in cambodia , mrs. obama will see how community - driven solutions are helping girls , a focus of the peace corps piece of the initiative .
