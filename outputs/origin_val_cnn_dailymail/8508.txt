you might think the secret to a long life is eating healthily and staying away from alcohol
but residents in a china village where most people live into their 90s disagree
in fact they say there is nothing better than a good argument , hard work and a drink
yu fangyin , 99 , drinks more than 10kgs of rice wine every month and leads a peaceful life in shuping , according to people 's daily online
residents from shuping in china have given their opinions on what leads to a long life
yu fangyin ( above ) , 99 , says the key to longevity is a good drink his daughter - in - law wang jiaxiang said it is drinking and smoking that keeps mr yu fangyin happy
she said : ' apart from these he has no other interests
he is very healthy , is rarely ill , and is a bit of a celebrity in the village
' mr yu fangyin is feeling so healthy that he is hoping to find a wife , jokingly saying that he will start looking ' next year after my 100th birthday '
as far as chen zhenglan , 93 , is concerned it is not getting married but having an argument that is best
she continually rebuffs her husband li changgui , 89 , over breakfast about what they are going to eat for dinner
her claims are backed up by the couple 's son li tianshun , who said his parents have argued all of their lives with most situations ending with his mother making a compromise
when he spoke to the reporter the 60 - year - old said : ' it âs actually good today
the old man does nât have much of a huff otherwise he would have walked out already
' arguments are part of life
this may be another way to express their love as well as the secret to their longevity
