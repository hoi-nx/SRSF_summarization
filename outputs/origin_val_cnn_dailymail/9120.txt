the jury found : ' the mirror came to fall on austen harrison after he moved the wings , causing the unfixed mirror to become unstable
' the jury believes that the mirror should have been fixed to the wall and that the wall should have been reinforced
we do not believe the mirror was fixed to the wall
' the youngster underwent an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain but died four days later in hospital after life - support was switched off
the jurors , who had been listening to evidence at the oxford hearing for three days , said safety checks should have been carried out
they stated : ' we believe there were health and safety systems in place but are not confident that these systems would have avoided any danger posed by the mirror
in any case , these systems do not seem to have been followed
' the coroner said he is writing a report about the case to the chief coroner in the hope of preventing future incidents
mr salter said : ' it is surprising to me that the mirror stayed in its position for possibly up to six months with staff and customers moving its wings
sadly , this was an accident waiting to happen and sadly it happened to young austen harrison
' you would not expect such a heavy mirror to be free - standing and unsupported in any way
' the inquest heard that the 6ft 6in ( 2m ) high mirror , which weighed 19 stone ( 120kg ) , was not fixed to the wall and that its free - standing position on the floor meant it could easily overbalance

the youngster underwent an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain evidence from health and safety experts suggested the mirror would have been ' very unstable ' as it stood on the floor , that there was ' no form of free - standing support ' , and that opening the wings of the mirror would change the centre of gravity , causing it to fall forwards
the coroner said health and safety systems had been ' in place but were not followed ' and that this lack of understanding and responsibility was something that ' seems to be accepted ' by hugo boss
he also noted that the company had made efforts to improve , including hiring a health and safety manager and training for staff
