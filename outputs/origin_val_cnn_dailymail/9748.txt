mr keith fraser said : â we have many young people wanting to join up with their â brothers â in is
let them bloody well go
â why are we concerned in wasting our time and resources in assuring these people do nât go to join ? â instead let âs find out who wants to go and we can then spend public money in chartering our own planes to take them there
we do nât need these traitors in our beloved country
â they can hand over their british passports on the way out and say do nât ever try and come back
â the ukip candidate , who currently works as a chartered surveyor , said that the extremists â have one aim to convert or murder all â non-believers â
â he added : â they do nât like our freedom , want to destroy our way of life and will not rest until they fly their flag over our shores

mr farage said a strong showing for ukip at may 's election could boost the calls for electoral reform , which in turn could make his eurosceptics a â big party in british politics â
he said : â i 've always thought there should be election reform but that is frankly irrelevant in the next 38 days
â yes , this is very hard for us because you find good ukip support in labour constituencies and in conservative constituencies
â yes , that 's a challenge but what we have to do is to get over the line in enough seats in this general election campaign and then you 'll see how many seats we 've actually come second in , and you 'll realise as part of a longer - term strategy this really could become a big party in british politics
