everton manager martinez believes his side have finally banished the fear factor which has been holding them back
the 3 - 0 win over 10 - man newcastle thanks to goals from james mccarthy , romelu lukaku and ross barkley was the everton ' first at goodison park in the league in 2015
it was a crucial one as it lifted them six points clear of the relegation zone and martinez believes the basis for the performance was founded in the come - from - behind 2 - 1 europa league win over dynamo kiev on thursday
martinez believes everton have finally banished the fear factor which has been holding them back james mccarthy ( right ) opened the the scoring against newcastle and was congratulated by aaron lennon ' it was a big game for us and sometimes that can bring extra pressure in that you play the occasion rather than the game , ' he said
' the perfect preparation was thursday
probably thursday was a real turning point in that moment when we managed to take control of the situation
the first 20 minutes ( against kiev ) was as bad as it can be in terms of suffering because you feel the anxiety and responsibility as a player then all of a sudden we found the way we should perform
' the mindset today was n't of a team who had fear of losing at home , some of the play was outstanding but when we had to defend and work hard for each other we did that with total composure
' from scoring the first goal we managed the game really well and i thought we defended really composed
tim howard had a big save in the second half but apart from that i thought we protected him very well
everton were already 2 - 0 up when magpies captain fabricio coloccini was sent off for a lunge at winger aaron lennon and martinez had no doubts about the straight red card
romelu lukaku , having set up james mccarthy for the opener , netted everton 's second from the penalty spot ' i have n't seen the replay but i thought it was reckless and high , ' he added
' if you look at the reaction of the newcastle players i do n't think anyone was surprised when they saw the red card
' i do n't think it was a turning point or the reason why we won because we were very much in control but it always helps
' newcastle caretaker boss carver 's initial thoughts were to agree with martinez but he admits he will closely examine all footage over the next day or two before deciding the next course of action
' i have looked at it from four or five angles and it is not conclusive , ' he said
ross barkley celebrates after giving gloss to the victory with a stoppage time strike to make it 3 - 0 ' when it actually happened , from the reaction of the everton players , straight away i thought ' that must be a red '
but when i came in and looked at it , it was very difficult to decide
' i will look at it again and if it is worthy of a sending off then i will accept it but if it is not i will appeal
' there seemed to be more of their players surrounding the situation than our players
' with nothing to play for newcastle are limping towards the end of the season but carver stressed that would not be allowed to happen and there was an immediate dressing room inquest after the game , although he was keen to point out it was not confrontational
' a few of the guys had a few composed words after the match , ' he added
' i told one or two players not to say anything because usually it is one or two players who come forward - i wanted it to come from other people
' the fact people make a point i think is a healthy situation - it ca n't always come from me , i 'm not a dictator
' we ca n't go hiding or disappear anywhere
i ca n't walk around miserable as sin , i have to do something about it
' the guys had a good two - way conversation and we will review it all on tuesday
