early human ancestors may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago , a new study has suggested
scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans
a study of fossils of homo erectus , an extinct human ancestor , shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully
the above skeletons of homo erectus were reconstructed from fossils that the researchers used in their study this would have enabled homo erectus to become a proficient hunter , able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey
dr roach , an anthropologist at the george washington university in washington , said : ' the combination of inferiorly rotated , human - like shoulders with a tall , mobile waist and low humeral torsion , support homo erectus as the first known hominin possessing the full anatomical complex associated with proficient throwing
55 million years ago - first primitive primates evolve 15 million years ago - hominidae ( great apes ) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon 8 million years ago - first gorillas evolve
later , chimp and human lineages diverge 5.5 million years ago - ardipithecus , early â proto - human â shares traits with chimps and gorillas 4 million years ago - australopithecines appeared
they had brains no larger than a chimpanzee 's 2.8 million years ago - ld 350 - 1 appeared and may be the first of the homo family 2.7 million years ago - paranthropus , lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 2.3 million years ago - homo habalis first thought to have appeared in africa 1.8 million years ago - homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record 1.6 million years ago - hand axes become the first major technological innovation 800,000 years ago - early humans control fire and create hearths
brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across europe and asia 200,000 years ago - homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in africa 40,0000 years ago - modern humans reach europe ' while direct evidence of early throwing behavior remains elusive , evidence for the intensification of hominin carnivory and hunting behavior dating back two million years is increasing
' we propose that this increased carnivory was facilitated by a flexible , situation - dependent hunting and scavenging strategy that included high - speed throwing
' in the study , which is published in the journal of human evolution , compared the shoulder and collar bone sizes with modern humans and other species
they also examined the throwing ability of boys and men from the daasanach tribes living around lake rukrana in north west kenya and south western ethiopia
daasanach boys use bent throwing sticks called ' shar ' to hunt small game and herd lifestock while adults will also hunt with spears
the researchers asked 27 daasanach to hurl throwing sticks as far as they could , measuring the speed with radar guns and the distance
they compared their throwing ability to the dimensions of their collarbones and the humerous bone
the researchers found that the daasanch were able to throw at speeds of up to 80mph ( 128km/h ) - comparable to skilled athletes
they were able to hurl their sticks more than 328ft ( 100 metres ) in many cases , with none throwing less than 196ft ( 60 metres )
the world record for throwing the javelin , for example , is 321ft ( 98 metres ) for men
the study showed that differences in collar bone size did not alter the length or speed of the throw
by comparing the results to fossils of homo erectus , they conclude that this species of early human would have had similar throwing abilities
homo erectus , shown in the reconstruction on the left and the skull on the right , is an extinct ancestor of modern humans that may have shared may of our abilities to throw and hunt , according to the latest research it suggests that the ability to throw spears and other objects for hunting evolved long before our own species , homo sapiens , appeared on the planet
the ability to throw powerfully and accurately has long been thought of as being a uniquely human trait
chimpanzees , by comparison can only throw at speeds of around 20mph
the study builds on earlier work by dr roach that compared the throwing action of college baseball players with the skeletons of chimpanzees
they identified key change to the shoulder , arm and torso of humans that allowed them to store elastic energy in their ligaments and tendons to help power a throw forward with great accuracy
homo erectus could have been able to throw further than many modern athletes , according to the research tucking into meat for dinner helped early humans spread more quickly across the world and had a profound effect on human evolution , scientists say
the high - quality diet allowed mothers to wean babies earlier and have more children , meaning that human communities grew faster , according to researchers from lund university in sweden
the research compared 67 species of mammals , including humans , apes , mice and killer whales , and found a clear correlation between eating meat and earlier weaning
they found young of all species stop suckling when their brains have developed to a particular stage , but that carnivores reached this point more quickly than herbivores or omnivores
eating meat enabled the breast - feeding periods and thereby the time between births to be shortened , according tot he researchers
among natural fertility societies , the average duration of breast - feeding is 2 years and 4 months
this is not much in relation to the maximum lifespan of our species , around 120 years
it is even less if compared to our closest relatives : female chimpanzees suckle their young for 4 to 5 years , whereas the maximum lifespan for chimpanzees is only 60 years
this was a crucial step towards evolving how to throw and led our ancestors to be able to hunt large prey
however , archaeological evidence of weapons like spears have yet to be found
dr roach said : ' a number of changes occurred in our evolutionary past to the shoulder , arm and torso make this elastic energy storage possible
' they first occurred two million years ago in the species homo erectus
that allowed us to throw with incredible velocity at around that time
' we see hunting behaviour to emerge around that time
we think that throwing was important early on in terms of hunting behavoiur to allow our ancestors to kill big game and get more calories in their diet
